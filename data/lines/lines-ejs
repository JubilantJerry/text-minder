It's still open!
And that's Mrs. Chadwick.
Oh, maybe I can go work for her!
This is amazing.
I saved a woman's life, and, you, you saved a woman's business.
And, you... you did an ice cream thing.
But, still, we're the ones causing all of this.
We're like gods.
We're like gods!
Is that really you?
Oh.
I got a completely different outlook on life after you came in.
I started thinking you were my guardian ang...
Oh!
Oh, my!
Is she okay?
I-I didn't see her.
You know, she just ran out into the middle of the street!
Please, call 911!

[NARRATOR] Setting camp at the ruins of Utgard Castle for the night, the Scouts found themselves overtaken by a Titan horde.
Their chances of survival low.
[CHRISTA] Nanaba.
Gelgar.
I'm sorry, Daddy!
I'll be a good girl from now on, I promise!
[NARRATOR] But when all seemed lost.
[YMIR] Listen to me.
When you break it down, this is really just more of a hope.
Christa.
Live a life you can be proud of.
[CHRISTA] Ymir!
Wait!
[NARRATOR] One of their own made a shocking transformation.
Yeah!
Atta girl!
[YMIR TITAN] Wanna live?
Grab on tight.
[CONNY] That's not good.
[gasps]
[CONNY] They're eating her!
[CHRISTA] No!
I still haven't told you my name!
I promised you!
[NARRATOR] The main force of the Scout Regiment swooped in and engaged the enemy.
Die!
[NARRATOR] The Titan assault fell before their blades.
[MIKASA yells]
[NARRATOR] However, standing on the wreckage of battle,
Eren and the others bore witness to a heartbreaking confession.
[CHRISTA] Ymir.
Just as promised.

Title: "Warrior"
That's it.
Bring it up slowly.
Steady the ropes, please.
[EREN] What's the verdict?
How bad a shape is Ymir in?
[KEIJI] Well, she's missing an arm and a leg.
And her insides are scrambled.
If she was normal, she'd be a goner.
[EREN] Normal, huh?
[REINER groans]
[EREN] Here, grab my hand.
Thanks.
[CHRISTA] Please, you've got to believe me!
I'm telling the truth!
Ymir could've run away any time she wanted!
She chose to fight the Titans to save our lives!
She had nothing to gain putting herself on the line like that.
Doesn't that speak volumes about where her loyalties are?
She should have told us before, yes.
She had no right to keep her power a secret.
It's hard to look past how much humankind might've gained from knowing what she's been keeping to her self, but...
I think...
I think she was just worried about what people might do to her.
Clearly her priorities have changed now.
This isn't nearly as complicated as it looks.
No one is closer to Ymir than me, and there's no question in my mind whose side she's on!
Is that so?
Well, under the circumstances it certainly behooves us to be friendly.
Her priorities aside,
I'll wager what she can teach us about the enemy is beyond measure.
Probably.
Even so.
You say this isn't as complicated as it looks, but from where I'm standing the world gets more complicated by the hour.
[HANGE] Oh, uh...
Historia Reiss you said your name was?
I did.
That's correct.
[HANGE] Isn't Reiss the name of a noble family?
Yes, it is.
Huh.
Historia, nice to meet'cha.
Thank you.
[HANGE] How's she doing?
Comatose but stable.
The bleeding's stopped, though steam appears to be coming out of her wounds.
Best course of action is taking her back to Trost where the poor girl can get proper medical care.
She's in your hands.
Consider it done.
Right, then.
On with our mission.
Finding the hole and patching it up.
[REINER exhales] Son of bitch.
You okay over there, Reiner?
[REINER] Not by a long shot.
Titan almost gnawed my arm off.
Pathetic.
All I could think was "this it how I go."
What else you s'posed to think at time like that?
You're only human.
Don't you get it?
This was my second time!
Armin!
Remember?
Huh?
[REINER] Go on!
Tell him how Annie nearly crushed me like an insect!
[ARMIN] Yeah.
That's twice I've nearly died now.
What are the chances I'll survive a third time?
This is what it really means.
What it is to be soldier.
Your spirit breaks and the body follows.
Eh.
No good whining about it now.
'Least not till we can plug up the wall.
That's true.
The two of you have been driven far enough away from your hometown as it is.
[REINER gasps] This is it.
This is where we draw the line.
[BERTHOLDT] Truer words were never spoken!
Home!
Let's go!
We've been here long enough!
Compared to everything else we've had to go through, the rest is easy!
You're right.
We don't have much further to go before it's done!
[EREN] What are guys talking about?
I needed that.
Thanks.
Are you injured?
Nah, I'm okay, but, Reiner's wounded.
And Ymir's sure seen better days.
[SASHA] Who would've ever pegged her for a Titan?
Are they?
[MIKASA] Sasha.
[HANGE] We all on the same page?
We'll decide what to do with Ymir later.
Oh, and Conny?
Chin up.
I'll order a squad to investigate your village.
For now, stay focused.
I want our energy on the task at hand.
Clear?
Crystal!
[HANGE] It's troubling.
You would expect this area to be teeming with Titans.
Hm?
[SASHA] Hannes?
Is that the Garrison advance squad?
Tell me they've located the breach.
Wall's perfectly fine.
What?
[HANNES] Spent all night trying to find out where they're getting in.
But between Trost and Krolva District, there's nothing.
No hole anywhere.
That's impossible!
We ran into a search party from Krolva and retraced our steps.
Not a single Titan on the way here either.
[ARMIN] But we know for a fact that there are Titans on this side of Wall Rose.
Oh, C'mon.
How much have you had to drink, seriously?
Why you little!
Hold on, wait a second.
What the hell are you kids even doing here?
If there's no breach, then I guess we have to change tactics.
We head back to Trost immediately.
You'd be smart to keep your guard up.
We'll go on ahead of you.
How can there be nothing wrong with the wall?
[ARMIN] Excellent question.
Nothing like this has happened in five years.
Why now all of a sudden?
[SASHA] Feels like everything's spiraling out of control.
[REINER] Eren.
We should talk.
You got a moment?
Sure, I guess.
[REINER] Five years ago, we compromised Wall Maria and launched an attack on humanity.
Oh no.
What if there's a species of Titan we haven't seen yet that knows how to dig?
Ugh.
That would definitely make their entry point hard to find.
[REINER] I'm the Armored Titan.
He's the Colossal.
[HANGE] We can hypothesize later.
Our first concern is Ymir.
[MOBLIT] Titans being a close second, even with the horses.
What are you talking about?
Why are you telling him?
Reiner, no!
Stop!
We were on a mission.
Our goal was to ensure mankind's extinction.
But now, there's no need for that.
Eren, if you want the walls to remain standing, it's simple.
Just come with Bertholdt and me.
Do you understand?
Understand?
What the hell is there to understand?
[REINER] Listen to me.
I need you to do exactly as I say.
[REINER] Look, I know this is sudden, but we have to go.
Right now?
Where would you take me?
I can't tell you.
Not yet.
Just think of it as our hometown.
Okay?
So what's it gonna be?
[gasps]
[REINER] Not a bad deal, right?
The chance to avert a major crisis?
I'm not so sure.
You guys!
Get a move on, we're heading out!
[EREN] Damn it.
I didn't want to believe what I was hearing yesterday.
[horse neighs]
[HANGE] Hmmm.
[EREN] Section Commander?
Something wrong?
Uh...
Huh?
Oh, uh, well I was finally able to get my hands on the background report
I requested for Annie Leonhart.
Annie?
[HANGE] Yeah.
Took longer than I was hoping for.
The paper trail's a bit of a catastrophe at the moment.
Bureaucracy, huh?
Anyway, according to this, there were two other cadets in the 104th who haled from the same region.
I have their names.
One Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover.
[gasps] [gasps]
Not much survives in the way of records, and thanks to the chaos five years ago, what we have on them is unreliable.
However, we do know that during the long-range scouting formation, their unit was given false intel.
They were among those intentionally misled into thinking Eren was in the right wing.
[gasps] Wait just a minute.
That's the section Annie attacked.
[SASHA] What?
What does that mean?
Well, it's entirely possible they told Annie where they thought Eren was.
Huh?
Why would they do that?
Where are you going with this, Armin?
You can't just accuse...!
[HANGE] I totally agree.
Coincidence doesn't establish relationship.
Bearing that in mind, I'm curious to know how the three interacted while training.
What can you tell me?
I knew Bertholdt and Reiner were from the same region as Annie, but I never saw them act friendly.
Same with me.
You'd never catch 'em shooting' the breeze.
And when they did talk it was pretty curt.
Plus, it's not like Annie was very social to begin with.
Yeah, at meals she always seemed to prefer eating by herself.
I dunno.
Ah!
I think I've got something that struck me as weird at the time.
I, uh...
heard she liked sweets!
I've got nothing.
Except maybe that...
[EREN] Guys.
What are we doing?
These are our comrades we're talking about.
Yeah, sure.
Bertholdt never has a lot to say.
But Reiner's like everyone's big brother, y'know?
You really think he's capable of lying to us?
Eren does have a point.
Think about it.
Reiner fought the Female Titan with everything he had.
Almost got himself squeezed to a bloody pulp in the process.
[gasps] What's the matter?
He burst free of her grip at the last minute.
Afterwards, though, Annie changed her course.
In fact, she ran straight toward where you were.
I...
I mentioned that you might be rear of the center rank, but there's no way she could've heard me.
She wasn't in earshot at the time.
You've gotta be kidding.
Do you recall if he seemed unusually interested in Eren's location?
So, where the hell do you think he is?
[ARMIN] Oh, no.
I only brought his position up in the first place because Reiner asked me where I thought Eren might be.
Something else.
Once he broke free, the Female Titan stood there staring at her palm, possibly transfixed by something he'd carved onto it with his blades.
Maybe Reiner...
What is wrong with you people?
The man's been with us from the beginning!
You don't just...
[HANGE] Enough!
All of you.
Listen up.
If we cross paths with the pair in question, don't give them any indication of what we've discussed.
And under no circumstances are you to broach the topic of Annie Leonhart in their company.
Before we can ascertain whether they were co-conspirators, we must find, lure, and contain them underground.
That's the plan.
Are we clear?
[SOLDIERS] Yes, clear!
You're just tired.
That's it, right?
Help me out here, Betholdt.
Your nerves are shot.
You don't know what you're saying.
[BERTHOLDT] Uh.
Yeah.
It's the battle fatigue talking!
It's okay.
You're okay.
If you really were the Armored Titan, what's the endgame here?
We wouldn't be having this conversation in the first place.
What'd you expect me to do?
Say yes?
Let myself be kidnaped just 'cause you asked politely?
[REINER gasps]
[REINER] Right.
Not thinking straight, am I?
Barely know what I'm saying here.
Must've gone off the deep end.
C'mon, let's go.
[REINER] That's the problem.
Heh.
I've been here too long for my own good.
Three years of this madness, surrounded by idiots.
We were kids.
What'd we know about anything?
Why did there have to be people like this?
Why?
Why did I let myself devolve into such a half-assed piece of shit?
It's too late now.
Damned if I know what's right anymore!
Who cares?
It is what it is.
No choice but to face what I've done.
[BOTH gasp]
As a warrior.
No road left but the one that leads to the end!
Reiner!
Right now?
Here?
We're doing this?
Yes.
Right here, right now!
We settle this once and for all!
[MIKASA grunts] [REINER groans]
[MIKASA grunts] [BERTHOLDT groans] [groans]
Eren!
Get out of here!
[REINER] Bertholdt!
Eren!
Run away!
[SASHA yells]
[growls]
[gasps] Ymir!
No!
[REINER] I'm going to return to the home that was taken from me.
I will do it.
No matter what.
[EREN] Bertholdt.
Reiner.
[EREN] Damn you!
You traitors!

While stopped at the ruins of Utgard Castle to take a brief break, the Scouts were overwhelmed by a Titan assault, vanquishing their hope of survival.
...Nanaba...
...No!
No!
...And Gelgar...
...No!
No!
Father, stop!
However, in that moment...
Christa.
This is nothing more than a hope of mine...
I want you... to live a life you're proud of.
Ymir!
Wait!
...Ymir suddenly transformed into a Titan.
Keep it up, Ymir!
Want live...?
Grab me!
This looks bad.
Ymir is...
This can't...
This can't...
I still haven't told you my real name!
And then the main force of the Scouts rushed in to engage the enemy.
Die!
They successfully dismantled the Titan attack.
However, upon the ruins of battle,
Eren and the others learn a surprising truth.
Ymir...
My real name is Historia.
"Warrior"
Slowly!
Bring it up slowly!
Raise it carefully now!
How's Ymir?
What sort of shape is she in?
Her right arm and leg were bitten off, and her insides are beaten like scrambled eggs.
If she was normal, she'd be dead for sure.
If she was normal, huh?
Reiner!
Grab on!
Right!
Please, believe me!
I'm telling the truth!
Ymir transformed into a Titan to fight off the other Titans and save us!
She did so with no regard for her own life, which proves her loyalty to us, her comrades!
It's true that her judgement until now is unforgivable.
After all, she may know things useful to humanity and yet she kept quiet about it!
I imagine she didn't say anything in order to protect herself.
But... now she's a changed person!
Ymir is an ally of humanity!
I know Ymir better than anybody.
She's a much simpler person than she looks!
I see.
Obviously, I hope we can build a trusting relationship with her.
Her judgement aside, the information she holds is a treasure for humanity.
I hope we get along.
But you know even if she is a simple person, this world becomes more of a confusing mess with every passing day.
You said... your real name was Historia Reiss?
Yes, that's right.
Reiss, as in that noble family?
Yes.
I see.
Nice to meet you, Historia.
Yeah...
How's Ymir?
She's still in a coma.
Her bleeding has stopped, and we think steam is coming out of her wounds.
For now, take her back to Trost so she can get some proper medical care.
She's in your hands.
Understood.
Now then...
Our original mission...
was to seal this wall.
Damn, it hurts.
You all right, Reiner?
Not by a long shot.
A Titan nearly gnawed off my arm.
That was... pathetic.
I thought I was done for.
Even someone as strong as you gets this way sometimes.
What are you talking about?
This is the second time for me!
Tell him, Armin.
Huh?
Remember the time I almost got crushed in that Titan's hand?
Oh...
Back then...
That makes twice I've nearly died.
At this rate, I'll be dead before I know it.
I picked this path on my own, but being a soldier is rough.
It's like a soldier's spirit breaks down before their body.
Though, until we plug up this wall, there's no time to waste whining about it.
Yeah.
You two have been driven far enough away from your hometown.
I'm thinking... this is where we gotta draw the line.
He's right, Reiner!
Our hometown!
Let's return!
Isn't it about time to go back?
Compared to all the trouble we've been through, what's left to do is nothing!
That's right.
We're so close, it's just another few steps till the end.
Huh?
What are you guys talking about?
Thanks, Mikasa.
Are you hurt?
I'm fine, but...
Reiner got his arm bit and Ymir is as you can see.
Who would've thought Ymir was a Titan, too?
Does that...?
Sasha.
Is everyone clear?
We'll deal with Ymir later.
And Conny...
I'll arrange for a Scout squad to investigate your village later.
For the time being, I want you to focus on the mission to fix the wall.
Got it?
Got it!
Still...
I expected this place to be swarming with Titans.
Hannes?
It's the Garrison's advance squad.
They came to tell us where the hole is.
There's no hole anywhere!
Huh?
We spent all night looking for it but at least between Trost and Krolva District, there's nothing wrong with the wall.
What'd you say?
We bumped into soldiers from Krolva and retraced our steps.
We haven't seen any Titans the whole way here.
But... we know for sure there's Titans on this side of the wall.
Did you actually look?
Are you sure you're not drunk?
I didn't drink!
Wait, why are all of you here anyways?
If there's no hole in the wall, so be it.
For now, we're falling back to Trost District!
Whatever you do, don't let your guard down.
We're going back ahead of you.
There's nothing wrong with the wall?
What could this mean?
There's been nothing like this in five years.
Why is it all happening now?
This world is getting more and more out of hand.
Eren.
Have a minute?
We need to talk.
What about?
Five years ago, we demolished the wall and began our attack on humanity.
Oh no...
What if there's a Titan that dug a hole underneath the wall?
The hole will be hard to find in that case.
I'm the Armored Titan and he's the Colossal Titan.
Right now, we need to focus on getting Ymir back safely.
Even with our horses, we still have to worry about Titans.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
Why are you telling him, Reiner?
Our primary goal was to ensure all of humanity was wiped out, but now there's no need for that.
Uh...
Eren.
If you agree to come with us, we won't have to destroy any more of the walls.
Understand?
Huh?
No, wait!
I don't understand at all!
I'm saying...
Why don't you just come with us?
I know this is sudden, but we need to go now.
Right now?
Where will you take me?
I can't say that yet.
But...
Well, it's something like our hometown.
So?
What will it be, Eren?
Uh...
It's not a bad deal, right?
You can easily avert this crisis.
I wonder about that...
Hey!
We're leaving!
What the hell?
And here I thought I had enough to think about yesterday...
"12 hours earlier"
Eren?
What is it, Section Commander?
Oh, well...
I was finally able to get my hands on the background report for Annie Leonhart.
Annie's?
Yeah.
It's taken so long to get it because managing these reports is such a mess right now.
According to this, there were two others belonging to the
104th Cadet Corps who came from the same area as her.
And those two are Reiner Braun... and Bertholdt Hoover.
Thanks to the chaos five years ago, pretty much all of their family records are spotty or missing.
However...
During the long-range scouting formation, their unit was given false information.
They were among those purposely told that Eren was in the right wing.
The Female Titan attacked from the right wing!
Huh?
What does that mean?
That it's possible they passed on that information to Annie...
Why?
Why would they tell Annie?
Hey, hold on a minute, Armin.
You can't just...
I know that, Eren.
By itself, that's not enough to prove anything.
So just in case, I'd like to hear from you how these three interacted during training.
Know anything?
I knew Reiner and Bertholdt were from the same place, but they didn't seem close to Annie.
I agree.
I don't recall ever seeing the pair talking to Annie that much.
Well, Annie didn't talk much in the first place.
When we ate, Annie would always sit alone and munch on food by herself.
Oh!
I've got something!
I heard a rumor she liked sweets, even though she looks so grouchy!
I... don't remember.
But...
As their comrade, I'd find it hard to believe.
Set aside Bertholdt, who doesn't say much.
Reiner is like everyone's big brother, and he's not devious enough to deceive all of us.
I agree.
Reiner gave everything he had fighting the Female Titan with me.
He would have gotten crushed in her hand if he hadn't...
What's wrong?
Reiner managed to escape, but Annie suddenly changed her course and ran in the direction of Eren.
I...
I did mention that Eren might be at the rear of the center rank.
But Annie was too far away to hear...
Seriously?
Did Reiner seem overly interested in Eren's location?
Then...
Where the hell is Eren?
It can't be...
I only started talking about Eren's position because Reiner was the one who asked about it first.
Furthermore when that happened, the Female Titan was staring at her palm.
He might have written a message with his blades in her hand.
Reiner could've...
What the hell?
Why are you saying things like this?
...You should Eren!
...You should...
No...
Everyone, listen up!
Supposing that we find Reiner or Bertholdt, act in such a way as to not reveal any suspicions.
Of course, do not make any mention of Annie Leonhart either.
Regardless if they're Annie's accomplices or not, we need to lead them deep underground and confine them.
Does everyone understand?
Yes!
You're just tired, aren't you?
Right, Bertholdt?
You've been through so much, it's making you crazy.
Y-Yeah.
Reiner's just really tired.
Besides, if you were really the Armored Titan that wants to destroy humanity why would you be asking me this in the first place?
What did you think would happen?
That I'd nod and say "Sure, let's go"?
Oh, right.
That's right.
What the hell was I thinking?
Have I really gone crazy?
Come on, let's go.
I see...
That's it.
I've been here too long for my own good.
It's been three long years... surrounded by nothing but idiots.
We were just kids...
We didn't know anything.
If only I never knew that there were people like this...
I wouldn't have become such a half-assed piece of shit!
It's too late now...
I don't know what's right anymore.
But the only choice for me now is to face the consequences of my actions and as a warrior fulfill my duty to the bitter end!
Reiner!
Are we doing it?
!
Now?
!
Right here?
!
Yeah.
We settle this... right here, right now!
Eren!
Run!
Bertholdt!
Eren!
Get out of there!
Ymir!
Eren!
I'm going to return to the hometown we lost.
That's all I care about now.
Bertholdt...
Reiner...
You damn traitors!
The Colossal Titan as well as the Armored Titan, engage the Scouts in battle.
If their mission is to exterminate all of humanity, there is no turning back for them now.
Reiner and the others devote their lives to the mission because they are warriors.
Next episode:
"Close Combat."
There it is again!
Wha...
Where is it coming from?
Setting camp at the ruins of Utgard Castle for the night, the Scouts found themselves overtaken by a Titan horde.
Their chances of survival low.
Nanaba.
Gelgar.
I'm sorry, Daddy!
I'll be a good girl from now on, I promise!
But when all seemed lost.
Listen to me.
When you break it down, this is really just more of a hope.
Christa.
Live a life you can be proud of.
Ymir!
Wait!
One of their own made a shocking transformation.
Yeah!
Atta girl!
Wanna live?
Grab on tight.
That's not good.
They're eating her!
No!
I still haven't told you my name!
I promised you!
The main force of the Scout Regiment swooped in and engaged the enemy.
Die!
The Titan assault fell before their blades.
However, standing on the wreckage of battle,
Eren and the others bore witness to a heartbreaking confession.
Ymir.
Just as promised.
My real name is Historia.

What else you s'posed to think at time like that?
You're only human.
Don't you get it?
This was my second time!
Armin!
Remember?
Huh?
Go on!
Tell him how Annie nearly crushed me like an insect!
Yeah.
That's twice I've nearly died now.
What are the chances I'll survive a third time?
This is what it really means.
What it is to be soldier.
Your spirit breaks and the body follows.
Eh.
No good whining about it now.
'Least not till we can plug up the wall.
That's true.
The two of you have been driven far enough away from your hometown as it is.
This is it.
This is where we draw the line.
Truer words were never spoken!
Home!
Let's go!
We've been here long enough!
Compared to everything else we've had to go through, the rest is easy!
You're right.
We don't have much further to go before it's done!
What are guys talking about?
I needed that.
Thanks.
Are you injured?
Nah, I'm okay, but, Reiner's wounded.
And Ymir's sure seen better days.
Who would've ever pegged her for a Titan?
- Are they?
- Sasha.
We all on the same page?
We'll decide what to do with Ymir later.
Oh, and Conny?
Chin up.
I'll order a squad to investigate your village.
For now, stay focused.
I want our energy on the task at hand.
Clear?
Crystal!
It's troubling.
You would expect this area to be teeming with Titans.
Hm?
Hannes?
Is that the Garrison advance squad?
Tell me they've located the breach.
Wall's perfectly fine.
What?
Spent all night trying to find out where they're getting in.
But between Trost and Krolva District, there's nothing.
No hole anywhere.
That's impossible!
We ran into a search party from Krolva and retraced our steps.
Not a single Titan on the way here either.
But we know for a fact that there are Titans on this side of Wall Rose.
Oh, C'mon.
How much have you had to drink, seriously?
Why you little!
Hold on, wait a second.
What the hell are you kids even doing here?
If there's no breach, then I guess we have to change tactics.
We head back to Trost immediately.
You'd be smart to keep your guard up.
We'll go on ahead of you.
How can there be nothing wrong with the wall?
Excellent question.
Nothing like this has happened in five years.
Why now all of a sudden?
Feels like everything's spiraling out of control.
Eren.
We should talk.
You got a moment?
Sure, I guess.
Five years ago, we compromised Wall Maria and launched an attack on humanity.
Oh no.
What if there's a species of Titan we haven't seen yet that knows how to dig?
Ugh.
That would definitely make their entry point hard to find.
I'm the Armored Titan.
He's the Colossal.
We can hypothesize later.
Our first concern is Ymir.
Titans being a close second, even with the horses.
What are you talking about?
Why are you telling him?
Reiner, no!
Stop!
We were on a mission.
Our goal was to ensure mankind's extinction.
But now, there's no need for that.
Eren, if you want the walls to remain standing, it's simple.
Just come with Bertholdt and me.
Do you understand?
Understand?
What the hell is there to understand?
Listen to me.
I need you to do exactly as I say.
Look, I know this is sudden, but we have to go.
Right now?
Where would you take me?
I can't tell you.
Not yet.
Just think of it as our hometown.
Okay?
So what's it gonna be?
Not a bad deal, right?
The chance to avert a major crisis?
I'm not so sure.
You guys!
Get a move on, we're heading out!
Damn it.
I didn't want to believe what I was hearing yesterday.
Hmmm.
Section Commander?
Something wrong?
Uh...
Huh?
Oh, uh, well I was finally able to get my hands on the background report
I requested for Annie Leonhart.
Annie?
Yeah.
Took longer than I was hoping for.
The paper trail's a bit of a catastrophe at the moment.
Bureaucracy, huh?
Anyway, according to this, there were two other cadets in the 104th who haled from the same region.
I have their names.
One Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover.
Not much survives in the way of records, and thanks to the chaos five years ago, what we have on them is unreliable.
However, we do know that during the long-range scouting formation, their unit was given false intel.
They were among those intentionally misled into thinking Eren was in the right wing.
Wait just a minute.
That's the section Annie attacked.
What?
What does that mean?
Well, it's entirely possible they told Annie where they thought Eren was.
Huh?
Why would they do that?
Where are you going with this, Armin?
You can't just accuse...!
I totally agree.
Coincidence doesn't establish relationship.
Bearing that in mind, I'm curious to know how the three interacted while training.
What can you tell me?
I knew Bertholdt and Reiner were from the same region as Annie, but I never saw them act friendly.
Same with me.
You'd never catch 'em shooting' the breeze.
And when they did talk it was pretty curt.
Plus, it's not like Annie was very social to begin with.
Yeah, at meals she always seemed to prefer eating by herself.
I dunno.
Ah!
I think I've got something that struck me as weird at the time.
I, uh...
heard she liked sweets!
I've got nothing.
Except maybe that...
Guys.
What are we doing?
These are our comrades we're talking about.
Yeah, sure.
Bertholdt never has a lot to say.
But Reiner's like everyone's big brother, y'know?
You really think he's capable of lying to us?
Eren does have a point.
Think about it.
Reiner fought the Female Titan with everything he had.
Almost got himself squeezed to a bloody pulp in the process.
What's the matter?
He burst free of her grip at the last minute.
Afterwards, though, Annie changed her course.
In fact, she ran straight toward where you were.
I...
I mentioned that you might be rear of the center rank, but there's no way she could've heard me.
She wasn't in earshot at the time.
You've gotta be kidding.
Do you recall if he seemed unusually interested in Eren's location?
So, where the hell do you think he is?
Oh, no.
I only brought his position up in the first place because Reiner asked me where I thought Eren might be.
Something else.
Once he broke free, the Female Titan stood there staring at her palm, possibly transfixed by something he'd carved onto it with his blades.
Maybe Reiner...
What is wrong with you people?
The man's been with us from the beginning!
- You don't just...
- Enough!
All of you.
Listen up.
If we cross paths with the pair in question, don't give them any indication of what we've discussed.
And under no circumstances are you to broach the topic of Annie Leonhart in their company.
Before we can ascertain whether they were co-conspirators, we must find, lure, and contain them underground.
That's the plan.
Are we clear?
Yes, clear!
You're just tired.
That's it, right?
Help me out here, Betholdt.
Your nerves are shot.
You don't know what you're saying.
Uh.
Yeah.
It's the battle fatigue talking!
It's okay.
You're okay.
If you really were the Armored Titan, what's the endgame here?
We wouldn't be having this conversation in the first place.
What'd you expect me to do?
Say yes?
Let myself be kidnaped just 'cause you asked politely?
Right.
Not thinking straight, am I?
Barely know what I'm saying here.
Must've gone off the deep end.
C'mon, let's go.
That's the problem.
Heh.
I've been here too long for my own good.
Three years of this madness, surrounded by idiots.
We were kids.
What'd we know about anything?
Why did there have to be people like this?
Why?
Why did I let myself devolve into such a half-assed piece of shit?
It's too late now.
Damned if I know what's right anymore!
Who cares?
It is what it is.
No choice but to face what I've done.
As a warrior.
No road left but the one that leads to the end!
Reiner!
Right now?
Here?
We're doing this?
Yes.
Right here, right now!
We settle this once and for all!
Eren!
Get out of here!
Bertholdt!
Eren!
Run away!
Ymir!
No!
I'm going to return to the home that was taken from me.
I will do it.
No matter what.
Bertholdt.
Reiner.
Damn you!
You traitors!

Ah, the water park.
Happy anniversary, Lois.
Everybody meet back here in six hours.
I can't wait to get everyone else's body water in my mouth.
Uh, where's the slide?
Just eat this Starburst.
Wow, lemons, oranges, cherries.
So juicy!
(thud)
I don't think that was a Starburst.
I think that may have just been acid.
Would you like to ride the Skittles rainbow now?
Is it also acid?
My friend, I'm an adult who works at a water park.
If I give you something, it's acid.
No going down headfirst, and wait till I say it's okay.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Hey!
MEG:
I'm gaining on you, Brian.
BRIAN:
Meg, slow down.
You're coming way too fast.
Ew, Brian, what happened?
(muffled speech):
I don't know.
Hey, idiot, you got to wait till the guy says go.
Excuse me, do you think you can help me out?
Sure, just let me do an awkward, extremely unattractive pool walk over to you.
(grunting)
(exhales):
Hey, what's up?
My top came off on the slide.
I think I may have seen you put it in your shorts.
Okay, well, here's my shorts.
Just fish out the one that's yours.
Thank you so much.
I'm Isabella.
I'm Chris.
Listen, my aunt is waiting for me, but it was nice to meet you, Chris.
You, too.
Enjoy the boobs of your morning.
Afternoon!
Enjoy the boobs of your afternoon.
(laughs)
My word, Chris, that girl was totally into you.
You should ask her out.
Really?
But what if she says no?
Hey, if you want something, you've got to go for it.
Just like the fat man did when he changed his name.
I'm looking for a Peter Ferrari.
Obviously, that's me.
Yes, there's a soiled pair of Ferrari underwear in the men's room trash.
Who took 'em out of the sink?
They were soaking.
Sir, I can't park this.
There's diarrhea all over the front seat of your PT Cruiser.
Isabella, listen, I'm not great at this, but... (grunts)
Told you.
Also, I was wondering if there's any chance you'd maybe want to go out with me sometime.
Oh, Chris, that's sweet, but I don't think you'd want to go out with me.
Why not?
It's just that, well, I have kids.
Oh, wow.
And a couple of cuties.
We got any teeth coming in?
Oh, oh, I think I feel something.
Please, please don't do that.
Hey, your aunt is Consuela?
Hi, Consuela.
You two know each other?
Oh, yeah.
"Lemon Pledge," "No, no." All that stuff.
Is time to go.
Lemon Pledge, no, no.
(laughs) See?
But wait, Isabella,
I don't care that you have kids.
I'd still like to go out with you.
Wow, that's really sweet, Chris.
Okay, you're on.
Here's my number.
Oh, boy, I haven't been this excited since our trip to Philadelphia.
MAN (over P.A.):
Ladies and gentlemen,
Flight 427 to Philadelphia has been canceled.
ALL:
Yay!
(slurping)
I saw Lady and the Tramp, so I asked if we could eat spaghetti in the alley, but they said no, because of all the homeless masturbation.
Oh, I love that movie.
Chris, I'm having a really nice time with you.
You are?
Listen, this is probably lame, but I learned a little bit of your language, and I just wanted to say... (speaking Korean)
What language is that?
You're Korean, are you not?
No, I'm Mexican.
(speaking Korean)
(laughing)
Hey, Chris.
Where are you off to?
Oh, Isabella's coming by, and we're gonna take the kids to the park.
Wow, you two are spending a lot of time together.
Uh, are you sure you want to date a girl who's... had so much experience?
What do you mean?
Like, maybe she's got some city miles on her voo-voo.
Not to mention a couple of blowouts.
(chuckles):
Hey, Bri...
Yup, I heard you.
She's talking about her kids, Chris.
Oh, I don't care about that, Mom.
I just want to make sure you're not getting in over your head.
Well, I'm sure someone's already been in there deeper than that, Lois.
(chuckles):
Brian.
(knock on door)
Oh, hello, Isabella.
Hi, Mrs. Griffin, Mr. Griffin.
Mr. Griffin's up here, sweetheart.
Well, I guess you two have fun.
Okay, bye.
Look, I can see why you're concerned that Chris' girlfriend has kids, but he's happy, and she seems like she's into him.
Plus, she's... she's hot.
Yeah, she is.
I bit my lip off.
(thump on window)
(thump) (sighs)
(thump) Go away, Mr. Herbert!
HERBERT:
It's not me.
I'm in your closet.
Isabella.
Is everything okay?
Chris, I just wanted to say good-bye.
Wha-What do you mean?
I found out that I'm going to be deported.
They're sending me back to Mexico in the morning.
So, in other words, this could have waited till the morning?
I didn't want to leave without saying good-bye.
But they can't send you away.
There's got to be something we can do.
Unfortunately, there's not.
But don't worry, I'm planning on getting back into the country as soon as I can.
What are you gonna do, just leave the babies with Consuela?
I wish I could, but she works seven days a week, between housekeeping and being the new CEO of Yahoo.
Maybe we should improve our business model.
No, no.
Improve our original content?
No, no.
So we have no corporate identity?
We secondary e-mail people use to sign up for porn sites.
So, are you taking your boys back with you?
I guess I have no choice.
But I hate having to.
The whole reason I left Mexico was to give them a better life.
Well, I could take them until you get back.
I mean, I'm no expert at this sort of thing, but...
(grunting)
Wow, you're getting better at that.
But I can't ask you to take care of my children.
Isabella, I want to do this.
Chris, stop.
You would really look after my kids for me?
Of course I would.
You're a wonderful man, Chris Griffin.
Thank you.
Gracias.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Don't worry, I'm gonna take good care of you.
I'm gonna call you "Juan,"
and I'm gonna call you "Two."
Good, he's been reading the book.
Uh, Dad, you're reading the paper upside down.
Wrong again, idiot.
Chris, what are you doing with Isabella's babies?
And why are you holding them that way?
You'll hurt them.
Where's Isabella?
She got deported this morning.
Deported?
A-And she just left her babies with you?
Well, just until she can come back.
Chris, are you crazy?
What makes you think you can take care of two babies?
I don't know, I've seen her take care of them.
I see you with Stewie.
Frankly, it doesn't seem that hard.
You just shattered her world.
Shattered.
Absolutely not, Chris.
I will not allow this.
Look, I made a promise to Isabella, and I'm gonna keep it.
Now, if you'll excuse me, these two need to eat.
He bought a breast-feeding book.
Someone may want to pop in on him.
There's no way Chris is gonna be able to take care of two babies.
Well, maybe he should have thought of that before he opened his slut legs.
No, Peter, that's not...
Anyway, we got to call Child Services.
Lois, if you do that, Chris will resent you for the rest of his life.
Then what do you suggest we do?
I say you let him try.
Trust me, one day of watching those kids, and he'll want them out of here.
(sighs) All right, fine.
Yes, taking care of kids is a 24-hour job.
Like when I worked at that all-night diner from that painting.
They kicked me out of the war for kissing a guy.
All right, guys, nothing but the best for you two, so I got you all-organic, non-GMO, no-hormone food.
That'll be $500.
Ah, well, sorry, kids.
Looks like we're gonna go to Jersey Mike's and hope that future science will save us.
Yay, we're jar people!
Ah!
Science, help!
ANNOUNCER:
Jersey Mike's.
Bring your girlfriend with the fat ass in here.
Hey, guys, how about a little TV?
We can watch a baby thing together.
Baby Einstein, Muppet Babies.
Uh, what's CSI:
Babies?
(babies crying) STEWIE:
What's this?
They can't solve this crime, they're just frightened babies.
They don't even know it's a crime, they just know their parents aren't there.
They're scared, now I'm scared.
Turn this off!
Aah, that's not what I want!
Aah, I'm gonna go hide in my couch fort!
Is CSI:
Babies over yet?
(knocks on door)
Oh, hello, Consuela.
You must be here for the twins.
No, no take babies.
I have good news and ay, ay, ay news.
Okay, give us the ay, ay, ay news first.
Isabella no can come back.
Stuck in Mexico.
The babies, they stay here.
What?
!
What's the good news?
Good news is bus get new wiper blades.
No more "ee-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa."
"Ee-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa."
Well, these kids are not staying here.
You got to take them.
How can I take them... when I was never here?
Wow, she's like the Mexican David Blaine.
Wait, is David Blaine Mexican?
He's something.
Peter, forget that.
What are we gonna do?
Chris can't just be stuck with these babies.
Why not?
I'm doing a great job.
I love Isabella and I love her kids.
Chris, you're living in a dreamland.
How are you gonna support two babies?
I could just take some time off school and get a job.
No, absolutely not.
Well, now-now hold on, Lois, hold on, maybe Chris getting a job's not the worst idea.
I mean, I made pretty good money when I hosted that confusing game show.
All right, Phil, come stand by me, it's Ashley's turn.
Ashley, go ahead, pick an answer, find a question, spin the table, and remember, the clock is ticking backwards.
I'll pass?
(buzzer sound)
Congrats, you win.
Sorry to see you go.
And, Phil, we'll see you tomorrow.
Well, that's all the time we have.
For those of you playing at home, why?
And how?
Audience?
AUDIENCE:
Why... and... how!
Stop that!
Forget it, I will not allow you to drop out of school.
If Isabella can't get here to take her kids back, we'll just have to bring them to her.
What?
What do you mean?
I mean we're going to Mexico so we can give these kids back to their mother.
Peter, back me up here.
♪ Let's get those kids back to their mama. ♪
(clap twice)
Look how winded he is from doing that one spin.
(breathing heavily):
Your mother's right, Chris.
We're going to Mexico.
Oh.
I got to sit.
All right, we're off to Mexico.
If you kids are good, we'll bring you back a tangled marionette.
Is it gonna be a long trip, Dad?
No, not too bad.
Especially since we're gonna do it to the wrong stock footage.
♪ ♪
Boy, what a trip.
(chicken clucks)
Chris, are you sure this is Isabella's village?
(goat bleats) This place looks pretty rough.
Yeah, this is it.
Santa Terrible.
Look, there she is!
Chris!
What in the Mind of Mencia are you doing here?
(gasps) My babies!
Isabella, I missed you so much.
Ay, Chris, I missed you, too.
Look, Isabella, you shouldn't be separated from your children, so we've brought them to you.
We wish you all the best.
Say good-bye, Chris.
Mom, we can't just leave them here.
This is no place for Isabella to raise a family.
(various animal noises, siren chirps)
(handcuffs click)
Oh, you're right, Chris.
I didn't want you to have to raise those babies yourself.
But as a mom, I don't know if I can in good conscience leave this family here.
We'll just have to smuggle her and her babies back in.
Well, no one's better at smuggling than El Chapo.
Maybe he can help us.
How are you gonna get El Chapo to help?
It's easy.
All you got to do is say "dyed black eyebrows"
into the wind, and he appears.
Dyed black eyebrows.
Can I help you?
Peter Gallagher?
Maybe I can help.
Mark Cuban?
Oh, we're getting all the wrong eyebrow guys.
Mrs. Griffin, you would take the risk of smuggling me and my children across the border?
But you could be arrested.
I realize that, but you have just as much right to a decent life for your children as anyone else.
Now we just need a plan.
All right, what if we... run!
(coughs) Damn it, Peter!
What about Quagmire?
He could probably get his hands on a plane.
Lois, that's actually a great idea.
"Actually"?
W-Why are you saying it like that?
And Quagmire owes me a favor anyway, remember?
Last time he went out of town, I sat on his eggs for him.
LOIS:
Peter, it's time for lunch.
Sorry, Lois, can't leave the eggs till Quagmire gets back.
We're having sloppy joes.
Well, I guess I haven't seen that mongoose in a while.
LOIS:
We're having sloppy joes.
Yeah, I heard.
Please say you got the onion bun...
We're having sloppy joes.
(gasps) Mongoose!
(gasps) Mongeese!
Hey, just a heads-up, my dad's friend, Mr. Quagmire, is gonna say a lot of stuff to you, and it's all gonna be disgusting.
Hey, you must be Isabella.
I came as soon as I heard about you.
And then I got on my plane.
(chuckles) All right.
MAN:
Hold it right there!
Uh-oh.
Somebody's coming.
N-Now, hold on, hold on.
I put my business card in a fishbowl at an El Torito.
This could be about that.
Policía!
Put your hands up!
Is this about the raffle for the free lunch?
Does it have to be during the week, because I...
Aah!
Wait a second, are we being arrested?
We've done nothing wrong.
We're not arresting you.
We're taking your plane.
And, Javier, get their keys and take their SUV.
Ah, that stupid, fat guido.
No, Peter, that's the wrong racial slur.
No, I know, I was just thinking about Snooki.
(hawk screeches)
Boy, I can't believe there'd be corrupt cops in Mexico.
Yeah, Donald Trump was right:
his daughter is a hot piece of ass.
Uh, you guys, don't panic, but there's a couple of coyotes over there.
(snarling)
Oh, like Coyote Ugly with Piper Perabo.
Peh-- i-is that it?
Peh-Peh-ree-- Peh-ree-bow?
Peh-Pera-- Pera-Pera-boo?
Pera-boo?
Say it with me.
Per-Per-a-bow.
Is that right?
It's weird, but you remember.
You know?
I guess...
I guess that's the point.
Do you think she's set for life?
Peter, we're about to die!
(snarls, growls)
No, my babies!
Get out of here!
You leave them alone!
Ow!
(grunting)
Ah!
Chris!
(groaning)
(Chris grunts, coyote whimpers)
You guys, I've been bit!
And it got away with my friendship bracelet.
You are a boy.
Chris, you saved my babies.
Oh, my God, Peter, we did nothing.
We're his parents and we did nothing.
I know, but, wow, did you see how Chris took care of those kids?
Up till now, the only thing he could take care of was my traffic tickets.
Name?
Uh, Peter Griffin.
Peter Griffin's here to surrender for his vehicular manslaughter.
What?
No.
I'm a good boy!
He is a good boy.
Oh, this is awful.
Chris is injured, and we're completely out of food and water.
I know.
I'm so thirsty, I'd be willing to drink anyone's pee.
Not-Not yours, Chris or Peter.
But, you know, you know, anyone.
Mom, Dad, thanks for trying to help.
You know, I just wanted to do the right thing, but now we're all gonna die.
Did-Did you gals hear my pee thing?
(vehicle approaches)
Time for clean getaway.
Consuela?
¿Tía?
Ay, thank God.
How did you find us?
Babies' earring have chip.
Oh, well, this is great.
Can you help us get to the border?
Oh, you already in United States.
We are?
Yes, this Texas.
What?
S-So, wait, so we walked right across the border and didn't even know it?
That is a problem.
Right?
I mean, politics aside, we can all agree, that is a problem.
Thanks for the ride, Consuela.
And thanks for talking us on that little detour to Dollywood.
Was I right, or was I right?
Yep, totally worth the extra two days.
Look, Chris, I owe you an apology.
I didn't believe in you.
I was wrong to say you couldn't handle the responsibility of taking care of two kids.
Y-You risked your life for those babies.
Well, I didn't want them to get hurt.
That's right.
Because you care about them, just like you care about Isabella.
And if you want to continue to date her and be a part of those kids' lives,
I'd be just fine with that.
Are you kidding?
Screw that.
Looking after babies is a nightmare.
Oh, you have no idea.
You know how many times I had you kids in the oven, just daring myself to turn it on?
Well, thanks for trusting me to figure it out for myself.
I love you, Mom.
I love you, too, sweetheart.
Isabella, being with you has been really great.
But I think I realized my mom was right.
I'm too young to be taking on this much responsibility.
I understand.
But I know someday you will make an incredible father.
Good-bye, Chris.
Good-bye, Isabella.
LOIS:
Chris, time for dinner.
We're having sloppy joes.
Oh, boy!
LOIS:
We're having sloppy joes.
Yeah, I heard you.
Oh, dear God.
Oh, they're all dead.
No, please, no!
(gunshots)
LOIS:
We're having sloppy joes.
We're having sloppy joes.
We're having sloppy joes.

Ah, the water park.
Happy anniversary, Lois.
Everybody meet back here in six hours.
I can't wait to get everyone else's body water in my mouth.
Uh, where's the slide?
Just eat this Starburst.
Wow, lemons, oranges, cherries.
So juicy!
(thud)
I don't think that was a Starburst.
I think that may have just been acid.
Would you like to ride the Skittles rainbow now?
Is it also acid?
My friend, I'm an adult who works at a water park.
If I give you something, it's acid.
No going down headfirst, and wait till I say it's okay.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Hey!
MEG:
I'm gaining on you, Brian.
BRIAN:
Meg, slow down.
You're coming way too fast.
Ew, Brian, what happened?
(muffled speech):
I don't know.
Hey, idiot, you got to wait till the guy says go.
Excuse me, do you think you can help me out?
Sure, just let me do an awkward, extremely unattractive pool walk over to you.
(grunting)
(exhales):
Hey, what's up?
My top came off on the slide.
I think I may have seen you put it in your shorts.
Okay, well, here's my shorts.
Just fish out the one that's yours.
Thank you so much.
I'm Isabella.
I'm Chris.
Listen, my aunt is waiting for me, but it was nice to meet you, Chris.
You, too.
Enjoy the boobs of your morning.
Afternoon!
Enjoy the boobs of your afternoon.
(laughs)
My word, Chris, that girl was totally into you.
You should ask her out.
Really?
But what if she says no?
Hey, if you want something, you've got to go for it.
Just like the fat man did when he changed his name.
I'm looking for a Peter Ferrari.
Obviously, that's me.
Yes, there's a soiled pair of Ferrari underwear in the men's room trash.
Who took 'em out of the sink?
They were soaking.
Sir, I can't park this.
There's diarrhea all over the front seat of your PT Cruiser.
Isabella, listen, I'm not great at this, but... (grunts)
Told you.
Also, I was wondering if there's any chance you'd maybe want to go out with me sometime.
Oh, Chris, that's sweet, but I don't think you'd want to go out with me.
Why not?
It's just that, well, I have kids.
Oh, wow.
And a couple of cuties.
We got any teeth coming in?
Oh, oh, I think I feel something.
Please, please don't do that.
Hey, your aunt is Consuela?
Hi, Consuela.
You two know each other?
Oh, yeah.
"Lemon Pledge," "No, no." All that stuff.
Is time to go.
Lemon Pledge, no, no.
(laughs) See?
But wait, Isabella,
I don't care that you have kids.
I'd still like to go out with you.
Wow, that's really sweet, Chris.
Okay, you're on.
Here's my number.
Oh, boy, I haven't been this excited since our trip to Philadelphia.
MAN (over P.A.):
Ladies and gentlemen,
Flight 427 to Philadelphia has been canceled.
ALL:
Yay!
(slurping)
I saw Lady and the Tramp, so I asked if we could eat spaghetti in the alley, but they said no, because of all the homeless masturbation.
Oh, I love that movie.
Chris, I'm having a really nice time with you.
You are?
Listen, this is probably lame, but I learned a little bit of your language, and I just wanted to say... (speaking Korean)
What language is that?
You're Korean, are you not?
No, I'm Mexican.
(speaking Korean)
(laughing)
Hey, Chris.
Where are you off to?
Oh, Isabella's coming by, and we're gonna take the kids to the park.
Wow, you two are spending a lot of time together.
Uh, are you sure you want to date a girl who's... had so much experience?
What do you mean?
Like, maybe she's got some city miles on her voo-voo.
Not to mention a couple of blowouts.
(chuckles):
Hey, Bri...
Yup, I heard you.
She's talking about her kids, Chris.
Oh, I don't care about that, Mom.
I just want to make sure you're not getting in over your head.
Well, I'm sure someone's already been in there deeper than that, Lois.
(chuckles):
Brian.
(knock on door)
Oh, hello, Isabella.
Hi, Mrs. Griffin, Mr. Griffin.
Mr. Griffin's up here, sweetheart.
Well, I guess you two have fun.
Okay, bye.
Look, I can see why you're concerned that Chris' girlfriend has kids, but he's happy, and she seems like she's into him.
Plus, she's... she's hot.
Yeah, she is.
I bit my lip off.
(thump on window)
(thump) (sighs)
(thump) Go away, Mr. Herbert!
HERBERT:
It's not me.
I'm in your closet.
Isabella.
Is everything okay?
Chris, I just wanted to say good-bye.
Wha-What do you mean?
I found out that I'm going to be deported.
They're sending me back to Mexico in the morning.
So, in other words, this could have waited till the morning?
I didn't want to leave without saying good-bye.
But they can't send you away.
There's got to be something we can do.
Unfortunately, there's not.
But don't worry, I'm planning on getting back into the country as soon as I can.
What are you gonna do, just leave the babies with Consuela?
I wish I could, but she works seven days a week, between housekeeping and being the new CEO of Yahoo.
Maybe we should improve our business model.
No, no.
Improve our original content?
No, no.
So we have no corporate identity?
We secondary e-mail people use to sign up for porn sites.
So, are you taking your boys back with you?
I guess I have no choice.
But I hate having to.
The whole reason I left Mexico was to give them a better life.
Well, I could take them until you get back.
I mean, I'm no expert at this sort of thing, but...
(grunting)
Wow, you're getting better at that.
But I can't ask you to take care of my children.
Isabella, I want to do this.
Chris, stop.
You would really look after my kids for me?
Of course I would.
You're a wonderful man, Chris Griffin.
Thank you.
Gracias.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Don't worry, I'm gonna take good care of you.
I'm gonna call you "Juan,"
and I'm gonna call you "Two."
Good, he's been reading the book.
Uh, Dad, you're reading the paper upside down.
Wrong again, idiot.
Chris, what are you doing with Isabella's babies?
And why are you holding them that way?
You'll hurt them.
Where's Isabella?
She got deported this morning.
Deported?
A-And she just left her babies with you?
Well, just until she can come back.
Chris, are you crazy?
What makes you think you can take care of two babies?
I don't know, I've seen her take care of them.
I see you with Stewie.
Frankly, it doesn't seem that hard.
You just shattered her world.
Shattered.
Absolutely not, Chris.
I will not allow this.
Look, I made a promise to Isabella, and I'm gonna keep it.
Now, if you'll excuse me, these two need to eat.
He bought a breast-feeding book.
Someone may want to pop in on him.
There's no way Chris is gonna be able to take care of two babies.
Well, maybe he should have thought of that before he opened his slut legs.
No, Peter, that's not...
Anyway, we got to call Child Services.
Lois, if you do that, Chris will resent you for the rest of his life.
Then what do you suggest we do?
I say you let him try.
Trust me, one day of watching those kids, and he'll want them out of here.
(sighs) All right, fine.
Yes, taking care of kids is a 24-hour job.
Like when I worked at that all-night diner from that painting.
They kicked me out of the war for kissing a guy.
All right, guys, nothing but the best for you two, so I got you all-organic, non-GMO, no-hormone food.
That'll be $500.
Ah, well, sorry, kids.
Looks like we're gonna go to Jersey Mike's and hope that future science will save us.
Yay, we're jar people!
Ah!
Science, help!
ANNOUNCER:
Jersey Mike's.
Bring your girlfriend with the fat ass in here.
Hey, guys, how about a little TV?
We can watch a baby thing together.
Baby Einstein, Muppet Babies.
Uh, what's CSI:
Babies?
(babies crying) STEWIE:
What's this?
They can't solve this crime, they're just frightened babies.
They don't even know it's a crime, they just know their parents aren't there.
They're scared, now I'm scared.
Turn this off!
Aah, that's not what I want!
Aah, I'm gonna go hide in my couch fort!
Is CSI:
Babies over yet?
(knocks on door)
Oh, hello, Consuela.
You must be here for the twins.
No, no take babies.
I have good news and ay, ay, ay news.
Okay, give us the ay, ay, ay news first.
Isabella no can come back.
Stuck in Mexico.
The babies, they stay here.
What?
!
What's the good news?
Good news is bus get new wiper blades.
No more "ee-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa."
"Ee-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa."
Well, these kids are not staying here.
You got to take them.
How can I take them... when I was never here?
Wow, she's like the Mexican David Blaine.
Wait, is David Blaine Mexican?
He's something.
Peter, forget that.
What are we gonna do?
Chris can't just be stuck with these babies.
Why not?
I'm doing a great job.
I love Isabella and I love her kids.
Chris, you're living in a dreamland.
How are you gonna support two babies?
I could just take some time off school and get a job.
No, absolutely not.
Well, now-now hold on, Lois, hold on, maybe Chris getting a job's not the worst idea.
I mean, I made pretty good money when I hosted that confusing game show.
All right, Phil, come stand by me, it's Ashley's turn.
Ashley, go ahead, pick an answer, find a question, spin the table, and remember, the clock is ticking backwards.
I'll pass?
(buzzer sound)
Congrats, you win.
Sorry to see you go.
And, Phil, we'll see you tomorrow.
Well, that's all the time we have.
For those of you playing at home, why?
And how?
Audience?
AUDIENCE:
Why... and... how!
Stop that!
Forget it, I will not allow you to drop out of school.
If Isabella can't get here to take her kids back, we'll just have to bring them to her.
What?
What do you mean?
I mean we're going to Mexico so we can give these kids back to their mother.
Peter, back me up here.
♪ Let's get those kids back to their mama. ♪
(clap twice)
Look how winded he is from doing that one spin.
(breathing heavily):
Your mother's right, Chris.
We're going to Mexico.
Oh.
I got to sit.
All right, we're off to Mexico.
If you kids are good, we'll bring you back a tangled marionette.
Is it gonna be a long trip, Dad?
No, not too bad.
Especially since we're gonna do it to the wrong stock footage.
♪ ♪
Boy, what a trip.
(chicken clucks)
Chris, are you sure this is Isabella's village?
(goat bleats) This place looks pretty rough.
Yeah, this is it.
Santa Terrible.
Look, there she is!
Chris!
What in the Mind of Mencia are you doing here?
(gasps) My babies!
Isabella, I missed you so much.
Ay, Chris, I missed you, too.
Look, Isabella, you shouldn't be separated from your children, so we've brought them to you.
We wish you all the best.
Say good-bye, Chris.
Mom, we can't just leave them here.
This is no place for Isabella to raise a family.
(various animal noises, siren chirps)
(handcuffs click)
Oh, you're right, Chris.
I didn't want you to have to raise those babies yourself.
But as a mom, I don't know if I can in good conscience leave this family here.
We'll just have to smuggle her and her babies back in.
Well, no one's better at smuggling than El Chapo.
Maybe he can help us.
How are you gonna get El Chapo to help?
It's easy.
All you got to do is say "dyed black eyebrows"
into the wind, and he appears.
Dyed black eyebrows.
Can I help you?
Peter Gallagher?
Maybe I can help.
Mark Cuban?
Oh, we're getting all the wrong eyebrow guys.
Mrs. Griffin, you would take the risk of smuggling me and my children across the border?
But you could be arrested.
I realize that, but you have just as much right to a decent life for your children as anyone else.
Now we just need a plan.
All right, what if we... run!
(coughs) Damn it, Peter!
What about Quagmire?
He could probably get his hands on a plane.
Lois, that's actually a great idea.
"Actually"?
W-Why are you saying it like that?
And Quagmire owes me a favor anyway, remember?
Last time he went out of town, I sat on his eggs for him.
LOIS:
Peter, it's time for lunch.
Sorry, Lois, can't leave the eggs till Quagmire gets back.
We're having sloppy joes.
Well, I guess I haven't seen that mongoose in a while.
LOIS:
We're having sloppy joes.
Yeah, I heard.
Please say you got the onion bun...
We're having sloppy joes.
(gasps) Mongoose!
(gasps) Mongeese!
Hey, just a heads-up, my dad's friend, Mr. Quagmire, is gonna say a lot of stuff to you, and it's all gonna be disgusting.
Hey, you must be Isabella.
I came as soon as I heard about you.
And then I got on my plane.
(chuckles) All right.
MAN:
Hold it right there!
Uh-oh.
Somebody's coming.
N-Now, hold on, hold on.
I put my business card in a fishbowl at an El Torito.
This could be about that.
Policía!
Put your hands up!
Is this about the raffle for the free lunch?
Does it have to be during the week, because I...
Aah!
Wait a second, are we being arrested?
We've done nothing wrong.
We're not arresting you.
We're taking your plane.
And, Javier, get their keys and take their SUV.
Ah, that stupid, fat guido.
No, Peter, that's the wrong racial slur.
No, I know, I was just thinking about Snooki.
(hawk screeches)
Boy, I can't believe there'd be corrupt cops in Mexico.
Yeah, Donald Trump was right:
his daughter is a hot piece of ass.
Uh, you guys, don't panic, but there's a couple of coyotes over there.
(snarling)
Oh, like Coyote Ugly with Piper Perabo.
Peh-- i-is that it?
Peh-Peh-ree-- Peh-ree-bow?
Peh-Pera-- Pera-Pera-boo?
Pera-boo?
Say it with me.
Per-Per-a-bow.
Is that right?
It's weird, but you remember.
You know?
I guess...
I guess that's the point.
Do you think she's set for life?
Peter, we're about to die!
(snarls, growls)
No, my babies!
Get out of here!
You leave them alone!
Ow!
(grunting)
Ah!
Chris!
(groaning)
(Chris grunts, coyote whimpers)
You guys, I've been bit!
And it got away with my friendship bracelet.
You are a boy.
Chris, you saved my babies.
Oh, my God, Peter, we did nothing.
We're his parents and we did nothing.
I know, but, wow, did you see how Chris took care of those kids?
Up till now, the only thing he could take care of was my traffic tickets.
Name?
Uh, Peter Griffin.
Peter Griffin's here to surrender for his vehicular manslaughter.
What?
No.
I'm a good boy!
He is a good boy.
Oh, this is awful.
Chris is injured, and we're completely out of food and water.
I know.
I'm so thirsty, I'd be willing to drink anyone's pee.
Not-Not yours, Chris or Peter.
But, you know, you know, anyone.
Mom, Dad, thanks for trying to help.
You know, I just wanted to do the right thing, but now we're all gonna die.
Did-Did you gals hear my pee thing?
(vehicle approaches)
Time for clean getaway.
Consuela?
¿Tía?
Ay, thank God.
How did you find us?
Babies' earring have chip.
Oh, well, this is great.
Can you help us get to the border?
Oh, you already in United States.
We are?
Yes, this Texas.
What?
S-So, wait, so we walked right across the border and didn't even know it?
That is a problem.
Right?
I mean, politics aside, we can all agree, that is a problem.
Thanks for the ride, Consuela.
And thanks for talking us on that little detour to Dollywood.
Was I right, or was I right?
Yep, totally worth the extra two days.
Look, Chris, I owe you an apology.
I didn't believe in you.
I was wrong to say you couldn't handle the responsibility of taking care of two kids.
Y-You risked your life for those babies.
Well, I didn't want them to get hurt.
That's right.
Because you care about them, just like you care about Isabella.
And if you want to continue to date her and be a part of those kids' lives,
I'd be just fine with that.
Are you kidding?
Screw that.
Looking after babies is a nightmare.
Oh, you have no idea.
You know how many times I had you kids in the oven, just daring myself to turn it on?
Well, thanks for trusting me to figure it out for myself.
I love you, Mom.
I love you, too, sweetheart.
Isabella, being with you has been really great.
But I think I realized my mom was right.
I'm too young to be taking on this much responsibility.
I understand.
But I know someday you will make an incredible father.
Good-bye, Chris.
Good-bye, Isabella.
LOIS:
Chris, time for dinner.
We're having sloppy joes.
Oh, boy!
LOIS:
We're having sloppy joes.
Yeah, I heard you.
Oh, dear God.
Oh, they're all dead.
No, please, no!
(gunshots)
LOIS:
We're having sloppy joes.
We're having sloppy joes.
We're having sloppy joes.

Aah, I'm gonna go hide in my couch fort!
Is CSI:
Babies over yet?
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)
Oh, hello, Consuela.
You must be here for the twins.
No, no take babies.
I have good news and ay, ay, ay news.
Okay, give us the ay, ay, ay news first.
Isabella no can come back.
Stuck in Mexico.
The babies, they stay here.
What?
!
What's the good news?
Good news is bus get new wiper blades.
No more "ee-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa."
"Ee-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa."
Well, these kids are not staying here.
You got to take them.
How can I take them... when I was never here?
Wow, she's like the Mexican David Blaine.
Wait, is David Blaine Mexican?
He's something.
Peter, forget that.
What are we gonna do?
Chris can't just be stuck with these babies.
Why not?
I'm doing a great job.
I love Isabella and I love her kids.
Chris, you're living in a dreamland.
How are you gonna support two babies?
I could just take some time off school and get a job.
No, absolutely not.
Well, now-now hold on, Lois, hold on, maybe Chris getting a job's not the worst idea.
I mean, I made pretty good money when I hosted that confusing game show.
All right, Phil, come stand by me, it's Ashley's turn.
Ashley, go ahead, pick an answer, find a question, spin the table, and remember, the clock is ticking backwards.
- I'll pass?
- (BUZZER SOUND)
Congrats, you win.
Sorry to see you go.
And, Phil, we'll see you tomorrow.
Well, that's all the time we have.
For those of you playing at home, why?
And how?
Audience?
AUDIENCE:
Why... and... how!
Stop that!
Forget it, I will not allow you to drop out of school.
If Isabella can't get here to take her kids back, we'll just have to bring them to her.
What?
What do you mean?
I mean we're going to Mexico so we can give these kids back to their mother.
Peter, back me up here.
♪ Let's get those kids back to their mama. ♪
(CLAP TWICE)
Look how winded he is from doing that one spin.
(BREATHING HEAVILY):
Your mother's right, Chris.
We're going to Mexico.
Oh.
I got to sit.
All right, we're off to Mexico.
If you kids are good, we'll bring you back a tangled marionette.
Is it gonna be a long trip, Dad?
No, not too bad.
Especially since we're gonna do it to the wrong stock footage.
♪ ♪
Boy, what a trip.
(CHICKEN CLUCKS)
Chris, are you sure this is Isabella's village?
- (GOAT BLEATS)
- This place looks pretty rough.
Yeah, this is it.
Santa Terrible.
Look, there she is!
Chris!
What in the Mind of Mencia are you doing here?
(GASPS) My babies!
Isabella, I missed you so much.
Ay, Chris, I missed you, too.
Look, Isabella, you shouldn't be separated from your children, so we've brought them to you.
We wish you all the best.
Say good-bye, Chris.
Mom, we can't just leave them here.
This is no place for Isabella to raise a family.
(VARIOUS ANIMAL NOISES, SIREN CHIRPS)
(HANDCUFFS CLICK)
Oh, you're right, Chris.
I didn't want you to have to raise those babies yourself.
But as a mom, I don't know if I can in good conscience leave this family here.
We'll just have to smuggle her and her babies back in.
Well, no one's better at smuggling than El Chapo.
Maybe he can help us.
How are you gonna get El Chapo to help?
It's easy.
All you got to do is say "dyed black eyebrows"
into the wind, and he appears.
Dyed black eyebrows.
Can I help you?
Peter Gallagher?
Maybe I can help.
Mark Cuban?
Oh, we're getting all the wrong eyebrow guys.
Mrs. Griffin, you would take the risk of smuggling me and my children across the border?
But you could be arrested.
I realize that, but you have just as much right to a decent life for your children as anyone else.
Now we just need a plan.
All right, what if we... run!
(COUGHS) Damn it, Peter!
What about Quagmire?
He could probably get his hands on a plane.
Lois, that's actually a great idea.
"Actually"?
W-Why are you saying it like that?
And Quagmire owes me a favor anyway, remember?
Last time he went out of town, I sat on his eggs for him.
LOIS:
Peter, it's time for lunch.
Sorry, Lois, can't leave the eggs till Quagmire gets back.
We're having sloppy joes.
Well, I guess I haven't seen that mongoose in a while.
LOIS:
We're having sloppy joes.
Yeah, I heard.
Please say you got the onion bun...
We're having sloppy joes.
(GASPS) Mongoose!
(GASPS) Mongeese!
Hey, just a heads-up, my dad's friend, Mr. Quagmire, is gonna say a lot of stuff to you, and it's all gonna be disgusting.
Hey, you must be Isabella.
I came as soon as I heard about you.
And then I got on my plane.
(CHUCKLES) All right.
MAN:
Hold it right there!
Uh-oh.
Somebody's coming.
N-Now, hold on, hold on.
I put my business card in a fishbowl at an El Torito.
This could be about that.
Policía!
Put your hands up!
Is this about the raffle for the free lunch?
Does it have to be during the week, because I...
Aah!
Wait a second, are we being arrested?
We've done nothing wrong.
We're not arresting you.
We're taking your plane.
And, Javier, get their keys and take their SUV.
Ah, that stupid, fat guido.
No, Peter, that's the wrong racial slur.
No, I know, I was just thinking about Snooki.
(HAWK SCREECHES)
Boy, I can't believe there'd be corrupt cops in Mexico.
Yeah, Donald Trump was right:
his daughter is a hot piece of ass.
Uh, you guys, don't panic, but there's a couple of coyotes over there.
(SNARLING)
Oh, like Coyote Ugly with Piper Perabo.
Peh...
I-is that it?
Peh-Peh-ree...
Peh-ree-bow?
Peh-Pera...
Pera-Pera-boo?
Pera-boo?
Say it with me.
Per-Per-a-bow.
Is that right?
It's weird, but you remember.
You know?
I guess...
I guess that's the point.
Do you think she's set for life?
Peter, we're about to die!
(SNARLS, GROWLS)
No, my babies!
Get out of here!
You leave them alone!
Ow!
(GRUNTING)
Ah!
Chris!
(GROANING)
(CHRIS GRUNTS, COYOTE WHIMPERS)
You guys, I've been bit!
And it got away with my friendship bracelet.
You are a boy.
Chris, you saved my babies.
Oh, my God, Peter, we did nothing.
We're his parents and we did nothing.
I know, but, wow, did you see how Chris took care of those kids?
Up till now, the only thing he could take care of was my traffic tickets.
- Name?
- Uh, Peter Griffin.
Peter Griffin's here to surrender for his vehicular manslaughter.
What?
No.
I'm a good boy!
He is a good boy.
Oh, this is awful.
Chris is injured, and we're completely out of food and water.
I know.
I'm so thirsty, I'd be willing to drink anyone's pee.
Not-Not yours, Chris or Peter.
But, you know, you know, anyone.
Mom, Dad, thanks for trying to help.
You know, I just wanted to do the right thing, but now we're all gonna die.
Did-Did you gals hear my pee thing?
(VEHICLE APPROACHES)
Time for clean getaway.
- Consuela?
- ¿Tía?
Ay, thank God.
How did you find us?
Babies' earring have chip.
Oh, well, this is great.
Can you help us get to the border?
Oh, you already in United States.
We are?
Yes, this Texas.
What?
S-So, wait, so we walked right across the border and didn't even know it?
That is a problem.
Right?
I mean, politics aside, we can all agree, that is a problem.
Thanks for the ride, Consuela.
And thanks for talking us on that little detour to Dollywood.
Was I right, or was I right?
Yep, totally worth the extra two days.
Look, Chris, I owe you an apology.
I didn't believe in you.
I was wrong to say you couldn't handle the responsibility of taking care of two kids.
Y-You risked your life for those babies.
Well, I didn't want them to get hurt.
That's right.
Because you care about them, just like you care about Isabella.
And if you want to continue to date her and be a part of those kids' lives,
I'd be just fine with that.
Are you kidding?
Screw that.
Looking after babies is a nightmare.
Oh, you have no idea.
You know how many times I had you kids in the oven, just daring myself to turn it on?
Well, thanks for trusting me to figure it out for myself.
I love you, Mom.
I love you, too, sweetheart.
Isabella, being with you has been really great.
But I think I realized my mom was right.
I'm too young to be taking on this much responsibility.
I understand.
But I know someday you will make an incredible father.
Good-bye, Chris.
Good-bye, Isabella.
LOIS:
Chris, time for dinner.
We're having sloppy joes.
Oh, boy!
LOIS:
We're having sloppy joes.
Yeah, I heard you.
Oh, dear God.
Oh, they're all dead.
No, please, no!

Ah, the water park.
Happy anniversary, Lois.
Everybody meet back here in six hours.
I can't wait to get everyone else's body water in my mouth.
Uh, where's the slide?
Just eat this Starburst.
Wow, lemons, oranges, cherries.
So juicy!
I don't think that was a Starburst.
I think that may have just been acid.
Would you like to ride the Skittles rainbow now?
Is it also acid?
My friend, I'm an adult who works at a water park.
If I give you something, it's acid.
No going down headfirst, and wait till I say it's okay.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Hey!
I'm gaining on you, Brian.
Meg, slow down.
You're coming way too fast.
Ew, Brian, what happened?
I don't know.
Hey, idiot, you got to wait till the guy says go.
Excuse me, do you think you can help me out?
Sure, just let me do an awkward, extremely unattractive pool walk over to you.
Hey, what's up?
My top came off on the slide.
I think I may have seen you put it in your shorts.
Okay, well, here's my shorts.
Just fish out the one that's yours.
Thank you so much.
I'm Isabella.
I'm Chris.
Listen, my aunt is waiting for me, but it was nice to meet you, Chris.
You, too.
Enjoy the boobs of your morning.
Afternoon!
Enjoy the boobs of your afternoon.
My word, Chris, that girl was totally into you.
You should ask her out.
Really?
But what if she says no?
Hey, if you want something, you've got to go for it.
Just like the fat man did when he changed his name.
I'm looking for a Peter Ferrari.
Obviously, that's me.
Yes, there's a soiled pair of Ferrari underwear in the men's room trash.
Who took 'em out of the sink?
They were soaking.
Sir, I can't park this.
There's diarrhea all over the front seat of your PT Cruiser.
Isabella, listen, I'm not great at this, but...
Told you.
Also, I was wondering if there's any chance you'd maybe want to go out with me sometime.
Oh, Chris, that's sweet, but I don't think you'd want to go out with me.
- Why not?
- It's just that, well, I have kids.
Oh, wow.
And a couple of cuties.
We got any teeth coming in?
Oh, oh, I think I feel something.
Please, please don't do that.
Hey, your aunt is Consuela?
Hi, Consuela.
- You two know each other?
- Oh, yeah.
"Lemon Pledge," "No, no." All that stuff.
Is time to go.
Lemon Pledge, no, no.
See?
But wait, Isabella,
I don't care that you have kids.
I'd still like to go out with you.
Wow, that's really sweet, Chris.
Okay, you're on.
Here's my number.
Oh, boy, I haven't been this excited since our trip to Philadelphia.
Ladiesandgentlemen,
Flight 427 to Philadelphia has been canceled.
Yay!
I saw Lady and the Tramp, so I asked if we could eat spaghetti in the alley, but they said no, because of all the homeless masturbation.
Oh, I love that movie.
Chris, I'm having a really nice time with you.
You are?
Listen, this is probably lame, but I learned a little bit of your language, and I just wanted to say... _
What language is that?
You're Korean, are you not?
No, I'm Mexican.
_
Hey, Chris.
Where are you off to?
Oh, Isabella's coming by, and we're gonna take the kids to the park.
Wow, you two are spending a lot of time together.
Uh, are you sure you want to date a girl who's... had so much experience?
What do you mean?
Like, maybe she's got some city miles on her voo-voo.
Not to mention a couple of blowouts.
- Hey, Bri...
- Yup, I heard you.
She's talking about her kids, Chris.
Oh, I don't care about that, Mom.
I just want to make sure you're not getting in over your head.
Well, I'm sure someone's already been in there deeper than that, Lois.
Brian.
Oh, hello, Isabella.
Hi, Mrs. Griffin, Mr. Griffin.
Mr. Griffin's up here, sweetheart.
Well, I guess you two have fun.
Okay, bye.
Look, I can see why you're concerned that Chris' girlfriend has kids, but he's happy, and she seems like she's into him.
Plus, she's... she's hot.
Yeah, she is.
I bit my lip off.
Go away, Mr. Herbert!
It's not me.
I'm in your closet.
Isabella.
Is everything okay?
Chris, I just wanted to say good-bye.
Wha-What do you mean?
I found out that I'm going to be deported.
They're sending me back to Mexico in the morning.
So, in other words, this could have waited till the morning?
I didn't want to leave without saying good-bye.
But they can't send you away.
There's got to be something we can do.
Unfortunately, there's not.
But don't worry, I'm planning on getting back into the country as soon as I can.
What are you gonna do, just leave the babies with Consuela?
I wish I could, but she works seven days a week, between housekeeping and being the new CEO of Yahoo.
Maybe we should improve our business model.
No, no.
Improve our original content?
No, no.
So we have no corporate identity?
We secondary e-mail people use to sign up for porn sites.
So, are you taking your boys back with you?
I guess I have no choice.
But I hate having to.
The whole reason I left Mexico was to give them a better life.
Well, I could take them until you get back.
I mean, I'm no expert at this sort of thing, but...
Wow, you're getting better at that.
But I can't ask you to take care of my children.
Isabella, I want to do this.
Chris, stop.
You would really look after my kids for me?
Of course I would.
You're a wonderful man, Chris Griffin.
Thank you.
Gracias.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Don't worry, I'm gonna take good care of you.
I'm gonna call you "Juan,"
and I'm gonna call you "Two."
Good, he's been reading the book.
Uh, Dad, you're reading the paper upside down.
Wrong again, idiot.
Chris, what are you doing with Isabella's babies?
And why are you holding them that way?
You'll hurt them.
Where's Isabella?
She got deported this morning.
Deported?
A-And she just left her babies with you?
Well, just until she can come back.
Chris, are you crazy?
What makes you think you can take care of two babies?
I don't know, I've seen her take care of them.
I see you with Stewie.
Frankly, it doesn't seem that hard.
You just shattered her world.
Shattered.
Absolutely not, Chris.
I will not allow this.
Look, I made a promise to Isabella, and I'm gonna keep it.
Now, if you'll excuse me, these two need to eat.
He bought a breast-feeding book.
Someone may want to pop in on him.
There's no way Chris is gonna be able to take care of two babies.
Well, maybe he should have thought of that before he opened his slut legs.
No, Peter, that's not...
Anyway, we got to call Child Services.
Lois, if you do that, Chris will resent you for the rest of his life.
Then what do you suggest we do?
I say you let him try.
Trust me, one day of watching those kids, and he'll want them out of here.
All right, fine.
Yes, taking care of kids is a 24-hour job.
Like when I worked at that all-night diner from that painting.
They kicked me out of the war for kissing a guy.
All right, guys, nothing but the best for you two, so I got you all-organic, non-GMO, no-hormone food.
That'll be $500.
Ah, well, sorry, kids.
Looks like we're gonna go to Jersey Mike's and hope that future science will save us.
Yay, we're jar people!
Ah!
Science, help!
JerseyMike's.
Bring your girlfriend with the fat ass in here.
Hey, guys, how about a little TV?
We can watch a baby thing together.
Baby Einstein, Muppet Babies.
Uh, what's CSI:
Babies?
What's this?
They can't solve this crime, they're just frightened babies.
They don't even know it's a crime, they just know their parents aren't there.
They're scared, now I'm scared.
Turn this off!
Aah, that's not what I want!
Aah, I'm gonna go hide in my couch fort!

No.
No.
No!
I want him.
But I don't want this seal to distract you from our goal.
We can use him... for the cause.
Navy seal wants to bring help, yes?
This is the help you bring.
Run!
Richard!
Okay!
Put your weapon down.
I told you this would happen.
Next time, it will be all of you.
I was supposed to call my grandson today.
It's his birthday.
He's turning 14.
It just goes so fast.
Terry.
Terry?
Tell me about your grandson.
What's his name?
Jake.
Jake.
Yeah.
He loves all that seal stuff.
He's already talking about going to...
Bud/s.
Well, maybe I can meet him someday.
Talk him out of it.
For him and his buddies, you guys are like superheroes.
Bear.
Bear.
Bear!
What?
Doughnuts.
I fought five cops for them.
No.
Come on, man.
You got to eat.
Come on, dude.
Don't tell me you slept here.
'Course he did.
Lena's been calling my phone all night.
Mine too.
Look, I got to go up to intel.
Hey, I've already been.
Well, maybe they missed something.
Bear.
You have a doctor's appointment.
Okay?
Get yourself cleaned up, and go pick up Lena.
Jesus, bear.
Look like you fell asleep in the gator pen.
Thank you.
We heard any news on rip?
No updates.
Maybe no news is good news.
If you hear anything, you let me know.
Tighten him up.
Saddle up, son.
We're about to have some fun.
Give that one to chase.
But, buck, you hit dead center.
We're at 4-4.
All right, ghetto, reset.
We're going again?
I'm sorry.
You got somewhere else you need to be?
How 'bout you, fishbait?
You got anywhere else to run off to?
Nope.
Why is that?
It's because I'm all-in.
That's cute.
You practice that?
Didn't have to.
See, fish here prays five times a day...
"allahu akbar," all that nonsense.
See, it don't matter to us.
That's debatable.
'Cause fish, we know he's here for all the right reasons.
And there ain't nothing worse than a Muslim raghead...
Except for a Harvard bitch.
You know that, caulder, about old ghetto here?
It's a lot to overcome, that's true.
Harvard, Navy seal, man of color...
You got the trifecta working for you.
Punch your ticket here a couple years, sell out, run for congress?
That's the plan, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, you gonna vote for me?
I'd vote for you if politics still mattered.
Hell, no, I ain't voting for you.
My granddaddy'd be twerking in his grave.
Question is, you all-in or ain't ya?
Hell yeah.
Yeah.
We'll see.
So, it's not like when you were a sales rep.
Everything is kam now.
Key account management?
Look, a single formulary is worth more than dozens of individual doctors writing scripts.
It may take me a bit to get up to speed.
Hey, listen, sometimes it still comes down to charm.
Like, just last week, I told a group of formulary stakeholders a joke.
Really?
You know how to hide a $100 bill from a surgeon?
You put it in the patient's chart.
Okay.
Right?
Because they never check it.
Yeah, I know, I get it.
I get it.
They just...
Hey, Ricky.
This is Patrick.
Hey.
Patrick and I were just reviewing some key points from the sales conference.
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.
Good to meet you, sir.
It's "Ricky."
Sure thing.
Ricky.
I'm gonna get something to drink.
You want anything, Patrick?
No, sir...
Ricky.
I'm,
- I'm good.
Um, hey, so, let's assume that you're part of my kam team.
Now, I'd task you with a whole matrix of individual questions so that you can actually figure out how to formulate it yourself.
Sure you don't want something?
I'm good.
Okay.
I'm gonna get some.
Are you okay?
Why are you so made up?
I have to look professional.
For him?
Ricky, this is business.
It's a whole new world.
I have to catch up.
Behave, please.
Wh-what are you doing?
I've, got to go.
No, no, no!
Stay!
Right, Ricky?
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Stay for lunch.
I'll throw a couple t-bones on the grill.
How do you like yours?
I've got some account research to do.
But, um, I will see you tomorrow at the office.
Yes.
Okay?
I will be there.
Okay.
Early.
Great meeting you, Ricky.
Yeah.
What am I gonna do with you?
What?
I have what?
Varicoceles... a swelling in the veins in the scrotum.
The result is an elevation in temperature of the testes.
So, you're saying my balls are too hot?
Doctor, can you please explain what the problem is?
Of course.
Sperm are quite sensitive.
Heat causes low motility.
In other words, your sperm are weak.
They can't swim strongly or at all.
They die before they get to the egg.
Just so we understand, h-how did we get pregnant before?
The chance of a single sperm reaching the egg is not eliminated, but it is significantly reduced.
You could get pregnant again, but it's unlikely.
Well, what do we do...
Short of ivf?
Well, Joseph, you can take steps to keep your testes cool...
Avoid wearing tight underwear, don't do any heavy exercise, stay out of extreme heat conditions.
Done.
There is a surgical option...
No.
It's...
Expensive.
I believe your insurance covers it.
This isn't necessarily bad news.
He wants to cut on my balls.
How is that good news?
We know what the problem is now, and we can treat it.
What?
God must be laughing.
I'm a seal, and my sperm can't even swim.
Joseph...
Joseph, this is not about you or god.
This is a simple medical issue.
We'll discuss it with the surgeon.
Yeah.
Maybe it wasn't meant to be.
Quitting...
It's not an option.
Navy seal, you killed this man.
Now you bury him.
Maybe you bury her, too.
She didn't have anything to do with this.
Richard, you can't just... na'omi.
Your whore digs with you.
Dig.
O0 c1 Nice shooting, man.
Did you see buck's face?
It was priceless.
He was not expecting that.
Thanks, man.
Look, I just wanted to say...
Back on the ship, I normally wouldn't suggest an explosive breach in those conditions, but we had the hvt, we were taking heavy fire...
Hey, do you surf?
I boogie-board.
Okay, well, it's the same concept anyway, so...
You see me here?
I'm riding the wave, just floating.
You, right now, you're here.
You're in the soup.
You're scraping rocks.
See, you're holding on to things, and whether it be the ship mission or your family or buck's bullshit, they weigh you down.
You were aggressive.
Own it.
Float up here with me, dude.
Roger that.
Yo!
So, how'd he do?
Getting there.
Good.
You gonna be a dad or what?
Jesus, is anything private around here?
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Derek Willis into the game for chuckie Jr.
Off to a good start this year.
Playing a lot and scoring a lot the first two games...
Fourth quarter, 2-point game.
It is time for the asr prayer.
Will you join?
Sure.
Akmal.
What was it that made you leave the Russians...
Change sides?
We raided alkhan-yurt.
That was my village.
When one or two men resisted, they massacred everyone.
My commanding officer shot a 12-year-old girl.
She was bleeding on the ground but still alive.
So he ordered me to kill her.
I knew her.
I knew her family.
So I made a deal with Allah.
If I end her suffering,
I would serve him for the rest of my life.
Yes.
It's all arranged.
The meeting with boko haram is a go.
Come on.
Let's pray, brother.
What took you so long?
Now is when you tell me why you're here.
Just exercised my first amendment rights.
You know...
What you're fighting for.
She handcuffed herself across the front doors of her school, then assaulted the officer who cut the cuffs.
Was this a protest?
Performance art.
Her friend recorded the whole thing on his cellphone.
What, you wanted to get arrested?
We're already prisoners in a system that shuffles us from station to station, like rats in a maze.
School is no better than prison.
See what we've been dealing with?
So, why didn't you call your mom?
Erica's still out of town...
Yoga retreat.
So where am I taking you?
No.
Not my place.
You signed for me, Alex.
You're the responsible parent.
Or I could stay with Brad.
You know a hospital that has rape kits?
Dharma, don't joke about that.
Or what?
You gonna take him out?
Jesus.
I'm just messing with you.
Don't try to be a dad all of a sudden.
So the lord said,
"I will wipe from the face of the earth"
the human race I have created, and with them, the animals and birds and creatures that move along the ground,
"for I regret that I have made them."
But let's take a moment to remember who was spared.
Noah, the righteous man, blameless among his people.
God would allow his line to continue.
Thank you.
Take care.
That was a powerful sermon, pastor.
I'm glad you thought so, Joe.
So, god, he...
He punished everyone for what some people did?
Yes.
Um, but I-it's an important message.
Sins have consequences.
So it's...
It's possible that, you know, god would...
Punish a child...
You know, for what her father...
F-for what her father...?
If... if...
If a father committed a big enough sin...
Your service was excellent, pastor, as usual.
Thank you.
Yeah.
We better... we better go.
Well, we'll see you next Sunday.
Absolutely.
It's command.
So...
It could be about rip, so...
I love you.
I love you, too.
We need to talk, Joseph.
I know.
You better go.
All right.
Employees at a refinery in our search sector confirmed suspicious boko haram activity nearby.
Through an agency asset, we identified an abandoned village which we believe may be where the hostages are being held.
Here's a live feed from isr.
As you can see, the tree canopy is pretty thick.
Can the asset positively identify?
He would've risked tipping off bh if he got too close.
Command agrees it's enough to warrant forward staging to the area.
A safe house 10 klicks from the target, and the agency will arrange ground transportation to the orp.
It's too dense for vertical insertion.
And it could endanger the hostages if they heard you coming.
Wheels up, three hours.
Navy seal, how many people you kill?
I kill seven.
Why?
Because they were my enemy.
And when you kill somebody, you take their spirit.
Claim it by its secret name.
The more you kill, stronger you become.
You've never killed anybody.
I kill seven.
Put him in.
You will not silence us.
You will never silence us!
Terry mcalwain, your company refuses to pay.
All this money for oil and none for you.
Just let him go.
You don't need him.
He's been through enough.
You just need me.
Yes.
He's been through enough.
And now he is worthless.
Felix.
Kill him.
Kill him now.
Felix, don't.
Don't do it.
Look at him.
You'll remember that face every day for the rest of your life.
I promise you.
It's not...
Felix, it's not what you think it is.
Trust me.
O0 c1.
It needs another nail.
Mighty American seal.
Well, look at you.
Now you know who has the power.
The infidels cannot protect you.
America cannot protect you.
This god cannot protect you.
Tell me... who can protect you?
Say it!
Leave her alone!
Who can protect you?
!
You.
Stop it!
How do you like your Messiah now?
The girl in your village...
What was her name?
Layla.
Layla.
And did you avenge her?
I castrated my commanding officer, slit his throat, and left for the mountains.
I ordered tea.
The price is $10 million.
Indige vehicle takes us to the orp here.
Please tell me it's not a garbage truck.
Cargo.
There's a local driver up front, one of our agency handlers riding shotgun.
Okay.
All right.
At midnight, we patrol in the rest of the way.
It's about 3 klicks to the target.
This is how the village looked before it was abandoned, when it was still housing for the refinery workers.
Now, assuming not much has changed, this here...
This is our primary target.
Delta team will search counterclockwise until the compound is secure.
The hostages should be there.
How's the knee?
It's fine.
What's up?
You know this is some heavy shit for bear.
This is some heavy shit for all of us.
We're talking about rip here.
That's what I mean.
You think he's got his head screwed on right?
Well, if you think bear's not gonna do the right thing, maybe you shouldn't be here, brother.
Rip is my team leader, too.
I want to get him back just as badly as you do.
Let's go get him.
I understand your desire to maximize the purchase price, my friend, but your organization swore allegiance to mine.
And we had an agreement...
$5 million.
10.
You proclaim to follow the quran.
It says we do not outbid each other or turn on each other or outsell each other.
We are servants of Allah as brothers, and we should act like it.
The quran?
Allah?
What do they have to do with this?
This is business.
I will agree to your price...
If I see the seal first.
Impossible.
Nothing is impossible.
I see the seal, or no deal.
No calls.
The Americans will pick it up.
Take me to him.
Come on, Richard.
Shut up!
Shut up!
You whore.
Enough.
All right, boys.
Hope everybody's got extra rounds for me.
I love you, caulder.
You put my anal-retentive mama to shame.
You're welcome.
I swear, Buddha, nobody can pack a car, a burrito, or a bag like your people.
It's our proud national tradition, man.
You have got to be kidding me.
Look, it's in here.
Give me a second.
Bang!
We're all dead.
Fishbait, will you please explain to chase why everybody carries extra rounds for yours truly?
Heavy weapon.
Eats up a lot of ammo.
Yeah, so we need to carry extra.
I know.
If you knew, you would have them ready at a moment's notice for you and I to grab.
While you're digging through your picnic basket, everybody's wondering where the hell the cover fire is.
I got your rounds right here, motherfucker.
Good.
He's testing you.
Yeah, no shit.
It's not about the rounds.
It's about what's going on up here and whether you can handle it.
You're in the pros now, kid.
And some advice...
Just fold it up and stick it in your outside pouch.
That's how we do it here.
What is Harvard pussy like, chase?
Not bad.
Speaks three to four languages, does advanced calculus.
Yeah, you're gonna have to tell us what that's like over tea and biscuits.
I make a damn fine Earl grey.
I'll bet you do.
That's fancy tea, fish, just in case you're wondering.
Tea, I know, brother.
Comes with this.
Good day, officer.
Where are you heading?
Cocoa factory.
You are aware there is a toll?
No.
But I can pay it.
How much?
How much do you have?
Him too.
American dollars?
Out!
Officer, what is the problem?
Show me what's in the back.
Officer... show me!
Officer, I'm late for my delivery.
You think I care?
Go!
Open the door.
I said open it!
O0 c1 the emir didn't authorize $10 million.
They don't know that.
Why is our assault team following us?
What are you doing, Michael?
What you did with your commanding officer...
What needs to be done.
The emir...
Let me worry about the emir.
I have his blessing.
Are you with me?
The answer is, "yes, I'm with you."
No turning back now.
Delta, soft timeline for infil is midnight.
Let's be ready.
Foxtrot delta one, this is reaper two-two.
Be advised... four-vehicle package moving north on north/south dirt road.
Appear to be heading toward target compound.
Wake up.
Richard, wake up!
Reaper two-two, foxtrot delta one.
Roger that.
I see them.
Stay with them until they leave the target compound.
Delta, bring it in.
The girls.
Safe.
What is that?
Reaper two-two, foxtrot delta one.
Do you still have them?
Negative.
We lost them when they reached the target area.
Could be nothing.
Or it could be a kill team coming in to take out the hostages.
Reaper two-two, foxtrot delta one.
Do you have radio traffic over the target?
Negative, delta one.
They're quiet at this time.
Bear, we got to go in, or they may be gone.
We'd be going in blind.
It's in the day...
Zero tactical advantage.
This is what we came for...
Rip and those girls.
Bear?
Going in... now.
Your new owners have arrived.
You'll be leaving soon.
We got to keep moving.
Make the bastards pay for this.
I got a dead boko haram.
Roger.
Keep moving.
Got another one.
What the hell?
O0 c1.
Foxtrot delta one.
We are troops in contact.
- Delta, get to the huts.
- Locate the hostages.
Grenade!
Aah!
Blue!
Blue!
Blue!
Buck!
You out of ammo?
I'm good.
We got a man down behind the southwest building.
Take the saw.
No hostages!
Hang in there, buck.
We got you, buddy.
Hey.
Look at me.
Easy day.
You see an exit wound?
No, negative.
This is foxtrot delta one.
Target secure.
We have a dry hole.
The hostages must be in that vehicle package.
Commence sse.
How bad?
Shot between the ribs, possible tension pneumothorax, internal bleeding.
He's urgent surgical.
This is delta one.
Execute qrf.
We need immediate casevac.
Single, cat-one Alpha, urgent surgical.
"The lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race"
had become on the earth...
And that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart
"was only evil all the time."
"So the lord said,"
'i will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created...
And with them, the animals, the birds, and the creatures
"that move along the ground...'"
"'...for I regret that I have made them.'"
Previously on "Six"...
All we know is that the hostages are approximately 120 kilometers east of Lagos, just north of Okomu National Park.
We have every available intelligence asset on it.
That's the man that killed my brother.
No.
No.
No!
I want him.
But I don't want this SEAL to distract you from our goal.
We can use him...
For the cause.

School is no better than prison.
See what we've been dealing with?
So, why didn't you call your mom?
Erica's still out of town...
Yoga retreat.
So where am I taking you?
No.
Not my place.
You signed for me, Alex.
You're the responsible parent.
Or I could stay with Brad.
You know a hospital that has rape kits?
Dharma, don't joke about that.
Or what?
You gonna take him out?
Jesus.
I'm just messing with you.
Don't try to be a dad all of a sudden.
So the Lord said,
"I will wipe from the face of the Earth the human race I have created, and with them, the animals and birds and creatures that move along the ground, for I regret that I have made them."
But let's take a moment to remember who was spared.
Noah, the righteous man, blameless among his people.
God would allow his line to continue.
Thank you.
Take care.
That was a powerful sermon, Pastor.
I'm glad you thought so, Joe.
So, God, He...
He punished everyone for what some people did?
Yes.
Um, but I-it's an important message.
Sins have consequences.
So it's, uh...
It's possible that, you know, God would... punish a child... you know, for what her father...
F-For what her father...?
If... if, uh...
If a father committed a big enough sin, uh...
Your service was excellent, Pastor, as usual.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Uh, uh, we better...
We better go.
Well, we'll see you next Sunday.
Absolutely.
It's Command.
Mm-hmm.
So, uh... it could be about Rip, so...
I love you.
I love you, too.
We need to talk, Joseph.
I know.
You better go.
All right.
Employees at a refinery in our search sector confirmed suspicious Boko Haram activity nearby.
Through an Agency asset, we identified an abandoned village which we believe may be where the hostages are being held.
Here's a live feed from ISR.
As you can see, the tree canopy is pretty thick.
Can the asset positively identify?
He would've risked tipping off BH if he got too close.
Command agrees it's enough to warrant forward staging to the area.
A safe house 10 klicks from the target, and the Agency will arrange ground transportation to the ORP.
It's too dense for vertical insertion.
And it could endanger the hostages if they heard you coming.
Wheels up, three hours.
Navy SEAL, how many people you kill?
I kill seven.
Why?
Because they were my enemy.
And when you kill somebody, you take their spirit.
Claim it by its secret name.
The more you kill, stronger you become.
You've never killed anybody.
I kill seven.
Put him in.
You will not silence us.
You will never silence us!
Terry McAlwain, your company refuses to pay.
All this money for oil and none for you.
Hmm.
Just let him go.
You don't need him.
He's been through enough.
You just need me.
Yes.
He's been through enough.
And now he is worthless.
Felix.
Kill him.
Kill him now.
Felix, don't.
Don't do it.
Look at him.
You'll remember that face every day for the rest of your life.
I promise you.
It's not...
Felix, it's not what you think it is.
Trust me.
It needs another nail.
Mighty American SEAL.
Well, look at you.
Now you know who has the power.
The infidels cannot protect you.
America cannot protect you.
This God cannot protect you.
Tell me...
Who can protect you?
- Say it!
- Leave her alone!
Who can protect you?
!
You.
Stop it!
Ohh!
How do you like your Messiah now?
_
The girl in your village...
What was her name?
Layla.
Layla.
And did you avenge her?
I castrated my commanding officer, slit his throat, and left for the mountains.
I ordered tea.
The price is $10 million.
Indige vehicle takes us to the ORP here.
- Please tell me it's not a garbage truck.
- Cargo.
There's a local driver up front, one of our Agency handlers riding shotgun.
Okay.
All right.
At midnight, we patrol in the rest of the way.
It's about 3 klicks to the target.
This is how the village looked before it was abandoned, when it was still housing for the refinery workers.
Now, assuming not much has changed, this here...
This is our primary target.
Delta Team will search counterclockwise until the compound is secure.
The hostages should be there.
How's the knee?
It's fine.
What's up?
You know this is some heavy shit for Bear.
This is some heavy shit for all of us.
We're talking about Rip here.
That's what I mean.
You think he's got his head screwed on right?
Well, if you think Bear's not gonna do the right thing, maybe you shouldn't be here, brother.
Rip is my team leader, too.
I want to get him back just as badly as you do.
Let's go get him.
_
I understand your desire to maximize the purchase price, my friend, but your organization swore allegiance to mine.
And we had an agreement... $5 million.
10.
You proclaim to follow the Quran.
It says we do not outbid each other or turn on each other or outsell each other.
We are servants of Allah as brothers, and we should act like it.
The Quran?
Allah?
What do they have to do with this, huh?
This is business.
I will agree to your price... if I see the SEAL first.
Impossible.
Nothing is impossible.
I see the SEAL, or no deal.
No calls.
The Americans will pick it up.
Take me to him.

You put my anal-retentive mama to shame.
You're welcome.
I swear, Buddha, nobody can pack a car, a burrito, or a bag like your people.
It's our proud national tradition, man.
You have got to be kidding me.
Look, it's in here.
Give me a second.
Bang!
We're all dead.
Fishbait, will you please explain to Chase why everybody carries extra rounds for yours truly?
Heavy weapon.
Eats up a lot of ammo.
Yeah, so we need to carry extra.
I know.
If you knew, you would have them ready at a moment's notice for you and I to grab.
While you're digging through your picnic basket, everybody's wondering where the hell the cover fire is.
I got your rounds right here, mother fakar.
Good.
He's testing you.
Yeah, no shit.
It's not about the rounds.
It's about what's going on up here and whether you can handle it.
You're in the pros now, kid.
Oh, and some advice...
Just fold it up and stick it in your outside pouch.
That's how we do it here.
What is Harvard...
like, Chase?
Not bad.
Speaks three to four languages, does advanced calculus.
Yeah, you're gonna have to tell us what that's like over tea and biscuits.
I make a damn fine Earl Grey.
I'll bet you do.
That's fancy tea, Fish, just in case you're wondering.
Tea, I know, brother.
Comes with this.
Good day, Officer.
Where are you heading?
Cocoa factory.
You are aware there is a toll?
No.
But I can pay it.
How much?
How much do you have?
Him too.
American dollars?
- Out!
- Huh?
Officer, what is the problem?
Show me what's in the back.
Officer...
Show me!
Officer, I'm late for my delivery.
You think I care?
Go!
Open the door.
I said open it!
The Emir didn't authorize $10 million.
They don't know that.
Why is our assault team following us?
What are you doing, Michael?
What you did with your commanding officer...
What needs to be done.
The Emir...
Let me worry about the Emir.
I have his blessing.
Are you with me?
The answer is, "Yes, I'm with you."
No turning back now.
Delta, soft timeline for infil is midnight.
Let's be ready.
Foxtrot Delta One, this is Reaper Two-Two.
Be advised... four-vehicle package moving north on north/south dirt road.
Appear to be heading toward target compound.
Wake up.
Richard, wake up!
Reaper Two-Two, Foxtrot Delta One.
Roger that.
I see them.
Stay with them until they leave the target compound.
Delta, bring it in.
The girls.
Safe.
What is that?
Reaper Two-Two, Foxtrot Delta One.
Do you still have them?
Negative.
We lost them when they reached the target area.
Could be nothing.
Or it could be a kill team coming in to take out the hostages.
Reaper Two-Two, Foxtrot Delta One.
Do you have radio traffic over the target?
Negative, Delta One.
They're quiet at this time.
Bear, we got to go in, or they may be gone.
We'd be going in blind.
It's in the day...
Zero tactical advantage.
This is what we came for...
Rip and those girls.
Bear?
Going in... now.
Your new owners have arrived.
You'll be leaving soon.
We got to keep moving.
Make the bastards pay for this.
I got a dead Boko Haram.
Roger.
Keep moving.
Got another one.
What the hell?
Foxtrot Delta One.
We are troops in contact.
Delta, get to the huts.
Locate the hostages.
Grenade!
Aah!
Blue!
Blue!
Blue!
Buck!
You out of ammo?
I'm good.
We got a man down behind the southwest building.
Take the SAW.
No hostages!
Hang in there, Buck.
We got you, buddy.
Hey.
Look at me.
Easy day.
You see an exit wound?
No, negative.
This is Foxtrot Delta One.
Target secure.
We have a dry hole.
The hostages must be in that vehicle package.
Commence SSE.
How bad?
Shot between the ribs, possible tension pneumothorax, internal bleeding.
He's urgent surgical.
This is Delta One.
Execute QRF.
We need immediate CASEVAC.
Single, Cat-One Alpha, urgent surgical.
"The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the Earth... and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time."
"So the Lord said,
'I will wipe from the face of the Earth the human race I have created... and with them, the animals, the birds, and the creatures that move along the ground...'"
"'...for I regret that I have made them.'"
Previously on Six... (Fung) All we know is that the hostages are approximately 120 kilometers east of Lagos, just north of Okomu National Park.
We have every available intelligence asset on it.
That's the man that killed my brother.
No.
No.
No-- [ Gunshot ]
(Michael) I want him.
But I don't want this SEAL to distract you from our goal.
We can use him for the cause.
Navy SEAL wants to bring help, yes?
This is the help you bring.
[ Gasps ]
[ Women scream ]
Run!
Richard!
[ Screams ] Okay!
Put your weapon down.
[ Helicopter blades whirring ]
[ Man shouting in native language ]
[ Shouting continues ]
I told you this would happen.
Next time, it will be all of you.
[ Grunts ]
I was supposed to call my grandson today.
It's his birthday.
He's turning 14.
It just goes so fast.
Terry.
Terry?
Tell me about your grandson.
What's his name?
Jake.
Jake.
Yeah.
He loves all that SEAL stuff.
He's already talking about going to...
BUD/S.
Well, maybe I can meet him someday.
Talk him out of it.
[ Chuckles ]
For him and his buddies, you guys are like superheroes.
[ Helicopter blades whirring ]
[ Indistinct shouting, gunshots ]
(Caulder) Bear.
Bear.
Bear!
[ Laughs ]
What?
Doughnuts.
I fought five cops for them.
No.
Come on, man.
You got to eat.
Come on, dude.
Don't tell me you slept here.
'Course he did.
Lena's been calling my phone all night.
Mine, too.
Look, I got to go up to Intel.
Hey, I've already been.
Well, maybe they missed something.
Bear, you have a doctor's appointment.
Okay?
Get yourself cleaned up, and go pick up Lena.
Jesus, Bear.
Look like you fell asleep in the gator pen.
Thank you.
We heard any news on Rip?
No updates.
Maybe no news is good news.
If you hear anything, you let me know.
Tighten him up.
Saddle up, son.
We're about to have some fun.

But Buck, you hit dead center.
We're at 4-4.
All right, Ghetto, reset.
We're going again?
Oh, I'm sorry.
You got somewhere else you need to be?
How 'bout you, Fishbait?
You got anywhere else to run off to?
Nope.
Why is that?
It's because I'm all-in.
That's cute.
You practice that?
Didn't have to.
See, Fish here prays five times a day,
"Allahu Akbar, " all that nonsense.
See, it don't matter to us.
Eh, that's debatable.
'Cause Fish, we know he's here for all the right reasons.
And there ain't nothing worse than a Muslim raghead, except for a Harvard bitch.
You know that, Caulder, about old Ghetto here?
It's a lot to overcome, that's true.
Harvard, Navy SEAL, man of color, you got the trifecta working for you.
Punch your ticket here a couple years, sell out, run for Congress?
That's the plan, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, you gonna vote for me?
I'd vote for you if politics still mattered.
Hell, no, I ain't voting for you.
My granddaddy'd be twerking in his grave.
Question is, you all-in or ain't ya?
Hell, yeah.
Yeah.
We'll see.
So, it's not like when you were a sales rep.
Everything is KAM now.
Key Account Management?
Look, a single formulary is worth more than dozens of individual doctors writing scripts.
It may take me a bit to get up to speed.
Hey, listen, sometimes it still comes down to charm.
Like just last week, I told a group of formulary stakeholders a joke.
Really?
Uh-huh.
You know how to hide a $100-bill from a surgeon?
You put it in the patient's chart.
Oh, okay.
[ Both laugh ]
Right?
Because they never check it.
Yeah, I know, I get it.
I get it.
Hey, Ricky.
This is Patrick.
Hey.
Patrick and I were just reviewing some key points from the sales conference.
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.
Good to meet you, sir.
Uh, it's "Ricky."
Sure thing.
Ricky.
I'm gonna get something to drink.
You want anything, Patrick?
No, sir.
Ricky.
I'm, uh, I'm good.
Um, hey, so, let's assume that you're part of my KAM team.
Now, I'd task you with a whole matrix of individual questions so that you can actually figure out how to formulate it yourself.
Sure you don't want something?
I'm good.
Okay.
I'm gonna get some.
[ Sighs ]
Are you okay?
Why are you so made up?
I have to look professional.
For him?
Ricky, this is business.
It's a whole new world.
I have to catch up.
Behave, please.
What are you doing?
I've, uh, got to go.
No, no, no!
Stay!
Right, Ricky?
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Stay for lunch.
I'll throw a couple T-bones on the grill.
How do you like yours?
Uh, I've got some account research to do.
But, um, I will see you tomorrow at the office.
Okay?
Yes, I will be there.
Early.
Great meeting you, Ricky.
Yeah.
[ Sighs ]
[ Door closes ]
What am I gonna do with you?
What?
I have what?
Varicoceles.
A swelling in the veins in the scrotum.
The result is an elevation in temperature of the testes.
So, you're saying my balls are too hot?
Doctor, can you please explain what the problem is?
Of course.
Sperm are quite sensitive.
Heat causes low motility.
In other words, your sperm are weak.
They can't swim strongly or at all.
They die before they get to the egg.
Just so we understand, how did we get pregnant before?
The chance of a single sperm reaching the egg is not eliminated, but it is significantly reduced.
You could get pregnant again, but it's unlikely.
Well, what do we do, short of IVF?
Well, Joseph, you can take steps to keep your testes cool, avoid wearing tight underwear, don't do any heavy exercise, stay out of extreme heat conditions.
Done.
[ Sighs ]
There is a surgical option-- No.
It's...expensive.
I believe your insurance covers it.
This isn't necessarily bad news.
He wants to cut on my balls.
How is that good news?
We know what the problem is now, and we can treat it.
What?
[ Laughs ]
God must be laughing.
I'm a SEAL, and my sperm can't even swim.
[ Laughing ]
Joseph...
Joseph, this is not about you or God.
This is a simple medical issue.
We'll discuss it with the surgeon.
Yeah.
Maybe it wasn't meant to be.
[ Engine starts ]
Quitting...
It's not an option.
Navy SEAL, you killed this man.
Now you bury him.
Maybe you bury her, too.
She didn't have anything to do with this.
Richard, you can't just-- Na'omi.
Your whore digs with you.
Dig.
[ Laughs ] Nice shooting, man.
Did you see Buck's face?
It was priceless.
He was not expecting that.
Thanks, man.
Look, I just wanted to say, uh, back on the ship, I normally wouldn't suggest an explosive breach in those conditions, but we had the HVT, we were taking heavy fire--
Hey, do you surf?
I boogie-board.
Okay, well, it's the same concept anyway, so...
You see me here?
I'm riding the wave, just floating.
You, right now, you're here.
You're in the soup.
You're scraping rocks.
See, you're holding on to things, and whether it be the ship mission or your family or Buck's bullshit, they weigh you down.
You were aggressive.
Own it.
Float up here with me, dude.
Roger that.
[ Indistinct conversations, laughter ]
Yo!
(Graves) So, how'd he do?
Getting there.
Good.
You gonna be a dad or what?
Jesus, is anything private around here?
[ Cellphone rings ] Huh?
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll be right there.
[TV Announcer] Derek Willis into the game for Chuckie Jr.
Off to a good start this year.
Playing a lot and scoring a lot the first two games...
Fourth quarter, two-point game.
It is time for the Asr prayer.
Will you join?
Sure.
Akmal.
What was it that made you leave the Russians change sides?
We raided Alkhan-Yurt.
That was my village.
When one or two men resisted, they massacred everyone.
My commanding officer shot a 12-year-old girl.
She was bleeding on the ground but still alive.
So he ordered me to kill her.
I knew her.
I knew her family.
So I made a deal with Allah.
If I end her suffering,
I would serve Him for the rest of my life.
[ Cellphone ringing ]
[ Clears throat ]
Yes.
It's all arranged.
The meeting with Boko Haram is a go.
Come on.
Let's pray, brother.
What took you so long?
Now is when you tell me why you're here.
Just exercised my First Amendment rights.
You know, what you're fighting for.
She handcuffed herself across the front doors of her school, then assaulted the officer who cut the cuffs.
Was this a protest?
Performance art.
Her friend recorded the whole thing on his cellphone.
What, you wanted to get arrested?
We're already prisoners in a system that shuffles us from station to station, like rats in a maze.
School is no better than prison.
See what we've been dealing with?
[ Sighs ]
So, why didn't you call your mom?
Erica's still out of town.
Yoga retreat.
So where am I taking you?
No.

Good day, Officer.

No.

Negative.
We lost them when they reached the target area.
Could be nothing.

Negative, Delta One.

All right, Ghetto, reset.
We're going again?
Oh, I'm sorry.
You got somewhere else you need to be?
How 'bout you, Fishbait?
You got anywhere else to run off to?
- Nope.
- Why is that?
It's because I'm all-in.
That's cute.
You practice that?
Didn't have to.

It may take me a bit to get up to speed.
Hey, listen, sometimes it still comes down to charm.
Like, just last week, I told a group of formulary stakeholders a joke.
- Really?
- Uh-huh.
You know how to hide a $100 bill from a surgeon?
You put it in the patient's chart.
Oh.
Okay.
Right?
- Because they never check it.
- Yeah, I know, I get it.
- I get it.
- They just...
Hey, Ricky.
This is Patrick.
Hey.
Patrick and I were just reviewing some key points from the sales conference.
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.
Good to meet you, sir.
Uh, it's "Ricky."
Sure thing.
Ricky.
I'm gonna get something to drink.
You want anything, Patrick?
No, sir...
Ricky.
I'm, uh...
I'm good.
Um, hey, so, let's assume that you're part of my KAM team.
Now, I'd task you with a whole matrix of individual questions so that you can actually figure out
- how to formulate it yourself.
- Sure you don't want something?
- I'm good.
- Okay.
I'm gonna get some.
[Sighs]
Are you okay?
Why are you so made up?
I have to look professional.
For him?
Ricky, this is business.
It's a whole new world.
I have to catch up.
Behave, please.
Wh-What are you doing?
I've, uh, got to go.
No, no, no!
Stay!
Right, Ricky?
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Stay for lunch.
I'll throw a couple T-bones on the grill.
How do you like yours?
Uh, I've got some account research to do.
But, um, I will see you tomorrow at the office.
- Yes.
- Okay?
I will be there.
- Okay.
- Early.
Great meeting you, Ricky.
Yeah.
[Sighs]
[Door closes]
What am I gonna do with you?
What?
I have what?
Varicoceles... a swelling in the veins in the scrotum.
The result is an elevation in temperature of the testes.
So, you're saying my balls are too hot?
Doctor, can you please explain what the problem is?
Of course.
Sperm are quite sensitive.
Heat causes low motility.
In other words, your sperm are weak.
They can't swim strongly or at all.
They die before they get to the egg.
Just so we understand, h-how did we get pregnant before?
The chance of a single sperm reaching the egg is not eliminated, but it is significantly reduced.
You could get pregnant again, but it's unlikely.
Well, what do we do...
Short of IVF?
Well, Joseph, you can take steps to keep your testes cool...
Avoid wearing tight underwear, don't do any heavy exercise, stay out of extreme heat conditions.
Done.
[Sighs]
There is a surgical option...
No.
It's... expensive.
I believe your insurance covers it.
[Ignition chimes]
This isn't necessarily bad news.
He wants to cut on my balls.
How is that good news?
We know what the problem is now, and we can treat it.
What?
[Laughs]
God must be laughing.
I'm a SEAL, and my [laughs] sperm can't even swim.
[Laughing]
Joseph...
Joseph, this is not about you or God.
This is a simple medical issue.
We'll discuss it with the surgeon.
Yeah.
Maybe it wasn't meant to be.
[Engine starts]
Quitting...
It's not an option.
Navy SEAL, you killed this man.
Now you bury him.
Maybe you bury her, too.
She didn't have anything to do with this.
- Richard, you can't just...
- Na'omi.
Your whore digs with you.
Dig.
[Laughs] Nice shooting, man.
Did you see Buck's face?
It was priceless.
He was not expecting that.
Thanks, man.

It is time for the Asr prayer.
Will you join?
Sure.

What was it that made you leave the Russians...
Change sides?
We raided Alkhan-Yurt.
That was my village.
When one or two men resisted, they massacred everyone.
My commanding officer shot a 12-year-old girl.
She was bleeding on the ground but still alive.
So he ordered me to kill her.
I knew her.
I knew her family.
So I made a deal with Allah.
If I end her suffering,
I would serve Him for the rest of my life.
[Cellphone ringing]
[Clears throat]
Yes.
It's all arranged.
The meeting with Boko Haram is a go.
Come on.
Let's pray, brother.
What took you so long?
Now is when you tell me why you're here.
Just exercised my First Amendment rights.
You know...
What you're fighting for.
She handcuffed herself across the front doors of her school, then assaulted the officer who cut the cuffs.
Was this a protest?
Performance art.
Her friend recorded the whole thing on his cellphone.
What, you wanted to get arrested?
We're already prisoners in a system that shuffles us from station to station, like rats in a maze.
School is no better than prison.
See what we've been dealing with?
[Sighs]
So, why didn't you call your mom?
Erica's still out of town...
Yoga retreat.
So where am I taking you?
No.
Not my place.
You signed for me, Alex.
You're the responsible parent.
Or I could stay with Brad.
You know a hospital that has rape kits?
Dharma, don't joke about that.
Or what?
You gonna take him out?
Jesus.
I'm just messing with you.
Don't try to be a dad all of a sudden.
So the Lord said,
"I will wipe from the face of the Earth the human race I have created, and with them, the animals and birds and creatures that move along the ground, for I regret that I have made them."
But let's take a moment to remember who was spared.
Noah, the righteous man, blameless among his people.
God would allow his line to continue.
[Indistinct conversations]
Thank you.
Take care.
That was a powerful sermon, Pastor.
I'm glad you thought so, Joe.
So, God, He...
He punished everyone for what some people did?
Yes.
Um, but I-it's an important message.
Sins have consequences.
So it's, uh...
It's possible that, you know, God would... punish a child... you know, for what her father...
F-For what her father...?
If... if, uh...
If a father committed a big enough sin, uh...
Your service was excellent, Pastor, as usual.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
[Cellphone vibrating]
Uh, uh, we better...
We better go.
Well, we'll see you next Sunday.
Absolutely.
It's Command.
Mm-hmm.
So, uh... it could be about Rip, so...
I love you.
I love you, too.
We need to talk, Joseph.
I know.
You better go.
All right.

Employees at a refinery in our search sector confirmed suspicious Boko Haram activity nearby.
Through an Agency asset, we identified an abandoned village which we believe may be where the hostages are being held.
Here's a live feed from ISR.
As you can see, the tree canopy is pretty thick.
Can the asset positively identify?
He would've risked tipping off BH if he got too close.
Command agrees it's enough to warrant forward staging to the area.
A safe house 10 klicks from the target, and the Agency will arrange ground transportation to the ORP.
It's too dense for vertical insertion.
And it could endanger the hostages if they heard you coming.
Wheels up, three hours.
Navy SEAL, how many people you kill?
I kill seven.
Why?
Because they were my enemy.
And when you kill somebody, you take their spirit.

Indige vehicle takes us to the ORP here.
- Please tell me it's not a garbage truck.
- Cargo.
There's a local driver up front, one of our Agency handlers riding shotgun.
Okay.
All right.
At midnight, we patrol in the rest of the way.
It's about 3 klicks to the target.
This is how the village looked before it was abandoned, when it was still housing for the refinery workers.
Now, assuming not much has changed, this here...
This is our primary target.
Delta Team will search counterclockwise until the compound is secure.
The hostages should be there.
How's the knee?
It's fine.
What's up?
You know this is some heavy shit for Bear.
This is some heavy shit for all of us.
We're talking about Rip here.
That's what I mean.
You think he's got his head screwed on right?
Well, if you think Bear's not gonna do the right thing, maybe you shouldn't be here, brother.

Get yourself cleaned up, and go pick up Lena.
Jesus, Bear.
Look like you fell asleep in the gator pen.
Thank you.
We heard any news on Rip?
No updates.
Maybe no news is good news.
If you hear anything, you let me know.
Tighten him up.
Saddle up, son.
We're about to have some fun.
Give that one to Chase.
But, Buck, you hit dead center.
We're at 4-4.
All right, Ghetto, reset.
We're going again?
Oh, I'm sorry.
You got somewhere else you need to be?
How 'bout you, Fishbait?
You got anywhere else to run off to?
- Nope.
- Why is that?
It's because I'm all-in.
That's cute.
You practice that?
Didn't have to.
See, Fish here prays five times a day...
"Allahu Akbar," all that nonsense.
- See, it don't matter to us.
- Eh, that's debatable.
'Cause Fish, we know he's here for all the right reasons.
And there ain't nothing worse than a Muslim raghead... except for a Harvard bitch.
You know that, Caulder, about old Ghetto here?
It's a lot to overcome, that's true.
Harvard, Navy SEAL, man of color...
You got the trifecta working for you.
Punch your ticket here a couple years, sell out, run for Congress?
That's the plan, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, you gonna vote for me?
I'd vote for you if politics still mattered.
Hell, no, I ain't voting for you.
My granddaddy'd be twerking in his grave.
Question is, you all-in or ain't ya?
Hell yeah.
Yeah.
We'll see.
So, it's not like when you were a sales rep.
Everything is KAM now.
Key Account Management?
Look, a single formulary is worth more than dozens of individual doctors writing scripts.
It may take me a bit to get up to speed.
Hey, listen, sometimes it still comes down to charm.
Like, just last week, I told a group of formulary stakeholders a joke.
- Really?
- Uh-huh.
You know how to hide a $100 bill from a surgeon?
You put it in the patient's chart.
Oh.
Okay.
Right?
- Because they never check it.
- Yeah, I know, I get it.
- I get it.
- They just...
Hey, Ricky.
This is Patrick.
Hey.
Patrick and I were just reviewing some key points from the sales conference.
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.
Good to meet you, sir.
Uh, it's "Ricky."
Sure thing.
Ricky.
I'm gonna get something to drink.
You want anything, Patrick?
No, sir...
Ricky.
I'm, uh...
I'm good.
Um, hey, so, let's assume that you're part of my KAM team.
Now, I'd task you with a whole matrix of individual questions so that you can actually figure out
- how to formulate it yourself.
- Sure you don't want something?
- I'm good.
- Okay.
I'm gonna get some.
Are you okay?
Why are you so made up?
I have to look professional.
For him?
Ricky, this is business.
It's a whole new world.
I have to catch up.
Behave, please.
Wh-What are you doing?
I've, uh, got to go.
No, no, no!
Stay!
Right, Ricky?
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Stay for lunch.
I'll throw a couple T-bones on the grill.
How do you like yours?
Uh, I've got some account research to do.
But, um, I will see you tomorrow at the office.
- Yes.
- Okay?
I will be there.
- Okay.
- Early.
Great meeting you, Ricky.
Yeah.
What am I gonna do with you?
What?
I have what?
Varicoceles... a swelling in the veins in the scrotum.
The result is an elevation in temperature of the testes.
So, you're saying my balls are too hot?
Doctor, can you please explain what the problem is?
Of course.
Sperm are quite sensitive.
Heat causes low motility.
In other words, your sperm are weak.
They can't swim strongly or at all.
They die before they get to the egg.
Just so we understand, h-how did we get pregnant before?
The chance of a single sperm reaching the egg is not eliminated, but it is significantly reduced.
You could get pregnant again, but it's unlikely.
Well, what do we do...
Short of IVF?
Well, Joseph, you can take steps to keep your testes cool...
Avoid wearing tight underwear, don't do any heavy exercise, stay out of extreme heat conditions.
Done.
There is a surgical option...
No.
It's... expensive.
I believe your insurance covers it.
This isn't necessarily bad news.
He wants to cut on my balls.
How is that good news?
We know what the problem is now, and we can treat it.
What?
God must be laughing.
I'm a SEAL, and my sperm can't even swim.
Joseph...
Joseph, this is not about you or God.
This is a simple medical issue.
We'll discuss it with the surgeon.
Yeah.
Maybe it wasn't meant to be.
Quitting...
It's not an option.
Navy SEAL, you killed this man.
Now you bury him.
Maybe you bury her, too.
She didn't have anything to do with this.
- Richard, you can't just...
- Na'omi.
Your whore digs with you.
Dig.
Nice shooting, man.
Did you see Buck's face?
It was priceless.
He was not expecting that.
Thanks, man.
Look, I just wanted to say, uh... back on the ship, I normally wouldn't suggest an explosive breach in those conditions, but we had the HVT, we were taking heavy fire...
Hey, do you surf?
I boogie-board.
Okay, well, it's the same concept anyway, so...
You see me here?
I'm riding the wave, just floating.
You, right now, you're here.
You're in the soup.
You're scraping rocks.
See, you're holding on to things, and whether it be the ship mission or your family or Buck's bull shit, they weigh you down.
You were aggressive.
Own it.
Float up here with me, dude.
Roger that.
Yo!
So, how'd he do?
Getting there.
Good.
You gonna be a dad or what?
Jesus, is anything private around here?
Huh?
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Derek Willis into the game for Chuckie Jr.
Off to a good start this year.
Playing a lot and scoring a lot the first two games...
Fourth quarter, 2-point game.
It is time for the Asr prayer.
Will you join?
Sure.
Akmal.
What was it that made you leave the Russians...
Change sides?
We raided Alkhan-Yurt.
That was my village.
When one or two men resisted, they massacred everyone.
My commanding officer shot a 12-year-old girl.
She was bleeding on the ground but still alive.
So he ordered me to kill her.
I knew her.
I knew her family.
So I made a deal with Allah.
If I end her suffering,
I would serve Him for the rest of my life.
Yes.
It's all arranged.
The meeting with Boko Haram is a go.
Come on.
Let's pray, brother.
What took you so long?
Now is when you tell me why you're here.
Just exercised my First Amendment rights.
You know...
What you're fighting for.
She handcuffed herself across the front doors of her school, then assaulted the officer who cut the cuffs.
Was this a protest?
Performance art.
Her friend recorded the whole thing on his cellphone.
What, you wanted to get arrested?
We're already prisoners in a system that shuffles us from station to station, like rats in a maze.
School is no better than prison.
See what we've been dealing with?
So, why didn't you call your mom?
Erica's still out of town...
Yoga retreat.
So where am I taking you?
No.
Not my place.
You signed for me, Alex.
You're the responsible parent.
Or I could stay with Brad.
You know a hospital that has rape kits?
Dharma, don't joke about that.
Or what?
You gonna take him out?
Jesus.
I'm just messing with you.
Don't try to be a dad all of a sudden.
So the Lord said,
"I will wipe from the face of the Earth the human race I have created, and with them, the animals and birds and creatures that move along the ground, for I regret that I have made them."
But let's take a moment to remember who was spared.
Noah, the righteous man, blameless among his people.
God would allow his line to continue.
Thank you.
Take care.
That was a powerful sermon, Pastor.
I'm glad you thought so, Joe.
So, God, He...
He punished everyone for what some people did?
Yes.
Um, but I-it's an important message.
Sins have consequences.
So it's, uh...
It's possible that, you know, God would... punish a child... you know, for what her father...
F-For what her father...?
If... if, uh...
If a father committed a big enough sin, uh...
Your service was excellent, Pastor, as usual.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Uh, uh, we better...
We better go.
Well, we'll see you next Sunday.
Absolutely.
It's Command.
Mm-hmm.
So, uh... it could be about Rip, so...
I love you.
I love you, too.
We need to talk, Joseph.
I know.
You better go.
All right.
Employees at a refinery in our search sector confirmed suspicious Boko Haram activity nearby.
Through an Agency asset, we identified an abandoned village which we believe may be where the hostages are being held.
Here's a live feed from ISR.
As you can see, the tree canopy is pretty thick.
Can the asset positively identify?
He would've risked tipping off BH if he got too close.
Command agrees it's enough to warrant forward staging to the area.
A safe house 10 klicks from the target, and the Agency will arrange ground transportation to the ORP.
It's too dense for vertical insertion.
And it could endanger the hostages if they heard you coming.
Wheels up, three hours.
Navy SEAL, how many people you kill?
I kill seven.
Why?
Because they were my enemy.
And when you kill somebody, you take their spirit.
Claim it by its secret name.
The more you kill, stronger you become.
You've never killed anybody.
I kill seven.
Put him in.
You will not silence us.
You will never silence us!
Terry McAlwain, your company refuses to pay.
All this money for oil and none for you.
Hmm.
Just let him go.
You don't need him.
He's been through enough.
You just need me.
Yes.
He's been through enough.
And now he is worthless.
Felix.
Kill him.
Kill him now.
Felix, don't.
Don't do it.
Look at him.
You'll remember that face every day for the rest of your life.
I promise you.
It's not...
Felix, it's not what you think it is.
Trust me.
It needs another nail.
Mighty American SEAL.
Well, look at you.
Now you know who has the power.
The infidels cannot protect you.
America cannot protect you.
This God cannot protect you.
Tell me...
Who can protect you?
- Say it!
- Leave her alone!
Who can protect you?
!
You.
Stop it!
Ohh!
How do you like your Messiah now?
_
The girl in your village...
What was her name?
Layla.
Layla.
And did you avenge her?
I castrated my commanding officer, slit his throat, and left for the mountains.
I ordered tea.
The price is $10 million.
Indige vehicle takes us to the ORP here.
- Please tell me it's not a garbage truck.
- Cargo.
There's a local driver up front, one of our Agency handlers riding shotgun.
Okay.
All right.
At midnight, we patrol in the rest of the way.
It's about 3 klicks to the target.
This is how the village looked before it was abandoned, when it was still housing for the refinery workers.
Now, assuming not much has changed, this here...
This is our primary target.
Delta Team will search counterclockwise until the compound is secure.
The hostages should be there.
How's the knee?
It's fine.
What's up?
You know this is some heavy shit for Bear.
This is some heavy shit for all of us.
We're talking about Rip here.
That's what I mean.
You think he's got his head screwed on right?
Well, if you think Bear's not gonna do the right thing, maybe you shouldn't be here, brother.
Rip is my team leader, too.
I want to get him back just as badly as you do.
Let's go get him.
_
I understand your desire to maximize the purchase price, my friend, but your organization swore allegiance to mine.
And we had an agreement... $5 million.
10.
You proclaim to follow the Quran.
It says we do not outbid each other or turn on each other or outsell each other.
We are servants of Allah as brothers, and we should act like it.
The Quran?
Allah?
What do they have to do with this, huh?
This is business.
I will agree to your price... if I see the SEAL first.
Impossible.
Nothing is impossible.
I see the SEAL, or no deal.
No calls.
The Americans will pick it up.
Take me to him.
Â♪ O Lord, my God Â♪
Â♪ When I, in awesome wonder Â♪
Â♪ Consider all Â♪
Â♪ The worlds Thy hands have made Â♪
Â♪ I see the stars Â♪
[Voice breaking] Â♪ I hear the rolling thunder Â♪
Come on, Richard.
Â♪ Thy po...
Â♪
Shut up!
Shut up!
You whore.
Enough.
All right, boys.
Hope everybody's got extra rounds for me.
I love you, Caulder.
You put my anal-retentive mama to shame.
You're welcome.
I swear, Buddha, nobody can pack a car, a burrito, or a bag like your people.
It's our proud national tradition, man.
You have got to be kidding me.
Look, it's in here.
Give me a second.
Bang!
We're all dead.
Fishbait, will you please explain to Chase why everybody carries extra rounds for yours truly?
Heavy weapon.
Eats up a lot of ammo.
Yeah, so we need to carry extra.
I know.
If you knew, you would have them ready at a moment's notice for you and I to grab.
While you're digging through your picnic basket, everybody's wondering where the hell the cover fire is.
I got your rounds right here, mother fakar.
Good.
He's testing you.
Yeah, no shit.
It's not about the rounds.
It's about what's going on up here and whether you can handle it.
You're in the pros now, kid.
Oh, and some advice...
Just fold it up and stick it in your outside pouch.
That's how we do it here.
What is Harvard...
like, Chase?
Not bad.
Speaks three to four languages, does advanced calculus.
Yeah, you're gonna have to tell us what that's like over tea and biscuits.
I make a damn fine Earl Grey.
I'll bet you do.
That's fancy tea, Fish, just in case you're wondering.
Tea, I know, brother.
Comes with this.
Good day, Officer.
Where are you heading?
Cocoa factory.
You are aware there is a toll?
No.
But I can pay it.
How much?
How much do you have?
Him too.
American dollars?
- Out!
- Huh?
Officer, what is the problem?
Show me what's in the back.
Officer...
Show me!
Officer, I'm late for my delivery.
You think I care?
Go!
Open the door.
I said open it!
The Emir didn't authorize $10 million.
They don't know that.
Why is our assault team following us?
What are you doing, Michael?
What you did with your commanding officer...
What needs to be done.
The Emir...
Let me worry about the Emir.
I have his blessing.
Are you with me?
The answer is, "Yes, I'm with you."
No turning back now.
Delta, soft timeline for infil is midnight.
Let's be ready.
Foxtrot Delta One, this is Reaper Two-Two.
Be advised... four-vehicle package moving north on north/south dirt road.
Appear to be heading toward target compound.
Wake up.
Richard, wake up!
Reaper Two-Two, Foxtrot Delta One.
Roger that.
I see them.
Stay with them until they leave the target compound.
Delta, bring it in.
The girls.
Safe.
What is that?
Reaper Two-Two, Foxtrot Delta One.
Do you still have them?
Negative.
We lost them when they reached the target area.
Could be nothing.
Or it could be a kill team coming in to take out the hostages.
Reaper Two-Two, Foxtrot Delta One.
Do you have radio traffic over the target?
Negative, Delta One.
They're quiet at this time.
Bear, we got to go in, or they may be gone.
We'd be going in blind.
It's in the day...
Zero tactical advantage.
This is what we came for...
Rip and those girls.
Bear?
Going in... now.
Your new owners have arrived.
You'll be leaving soon.
We got to keep moving.
Make the bastards pay for this.
I got a dead Boko Haram.
Roger.
Keep moving.
Got another one.
What the hell?
Foxtrot Delta One.
We are troops in contact.
Delta, get to the huts.
Locate the hostages.
Grenade!
Aah!
Blue!
Blue!
Blue!
Buck!
You out of ammo?
I'm good.
We got a man down behind the southwest building.
Take the SAW.
No hostages!
Hang in there, Buck.
We got you, buddy.
Hey.
Look at me.
Easy day.
You see an exit wound?
No, negative.
This is Foxtrot Delta One.
Target secure.
We have a dry hole.
The hostages must be in that vehicle package.
Commence SSE.
How bad?
Shot between the ribs, possible tension pneumothorax, internal bleeding.
He's urgent surgical.
This is Delta One.
Execute QRF.
We need immediate CASEVAC.
Single, Cat-One Alpha, urgent surgical.
"The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the Earth... and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time."
"So the Lord said,
'I will wipe from the face of the Earth the human race I have created... and with them, the animals, the birds, and the creatures that move along the ground...'"
"'...for I regret that I have made them.'"
Previously on "Six"...
All we know is that the hostages are approximately 120 kilometers east of Lagos, just north of Okomu National Park.
We have every available intelligence asset on it.
That's the man that killed my brother.
No.
No.
No!
I want him.
But I don't want this SEAL to distract you from our goal.
We can use him...
For the cause.
_
Navy SEAL wants to bring help, yes?
This is the help you bring.
Run!
Richard!
Okay!
Put your weapon down.
_
I told you this would happen.
Next time, it will be all of you.
I was supposed to call my grandson today.
It's his birthday.
He's turning 14.
It just goes so fast.
Terry.
Terry?
Tell me about your grandson.
What's his name?
Jake.
Jake.
Yeah.
He loves all that SEAL stuff.
He's already talking about going to...
BUD/S.
Well, maybe I can meet him someday.
Talk him out of it.
For him and his buddies, you guys are like superheroes.
Bear.
Bear.
Bear!
What?
Doughnuts.
I fought five cops for them.
No.
Come on, man.
You got to eat.
Come on, dude.
Don't tell me you slept here.
'Course he did.
Lena's been calling my phone all night.
Mine too.
Look, I got to go up to Intel.
Hey, I've already been.
Well, maybe they missed something.
Bear.
You have a doctor's appointment.
Okay?
Get yourself cleaned up, and go pick up Lena.
Jesus, Bear.
Look like you fell asleep in the gator pen.
Thank you.

I'm glad you thought so, Joe.
So, God, He...
He punished everyone for what some people did?
Yes.
Um, but I-it's an important message.
Sins have consequences.
So it's, uh...
It's possible that, you know, God would... punish a child... you know, for what her father...
F-For what her father...?
If... if, uh...
If a father committed a big enough sin, uh...
Your service was excellent, Pastor, as usual.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Uh, uh, we better...
We better go.
Well, we'll see you next Sunday.
Absolutely.
It's Command.
Mm-hmm.
So, uh... it could be about Rip, so...
I love you.
I love you, too.
We need to talk, Joseph.
I know.
You better go.
All right.
Employees at a refinery in our search sector confirmed suspicious Boko Haram activity nearby.
Through an Agency asset, we identified an abandoned village which we believe may be where the hostages are being held.
Here's a live feed from ISR.
As you can see, the tree canopy is pretty thick.
Can the asset positively identify?
He would've risked tipping off BH if he got too close.
Command agrees it's enough to warrant forward staging to the area.
A safe house 10 klicks from the target, and the Agency will arrange ground transportation to the ORP.
It's too dense for vertical insertion.
And it could endanger the hostages if they heard you coming.
Wheels up, three hours.
Navy SEAL, how many people you kill?
I kill seven.
Why?
Because they were my enemy.
And when you kill somebody, you take their spirit.
Claim it by its secret name.
The more you kill, stronger you become.
You've never killed anybody.
I kill seven.
Put him in.
You will not silence us.
You will never silence us!
Terry McAlwain, your company refuses to pay.
All this money for oil and none for you.
Hmm.
Just let him go.
You don't need him.
He's been through enough.
You just need me.
Yes.
He's been through enough.
And now he is worthless.
Felix.
Kill him.
Kill him now.
Felix, don't.
Don't do it.
Look at him.
You'll remember that face every day for the rest of your life.
I promise you.
It's not...
Felix, it's not what you think it is.
Trust me.
It needs another nail.
Mighty American SEAL.
Well, look at you.
Now you know who has the power.
The infidels cannot protect you.
America cannot protect you.
This God cannot protect you.
Tell me...
Who can protect you?
- Say it!
- Leave her alone!
Who can protect you?
!
You.
Stop it!
Ohh!
How do you like your Messiah now?
_
The girl in your village...
What was her name?
Layla.
Layla.
And did you avenge her?
I castrated my commanding officer, slit his throat, and left for the mountains.
I ordered tea.
The price is $10 million.
Indige vehicle takes us to the ORP here.
- Please tell me it's not a garbage truck.
- Cargo.
There's a local driver up front, one of our Agency handlers riding shotgun.
Okay.
All right.
At midnight, we patrol in the rest of the way.
It's about 3 klicks to the target.
This is how the village looked before it was abandoned, when it was still housing for the refinery workers.
Now, assuming not much has changed, this here...
This is our primary target.
Delta Team will search counterclockwise until the compound is secure.
The hostages should be there.
How's the knee?
It's fine.
What's up?
You know this is some heavy shit for Bear.
This is some heavy shit for all of us.
We're talking about Rip here.
That's what I mean.
You think he's got his head screwed on right?
Well, if you think Bear's not gonna do the right thing, maybe you shouldn't be here, brother.
Rip is my team leader, too.
I want to get him back just as badly as you do.
Let's go get him.
_
I understand your desire to maximize the purchase price, my friend, but your organization swore allegiance to mine.
And we had an agreement... $5 million.
10.
You proclaim to follow the Quran.
It says we do not outbid each other or turn on each other or outsell each other.
We are servants of Allah as brothers, and we should act like it.
The Quran?
Allah?
What do they have to do with this, huh?
This is business.
I will agree to your price... if I see the SEAL first.
Impossible.
Nothing is impossible.
I see the SEAL, or no deal.
No calls.
The Americans will pick it up.
Take me to him.

All right, boys.
Hope everybody's got extra rounds for me.
I love you, Caulder.
You put my anal-retentive mama to shame.
You're welcome.
I swear, Buddha, nobody can pack a car, a burrito, or a bag like your people.
It's our proud national tradition, man.
You have got to be kidding me.
Look, it's in here.
Give me a second.
Bang!
We're all dead.
Fishbait, will you please explain to Chase why everybody carries extra rounds for yours truly?
Heavy weapon.
Eats up a lot of ammo.
Yeah, so we need to carry extra.
I know.
If you knew, you would have them ready at a moment's notice for you and I to grab.
While you're digging through your picnic basket, everybody's wondering where the hell the cover fire is.
I got your rounds right here, mother fakar.
Good.
He's testing you.
Yeah, no shit.
It's not about the rounds.
It's about what's going on up here and whether you can handle it.
You're in the pros now, kid.
Oh, and some advice...
Just fold it up and stick it in your outside pouch.
That's how we do it here.
What is Harvard...
like, Chase?
Not bad.
Speaks three to four languages, does advanced calculus.
Yeah, you're gonna have to tell us what that's like over tea and biscuits.
I make a damn fine Earl Grey.
I'll bet you do.
That's fancy tea, Fish, just in case you're wondering.
Tea, I know, brother.
Comes with this.
Good day, Officer.
Where are you heading?
Cocoa factory.
You are aware there is a toll?
No.
But I can pay it.
How much?
How much do you have?
Him too.
American dollars?
- Out!
- Huh?
Officer, what is the problem?
Show me what's in the back.
Officer...
Show me!
Officer, I'm late for my delivery.
You think I care?
Go!
Open the door.
I said open it!
The Emir didn't authorize $10 million.
They don't know that.
Why is our assault team following us?
What are you doing, Michael?
What you did with your commanding officer...
What needs to be done.
The Emir...
Let me worry about the Emir.
I have his blessing.
Are you with me?
The answer is, "Yes, I'm with you."
No turning back now.
Delta, soft timeline for infil is midnight.
Let's be ready.
Foxtrot Delta One, this is Reaper Two-Two.
Be advised... four-vehicle package moving north on north/south dirt road.
Appear to be heading toward target compound.
Wake up.
Richard, wake up!
Reaper Two-Two, Foxtrot Delta One.
Roger that.
I see them.
Stay with them until they leave the target compound.
Delta, bring it in.
The girls.
Safe.
What is that?
Reaper Two-Two, Foxtrot Delta One.
Do you still have them?
Negative.
We lost them when they reached the target area.
Could be nothing.
Or it could be a kill team coming in to take out the hostages.
Reaper Two-Two, Foxtrot Delta One.
Do you have radio traffic over the target?
Negative, Delta One.
They're quiet at this time.
Bear, we got to go in, or they may be gone.
We'd be going in blind.
It's in the day...
Zero tactical advantage.
This is what we came for...
Rip and those girls.
Bear?
Going in... now.
Your new owners have arrived.
You'll be leaving soon.
We got to keep moving.
Make the bastards pay for this.
I got a dead Boko Haram.
Roger.
Keep moving.
Got another one.
What the hell?
Foxtrot Delta One.
We are troops in contact.
Delta, get to the huts.
Locate the hostages.
Grenade!
Aah!
Blue!
Blue!
Blue!
Buck!
You out of ammo?
I'm good.
We got a man down behind the southwest building.
Take the SAW.
No hostages!
Hang in there, Buck.
We got you, buddy.
Hey.
Look at me.
Easy day.
You see an exit wound?
No, negative.
This is Foxtrot Delta One.
Target secure.
We have a dry hole.
The hostages must be in that vehicle package.
Commence SSE.
How bad?
Shot between the ribs, possible tension pneumothorax, internal bleeding.
He's urgent surgical.
This is Delta One.
Execute QRF.
We need immediate CASEVAC.
Single, Cat-One Alpha, urgent surgical.
"The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the Earth... and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time."
"So the Lord said,
'I will wipe from the face of the Earth the human race I have created... and with them, the animals, the birds, and the creatures that move along the ground...'"
"'...for I regret that I have made them.'"
Back a few months ago,
I was headlinin' a great big nightclub, and they put me up a couple days early.
I came in a couple days early, and they put me up in what they call the "Star Suite."
Now here I am, headlining' in one of the biggest nightclubs in the country, and I wake up at 8:00 in the morning in this "Star Suite"
all by myself.
Aw!
Yeah, that's what I said, "Aw."
But I did what I've always done, man, to cheer myself up,
I picked up my guitar,
I sat down, and I wrote me a little song.
Now this is how it feels to be alone at the top of the hill, tryin' to figure out why.

Oh, yeah, Emmit!

Nail me, Emmit, harder.
Yeah!

Oh, yeah!
Oh, Emmit!
Oh, yeah!
Don't stop!
Oh, Emmit!
On the sofa, I thought, unless you're attached to a more classic bed narrative.
Non-descript, though, you know, the furnishings, so they can't tie it to us.
That's...
I think you solved it.
We can keep you in a shirt, hiding your difference.
Maybe in a cowgirl, or a doggy scenario, favoring our rears, in other words, keeping our faces slightly absurd.
"Obscured."
What did I say?
I'm glad we're doing this, babe.
Taking control.
This whole time, we've been playing to draw.
It's time we start playing to win.
I know, but blackmail...
We lost the high roller, babe.
Zip.
Gone.
I know, and I'm so sorry.
It's not your fault.
A day like you had,
I would have stopped for a sidecar, too.
I just lost track...
I know.
This thing with your brother has got us both upset.
To deprive a man of his career, endanger his female...
I panicked.
You're too hard on yourself.
You rallied, didn't you, in the end?
You're here.
We're together.
Maybe I can call the guy, the high roller,
- and say...
- What?
Really?
'Cause you lost your job at the parole board on account of banging your clients?
No, because I fell in love.
That's sweet.
You're sweet.
Hon.
Where did you go?
I...
Jesus!
I just love you so much.
No.
For Pete's sake, I'm wearing a hooker wig!
- Just hold on.
- Sorry.
No, just...
That's got to be bad luck.
Okay.
Now, go.
Babe, you're my everything.
I want we should spend the rest of our lives together.
You gotta ask.
Oh.
Right.
Nikki Swango, will you marry me?
Yes, Raymond Stussy, I will marry you.
Come here.
You've made me the happiest woman ever.
Now, let's make a sex tape.
Hey, hon.
You...
Stella?
What is it, honey?
I'll...
No!
Now, hold on!
Don't make a scene, Daddy.
Yeah, Mr. Stussy.
I saw the tape.
It's disgusting.
I didn't...
Baby!
Baby, I didn't...
I wouldn't!
Swear to Christ!
Stella...
Ma says to tell you, "Don't call."
Stella!
Nail me, Emmit, harder.
Yeah!
Oh!
Emmit, Emmit, nail me, Emmit!
What the goddamn hell?
You have a fat wife.
Excuse me?
Which part of what I just said is giving you trouble?
This is my office.
A fat woman is inherently untrustworthy as she is a sensualist who sees no real difference between a pastrami sandwich and a dick in the mouth.
There's no call for that kind of language.
No.
A female Jew is especially vulnerable to the zaftig seduction of the forbidden, being part animal.
What are you doing?
Do you know what a chicken is?
- What?
- A chicken.
Do you know what a chicken is?
A chicken is an egg's way of making another egg.
You see, it's all a matter of perspective.
The chicken sees it one way, the egg another, so let's start again.
This is not your office, just as your wife would not be your wife if I came to her in the night with a platter of cold cuts.
Sit down, my friend.
You have shock.
All is well.
I'm just...
I'm not...
I need a minute.
No problem, no problem.
Have a drink, you'll feel better.
No.
Are you out of your mind?
Nice drink, refreshing.
Are you threatening me?
No, no, no, the whole thing.
Yuri tells me you spoke to the police yesterday.
You can ask her, she came to me.
Not about anything, but there was a...
One of our cars was...
Some kind of accident.
A fender bender.
So, you know, unconnected to this completely.
You may have, during the course of the day, a strong impulse to act.
It's perfectly normal, a man of your station being forced to play the cuckold.
But remember, it's all a matter of perspective.
What's happening here is good.
You and I are partners now.
Contracts have been signed by the majordomo himself.
So, you see, lives are changing for the better.
And all you have to do is review the accounts, write up the deals, and approve the paperwork.
Do you understand?
Yuri will show you to your new office.
Don't forget your mug.
_
Emmit?
It's worse than we thought.
What we talked about.
The thing...
Are you...
Did they hurt you?
To get you to sign, I'm saying.
Did they...
You...
Emmit?
Emmit?
Mrs. Goldfarb.
You must be Sy.
I am so glad we finally get to meet.
I've been pinching Buck's ear every time I see him.
Yes, yes, he told me.
And I must admit, I'm curious.
Are you all right?
Uh...
Of course, I just...
I had an upsetting experience this morning.
To be honest,
I feel as if I've left the known world.
You ever had that feeling?
Like you, uh, stepped off the map into the, well, unknown, I guess?
That's how I felt when my Torvald died.
My husband made his first million in mortuaries.
"Everybody dies, Ruby," he told me,
"You can't just leave them on the sofa."
One night, he was eating a three-pound lobster and he had a stroke, and with it, a revelation.
Self-storage, that was the future.
The two businesses are surprisingly similar when you think about it, a place to put the things you'll never use again.
He died last year.
Complications from polio.
For six months, I wore black and tore my sleeves.
And then, I had a revelation of my own.
Parking lots.
The final piece to the storage triptych.
People are always going to need a place to park.
Amen.
I'll be honest with you, Mr. Feltz.
At my age, I'm not looking for a partner.
My preference would be to acquire the entire company, Stussy Lots Ltd., and I would be happy to let you keep the name intact if that worries you.
A second choice would be to buy several lots independently and build the business that way, but let's be honest.
That would make me your competitor, and, as my late husband always used to say,
"You don't want a Goldfarb for an enemy."
- I'm sure that's true.
- Mmm.
It's interesting that you should come to us now.
Problems?
No, not problems.
More of a softening of the will.
You see, Emmit Stussy, whom you'll meet, is a great man, a philanthropist, a leader, and, of late, he's been talking with increased regularity about dedicating himself in total to his good works,
i.e., the betterment of mankind.
Now, I suggested he take a step back and allow me to run the day-to-day, but he seems adamant that we stick together.
Pre-schools in Mumbai, health clinics in Inner Mongolia, better access to veterinary care.
And after all, how much money does one man need?
A lot, actually.
Women, more so.
And you'd be okay with that, selling a business that you worked so hard to build?
I'm sorry.
There's... _
I forgot a very important...
We're closing on a new line of credit, and my girl got my calendar confused.
You go ahead.
Play hard to get.
No, no, no, that's not...
Easy to get.
Really.
I mean, at the right price.
But we should talk more.
Call my private line.
The office isn't safe.
I mean, the lines are down.
Hello?
Emmit!
Emmit!
Hello?
Emmit?
She left.
Did you sign partnership papers?
Did you make Varga a partner in our firm?
I didn't think it was possible.
The evil of this man.
My brother.
My brother.
He's in my office.
He put his Schwanz in the mug Esther gave me.
I had to throw it away.
You said you were gonna fix this.
You swore he'd go away.
Oh, enough about your stupid brother!
We're in trouble here!
This is a...
Enemies are at the gates!
Inside the gates!
Fornicating with our cookware!
What is the point of you?
What?
The point.
What is the point of you?
You're supposed to be a fixer.
Nothing's fixed.
Everything's broken.
They sent my wife a sex tape.
Why would your wife wanna watch your brother have sex?
Not him, dummy, me!
Ray, in a wig, pretending to...
He shaved his mustache!
He and that... whore.
And you were supposed to stop them!
Don't come here moaning about, "We're in trouble."
Who was the one who found Ermentraub, the go-between which led to Varga?
Where was the diligence, the due diligence?
You said...
I wanted to go deeper, but you said...
"Enemies at the gates," who let them in?
I never.
You need to unchain me.
If I was free, my hands, I could...
Your brother wouldn't bother us again.
It's the Delilah.
This floozy is pushing him, putting ideas in his head.
And now, they think, my family, that I'm some kind of...
When all I ever did was...
And there's...
Look at me, there's good inside, a good person.
Of course there is.
Think of the children, the lives you help.
I'm not some kind of weakling that can't control his...
Twenty-five years, and never once did I look at a woman sideways.
Sit-down meetings with the doors open, professional always.
You're a model, a role model.
I look up to you.
Everyone I know.
You've gotta fix this.
Whatever it takes.
Shackles off?
And throw away the key.
I met with the widow Goldfarb...
Not...
Okay.
I can't...
So, nope, say it again?
I'm saying Maurice, the fellow with his head caved in, it wasn't a random robbery.
He was hired by another fellow to rob somebody.
His brother.
Maurice's brother?
No, the brother of the fella that hired Maurice, both named Stussy.
- Like your stepdad.
- Exactly.
Probably gave Maurice an address for the brother, except he lost it.
Or forgot it, at which point,
Maurice makes the wrong choice.
Drives to the wrong town, takes a name out of the phone book.
Also Stussy.
And you know what happens next.
New chief's not gonna like this.
He doesn't have to like it, it's factual, we think.
Makes more sense than the other at least.
He's still not gonna like it.
Well, you don't have to like the truth for it to be true.
You sure?
We're gonna visit the parole office today either way, face the hiring brother.
And see if you can't track down this Vanessa who rented the apartment that lost an air-conditioner.
I'm thinking they might be connected.
What do you think?
Bigger size.
Don't you think it'd be more comfortable?
Yeah?
We have something in a 44.
We'll try that.
You're sweating.
It's just...
It's a lot of money, 100 grand.
Are you sure?
I mean, we could ask for less...
Are we worth less?
You and me, our value, I'm saying, to the world?
What makes him rich, and us not?
Larceny.
Your brother stole from you, your birthright, like the snake in the garden, and then he built this falsehood.
Self-made man, my ass.
That business is your business, that mansion is your mansion on account of the stamps.
What he used to build this empire.
What's fair here is complete surrender.
We're compromising by asking for 100 grand.
He is getting off easy.
Here you go.
Oh, yeah.
You got me.
Congratulations, you're officially the stupidest person alive.
Who is this?
It's Menachem Begin.
Who do you think it is?
You made a sex tape and gave it straight to the wife.
No...
You left it on the stoop.
Three people live in that house.
What did you think was gonna happen?
Tears, were there?
She left, and took the mother-in-law.
So, whatever leverage you think you have...
He's gonna pay.
For what?
She left.
The way we figure it, that's money owed for startup fees.
Collateral Ray put down as a youth.
He's part owner in the enterprise, in other words.
We're not gonna stop till we get what's ours.
We should meet, you and me, hammer out an end to this.
The end is, you pay.
She watched the tape.
Asshole.
Asshole.
She watched the tape.
So, she believes, right now, her husband slipping dick to a redhead is a true story?
Factual?
We were asking 100 grand to keep her from knowing, now I'm saying 200 grand to tell her the other truth.
There is no other truth.
You sure about that?
We got video evidence
Emmit's screwing his secretary.
It's a fact.
It never happened!
That doesn't make it any less of a fact.
And I'm saying the price to convince her of the other truth is 200 grand.
Stussy Lot 350, one hour.
Baby, look at you.
Is it all right?
It's amazing.
I gotta do a girl thing.
I'll see you at home later?
You want me to come?
It's not like I gotta work.
You're sweet.
What do you want?
You're dead, do you hear me?
Oh, I'm dead?
That's...
You got some nerve after...
She saw it!
Stella, the tape.
Big whoop, I'm out of a job.
She left me.
Oh, well, you know, reap what you sow.
You should've done what's right when you had the chance.
Buddy, when I'm done with you, they'll be sponging you off the floor.
Yeah?
You'll be in the poor house making soup out of your dirty socks.
Fuck you.
Me?
Is that...
Is that what you're saying?
Fuck me?
You wanna fuck me?
I'll tattoo it on my fist and come over there!
Stuffed and mounted like a goddamn...
Yeah, fuck you!
So, if you know what's good for you, pay the damn money and pray that I'm satisfied!
Hello?
God damn it!
My mom.
Mr. Stussy!
Chief Burgle, we met yesterday.
Uh, you know Officer Lopez.
What's, uh...
We just had a few more questions.
I thought you said you weren't together?
We had an intersection of interest.
Shouldn't take long.
You wanna come inside, or...
Oh.
Better you come to the station with us.
Cleaner.
Okay.
I gotta be back by 6:00.
There's...
I got an appointment.
Oh, sure, we'll have you back.
Look, I understand you got threads to pull.
I'm on the job, too, in probationary guise, but, still, we're both officers of the court.
Got yourself fired yesterday is how I heard it.
Just now at your office.
That's...
Okay, I'm taking a little time.
Continuing my education, exploring a few...
'Cause it hit me one day.
You know, what if I could do more good in, like, a lawyer capacity?
You're going to law school?
Not, you know, officially, but...
Met with Mr. Feltz?
Sy Feltz?
He runs your brother's...
Oh, yeah, that's...
Like I said, there's no hard feelings there.
Just a minor traffic skirmish.
You're saying Mr. Feltz was the driver of the offending vehicle?
No.
Why?
What did he say?
Look, it's a family matter is my philosophy.
Whatever past disagreements, bygones.
You know?
Think of Jesus, His actions.
So, there's bad blood between you and Mr. Feltz?
- No, I wouldn't say...
- What about between you and...
- What's the brother's name?
- Emmit.
Right, Emmit.
Emmit Stussy, who lives in Eden Prairie?
Did Sy...
Has he been making accusations?
'Cause I got...
Literally, my conscience is clear.
- Your conscience?
- Right.
I'm saying if we're being honest here and not to cast aspersions, but I've seen a lot of snakes in my day, and that man is a scorpion.
So, whatever he told you,
I'd take that with a huge sack of salt.
Maybe if you tell us how your car came to be damaged.
Like I said, it was an accident.
He backed into your Corvette two times.
Mr. Feltz.
He's...
There's jealousy there, how close we are.
Me and Emmit, our bond.
So, you're saying there's no beef with Emmit?
There's no bad blood?
No.
Emmit, we're...
I was best man at his wedding.
And his daughter's wedding, they had it in, uh, Mexico.
The invitation said "no shoes."
Can you imagine a wedding with no shoes?
Tell me more about your man, Maurice LeFay.
Well, he's not my...
Just a number on a file, uh, one of the faceless masses.
Blew his piss test, like I said.
Uh, I would have rounded him up, except air-conditioner.
And, um, just so I'm clear, when's the last time you...
One sec.
- We said 6:00, yeah?
- Yeah.
- No.
- Sheriff, before you...
I talked to Donny, let it go.
He told me what you're up to.
We're not up to anything, there's a suspect in the box.
A suspect of what?
Winnie Lopez, St. Cloud Metro.
We got a conflagration of names here.
Your victim, Ennis Stussy, Eden Valley, was murdered by the parolee of Ray Stussy, currently in the box, whose brother, Emmit Stussy, lives in Eden Prairie.
- And?
- And, there's bad blood between the brothers, a run-in, one vehicle against another.
So, we're thinking things escalated.
Ray hires the ex-con to...
Listen to me.
There's a girl in England.
Nine years old.
Laura Buxton, she's got a red balloon.
She ties a note to it.
"If found, please return to Laura Buxton,"
and her address.
She lets it go.
Damn thing flies 30, 40, 50 miles, comes down in a field.
The words found by another little girl, also nine, also named, wait for it, Laura Buxton.
That's...
A true story.
These things happen all the time.
Coincidence, random life.
Okay.
Here's another story.
Once upon a time, a guy named Stussy hired an idiot to rob his brother, and the idiot drove to the wrong town and killed the wrong Stussy.
I hate that story.
You know why?
You can't prove it.
Now, pack him up and get him out of here.
We got work to do.
How's your wife?
My wife?
Please thank her for dinner the other night.
Those pork chops were delightful.
I, uh...
Yeah, she's a hell of a cook.
I'm not sure we can trust the Jew.
- Who?
- Feltz.
There's been some sneaking around.
Do you trust him?
Sy?
Some people think he's colluding with your brother.
What?
Who?
People talk, that's all I'm saying.
People you don't want to be talking.
I heard he broke into your bank.
Sy?
Raymond.
Access to a safety deposit box, et cetera, and, now, he would've needed a key, and where he might've gotten one?
An insider.
No, that's...
Buck drilled the lock is what Sy said.
Is what Sy says.
Or either, it's possible that your consigliere making a move and he's using your brother as a diversion, or worse, a straw man after all.
The name on the marquee is "Stussy Lots,"
but nowhere does it specify which Stussy.
That's...
He's...
I talked to Sy.
He's onboard, all in with this, with us.
Trust me.
And he hates, trust me, hates Ray.
Wishes I'd cut him out a long time ago.
Look.
We are making a souffle here.
Do you understand?
Lines of credit, capital acquisition, increased valuation.
It's how you turn a small business into a big business.
And it is fluffy, and it is delicious.
But you can't agitate while it rises, otherwise...
Poof.
It's...
He...
He knows it's not Sy, that this isn't...
He just wants to protect me.
From success?
I'll talk to him.
That's all I ask.
Any calls?
I left the slips on your desk.
Also, there's a man waiting to see you.
Mr. Stussy.
I'm Agent Dollard from the IRS.
That's...
What is this about?
Just a routine visit, or...
Well, maybe we could go to your office?
Great.
It's, uh, right back here.
- Do you mind if I...
- Please.
So, you said that this was just a routine drop in, or...
Yes.
And, no.
Routine, in that we make these kind of calls all the time, so routine for me.
You made a withdrawal in the amount of $10,000 cash earlier this week.
- Motherfucker.
- Excuse me?
- What?
- You said?
Since when was it a crime for a citizen, a tax paying citizen to use their own money?
No, sir, it's not a crime.
Not exactly.
But, uh, any transaction, deposit or withdrawal greater than $9,999.99, it triggers an alarm with us.
An alarm?
Not an actual alarm like at a fire station, that would be funny.
Spinning light, maybe get a pole.
No, it's more of an alert, a computer alert.
So, I've been dispatched by HQ to ask a few questions.
They're simple questions.
Maybe take a look at your books.
My books?
Think of it like...
You been to the airport?
Recently?
In life, I'm saying you've been to an airport?
Yes.
Well, sometimes at the airport, when you go through the detector, the metal detector, or the radiographic scan, you get selected for additional screening, a pat down.
Maybe they swab your hands for explosives residue.
- What?
- Residue.
To make sure you haven't been, you know, building a bomb.
What are we talking about here?
Nobody's been building any...
No, of course not.
That's what I'm saying.
But because of your withdrawal, which I am required by law to question, you've been selected for additional review.
Screening, minimally invasive, day surgery, versus, say, having your colon removed.
Little IRS humor.
Isn't this...
Uh...
Don't you need a warrant for this?
Oh, no, sir, that's the FBI.
Uh, this is more of an informal kick-the-tires and all that, so that we can avert an actual audit.
An audit?
Are you crazy?
Sir?
It's...
We...
- I'm sorry.
- Sure.
Our records are pristine, our books.
You could eat off them if that was your...
And that other gentleman in the next office, that would be Mr., uh...
Feltz?
It might be.
Sir?
No.
Uh, Mr. Feltz is off today.
Family matter.
Oh, I see.
Well, I would need to talk to him as well, and any other senior members of your staff.
How many partners do you have?
Just how much time...
Like I said, this is just a baby step.
I'll park myself in an office, you know, do a few interviews, maybe look over your books.
An office?
Exactly.
Or a conference room, if that's easier.
Heck, I spent three months in the mailroom of a novelty store once surrounded by plastic poop and rubber vomit, so it doesn't have to be the Riviera.
Okay.
Not a problem.
I know just where to put you.
Oh, good.
Well, I appreciate it.
Shall we say 8:00 AM?
How about 7:30?
Perfect.
I'll see you then.
You betcha.
Is he married?
What?
Was he wearing a ring?
Did he mention kids?
That can be used.
I have no idea what you're saying to me right now.
We can't...
The jig is up.
This isn't...
He's gonna park himself in an office.
An office!
Days, weeks, asking questions, reviewing the books.
He asked to see the books?
Yes.
That's all right.
We'll show him the fake ones.
That's...
Wait.
We have fake books?
Let's go deeper.
Away from the road.
Forty grand.
That, plus the 10 you stole, puts it 50.
My thought, then, is you should leave the state.
Two hundred.
And we want the stamp.
For what?
It's the principle.
What's this?
Nothing.
Something else.
It's okay, I got it.
Sy, Sy...
What's the matter, buddy?
You drank from the holy cup, but here you are.
Not being a good boy.
This isn't that.
I'm sorry.
Who are you?
What?
He said pretty girls should only open their mouths
- when they see a dick.
- Oh.
And, just so I'm clear, which one of you is the dick?
Enough.
I'm handling this.
Okay.
Have you been to Siberia?
Have I been to Siberia, is that the question?
It's very much like this.
Except the dirt.
The earth soaking in blood, frozen red.
All of Russia.
Hundreds of years, millions the tsar killed, then it was Lenin, then Stalin.
Ten thousand, 20,000.
But here you have, like, what?
Malls.
Few dead Indians.
Twenty million Russian died fighting Hitler, 20 million.
I see from your face that you can't even imagine that.
The pogroms, the starvation, 20 million more.
Mothers cooking and eating their babies.
That's why the snow falls white.
To hide the blood.
I'm leaving.
Ahh!
No!
You don't have to...
This is what comes after the cup.
Babe, I'm...
Phew.
Had a little scare for a minute.
The police, which...
I don't have to tell you, got my heart going real good.
But all fine now.
Babe?
Babe?
Nikki, what...
Honey?
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
Honey?
Can you hear me?
Nikki?
Come on.
Honey?
Baby?
Baby, what happened?
What happened?
(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING)
MAC DAVIS:
Back a few months ago,
I was headlinin' a great big nightclub, and they put me up a couple days early.
I came in a couple days early, and they put me up in what they call the "Star Suite."
Now here I am, headlining' in one of the biggest nightclubs in the country, and I wake up at 8:00 in the morning in this "Star Suite"
all by myself.

But I did what I've always done, man, to cheer myself up,
I picked up my guitar,

On the sofa, I thought, unless you're attached to a more classic bed narrative.
Non-descript, though, you know, the furnishings, so they can't tie it to us.
That's...
I think you solved it.
We can keep you in a shirt, hiding your difference.
Maybe in a cowgirl, or a doggy scenario, favoring our rears, in other words, keeping our faces slightly absurd.
"Obscured."
What did I say?
I'm glad we're doing this, babe.
Taking control.
This whole time, we've been playing to draw.
It's time we start playing to win.
I know, but blackmail...
We lost the high roller, babe.
Zip.
Gone.
I know, and I'm so sorry.
It's not your fault.
A day like you had,
I would have stopped for a sidecar, too.
I just lost track...
I know.
This thing with your brother has got us both upset.
To deprive a man of his career, endanger his female...
I panicked.
You're too hard on yourself.
You rallied, didn't you, in the end?
You're here.
We're together.
Maybe I can call the guy, the high roller,
- and say...
- What?
Really?
'Cause you lost your job at the parole board on account of banging your clients?
No, because I fell in love.
That's sweet.
You're sweet.
Hon.
Where did you go?
I...
Jesus!
I just love you so much.
No.
For Pete's sake, I'm wearing a hooker wig!
- Just hold on.
- Sorry.
No, just...
That's got to be bad luck.
Okay.
Now, go.
Babe, you're my everything.
I want we should spend the rest of our lives together.
You gotta ask.
Oh.

Yes, Raymond Stussy, I will marry you.

(BOTH MOANING)
What the goddamn hell?
You have a fat wife.
Excuse me?
Which part of what I just said is giving you trouble?
This is my office.
A fat woman is inherently untrustworthy as she is a sensualist who sees no real difference between a pastrami sandwich and a dick in the mouth.
There's no call for that kind of language.
No.
A female Jew is especially vulnerable to the zaftig seduction of the forbidden, being part animal.
What are you doing?
Ah!
Do you know what a chicken is?
- What?
- A chicken.
Do you know what a chicken is?
A chicken is an egg's way of making another egg.
You see, it's all a matter of perspective.
The chicken sees it one way, the egg another, so let's start again.
This is not your office, just as your wife would not be your wife if I came to her in the night with a platter of cold cuts.
YURI:
Sit down, my friend.
You have shock.
All is well.
I'm just...
I'm not...
I need a minute.
No problem, no problem.
VARGA:
Have a drink, you'll feel better.
No.
Are you out of your mind?
YURI:
Nice drink, refreshing.
Are you threatening me?

No, no, no, the whole thing.
(CHOKING)

VARGA:
Yuri tells me you spoke to the police yesterday.
You can ask her, she came to me.
Not about anything, but there was a...
One of our cars was...
Some kind of accident.
A fender bender.
So, you know, unconnected to this completely.
You may have, during the course of the day, a strong impulse to act.
It's perfectly normal, a man of your station being forced to play the cuckold.
But remember, it's all a matter of perspective.
What's happening here is good.
You and I are partners now.
Contracts have been signed by the majordomo himself.
So, you see, lives are changing for the better.
And all you have to do is review the accounts, write up the deals, and approve the paperwork.
Do you understand?
Ah.
Yuri will show you to your new office.
Don't forget your mug.

Yes, yes, he told me.
And I must admit, I'm curious.
(CORK POPS)
(LAUGHS)
Are you all right?
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
Uh...
Of course, I just...
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
I had an upsetting experience this morning.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
To be honest,
I feel as if I've left the known world.
(CHUCKLES)
You ever had that feeling?
Like you, uh, stepped off the map into the, well, unknown, I guess?
That's how I felt when my Torvald died.
Oh.
My husband made his first million in mortuaries.
SY:
Hmm.
"Everybody dies, Ruby," he told me,
"You can't just leave them on the sofa."
(SY LAUGHS)
One night, he was eating a three-pound lobster and he had a stroke, and with it, a revelation.
Self-storage, that was the future.
The two businesses are surprisingly similar when you think about it, a place to put the things you'll never use again.
He died last year.
Complications from polio.
For six months, I wore black and tore my sleeves.
And then, I had a revelation of my own.
Parking lots.
The final piece to the storage triptych.
People are always going to need a place to park.
Amen.
I'll be honest with you, Mr. Feltz.
At my age, I'm not looking for a partner.
My preference would be to acquire the entire company, Stussy Lots Ltd., and I would be happy to let you keep the name intact if that worries you.
A second choice would be to buy several lots independently and build the business that way, but let's be honest.
That would make me your competitor, and, as my late husband always used to say,
"You don't want a Goldfarb for an enemy."
- I'm sure that's true.
- Mmm.
It's interesting that you should come to us now.
Problems?
No, not problems.
More of a softening of the will.
You see, Emmit Stussy, whom you'll meet, is a great man, a philanthropist, a leader, and, of late, he's been talking with increased regularity about dedicating himself in total to his good works,
i.e., the betterment of mankind.
Now, I suggested he take a step back and allow me to run the day-to-day, but he seems adamant that we stick together.
Pre-schools in Mumbai, health clinics in Inner Mongolia, better access to veterinary care.
And after all, how much money does one man need?
A lot, actually.
Women, more so.
And you'd be okay with that, selling a business that you worked so hard to build?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
I'm sorry.
There's... _
Uh... (STAMMERS) I forgot a very important...
We're closing on a new line of credit, and my girl got my calendar confused.
You go ahead.
Play hard to get.
(CHUCKLES) No, no, no, that's not...
Easy to get.
Really.
I mean, at the right price.
But we should talk more.
Call my private line.

SY:
He's in my office.
He put his Schwanz in the mug Esther gave me.
I had to throw it away.
You said you were gonna fix this.
You swore he'd go away.
Oh, enough about your stupid brother!
We're in trouble here!
This is a...
Enemies are at the gates!
Inside the gates!
Fornicating with our cookware!
What is the point of you?
What?
The point.
What is the point of you?
You're supposed to be a fixer.
Nothing's fixed.
Everything's broken.
They sent my wife a sex tape.
Why would your wife wanna watch your brother have sex?
Not him, dummy, me!
Ray, in a wig, pretending to...
He shaved his mustache!
He and that... whore.
And you were supposed to stop them!
Don't come here moaning about, "We're in trouble."
Who was the one who found Ermentraub, the go-between which led to Varga?
Where was the diligence, the due diligence?
You said...
I wanted to go deeper, but you said...
"Enemies at the gates," who let them in?
I never.
You need to unchain me.
If I was free, my hands, I could...
Your brother wouldn't bother us again.
It's the Delilah.
This floozy is pushing him, putting ideas in his head.
And now, they think, my family, that I'm some kind of...
When all I ever did was...
And there's...
Look at me, there's good inside, a good person.
Of course there is.
Think of the children, the lives you help.
I'm not some kind of weakling that can't control his...
Twenty-five years, and never once did I look at a woman sideways.
Sit-down meetings with the doors open, professional always.
You're a model, a role model.
I look up to you.
Everyone I know.
You've gotta fix this.
Whatever it takes.
Shackles off?
And throw away the key.

Not...
Okay.
I can't...
So, nope, say it again?
(SIGHS) I'm saying Maurice, the fellow with his head caved in, it wasn't a random robbery.
He was hired by another fellow to rob somebody.
His brother.
Maurice's brother?
No, the brother of the fella that hired Maurice, both named Stussy.
- Like your stepdad.
- Exactly.
Probably gave Maurice an address for the brother, except he lost it.
Or forgot it, at which point,
Maurice makes the wrong choice.
Drives to the wrong town, takes a name out of the phone book.
Also Stussy.
And you know what happens next.
New chief's not gonna like this.
(SIGHS) He doesn't have to like it, it's factual, we think.
Makes more sense than the other at least.
DONNY:
He's still not gonna like it.
Well, you don't have to like the truth for it to be true.
You sure?
We're gonna visit the parole office today either way, face the hiring brother.
And see if you can't track down this Vanessa who rented the apartment that lost an air-conditioner.
I'm thinking they might be connected.
What do you think?

Don't you think it'd be more comfortable?

Are we worth less?
You and me, our value, I'm saying, to the world?
What makes him rich, and us not?
Larceny.
Your brother stole from you, your birthright, like the snake in the garden, and then he built this falsehood.
Self-made man, my ass.
That business is your business, that mansion is your mansion on account of the stamps.
What he used to build this empire.
What's fair here is complete surrender.
We're compromising by asking for 100 grand.

What did you think was gonna happen?
Tears, were there?
She left, and took the mother-in-law.
So, whatever leverage you think you have...
He's gonna pay.
For what?
She left.
The way we figure it, that's money owed for startup fees.
Collateral Ray put down as a youth.
He's part owner in the enterprise, in other words.
We're not gonna stop till we get what's ours.
We should meet, you and me, hammer out an end to this.
The end is, you pay.
SY:
She watched the tape.
Asshole.
Asshole.
She watched the tape.
So, she believes, right now, her husband slipping dick to a redhead is a true story?
Factual?
We were asking 100 grand to keep her from knowing, now I'm saying 200 grand to tell her the other truth.
There is no other truth.
You sure about that?
We got video evidence
Emmit's screwing his secretary.
It's a fact.
It never happened!
That doesn't make it any less of a fact.
And I'm saying the price to convince her of the other truth is 200 grand.
Stussy Lot 350, one hour.
Baby, look at you.
Is it all right?
It's amazing.
I gotta do a girl thing.
I'll see you at home later?
You want me to come?

Got yourself fired yesterday is how I heard it.
Just now at your office.
That's...
Okay, I'm taking a little time.
Continuing my education, exploring a few...
'Cause it hit me one day.
You know, what if I could do more good in, like, a lawyer capacity?
You're going to law school?
Not, you know, officially, but...
Met with Mr. Feltz?
Sy Feltz?
He runs your brother's...
Oh, yeah, that's...
Like I said, there's no hard feelings there.
Just a minor traffic skirmish.
WINNIE:
You're saying Mr. Feltz was the driver of the offending vehicle?
No.
Why?
What did he say?
Look, it's a family matter is my philosophy.
Whatever past disagreements, bygones.
You know?
Think of Jesus, His actions.
So, there's bad blood between you and Mr. Feltz?
- No, I wouldn't say...
- What about between you and...
- What's the brother's name?
- Emmit.
Right, Emmit.
Emmit Stussy, who lives in Eden Prairie?
Did Sy...
Has he been making accusations?
'Cause I got...
Literally, my conscience is clear.
- Your conscience?
- Right.
I'm saying if we're being honest here and not to cast aspersions, but I've seen a lot of snakes in my day, and that man is a scorpion.
So, whatever he told you,
I'd take that with a huge sack of salt.
Maybe if you tell us how your car came to be damaged.
Like I said, it was an accident.
WINNIE:
He backed into your Corvette two times.
Mr. Feltz.
He's...
(SIGHS)
There's jealousy there, how close we are.
Me and Emmit, our bond.
So, you're saying there's no beef with Emmit?
There's no bad blood?
No.
Emmit, we're...
I was best man at his wedding.
And his daughter's wedding, they had it in, uh, Mexico.
The invitation said "no shoes."
Can you imagine a wedding with no shoes?
(WOMEN LAUGHING)
Tell me more about your man, Maurice LeFay.
Well, he's not my...
(SIGHS)
Just a number on a file, uh, one of the faceless masses.
Blew his piss test, like I said.
Uh, I would have rounded him up, except air-conditioner.
And, um, just so I'm clear, when's the last time you... (KNOCK ON DOOR)
One sec.
- We said 6:00, yeah?
- Yeah.
- No.
- Sheriff, before you...
I talked to Donny, let it go.
He told me what you're up to.
We're not up to anything, there's a suspect in the box.
A suspect of what?
Winnie Lopez, St. Cloud Metro.
We got a conflagration of names here.
Your victim, Ennis Stussy, Eden Valley, was murdered by the parolee of Ray Stussy, currently in the box, whose brother, Emmit Stussy, lives in Eden Prairie.
- And?
- And, there's bad blood between the brothers, a run-in, one vehicle against another.
So, we're thinking things escalated.
Ray hires the ex-con to...
Listen to me.
There's a girl in England.
Nine years old.
Laura Buxton, she's got a red balloon.
She ties a note to it.
"If found, please return to Laura Buxton,"
and her address.
She lets it go.
Damn thing flies 30, 40, 50 miles, comes down in a field.
The words found by another little girl, also nine, also named, wait for it, Laura Buxton.
That's...
A true story.
These things happen all the time.
Coincidence, random life.
Okay.
Here's another story.
Once upon a time, a guy named Stussy hired an idiot to rob his brother, and the idiot drove to the wrong town and killed the wrong Stussy.
I hate that story.
You know why?
You can't prove it.
Now, pack him up and get him out of here.
We got work to do.
(VARGA SIGHS)
How's your wife?
My wife?
Please thank her for dinner the other night.
Those pork chops were delightful.
I, uh...
Yeah, she's a hell of a cook.
I'm not sure we can trust the Jew.
- Who?
- Feltz.
There's been some sneaking around.
Do you trust him?
Sy?
Some people think he's colluding with your brother.
What?
Who?
People talk, that's all I'm saying.
People you don't want to be talking.
I heard he broke into your bank.
Sy?
Raymond.
Access to a safety deposit box, et cetera, and, now, he would've needed a key, and where he might've gotten one?
An insider.
No, that's...
Buck drilled the lock is what Sy said.
Is what Sy says.
Or either, it's possible that your consigliere making a move and he's using your brother as a diversion, or worse, a straw man after all.
The name on the marquee is "Stussy Lots,"
but nowhere does it specify which Stussy.
That's...
He's...
I talked to Sy.
He's onboard, all in with this, with us.
Trust me.
And he hates, trust me, hates Ray.
Wishes I'd cut him out a long time ago.
Look.
We are making a souffle here.
Do you understand?
Lines of credit, capital acquisition, increased valuation.
It's how you turn a small business into a big business.
And it is fluffy, and it is delicious.
But you can't agitate while it rises, otherwise...
Poof.
It's...
He...
He knows it's not Sy, that this isn't...
He just wants to protect me.
From success?
I'll talk to him.
That's all I ask.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Any calls?
RECEPTIONIST:
I left the slips on your desk.
Also, there's a man waiting to see you.
Oh.
Mr. Stussy.
I'm Agent Dollard from the IRS.
EMMIT:
That's...
What is this about?
Just a routine visit, or...
Well, maybe we could go to your office?
Great.
It's, uh, right back here.
- Do you mind if I...
- Please.
- (EMMIT CLEARS THROAT) - (UNLATCHES SUITCASE)
So, you said that this was just a routine drop in, or... (CHUCKLES) Yes.
And, no.
Routine, in that we make these kind of calls all the time, so routine for me.
(CHUCKLES)
You made a withdrawal in the amount of $10,000 cash earlier this week.
- Motherfucker.
- Excuse me?
- What?
- You said?
Since when was it a crime for a citizen, a tax paying citizen to use their own money?
No, sir, it's not a crime.
Not exactly.
But, uh, any transaction, deposit or withdrawal greater than $9,999.99, it triggers an alarm with us.
An alarm?
Not an actual alarm like at a fire station, that would be funny.
Spinning light, maybe get a pole.
No, it's more of an alert, a computer alert.
So, I've been dispatched by HQ to ask a few questions.
They're simple questions.
Maybe take a look at your books.
My books?
Think of it like...
You been to the airport?
Recently?
In life, I'm saying you've been to an airport?
Yes.
Well, sometimes at the airport, when you go through the detector, the metal detector, or the radiographic scan, you get selected for additional screening, a pat down.
Maybe they swab your hands for explosives residue.
- What?
- Residue.
To make sure you haven't been, you know, building a bomb.
What are we talking about here?
Nobody's been building any...
No, of course not.
That's what I'm saying.
But because of your withdrawal, which I am required by law to question, you've been selected for additional review.
Screening, minimally invasive, day surgery, versus, say, having your colon removed.
Little IRS humor.
Isn't this...
Uh...
Don't you need a warrant for this?
Oh, no, sir, that's the FBI.
Uh, this is more of an informal kick-the-tires and all that, so that we can avert an actual audit.
An audit?
Are you crazy?
Sir?
It's...
We...
- I'm sorry.
- Sure.
Our records are pristine, our books.
You could eat off them if that was your...
And that other gentleman in the next office, that would be Mr., uh...
Feltz?
It might be.
Sir?
No.
Uh, Mr. Feltz is off today.
Family matter.
Oh, I see.
Well, I would need to talk to him as well, and any other senior members of your staff.
How many partners do you have?
Just how much time...
Like I said, this is just a baby step.
I'll park myself in an office, you know, do a few interviews, maybe look over your books.
An office?
Exactly.
Or a conference room, if that's easier.
Heck, I spent three months in the mailroom of a novelty store once surrounded by plastic poop and rubber vomit, so it doesn't have to be the Riviera.
Okay.
Not a problem.
Uh...
I know just where to put you.
- Oh, good.
- (LAUGHS)
(EMMIT CLEARS THROAT)
(UNLATCHES SUITCASE)
Well, I appreciate it.
Shall we say 8:00 AM?
How about 7:30?
Perfect.
I'll see you then.
You betcha.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Is he married?
What?
Was he wearing a ring?
Did he mention kids?
That can be used.
I have no idea what you're saying to me right now.
We can't...
The jig is up.
This isn't...
He's gonna park himself in an office.
An office!
Days, weeks, asking questions, reviewing the books.
He asked to see the books?
Yes.
That's all right.
We'll show him the fake ones.
That's...
Wait.
We have fake books?
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
Let's go deeper.
Away from the road.
Forty grand.
That, plus the 10 you stole, puts it 50.
My thought, then, is you should leave the state.
(SCOFFS)
Two hundred.
And we want the stamp.
For what?
It's the principle.
What's this?
Nothing.
Something else.
It's okay, I got it.
(CLICKING TONGUE) Sy, Sy...
What's the matter, buddy?
You drank from the holy cup, but here you are.
Not being a good boy.
SY:
This isn't that.
I'm sorry.
Who are you?
(SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)
What?
He said pretty girls should only open their mouths
- when they see a dick.
- Oh.
And, just so I'm clear, which one of you is the dick?
- (YURI LAUGHING)
- Enough.
I'm handling this.
Okay.
Have you been to Siberia?
Have I been to Siberia, is that the question?
It's very much like this.
Except the dirt.
The earth soaking in blood, frozen red.
All of Russia.
Hundreds of years, millions the tsar killed, then it was Lenin, then Stalin.
Ten thousand, 20,000.
(IMITATES GUNSHOTS)
But here you have, like, what?
Malls.
Few dead Indians.
Twenty million Russian died fighting Hitler, 20 million.
I see from your face that you can't even imagine that.
The pogroms, the starvation, 20 million more.
Mothers cooking and eating their babies.
That's why the snow falls white.
To hide the blood.
(SCOFFS)
I'm leaving.
Ahh!
No!

You don't have to... (CONTINUES GROANING)

Had a little scare for a minute.
The police, which...
I don't have to tell you, got my heart going real good.
But all fine now.
Babe?
Babe?
Nikki, what...
Honey?
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
Honey?
Can you hear me?
Nikki?
Come on.
Honey?
Baby?
Baby, what happened?
What happened?
(♪ SHIP OF FOOLS ♪)
Back a few months ago,
I was headlinin' a great big nightclub, and they put me up a couple days early.
I came in a couple days early, and they put me up in what they call the "star suite."
Now here I am, headlining' in one of the biggest nightclubs in the country, and I wake up at 8:00 in the morning in this "star suite"
all by myself.
Aw!
Yeah, that's what I said, "aw."
But I did what I've always done, man, to cheer myself up,
I picked up my guitar,
I sat down, and I wrote me a little song.
Now this is how it feels to be alone at the top of the hill, tryin' to figure out why.
Can't wait to look in the mirror.
Help me out now, come on.
To know me is to what?
Must be a hell of a man.
Lord, it's hard.
When you're doing what?
One more time.
What are we doing?
Yeah, emmit!
Yeah!
Nail me, emmit, harder.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Emmit!
Yeah!
Don't stop!
Emmit!
On the sofa, I thought, unless you're attached to a more classic bed narrative.
Nondescript, though, you know, the furnishings, so they can't tie it to us.
That's...
I think you solved it.
We can keep you in a shirt, hiding your difference.
Maybe in a cowgirl, or a doggy scenario, favoring our rears, in other words, keeping our faces slightly absurd.
"Obscured."
What did I say?
I'm glad we're doing this, babe.
Taking control.
This whole time, we've been playing to draw.
It's time we start playing to win.
I know, but blackmail...
We lost the high roller, babe.
Zip.
Gone.
I know, and I'm so sorry.
It's not your fault.
A day like you had,
I would have stopped for a sidecar, too.
I just lost track...
I know.
This thing with your brother has got us both upset.
To deprive a man of his career, endanger his female...
I panicked.
You're too hard on yourself.
You rallied, didn't you, in the end?
You're here.
We're together.
Maybe I can call the guy, the high roller,
- and say...
- What?
Really?
'Cause you lost your job at the parole board on account of banging your clients?
No, because I fell in love.
That's sweet.
You're sweet.
Hon.
Where did you go?
I...
Jesus!
I just love you so much.
No.
For Pete's sake, I'm wearing a hooker wig!
- Just hold on.
- Sorry.
No, just...
That's got to be bad luck.
Okay.
Now, go.
Babe, you're my everything.
I want we should spend the rest of our lives together.
You gotta ask.
Right.
Nikki swango, will you marry me?
Yes, Raymond stussy, I will marry you.
Come here.
You've made me the happiest woman ever.
Now, let's make a sex tape.
Hey, hon.
You...
Stella?
What is it, honey?
I'll...
No!
Now, hold on!
Don't make a scene, daddy.
Yeah, Mr. stussy.
I saw the tape.
It's disgusting.
I didn't...
Baby!
Baby, I didn't...
I wouldn't!
Swear to Christ!
Stella...
Ma says to tell you, "don't call."
Stella!
Nail me, emmit, harder.
Yeah!
Emmit, emmit, nail me, emmit!
What the goddamn hell?
You have a fat wife.
Excuse me?
Which part of what I just said is giving you trouble?
This is my office.
A fat woman is inherently untrustworthy as she is a sensualist who sees no real difference between a pastrami sandwich and a dick in the mouth.
There's no call for that kind of language.
No.
A female Jew is especially vulnerable to the zaftig seduction of the forbidden, being part animal.
What are you doing?
Do you know what a chicken is?
- What?
- A chicken.
Do you know what a chicken is?
A chicken is an egg's way of making another egg.
You see, it's all a matter of perspective.
The chicken sees it one way, the egg another, so let's start again.
This is not your office, just as your wife would not be your wife if I came to her in the night with a platter of cold cuts.
Sit down, my friend.
You have shock.
All is well.
I'm just...
I'm not...
I need a minute.
No problem, no problem.
Have a drink, you'll feel better.
No.
Are you out of your mind?
Nice drink, refreshing.
Are you threatening me?
No, no, no, the whole thing.
Yuri tells me you spoke to the police yesterday.
You can ask her, she came to me.
Not about anything, but there was a...
One of our cars was...
Some kind of accident.
A Fender bender.
So, you know, unconnected to this completely.
You may have, during the course of the day, a strong impulse to act.
It's perfectly normal, a man of your station being forced to play the cuckold.
But remember, it's all a matter of perspective.
What's happening here is good.
You and I are partners now.
Contracts have been signed by the majordomo himself.
So, you see, lives are changing for the better.
And all you have to do is review the accounts, write up the deals, and approve the paperwork.
Do you understand?
Yuri will show you to your new office.
Don't forget your mug.
Emmit?
It's worse than we thought.
What we talked about.
The thing... are you...
Did they hurt you?
To get you to sign, I'm saying.
Did they...
You...
Emmit?
Emmit?
Mrs. goldfarb.
You must be sy.
I am so glad we finally get to meet.
I've been pinching buck's ear every time I see him.
Yes, yes, he told me.
And I must admit, I'm curious.
Are you all right?
Of course, I just...
I had an upsetting experience this morning.
To be honest,
I feel as if I've left the known world.
You ever had that feeling?
Like you, stepped off the map into the, well, unknown, I guess?
That's how I felt when my torvald died.
My husband made his first million in mortuaries.
"Everybody dies, Ruby," he told me,
"you can't just leave them on the sofa."
One night, he was eating a threepound lobster and he had a stroke, and with it, a revelation.
Selfstorage, that was the future.
The two businesses are surprisingly similar when you think about it, a place to put the things you'll never use again.
He died last year.
Complications from polio.
For six months, I wore black and tore my sleeves.
And then, I had a revelation of my own.
Parking lots.
The final piece to the storage triptych.
People are always going to need a place to park.
Amen.
I'll be honest with you, Mr. feltz.
At my age, I'm not looking for a partner.
My preference would be to acquire the entire company, stussy lots ltd., and I would be happy to let you keep the name intact if that worries you.
A second choice would be to buy several lots independently and build the business that way, but let's be honest.
That would make me your competitor, and, as my late husband always used to say,
"you don't want a goldfarb for an enemy."
I'm sure that's true.
It's interesting that you should come to us now.
Problems?
No, not problems.
More of a softening of the will.
You see, emmit stussy, whom you'll meet, is a great man, a philanthropist, a leader, and, of late, he's been talking with increased regularity about dedicating himself in total to his good works,
the betterment of mankind.
Now, I suggested he take a step back and allow me to run the daytoday, but he seems adamant that we stick together.
Preschools in Mumbai, health clinics in inner Mongolia, better access to veterinary care.
And after all, how much money does one man need?
A lot, actually.
Women, more so.
And you'd be okay with that, selling a business that you worked so hard to build?
I'm sorry.
There's...
I forgot a very important...
We're closing on a new line of credit, and my girl got my calendar confused.
You go ahead.
Play hard to get.
No, no, no, that's not...
Easy to get.
Really.
I mean, at the right price.
But we should talk more.
Call my private line.
The office isn't safe.
I mean, the lines are down.
Hello?
Emmit!
Emmit!
Hello?
Emmit?
She left.
Did you sign partnership papers?
Did you make varga a partner in our firm?
I didn't think it was possible.
The evil of this man.
My brother.
My brother.
He's in my office.
He put his schwanz in the mug Esther gave me.
I had to throw it away.
You said you were gonna fix this.
You swore he'd go away.
Enough about your stupid brother!
We're in trouble here!
This is a...
Enemies are at the gates!
Inside the gates!
Fornicating with our cookware!
What is the point of you?
What?
The point.
What is the point of you?
You're supposed to be a fixer.
Nothing's fixed.
Everything's broken.
They sent my wife a sex tape.
Why would your wife wanna watch your brother have sex?
Not him, dummy, me!
Ray, in a wig, pretending to...
He shaved his mustache!
He and that... whore.
And you were supposed to stop them!
Don't come here moaning about, "we're in trouble."
Who was the one who found ermentraub, the gobetween which led to varga?
Where was the diligence, the due diligence?
You said...
I wanted to go deeper, but you said...
"Enemies at the gates," who let them in?
I never.
You need to unchain me.
If I was free, my hands, I could...
Your brother wouldn't bother us again.
It's the Delilah.
This floozy is pushing him, putting ideas in his head.
And now, they think, my family, that I'm some kind of...
When all I ever did was...
And there's...
Look at me, there's good inside, a good person.
Of course there is.
Think of the children, the lives you help.
I'm not some kind of weakling that can't control his...
Twentyfive years, and never once did I look at a woman sideways.
Sitdown meetings with the doors open, professional always.
You're a model, a role model.
I look up to you.
Everyone I know.
You've gotta fix this.
Whatever it takes.
Shackles off?
And throw away the key.
I met with the widow goldfarb...
Not...
Okay.
I can't...
So, nope, say it again?
I'm saying Maurice, the fellow with his head caved in, it wasn't a random robbery.
He was hired by another fellow to rob somebody.
His brother.
Maurice's brother?
No, the brother of the fella that hired Maurice, both named stussy.
- Like your stepdad.
- Exactly.
Probably gave Maurice an address for the brother, except he lost it.
Or forgot it, at which point,
Maurice makes the wrong choice.
Drives to the wrong town, takes a name out of the phone book.
Also stussy.
And you know what happens next.
New chief's not gonna like this.
He doesn't have to like it, it's factual, we think.
Makes more sense than the other at least.
He's still not gonna like it.
Well, you don't have to like the truth for it to be true.
You sure?
We're gonna visit the parole office today either way, face the hiring brother.
And see if you can't track down this Vanessa who rented the apartment that lost an airconditioner.
I'm thinking they might be connected.
What do you think?
Bigger size.
Don't you think it'd be more comfortable?
Yeah?
We have something in a 44.
We'll try that.
You're sweating.
It's just...
It's a lot of money, 100 grand.
Are you sure?
I mean, we could ask for less...
Are we worth less?
You and me, our value, I'm saying, to the world?
What makes him rich, and us not?
Larceny.
Your brother stole from you, your birthright, like the snake in the garden, and then he built this falsehood.
Selfmade man, my ass.
That business is your business, that mansion is your mansion on account of the stamps.
What he used to build this empire.
What's fair here is complete surrender.
We're compromising by asking for 100 grand.
He is getting off easy.
Here you go.
Yeah.
You got me.
Congratulations, you're officially the stupidest person alive.
Who is this?
It's menachem begin.
Who do you think it is?
You made a sex tape and gave it straight to the wife.
No...
You left it on the stoop.
Three people live in that house.
What did you think was gonna happen?
Tears, were there?
She left, and took the motherinlaw.
So, whatever leverage you think you have...
He's gonna pay.
For what?
She left.
The way we figure it, that's money owed for startup fees.
Collateral ray put down as a youth.
He's part owner in the enterprise, in other words.
We're not gonna stop till we get what's ours.
We should meet, you and me, hammer out an end to this.
The end is, you pay.
She watched the tape.
Asshole.
Asshole.
She watched the tape.
So, she believes, right now, her husband slipping dick to a redhead is a true story?
Factual?
We were asking100 grand to keep her from knowing, now I'm saying 200 grand to tell her the other truth.
There is no other truth.
You sure about that?
We got video evidence emmit's screwing his secretary.
It's a fact.
It never happened!
That doesn't make it any less of a fact.
And I'm saying the price to convince her of the other truth is 200 grand.
Stussy lot 350, one hour.
Baby, look at you.
Is it all right?
It's amazing.
I gotta do a girl thing.
I'll see you at home later?
You want me to come?
It's not like I gotta work.
You're sweet.
What do you want?
You're dead, do you hear me?
I'm dead?
That's...
You got some nerve after...
She saw it!
Stella, the tape.
Big whoop, I'm out of a job.
She left me.
Well, you know, reap what you sow.
You should've done what's right when you had the chance.
Buddy, when I'm done with you, they'll be sponging you off the floor.
Yeah?
You'll be in the poor house making soup out of your dirty socks.
Fuck you.
Me?
Is that... is that what you're saying?
Fuck me?
You wanna fuck me?
I'll tattoo it on my fist and come over there!
Stuffed and mounted like a goddamn...
Yeah, fuck you!
So, if you know what's good for you, pay the damn money and pray that I'm satisfied!
Hello?
God damn it!
My mom.
Mr. stussy!
Chief burgle, we met yesterday.
You know officer Lopez.
What's...
We just had a few more questions.
I thought you said you weren't together?
We had an intersection of interest.
Shouldn't take long.
You wanna come inside, or...
Better you come to the station with us.
Cleaner.
Okay.
I gotta be back by 6:00.
There's...
I got an appointment.
Sure, we'll have you back.
Look, I understand you got threads to pull.
I'm on the job, too, in probationary guise, but, still, we're both officers of the court.
Got yourself fired yesterday is how I heard it.
Just now at your office.
That's...
Okay, I'm taking a little time.
Continuing my education, exploring a few...
'Cause it hit me one day.
You know, what if I could do more good in, like, a lawyer capacity?
You're going to law school?
Not, you know, officially, but...
Met with Mr. feltz?
Sy feltz?
He runs your brother's...
Yeah, that's...
Like I said, there's no hard feelings there.
Just a minor traffic skirmish.
You're saying Mr. feltz was the driver of the offending vehicle?
No.
Why?
What did he say?
Look, it's a family matter is my philosophy.
Whatever past disagreements, bygones.
You know?
Think of Jesus, his actions.
So, there's bad blood between you and Mr. feltz?
- No, I wouldn't say...
- What about between you and...
- What's the brother's name?
- Emmit.
Right, emmit.
Emmit stussy, who lives in Eden prairie?
Did sy... has he been making accusations?
'Cause I got...
literally, my conscience is clear.
- Your conscience?
- Right.
I'm saying if we're being honest here and not to cast aspersions, but I've seen a lot of snakes in my day, and that man is a scorpion.
So, whatever he told you,
I'd take that with a huge sack of salt.
Maybe if you tell us how your car came to be damaged.
Like I said, it was an accident.
He backed into your corvette two times.
Mr. feltz.
He's...
There's jealousy there, how close we are.
Me and emmit, our bond.
So, you're saying there's no beef with emmit?
There's no bad blood?
No.
Emmit, we're...
I was best man at his wedding.
And his daughter's wedding, they had it in, Mexico.
The invitation said "no shoes."
Can you imagine a wedding with no shoes?
Tell me more about your man, Maurice lefay.
Well, he's not my...
Just a number on a file, one of the faceless masses.
Blew his piss test, like I said.
I would have rounded him up, except airconditioner.
And, um, just so I'm clear, when's the last time you...
One sec.
- We said 6:00, yeah?
- Yeah.
- No.
- Sheriff, before you...
I talked to Donny, let it go.
He told me what you're up to.
We're not up to anything, there's a suspect in the box.
A suspect of what?
Winnie Lopez, St. cloud Metro.
We got a conflagration of names here.
Your victim, ennis stussy, Eden valley, was murdered by the parolee of ray stussy, currently in the box, whose brother, emmit stussy, lives in Eden prairie.
- And?
- And, there's bad blood between the brothers, a runin, one vehicle against another.
So, we're thinking things escalated.
Ray hires the excon to...
Listen to me.
There's a girl in england.
Nine years old.
Laura buxton, she's got a red balloon.
She ties a note to it.
"If found,"
"please return to Laura buxton,"
and her address.
She lets it go.
Damn thing flies 30, 40, 50 miles, comes down in a field.
The words found by another little girl, also nine, also named, wait for it, Laura buxton.
That's...
A true story.
These things happen all the time.
Coincidence, random life.
Okay.
Here's another story.
Once upon a time, a guy named stussy hired an idiot to rob his brother, and the idiot drove to the wrong town and killed the wrong stussy.
I hate that story.
You know why?
You can't prove it.
Now, pack him up and get him out of here.
We got work to do.
How's your wife?
My wife?
Please thank her for dinner the other night.
Those pork chops were delightful.
I...
Yeah, she's a hell of a cook.
I'm not sure we can trust the Jew.
- Who?
- Feltz.
There's been some sneaking around.
Do you trust him?
Sy?
Some people think he's colluding with your brother.
What?
Who?
People talk, that's all I'm saying.
People you don't want to be talking.
I heard he broke into your bank.
Sy?
Raymond.
Access to a safety deposit box, et cetera, and, now, he would've needed a key, and where he might've gotten one?
An insider.
No, that's...
Buck drilled the lock is what sy said.
Is what sy says.
Or either, it's possible that your consigliere making a move and he's using your brother as a diversion, or worse, a straw man after all.
The name on the marquee is "stussy lots,"
but nowhere does it specify which stussy.
That's... he's...
I talked to sy.
He's on board, all in with this, with us.
Trust me.
And he hates, trust me, hates ray.
Wishes I'd cut him out a long time ago.
Look.
We are making a souffle here.
Do you understand?
Lines of credit, capital acquisition, increased valuation.
It's how you turn a small business into a big business.
And it is fluffy, and it is delicious.
But you can't agitate while it rises, otherwise...
Poof.
It's... he...
He knows it's not sy, that this isn't...
He just wants to protect me.
From success?
I'll talk to him.
That's all I ask.
Any calls?
I left the slips on your desk.
Also, there's a man waiting to see you.
Mr. stussy.
I'm agent dollard from the IRS.
That's...
What is this about?
Just a routine visit, or...
Well, maybe we could go to your office?
Great.
It's, right back here.
- Do you mind if I...
- Please.
So, you said that this was just a routine drop in, or...
Yes.
And, no.
Routine, in that we make these kind of calls all the time, so routine for me.
You made a withdrawal in the amount of $10,000 cash earlier this week.
- Motherfucker.
- Excuse me?
- What?
- You said?
Since when was it a crime for a citizen, a tax paying citizen to use their own money?
No, sir, it's not a crime.
Not exactly.
But, any transaction, deposit or withdrawal greater than $9,999.99, it triggers an alarm with us.
An alarm?
Not an actual alarm like at a fire station, that would be funny.
Spinning light, maybe get a pole.
No, it's more of an alert, a computer alert.
So, I've been dispatched by hq to ask a few questions.
They're simple questions.
Maybe take a look at your books.
My books?
Think of it like...
You been to the airport?
Recently?
In life, I'm saying you've been to an airport?
Yes.
Well, sometimes at the airport, when you go through the detector, the metal detector, or the radiographic scan, you get selected for additional screening, a pat down.
Maybe they swab your hands for explosives residue.
- What?
- Residue.
To make sure you haven't been, you know, building a bomb.
What are we talking about here?
Nobody's been building any...
No, of course not.
That's what I'm saying.
But because of your withdrawal, which I am required by law to question, you've been selected for additional review.
Screening, minimally invasive, day surgery, versus, say, having your colon removed.
Little IRS humor.
Isn't this...
Don't you need a warrant for this?
No, sir, that's the FBI.
This is more of an informal kickthetires and all that, so that we can avert an actual audit.
An audit?
Are you crazy?
Sir?
It's... we...
- I'm sorry.
- Sure.
Our records are pristine, our books.
You could eat off them if that was your...
And that other gentleman in the next office, that would be Mr...
Feltz?
It might be.
Sir?
No.
Mr. feltz is off today.
Family matter.
I see.
Well, I would need to talk to him as well, and any other senior members of your staff.
How many partners do you have?
Just how much time...
Like I said, this is just a baby step.
I'll park myself in an office, you know, do a few interviews, maybe look over your books.
An office?
Exactly.
Or a conference room, if that's easier.
Heck, I spent three months in the mailroom of a novelty store once surrounded by plastic poop and rubber vomit, so it doesn't have to be the riviera.
Okay.
Not a problem.
I know just where to put you.
Good.
Well, I appreciate it.
Shall we say 8:00 A.M.?
How about 7:30?
Perfect.
I'll see you then.
You betcha.
Is he married?
What?
Was he wearing a ring?
Did he mention kids?
That can be used.
I have no idea what you're saying to me right now.
We can't...
The jig is up.
This isn't...
He's gonna park himself in an office.
An office!
Days, weeks, asking questions, reviewing the books.
He asked to see the books?
Yes.
That's all right.
We'll show him the fake ones.
That's... wait.
We have fake books?
Let's go deeper.
Away from the road.
Forty grand.
That, plus the 10 you stole, puts it 50.
My thought, then, is you should leave the state.
Two hundred.
And we want the stamp.
For what?
It's the principle.
What's this?
Nothing.
Something else.
It's okay, I got it.
Sy, sy...
What's the matter, buddy?
You drank from the holy cup, but here you are.
Not being a good boy.
This isn't that.
I'm sorry.
Who are you?
What?
He said pretty girls should only open their mouths when they see a dick.
And, just so I'm clear, which one of you is the dick?
Enough.
I'm handling this.
Okay.
Have you been to Siberia?
Have I been to Siberia, is that the question?
It's very much like this.
Except the dirt.
The earth soaking in blood, frozen red.
All of Russia.
Hundreds of years, millions the tsar killed, then it was Lenin, then Stalin.
Ten thousand, 20,000.
But here you have, like, what?
Malls.
Few dead Indians.
Twenty million Russian died fighting Hitler, 20 million.
I see from your face that you can't even imagine that.
The pogroms, the starvation, 20 million more.
Mothers cooking and eating their babies.
That's why the snow falls white.
To hide the blood.
I'm leaving.
No!
You don't have to...
This is what comes after the cup.
Babe, I'm...
Had a little scare for a minute.
The police, which...
I don't have to tell you, got my heart going real good.
But all fine now.
Babe?
Babe?
Nikki, what... honey?
No.
No, no, no.
Honey?
Can you hear me?
Nikki?
Come on.
Honey?
Baby?
Baby, what happened?
What happened?
(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING)
MAC DAVIS:
Back a few months ago,
I was headlinin' a great big nightclub, and they put me up a couple days early.
I came in a couple days early, and they put me up in what they call the "Star Suite."
Now here I am, headlining' in one of the biggest nightclubs in the country, and I wake up at 8:00 in the morning in this "Star Suite"
all by myself.
AUDIENCE:
Aw!
DAVIS:
Yeah, that's what I said, "Aw."
But I did what I've always done, man, to cheer myself up,
I picked up my guitar,
I sat down, and I wrote me a little song.

On the sofa, I thought, unless you're attached to a more classic bed narrative.
Non-descript, though, you know, the furnishings, so they can't tie it to us.
That's...
I think you solved it.
We can keep you in a shirt, hiding your difference.
Maybe in a cowgirl, or a doggy scenario, favoring our rears, in other words, keeping our faces slightly absurd.
"Obscured."
What did I say?
I'm glad we're doing this, babe.
Taking control.
This whole time, we've been playing to draw.
It's time we start playing to win.
I know, but blackmail...
We lost the high roller, babe.
Zip.
Gone.
I know, and I'm so sorry.
It's not your fault.
A day like you had,
I would have stopped for a sidecar, too.
I just lost track...
I know.
This thing with your brother has got us both upset.
To deprive a man of his career, endanger his female...
I panicked.
You're too hard on yourself.
You rallied, didn't you, in the end?
You're here.
We're together.
Maybe I can call the guy, the high roller,
- and say...
- What?
Really?
'Cause you lost your job at the parole board on account of banging your clients?
No, because I fell in love.
That's sweet.
You're sweet.
Hon.
Where did you go?
I...
Jesus!
I just love you so much.
No.
For Pete's sake, I'm wearing a hooker wig!
- Just hold on.
- Sorry.
No, just...
That's got to be bad luck.
Okay.
Now, go.
Babe, you're my everything.
I want we should spend the rest of our lives together.
You gotta ask.
Oh.

Yes, Raymond Stussy, I will marry you.

(BOTH MOANING)
What the goddamn hell?
You have a fat wife.
Excuse me?
Which part of what I just said is giving you trouble?
This is my office.
A fat woman is inherently untrustworthy as she is a sensualist who sees no real difference between a pastrami sandwich and a dick in the mouth.
There's no call for that kind of language.
No.
A female Jew is especially vulnerable to the zaftig seduction of the forbidden, being part animal.
What are you doing?
Ah!
Do you know what a chicken is?
- What?
- A chicken.
Do you know what a chicken is?
A chicken is an egg's way of making another egg.
You see, it's all a matter of perspective.
The chicken sees it one way, the egg another, so let's start again.
This is not your office, just as your wife would not be your wife if I came to her in the night with a platter of cold cuts.
YURI:
Sit down, my friend.
You have shock.
All is well.
I'm just...
I'm not...
I need a minute.
No problem, no problem.
VARGA:
Have a drink, you'll feel better.
No.
Are you out of your mind?
YURI:
Nice drink, refreshing.
Are you threatening me?
(GUN COCKS)
No, no, no, the whole thing.
(CHOKING)

(RETCHING)
VARGA:
Yuri tells me you spoke to the police yesterday.
You can ask her, she came to me.
Not about anything, but there was a...
One of our cars was...
Some kind of accident.
A fender bender.
So, you know, unconnected to this completely.
You may have, during the course of the day, a strong impulse to act.
It's perfectly normal, a man of your station being forced to play the cuckold.
But remember, it's all a matter of perspective.
What's happening here is good.
You and I are partners now.
Contracts have been signed by the majordomo himself.
So, you see, lives are changing for the better.
And all you have to do is review the accounts, write up the deals, and approve the paperwork.
Do you understand?
Ah.
Yuri will show you to your new office.
Don't forget your mug.

Yes, yes, he told me.
And I must admit, I'm curious.
(CORK POPS)
(LAUGHS)
Are you all right?
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
Uh...
Of course, I just...
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
I had an upsetting experience this morning.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
To be honest,
I feel as if I've left the known world.
(CHUCKLES)
You ever had that feeling?
Like you, uh, stepped off the map into the, well, unknown, I guess?
That's how I felt when my Torvald died.
Oh.
My husband made his first million in mortuaries.
SY:
Hmm.
"Everybody dies, Ruby," he told me,
"You can't just leave them on the sofa."
(SY LAUGHS)
One night, he was eating a three-pound lobster and he had a stroke, and with it, a revelation.
Self-storage, that was the future.
The two businesses are surprisingly similar when you think about it, a place to put the things you'll never use again.
He died last year.
Complications from polio.
For six months, I wore black and tore my sleeves.
And then, I had a revelation of my own.
Parking lots.
The final piece to the storage triptych.
People are always going to need a place to park.
Amen.
I'll be honest with you, Mr. Feltz.
At my age, I'm not looking for a partner.
My preference would be to acquire the entire company, Stussy Lots Ltd., and I would be happy to let you keep the name intact if that worries you.
A second choice would be to buy several lots independently and build the business that way, but let's be honest.
That would make me your competitor, and, as my late husband always used to say,
"You don't want a Goldfarb for an enemy."
- I'm sure that's true.
- Mmm.
It's interesting that you should come to us now.
Problems?
No, not problems.
More of a softening of the will.
You see, Emmit Stussy, whom you'll meet, is a great man, a philanthropist, a leader, and, of late, he's been talking with increased regularity about dedicating himself in total to his good works,
i.e., the betterment of mankind.
Now, I suggested he take a step back and allow me to run the day-to-day, but he seems adamant that we stick together.
Pre-schools in Mumbai, health clinics in Inner Mongolia, better access to veterinary care.
And after all, how much money does one man need?
A lot, actually.
Women, more so.
And you'd be okay with that, selling a business that you worked so hard to build?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
I'm sorry.
There's... _
Uh... (STAMMERS) I forgot a very important...
We're closing on a new line of credit, and my girl got my calendar confused.
You go ahead.
Play hard to get.
(CHUCKLES) No, no, no, that's not...
Easy to get.
Really.
I mean, at the right price.
But we should talk more.
Call my private line.

I mean, the lines are down.

My brother.
SY:
He's in my office.
He put his Schwanz in the mug Esther gave me.
I had to throw it away.
You said you were gonna fix this.
You swore he'd go away.
Oh, enough about your stupid brother!
We're in trouble here!
This is a...
Enemies are at the gates!
Inside the gates!
Fornicating with our cookware!
What is the point of you?
What?
The point.
What is the point of you?
You're supposed to be a fixer.
Nothing's fixed.
Everything's broken.
They sent my wife a sex tape.
Why would your wife wanna watch your brother have sex?
Not him, dummy, me!
Ray, in a wig, pretending to...
He shaved his mustache!
He and that... whore.
And you were supposed to stop them!
Don't come here moaning about, "We're in trouble."
Who was the one who found Ermentraub, the go-between which led to Varga?
Where was the diligence, the due diligence?
You said...
I wanted to go deeper, but you said...
"Enemies at the gates," who let them in?
I never.
You need to unchain me.
If I was free, my hands, I could...
Your brother wouldn't bother us again.
It's the Delilah.
This floozy is pushing him, putting ideas in his head.
And now, they think, my family, that I'm some kind of...
When all I ever did was...
And there's...
Look at me, there's good inside, a good person.
Of course there is.
Think of the children, the lives you help.
I'm not some kind of weakling that can't control his...
Twenty-five years, and never once did I look at a woman sideways.
Sit-down meetings with the doors open, professional always.
You're a model, a role model.
I look up to you.
Everyone I know.
You've gotta fix this.
Whatever it takes.
Shackles off?
And throw away the key.

I met with the widow Goldfarb...
Not...
Okay.
I can't...
So, nope, say it again?
(SIGHS) I'm saying Maurice, the fellow with his head caved in, it wasn't a random robbery.
He was hired by another fellow to rob somebody.
His brother.
Maurice's brother?
No, the brother of the fella that hired Maurice, both named Stussy.
- Like your stepdad.
- Exactly.
Probably gave Maurice an address for the brother, except he lost it.
Or forgot it, at which point,
Maurice makes the wrong choice.
Drives to the wrong town, takes a name out of the phone book.
Also Stussy.
And you know what happens next.
New chief's not gonna like this.
(SIGHS) He doesn't have to like it, it's factual, we think.
Makes more sense than the other at least.
DONNY:
He's still not gonna like it.
Well, you don't have to like the truth for it to be true.
You sure?
We're gonna visit the parole office today either way, face the hiring brother.
And see if you can't track down this Vanessa who rented the apartment that lost an air-conditioner.
I'm thinking they might be connected.
What do you think?
Bigger size.
Don't you think it'd be more comfortable?
RAY:
Yeah?
We have something in a 44.
NIKKI:
We'll try that.
You're sweating.
It's just... (SOFTLY) It's a lot of money, 100 grand.
Are you sure?
I mean, we could ask for less...
Are we worth less?
You and me, our value, I'm saying, to the world?
What makes him rich, and us not?
Larceny.
Your brother stole from you, your birthright, like the snake in the garden, and then he built this falsehood.
Self-made man, my ass.
That business is your business, that mansion is your mansion on account of the stamps.
What he used to build this empire.
What's fair here is complete surrender.
We're compromising by asking for 100 grand.
He is getting off easy.
Here you go.
Oh, yeah.
(CELL PHONE BUZZES)
You got me.
SY:
Congratulations, you're officially the stupidest person alive.
Who is this?
It's Menachem Begin.
Who do you think it is?
You made a sex tape and gave it straight to the wife.
No...
You left it on the stoop.
Three people live in that house.
What did you think was gonna happen?
Tears, were there?
She left, and took the mother-in-law.
So, whatever leverage you think you have...
He's gonna pay.
For what?
She left.
The way we figure it, that's money owed for startup fees.
Collateral Ray put down as a youth.
He's part owner in the enterprise, in other words.
We're not gonna stop till we get what's ours.
We should meet, you and me, hammer out an end to this.
The end is, you pay.
SY:
She watched the tape.
Asshole.
Asshole.
She watched the tape.
So, she believes, right now, her husband slipping dick to a redhead is a true story?
Factual?
We were asking 100 grand to keep her from knowing, now I'm saying 200 grand to tell her the other truth.
There is no other truth.
You sure about that?
We got video evidence
Emmit's screwing his secretary.
It's a fact.
It never happened!
That doesn't make it any less of a fact.
And I'm saying the price to convince her of the other truth is 200 grand.
Stussy Lot 350, one hour.
Baby, look at you.
Is it all right?
It's amazing.
I gotta do a girl thing.
I'll see you at home later?
You want me to come?
It's not like I gotta work.
You're sweet.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
What do you want?
EMMIT:
You're dead, do you hear me?
Oh, I'm dead?
That's...
You got some nerve after...
She saw it!

Big whoop, I'm out of a job.
She left me.
Oh, well, you know, reap what you sow.
You should've done what's right when you had the chance.
Buddy, when I'm done with you, they'll be sponging you off the floor.
Yeah?
You'll be in the poor house making soup out of your dirty socks.
Fuck you.
Me?
Is that...
Is that what you're saying?
Fuck me?
- (BRAKES SCREECHING) - (RAY SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
You wanna fuck me?
I'll tattoo it on my fist and come over there!
Stuffed and mounted like a goddamn...
Yeah, fuck you!
So, if you know what's good for you, pay the damn money and pray that I'm satisfied!
Hello?
God damn it!
My mom.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
GLORIA:
Mr. Stussy!
(CAR DOORS CLOSING)
Chief Burgle, we met yesterday.
Uh, you know Officer Lopez.
RAY:
What's, uh...
We just had a few more questions.
I thought you said you weren't together?
We had an intersection of interest.
Shouldn't take long.
You wanna come inside, or...
Oh.
Better you come to the station with us.
Cleaner.
Okay.
I gotta be back by 6:00.
There's...
I got an appointment.
Oh, sure, we'll have you back.
RAY:
Look, I understand you got threads to pull.
I'm on the job, too, in probationary guise, but, still, we're both officers of the court.
GLORIA:
Got yourself fired yesterday is how I heard it.
Just now at your office.
That's...
Okay, I'm taking a little time.
Continuing my education, exploring a few...
'Cause it hit me one day.
You know, what if I could do more good in, like, a lawyer capacity?
You're going to law school?
Not, you know, officially, but...
Met with Mr. Feltz?
Sy Feltz?
He runs your brother's...
Oh, yeah, that's...
Like I said, there's no hard feelings there.
Just a minor traffic skirmish.
WINNIE:
You're saying Mr. Feltz was the driver of the offending vehicle?
No.
Why?
What did he say?
Look, it's a family matter is my philosophy.
Whatever past disagreements, bygones.
You know?
Think of Jesus, His actions.
So, there's bad blood between you and Mr. Feltz?
- No, I wouldn't say...
- What about between you and...
- What's the brother's name?
- Emmit.
Right, Emmit.
Emmit Stussy, who lives in Eden Prairie?
Did Sy...
Has he been making accusations?
'Cause I got...
Literally, my conscience is clear.
- Your conscience?
- Right.
I'm saying if we're being honest here and not to cast aspersions, but I've seen a lot of snakes in my day, and that man is a scorpion.
So, whatever he told you,
I'd take that with a huge sack of salt.
Maybe if you tell us how your car came to be damaged.
Like I said, it was an accident.
WINNIE:
He backed into your Corvette two times.
Mr. Feltz.
He's...
(SIGHS)
There's jealousy there, how close we are.
Me and Emmit, our bond.
So, you're saying there's no beef with Emmit?
There's no bad blood?
No.
Emmit, we're...
I was best man at his wedding.
And his daughter's wedding, they had it in, uh, Mexico.
The invitation said "no shoes."
Can you imagine a wedding with no shoes?
(WOMEN LAUGHING)
Tell me more about your man, Maurice LeFay.
Well, he's not my...
(SIGHS)
Just a number on a file, uh, one of the faceless masses.
Blew his piss test, like I said.
Uh, I would have rounded him up, except air-conditioner.
And, um, just so I'm clear, when's the last time you... (KNOCK ON DOOR)
One sec.
- We said 6:00, yeah?
- Yeah.
- No.
- Sheriff, before you...
I talked to Donny, let it go.
He told me what you're up to.
We're not up to anything, there's a suspect in the box.
A suspect of what?
Winnie Lopez, St. Cloud Metro.
We got a conflagration of names here.
Your victim, Ennis Stussy, Eden Valley, was murdered by the parolee of Ray Stussy, currently in the box, whose brother, Emmit Stussy, lives in Eden Prairie.
- And?
- And, there's bad blood between the brothers, a run-in, one vehicle against another.
So, we're thinking things escalated.
Ray hires the ex-con to...
Listen to me.
There's a girl in England.
Nine years old.
Laura Buxton, she's got a red balloon.
She ties a note to it.
"If found, please return to Laura Buxton,"
and her address.
She lets it go.
Damn thing flies 30, 40, 50 miles, comes down in a field.
The words found by another little girl, also nine, also named, wait for it, Laura Buxton.
That's...
A true story.
These things happen all the time.
Coincidence, random life.
Okay.
Here's another story.
Once upon a time, a guy named Stussy hired an idiot to rob his brother, and the idiot drove to the wrong town and killed the wrong Stussy.
I hate that story.
You know why?
You can't prove it.
Now, pack him up and get him out of here.
We got work to do.
(VARGA SIGHS)
How's your wife?
My wife?
Please thank her for dinner the other night.
Those pork chops were delightful.
I, uh...
Yeah, she's a hell of a cook.
I'm not sure we can trust the Jew.
- Who?
- Feltz.
There's been some sneaking around.
Do you trust him?
Sy?
Some people think he's colluding with your brother.
What?
Who?
People talk, that's all I'm saying.
People you don't want to be talking.
I heard he broke into your bank.
Sy?
Raymond.
Access to a safety deposit box, et cetera, and, now, he would've needed a key, and where he might've gotten one?
An insider.
No, that's...
Buck drilled the lock is what Sy said.
Is what Sy says.
Or either, it's possible that your consigliere making a move and he's using your brother as a diversion, or worse, a straw man after all.
The name on the marquee is "Stussy Lots,"
but nowhere does it specify which Stussy.
That's...
He's...
I talked to Sy.
He's onboard, all in with this, with us.
Trust me.
And he hates, trust me, hates Ray.
Wishes I'd cut him out a long time ago.
Look.
We are making a souffle here.
Do you understand?
Lines of credit, capital acquisition, increased valuation.
It's how you turn a small business into a big business.
And it is fluffy, and it is delicious.
But you can't agitate while it rises, otherwise...
Poof.
It's...
He...
He knows it's not Sy, that this isn't...
He just wants to protect me.
From success?
I'll talk to him.
That's all I ask.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Any calls?
RECEPTIONIST:
I left the slips on your desk.
Also, there's a man waiting to see you.
Oh.
Mr. Stussy.
I'm Agent Dollard from the IRS.
EMMIT:
That's...
What is this about?
Just a routine visit, or...
Well, maybe we could go to your office?
Great.
It's, uh, right back here.
- Do you mind if I...
- Please.
- (EMMIT CLEARS THROAT) - (UNLATCHES SUITCASE)
So, you said that this was just a routine drop in, or... (CHUCKLES) Yes.
And, no.
Routine, in that we make these kind of calls all the time, so routine for me.
(CHUCKLES)
You made a withdrawal in the amount of $10,000 cash earlier this week.
- Motherfucker.
- Excuse me?
- What?
- You said?
Since when was it a crime for a citizen, a tax paying citizen to use their own money?
No, sir, it's not a crime.
Not exactly.
But, uh, any transaction, deposit or withdrawal greater than $9,999.99, it triggers an alarm with us.
An alarm?
Not an actual alarm like at a fire station, that would be funny.
Spinning light, maybe get a pole.
No, it's more of an alert, a computer alert.
So, I've been dispatched by HQ to ask a few questions.
They're simple questions.
Maybe take a look at your books.
My books?
Think of it like...
You been to the airport?
Recently?
In life, I'm saying you've been to an airport?
Yes.
Well, sometimes at the airport, when you go through the detector, the metal detector, or the radiographic scan, you get selected for additional screening, a pat down.
Maybe they swab your hands for explosives residue.
- What?
- Residue.
To make sure you haven't been, you know, building a bomb.
What are we talking about here?
Nobody's been building any...
No, of course not.
That's what I'm saying.
But because of your withdrawal, which I am required by law to question, you've been selected for additional review.
Screening, minimally invasive, day surgery, versus, say, having your colon removed.
Little IRS humor.
Isn't this...
Uh...
Don't you need a warrant for this?
Oh, no, sir, that's the FBI.
Uh, this is more of an informal kick-the-tires and all that, so that we can avert an actual audit.
An audit?
Are you crazy?
Sir?
It's...
We...
- I'm sorry.
- Sure.
Our records are pristine, our books.
You could eat off them if that was your...
And that other gentleman in the next office, that would be Mr., uh...
Feltz?
It might be.
Sir?
No.
Uh, Mr. Feltz is off today.
Family matter.
Oh, I see.
Well, I would need to talk to him as well, and any other senior members of your staff.
How many partners do you have?
Just how much time...
Like I said, this is just a baby step.
I'll park myself in an office, you know, do a few interviews, maybe look over your books.
An office?
Exactly.
Or a conference room, if that's easier.
Heck, I spent three months in the mailroom of a novelty store once surrounded by plastic poop and rubber vomit, so it doesn't have to be the Riviera.
Okay.
Not a problem.
Uh...
I know just where to put you.
- Oh, good.
- (LAUGHS)
(EMMIT CLEARS THROAT)
(UNLATCHES SUITCASE)
Well, I appreciate it.
Shall we say 8:00 AM?
How about 7:30?
Perfect.
I'll see you then.
You betcha.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Is he married?
What?
Was he wearing a ring?
Did he mention kids?
That can be used.
I have no idea what you're saying to me right now.
We can't...
The jig is up.
This isn't...
He's gonna park himself in an office.
An office!
Days, weeks, asking questions, reviewing the books.
He asked to see the books?
Yes.
That's all right.
We'll show him the fake ones.
That's...
Wait.
We have fake books?
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
Let's go deeper.
Away from the road.
Forty grand.
That, plus the 10 you stole, puts it 50.
My thought, then, is you should leave the state.
(SCOFFS)
Two hundred.
And we want the stamp.
For what?
It's the principle.
What's this?
Nothing.
Something else.
It's okay, I got it.
(CLICKING TONGUE) Sy, Sy...
What's the matter, buddy?
You drank from the holy cup, but here you are.
Not being a good boy.
SY:
This isn't that.
I'm sorry.
Who are you?
(SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)
What?
He said pretty girls should only open their mouths
- when they see a dick.
- Oh.
And, just so I'm clear, which one of you is the dick?
- (YURI LAUGHING)
- Enough.
I'm handling this.
Okay.
Have you been to Siberia?
Have I been to Siberia, is that the question?
It's very much like this.
Except the dirt.
The earth soaking in blood, frozen red.
All of Russia.
Hundreds of years, millions the tsar killed, then it was Lenin, then Stalin.
Ten thousand, 20,000.
(IMITATES GUNSHOTS)
But here you have, like, what?
Malls.
Few dead Indians.
Twenty million Russian died fighting Hitler, 20 million.
I see from your face that you can't even imagine that.
The pogroms, the starvation, 20 million more.
Mothers cooking and eating their babies.
That's why the snow falls white.
To hide the blood.
(SCOFFS)
I'm leaving.
Ahh!
No!

You don't have to... (CONTINUES GROANING)

(♪ SHIP OF FOOLS ♪)
Back a few months ago,
I was headlining' a great big nightclub, and they put me up a couple days early.
I came in a couple days early, and they put me up in what they call the "Star Suite."
Now here I am, headlining' in one of the biggest nightclubs in the country, and I wake up at 8:00 in the morning in this "Star Suite"
all by myself.
Aw!
Yeah, that's what I said, "Aw."
But I did what I've always done, man, to cheer myself up,
I picked up my guitar,
I sat down, and I wrote me a little song.
Now this is how it feels to be alone at the top of the hill, tryin' to figure out why.

On the sofa, I thought, unless you're attached to a more classic bed narrative.
Non-descript, though, you know, the furnishings, so they can't tie it to us.
That's...
I think you solved it.
We can keep you in a shirt, hiding your difference.
Maybe in a cowgirl, or a doggy scenario, favoring our rears, in other words, keeping our faces slightly absurd.
"Obscured."
What did I say?
I'm glad we're doing this, babe.
Taking control.
This whole time, we've been playing to draw.
It's time we start playing to win.
I know, but blackmail...
We lost the high roller, babe.
Zip.
Gone.
I know, and I'm so sorry.
It's not your fault.
A day like you had,
I would have stopped for a sidecar, too.
I just lost track...
I know.
This thing with your brother has got us both upset.
To deprive a man of his career, endanger his female...
I panicked.
You're too hard on yourself.
You rallied, didn't you, in the end?
You're here.
We're together.
Maybe I can call the guy, the high roller,
- and say...
- What?
Really?
'Cause you lost your job at the parole board on account of banging your clients?
No, because I fell in love.
That's sweet.
You're sweet.
Hon.
Where did you go?
I...
Jesus!
I just love you so much.
No.
For Pete's sake, I'm wearing a hooker wig!
- Just hold on.
- Sorry.
No, just...
That's got to be bad luck.
Okay.
Now, go.
Babe, you're my everything.
I want we should spend the rest of our lives together.
You gotta ask.
Oh.
Right.
Nikki Swango, will you marry me?
Yes, Raymond Stussy, I will marry you.
Come here.
You've made me the happiest woman ever.
Now, let's make a sex tape.
Hey, hon.
You...
Stella?
What is it, honey?
I'll...
No!
Now, hold on!
Don't make a scene, Daddy.
Yeah, Mr. Stussy.
I saw the tape.
It's disgusting.
I didn't...
Baby!
Baby, I didn't...
I wouldn't!
Swear to Christ!
Stella...
Ma says to tell you, "Don't call."
Stella!
Nail me, Emmit, harder.
Yeah!
Oh!
Emmit, Emmit, nail me, Emmit!
What the goddamn hell?
You have a fat wife.
Excuse me?
Which part of what I just said is giving you trouble?
This is my office.
A fat woman is inherently untrustworthy as she is a sensualist who sees no real difference between a pastrami sandwich and a dick in the mouth.
There's no call for that kind of language.
No.
A female Jew is especially vulnerable to the zaftig seduction of the forbidden, being part animal.
What are you doing?
Ah!
Do you know what a chicken is?
- What?
- A chicken.
Do you know what a chicken is?
A chicken is an egg's way of making another egg.
You see, it's all a matter of perspective.
The chicken sees it one way, the egg another, so let's start again.
This is not your office, just as your wife would not be your wife if I came to her in the night with a platter of cold cuts.
Sit down, my friend.
You have shock.
All is well.
I'm just...
I'm not...
I need a minute.
No problem, no problem.
Have a drink, you'll feel better.
No.
Are you out of your mind?
Nice drink, refreshing.
Are you threatening me?
No, no, no, the whole thing.
Yuri tells me you spoke to the police yesterday.
You can ask her, she came to me.
Not about anything, but there was a...
One of our cars was...
Some kind of accident.
A fender bender.
So, you know, unconnected to this completely.
You may have, during the course of the day, a strong impulse to act.
It's perfectly normal, a man of your station being forced to play the cuckold.
But remember, it's all a matter of perspective.
What's happening here is good.
You and I are partners now.
Contracts have been signed by the majordomo himself.
So, you see, lives are changing for the better.
And all you have to do is review the accounts, write up the deals, and approve the paperwork.
Do you understand?
Ah.
Yuri will show you to your new office.
Don't forget your mug.
_
Emmit?
It's worse than we thought.
What we talked about.
The thing...
Are you...
Did they hurt you?
To get you to sign, I'm saying.
Did they...
You...
Emmit?
Emmit?
Mrs. Goldfarb.
You must be Sy.
I am so glad we finally get to meet.
I've been pinching Buck's ear every time I see him.
Yes, yes, he told me.
And I must admit, I'm curious.
Are you all right?
Uh...
Of course, I just...
I had an upsetting experience this morning.
To be honest,
I feel as if I've left the known world.
You ever had that feeling?
Like you, uh, stepped off the map into the, well, unknown, I guess?
That's how I felt when my Torvald died.
Oh.
My husband made his first million in mortuaries.
Hmm.
"Everybody dies, Ruby," he told me,
"You can't just leave them on the sofa."
One night, he was eating a three-pound lobster and he had a stroke, and with it, a revelation.
Self-storage, that was the future.
The two businesses are surprisingly similar when you think about it, a place to put the things you'll never use again.
He died last year.
Complications from polio.
For six months, I wore black and tore my sleeves.
And then, I had a revelation of my own.
Parking lots.
The final piece to the storage triptych.
People are always going to need a place to park.
Amen.
I'll be honest with you, Mr. Feltz.
At my age, I'm not looking for a partner.
My preference would be to acquire the entire company, Stussy Lots Ltd., and I would be happy to let you keep the name intact if that worries you.
A second choice would be to buy several lots independently and build the business that way, but let's be honest.
That would make me your competitor, and, as my late husband always used to say,
"You don't want a Goldfarb for an enemy."
- I'm sure that's true.
- Mmm.
It's interesting that you should come to us now.
Problems?
No, not problems.
More of a softening of the will.
You see, Emmit Stussy, whom you'll meet, is a great man, a philanthropist, a leader, and, of late, he's been talking with increased regularity about dedicating himself in total to his good works,
i.e., the betterment of mankind.
Now, I suggested he take a step back and allow me to run the day-to-day, but he seems adamant that we stick together.
Pre-schools in Mumbai, health clinics in Inner Mongolia, better access to veterinary care.
And after all, how much money does one man need?
A lot, actually.
Women, more so.
And you'd be okay with that, selling a business that you worked so hard to build?
I'm sorry.
There's... _
Uh...
I forgot a very important...
We're closing on a new line of credit, and my girl got my calendar confused.
You go ahead.
Play hard to get.
No, no, no, that's not...
Easy to get.
Really.
I mean, at the right price.
But we should talk more.
Call my private line.
The office isn't safe.
I mean, the lines are down.
Hello?
Emmit!
Emmit!
Hello?
Emmit?
She left.
Did you sign partnership papers?
Did you make Varga a partner in our firm?
I didn't think it was possible.
The evil of this man.
My brother.
My brother.
He's in my office.
He put his Schwanz in the mug Esther gave me.
I had to throw it away.
You said you were gonna fix this.
You swore he'd go away.
Oh, enough about your stupid brother!
We're in trouble here!
This is a...
Enemies are at the gates!
Inside the gates!
Fornicating with our cookware!
What is the point of you?
What?
The point.
What is the point of you?
You're supposed to be a fixer.
Nothing's fixed.
Everything's broken.
They sent my wife a sex tape.
Why would your wife wanna watch your brother have sex?
Not him, dummy, me!
Ray, in a wig, pretending to...
He shaved his mustache!
He and that... whore.
And you were supposed to stop them!
Don't come here moaning about, "We're in trouble."
Who was the one who found Ermentraub, the go-between which led to Varga?
Where was the diligence, the due diligence?
You said...
I wanted to go deeper, but you said...
"Enemies at the gates," who let them in?
I never.
You need to unchain me.
If I was free, my hands, I could...
Your brother wouldn't bother us again.
It's the Delilah.
This floozy is pushing him, putting ideas in his head.
And now, they think, my family, that I'm some kind of...
When all I ever did was...
And there's...
Look at me, there's good inside, a good person.
Of course there is.
Think of the children, the lives you help.
I'm not some kind of weakling that can't control his...
Twenty-five years, and never once did I look at a woman sideways.
Sit-down meetings with the doors open, professional always.
You're a model, a role model.
I look up to you.
Everyone I know.
You've gotta fix this.
Whatever it takes.
Shackles off?
And throw away the key.
I met with the widow Goldfarb...
Not...
Okay.
I can't...
So, nope, say it again?
I'm saying Maurice, the fellow with his head caved in, it wasn't a random robbery.
He was hired by another fellow to rob somebody.
His brother.
Maurice's brother?
No, the brother of the fella that hired Maurice, both named Stussy.
- Like your stepdad.
- Exactly.
Probably gave Maurice an address for the brother, except he lost it.
Or forgot it, at which point,
Maurice makes the wrong choice.
Drives to the wrong town, takes a name out of the phone book.
Also Stussy.
And you know what happens next.
New chief's not gonna like this.
He doesn't have to like it, it's factual, we think.
Makes more sense than the other at least.
He's still not gonna like it.
Well, you don't have to like the truth for it to be true.
You sure?
We're gonna visit the parole office today either way, face the hiring brother.
And see if you can't track down this Vanessa who rented the apartment that lost an air-conditioner.
I'm thinking they might be connected.
What do you think?
Bigger size.
Don't you think it'd be more comfortable?
Yeah?
We have something in a 44.
We'll try that.
You're sweating.
It's just...
It's a lot of money, 100 grand.
Are you sure?
I mean, we could ask for less...
Are we worth less?
You and me, our value, I'm saying, to the world?
What makes him rich, and us not?
Larceny.
Your brother stole from you, your birthright, like the snake in the garden, and then he built this falsehood.
Self-made man, my ass.
That business is your business, that mansion is your mansion on account of the stamps.
What he used to build this empire.
What's fair here is complete surrender.
We're compromising by asking for 100 grand.
He is getting off easy.
Here you go.
Oh, yeah.
You got me.
Congratulations, you're officially the stupidest person alive.
Who is this?
It's Menachem Begin.
Who do you think it is?
You made a sex tape and gave it straight to the wife.
No...
You left it on the stoop.
Three people live in that house.
What did you think was gonna happen?
Tears, were there?
She left, and took the mother-in-law.
So, whatever leverage you think you have...
He's gonna pay.
For what?
She left.
The way we figure it, that's money owed for startup fees.
Collateral Ray put down as a youth.
He's part owner in the enterprise, in other words.
We're not gonna stop till we get what's ours.
We should meet, you and me, hammer out an end to this.
The end is, you pay.
She watched the tape.
Asshole.
Asshole.
She watched the tape.
So, she believes, right now, her husband slipping dick to a redhead is a true story?
Factual?
We were asking 100 grand to keep her from knowing, now I'm saying 200 grand to tell her the other truth.
There is no other truth.
You sure about that?
We got video evidence
Emmit's screwing his secretary.
It's a fact.
It never happened!
That doesn't make it any less of a fact.
And I'm saying the price to convince her of the other truth is 200 grand.
Stussy Lot 350, one hour.
Baby, look at you.
Is it all right?
It's amazing.
I gotta do a girl thing.
I'll see you at home later?
You want me to come?
It's not like I gotta work.
You're sweet.
What do you want?
You're dead, do you hear me?
Oh, I'm dead?
That's...
- You got some nerve after...
- She saw it!
Stella, the tape.
Big whoop, I'm out of a job.
She left me.
Oh, well, you know, reap what you sow.
You should've done what's right when you had the chance.
Buddy, when I'm done with you, they'll be sponging you off the floor.
Yeah?
You'll be in the poor house making soup out of your dirty socks.
Fuck you.
Me?
Is that...
Is that what you're saying?
Fuck me?
You wanna fuck me?
I'll tattoo it on my fist and come over there!
Stuffed and mounted like a goddamn...
Yeah, fuck you!
So, if you know what's good for you, pay the damn money and pray that I'm satisfied!
Hello?
God damn it!
My mom.
Mr. Stussy!
Chief Burgle, we met yesterday.
Uh, you know Officer Lopez.
What's, uh...
We just had a few more questions.
I thought you said you weren't together?
We had an intersection of interest.
Shouldn't take long.
You wanna come inside, or...
Oh.
Better you come to the station with us.
Cleaner.
Okay.
I gotta be back by 6:00.
There's...
I got an appointment.
Oh, sure, we'll have you back.
Look, I understand you got threads to pull.
I'm on the job, too, in probationary guise, but, still, we're both officers of the court.
Got yourself fired yesterday is how I heard it.
Just now at your office.
That's...
Okay, I'm taking a little time.
Continuing my education, exploring a few...
'Cause it hit me one day.
You know, what if I could do more good in, like, a lawyer capacity?
You're going to law school?
Not, you know, officially, but...
Met with Mr. Feltz?
Sy Feltz?
He runs your brother's...
Oh, yeah, that's...
Like I said, there's no hard feelings there.
Just a minor traffic skirmish.
You're saying Mr. Feltz was the driver of the offending vehicle?
No.
Why?
What did he say?
Look, it's a family matter is my philosophy.
Whatever past disagreements, bygones.
You know?
Think of Jesus, His actions.
So, there's bad blood between you and Mr. Feltz?
- No, I wouldn't say...
- What about between you and...
- What's the brother's name?
- Emmit.
Right, Emmit.
Emmit Stussy, who lives in Eden Prairie?
Did Sy...
Has he been making accusations?
'Cause I got...
Literally, my conscience is clear.
- Your conscience?
- Right.
I'm saying if we're being honest here and not to cast aspersions, but I've seen a lot of snakes in my day, and that man is a scorpion.
So, whatever he told you,
I'd take that with a huge sack of salt.
Maybe if you tell us how your car came to be damaged.
Like I said, it was an accident.
He backed into your Corvette two times.
Mr. Feltz.
He's...
There's jealousy there, how close we are.
Me and Emmit, our bond.
So, you're saying there's no beef with Emmit?
There's no bad blood?
No.
Emmit, we're...
I was best man at his wedding.
And his daughter's wedding, they had it in, uh, Mexico.
The invitation said "no shoes."
Can you imagine a wedding with no shoes?
Tell me more about your man, Maurice LeFay.
Well, he's not my...
Just a number on a file, uh, one of the faceless masses.
Blew his piss test, like I said.
Uh, I would have rounded him up, except air-conditioner.
And, um, just so I'm clear, when's the last time you...
One sec.
- We said 6:00, yeah?
- Yeah.
- No.
- Sheriff, before you...
I talked to Donny, let it go.
He told me what you're up to.
We're not up to anything, there's a suspect in the box.
A suspect of what?
Winnie Lopez, St. Cloud Metro.
We got a conflagration of names here.
Your victim, Ennis Stussy, Eden Valley, was murdered by the parolee of Ray Stussy, currently in the box, whose brother, Emmit Stussy, lives in Eden Prairie.
- And?
- And, there's bad blood between the brothers, a run-in, one vehicle against another.
So, we're thinking things escalated.
Ray hires the ex-con to...
Listen to me.
There's a girl in England.
Nine years old.
Laura Buxton, she's got a red balloon.
She ties a note to it.
"If found, please return to Laura Buxton,"
and her address.
She lets it go.
Damn thing flies 30, 40, 50 miles, comes down in a field.
The words found by another little girl, also nine, also named, wait for it, Laura Buxton.
That's...
A true story.
These things happen all the time.
Coincidence, random life.
Okay.
Here's another story.
Once upon a time, a guy named Stussy hired an idiot to rob his brother, and the idiot drove to the wrong town and killed the wrong Stussy.
I hate that story.
You know why?
You can't prove it.
Now, pack him up and get him out of here.
We got work to do.
How's your wife?
My wife?
Please thank her for dinner the other night.
Those pork chops were delightful.
I, uh...
Yeah, she's a hell of a cook.
I'm not sure we can trust the Jew.
- Who?
- Feltz.
There's been some sneaking around.
Do you trust him?
Sy?
Some people think he's colluding with your brother.
What?
Who?
People talk, that's all I'm saying.
People you don't want to be talking.
I heard he broke into your bank.
Sy?
Raymond.
Access to a safety deposit box, et cetera, and, now, he would've needed a key, and where he might've gotten one?
An insider.
No, that's...
Buck drilled the lock is what Sy said.
Is what Sy says.
Or either, it's possible that your consigliere making a move and he's using your brother as a diversion, or worse, a straw man after all.
The name on the marquee is "Stussy Lots,"
but nowhere does it specify which Stussy.
That's...
He's...
I talked to Sy.
He's onboard, all in with this, with us.
Trust me.
And he hates, trust me, hates Ray.
Wishes I'd cut him out a long time ago.
Look.
We are making a souffle here.
Do you understand?
Lines of credit, capital acquisition, increased valuation.
It's how you turn a small business into a big business.
And it is fluffy, and it is delicious.
But you can't agitate while it rises, otherwise...
Poof.
It's...
He...
He knows it's not Sy, that this isn't...
He just wants to protect me.
From success?
I'll talk to him.
That's all I ask.
Any calls?
I left the slips on your desk.
Also, there's a man waiting to see you.
Oh.
Mr. Stussy.
I'm Agent Dollard from the IRS.
That's...
What is this about?
Just a routine visit, or...
Well, maybe we could go to your office?
Great.
It's, uh, right back here.
- Do you mind if I...
- Please.
So, you said that this was just a routine drop in, or...
Yes.
And, no.
Routine, in that we make these kind of calls all the time, so routine for me.
You made a withdrawal in the amount of $10,000 cash earlier this week.
- Motherfucker.
- Excuse me?
- What?
- You said?
Since when was it a crime for a citizen, a tax paying citizen to use their own money?
No, sir, it's not a crime.
Not exactly.
But, uh, any transaction, deposit or withdrawal greater than $9,999.99, it triggers an alarm with us.
An alarm?
Not an actual alarm like at a fire station, that would be funny.
Spinning light, maybe get a pole.
No, it's more of an alert, a computer alert.
So, I've been dispatched by HQ to ask a few questions.
They're simple questions.
Maybe take a look at your books.
My books?
Think of it like...
You been to the airport?
Recently?
In life, I'm saying you've been to an airport?
Yes.
Well, sometimes at the airport, when you go through the detector, the metal detector, or the radiographic scan, you get selected for additional screening, a pat down.
Maybe they swab your hands for explosives residue.
- What?
- Residue.
To make sure you haven't been, you know, building a bomb.
What are we talking about here?
Nobody's been building any...
No, of course not.
That's what I'm saying.
But because of your withdrawal, which I am required by law to question, you've been selected for additional review.
Screening, minimally invasive, day surgery, versus, say, having your colon removed.
Little IRS humor.
Isn't this...
Uh...
Don't you need a warrant for this?
Oh, no, sir, that's the FBI.
Uh, this is more of an informal kick-the-tires and all that, so that we can avert an actual audit.
An audit?
Are you crazy?
Sir?
It's...
We...
- I'm sorry.
- Sure.
Our records are pristine, our books.
You could eat off them if that was your...
And that other gentleman in the next office, that would be Mr., uh...
Feltz?
It might be.
Sir?
No.
Uh, Mr. Feltz is off today.
Family matter.
Oh, I see.
Well, I would need to talk to him as well, and any other senior members of your staff.
How many partners do you have?
Just how much time...
Like I said, this is just a baby step.
I'll park myself in an office, you know, do a few interviews, maybe look over your books.
An office?
Exactly.
Or a conference room, if that's easier.
Heck, I spent three months in the mailroom of a novelty store once surrounded by plastic poop and rubber vomit, so it doesn't have to be the Riviera.
Okay.
Not a problem.
Uh...
I know just where to put you.
Oh, good.
Well, I appreciate it.
Shall we say 8:00 AM?
How about 7:30?
Perfect.
I'll see you then.
You betcha.
Is he married?
What?
Was he wearing a ring?
Did he mention kids?
That can be used.
I have no idea what you're saying to me right now.
We can't...
The jig is up.
This isn't...
He's gonna park himself in an office.
An office!
Days, weeks, asking questions, reviewing the books.
He asked to see the books?
Yes.
That's all right.
We'll show him the fake ones.
That's...
Wait.
We have fake books?
Let's go deeper.
Away from the road.
Forty grand.
That, plus the 10 you stole, puts it 50.
My thought, then, is you should leave the state.
Two hundred.
And we want the stamp.
For what?
It's the principle.
What's this?
Nothing.
Something else.
It's okay, I got it.
Sy, Sy...
What's the matter, buddy?
You drank from the holy cup, but here you are.
Not being a good boy.
This isn't that.
I'm sorry.
Who are you?
What?
He said pretty girls should only open their mouths
- when they see a dick.
- Oh.
And, just so I'm clear, which one of you is the dick?
Enough.
I'm handling this.
Okay.
Have you been to Siberia?
Have I been to Siberia, is that the question?
It's very much like this.
Except the dirt.
The earth soaking in blood, frozen red.
All of Russia.
Hundreds of years, millions the tsar killed, then it was Lenin, then Stalin.
Ten thousand, 20,000.
But here you have, like, what?
Malls.
Few dead Indians.
Twenty million Russian died fighting Hitler, 20 million.
I see from your face that you can't even imagine that.
The pogroms, the starvation, 20 million more.
Mothers cooking and eating their babies.
That's why the snow falls white.
To hide the blood.
I'm leaving.
Ahh!
No!
You don't have to...
This is what comes after the cup.
Babe, I'm...
Phew.
Had a little scare for a minute.
The police, which...
I don't have to tell you, got my heart going real good.
But all fine now.
Babe?
Babe?
Nikki, what...
Honey?
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
Honey?
Can you hear me?
Nikki?
Come on.
Honey?
Baby?
Baby, what happened?
What happened?

Oh ,emmit!
On the sofa, I thought, unless you're attached to a more classic bed narrative.
Non-descript, though, you know, the furnishings, so they can't tie it to us.
That's...
I think you solved it.
We can keep you in a shirt, hiding your difference.
Maybe in a cowgirl, or a doggy scenario, favoring our rears, in other words, keeping our faces slightly absurd.
"Obscured."
What did I say?
I'm glad we're doing this, babe.
Taking control.
This whole time, we've been playing to draw.
It's time we start playing to win.
I know, but blackmail...
We lost the high roller, babe.
Zip.
Gone.
I know, and I'm so sorry.
It's not your fault.
A day like you had,
I would have stopped for a sidecar, too.
I just lost track...
I know.
This thing with your brother has got us both upset.
To deprive a man of his career, endanger his female...
I panicked.
You're too hard on yourself.
You rallied, didn't you, in the end?
You're here.
We're together.
Maybe I can call the guy, the high roller,
-and say...
-What?
Really?
'Cause you lost your job at the parole board on account of banging your clients?
No, because I fell in love.
That's sweet.
You're sweet.
Hon.
Where did you go?
I...
Jesus!
I just love you so much.
No.
For Pete's sake, I'm wearing a hooker wig!
-Just hold on.
-Sorry.
No, just...
That's got to be bad luck.
Okay.
Now, go.
Babe, you're my everything.
I want we should spend the rest of our lives together.
You gotta ask.
Oh.
Right.
Nikki swango, will you marry me?
Yes, Raymond stussy, i will marry you.
(Nikki chuckles)
Come here.
You've made me the happiest woman ever.
Now, let's make a sex tape.
(Cell phone buzzing)
-Emmit:
Hey, hon.
-(Stella sobbing)
Stella:
You...
(Shouts incoherently)
Stella?
What is it, honey?
I'll...
(Shouting incoherently)
(Percussive music playing)
No!
Now, hold on!
Don't make a scene, daddy.
Yeah, Mr. stussy.
Grace:
I saw the tape.
It's disgusting.
Emmit:
I didn't... (Stella sniffles)
Baby!
Baby, I didn't...
I wouldn't!
Swear to Christ!
Stella...
Grace:
Ma says to tell you, "don't call."
-(Car door closes) -(Engine starts)
Stella!
(Breathing heavily)
(Nikki moaning on video)
Nikki:
Nail me, emmit, harder.
Yeah!
(Moaning continues)
Oh!
Emmit,emmit, nailme,emmit!
(Both moaning)
What the goddamn hell?
You have a fat wife.
Excuse me?
Which part of what I just said is giving you trouble?
This is my office.
A fat woman is inherently untrustworthy as she is a sensualist who sees no real difference between a pastrami sandwich and a dick in the mouth.
There's no call for that kind of language.
No.
A female Jew is especially vulnerable to the zaftig seduction of the forbidden, being part animal.
What are you doing?
Ah!
Do you know what a chicken is?
-What?
-A chicken.
Do you know what a chicken is?
A chicken is an egg's way of making another egg.
You see, it's all a matter of perspective.
The chicken sees it one way, the egg another, so let's start again.
This is not your office, just as your wife would not be your wife if I came to her in the night with a platter of cold cuts.
Yuri:
Sit down, my friend.
You have shock.
All is well.
I'm just...
I'm not...
I need a minute.
No problem, no problem.
Varga:
Have a drink, you'll feel better.
No.
Are you out of your mind?
Yuri:
Nice drink, refreshing.
Are you threatening me?
(Gun cocks)
No, no, no, the whole thing.
(Choking)
(Coughs)
(Retching)
Varga:
Yuri tells me you spoke to the police yesterday.
You can ask her, she came to me.
Not about anything, but there was a...
One of our cars was...
Some kind of accident.
A Fender bender.
So, you know, unconnected to this completely.
You may have, during the course of the day, a strong impulse to act.
It's perfectly normal, a man of your station being forced to play the cuckold.
But remember, it's all a matter of perspective.
What's happening here is good.
You and I are partners now.
Contracts have been signed by the majordomo himself.
So, you see, lives are changing for the better.
And all you have to do is review the accounts, write up the deals, and approve the paperwork.
Do you understand?
Ah.
Yuri will show you to your new office.
Don't forget your mug.
(Phone ringing)
(Answering machine beeps)
Sy:
Emmit?
-It's worse than we thought.
-(Door closes)
Whatwetalkedabout.
Thething...areyou ...

To get you to sign, I'm saying.
Did they... (Answering machine beeps)
You...
Emmit?
Emmit?
(Ominous music playing)
(Elevator bell dings)
-(Indistinct chattering) -(Classical music playing)
Sy:
Mrs. goldfarb.
You must be sy.
I am so glad we finally get to meet.
I've been pinching buck's ear every time I see him.
Yes, yes, he told me.
And I must admit, I'm curious.
(Cork pops)
(Laughs)
Are you all right?
(Laughs nervously)
Uh... of course, I just...
(Laughs nervously)
I had an upsetting experience this morning. (Laughs)
(Breathing heavily)
To be honest,
I feel as if I've left the known world.
(Chuckles)
You ever had that feeling?
Like you, uh, stepped off the map into the, well, unknown, I guess?
That's how I felt when my torvald died.
Oh.
My husband made his first million in mortuaries.
Sy:
Hmm.
"Everybody dies, Ruby," he told me,
"you can't just leave them on the sofa."
(Sy laughs)
One night, he was eating a three-pound lobster and he had a stroke, and with it, a revelation.
Self-storage, that was the future.
The two businesses are surprisingly similar when you think about it, a place to put the things you'll never use again.
He died last year.
Complications from polio.
For six months, I wore black and tore my sleeves.
And then, i had a revelation of my own.
Parking lots.
The final piece to the storage triptych.
People are always going to need a place to park.
Amen.
I'll be honest with you, Mr. feltz.
At my age, I'm not looking for a partner.
My preference would be to acquire the entire company, stussy lots ltd., and I would be happy to let you keep the name intact if that worries you.
A second choice would be to buy several lots independently and build the business that way, but let's be honest.
That would make me your competitor, and, as my late husband always used to say,
"you don't want a goldfarb for an enemy."
-I'm sure that's true.
-Mmm.
It's interesting that you should come to us now.
Problems?
No, not problems.
More of a softening of the will.
You see, emmit stussy, whom you'll meet, is a great man, a philanthropist, a leader, and, of late, he's been talking with increased regularity about dedicating himself in total to his good works,
I.E., the betterment of mankind.
Now, I suggested he take a step back and allow me to run the day-to-day, but he seems adamant that we stick together.
Pre-schools in Mumbai, health clinics in inner Mongolia, better access to veterinary care.
And after all, how much money does one man need?
A lot, actually.
Women, more so.
And you'd be okay with that, selling a business that you worked so hard to build?
(Cell phone ringing)
I'm sorry.
There's...
Uh... (Stammers) I forgot a very important...
We're closing on a new line of credit, and my girl got my calendar confused.
You go ahead.
Play hard to get.
(Chuckles) No, no, no, that's not...
Easy to get.
Really.
I mean, at the right price.
But we should talk more.
Call my private line.
The office isn't safe.
I mean, the lines are down.
(Classical music continues playing)

Hello?
Emmit!
Emmit!
(Emmit sobbing)
Hello?
-Emmit?
-(Continues sobbing)
She left. (Sniffles)
Did you sign partnership papers?
Did you make varga a partner in our firm?
I didn't think it was possible. (Sniffles)
The evil of this man.
My brother.
My brother.
Sy:
He's in my office.
He put his schwanz in the mug Esther gave me.
I had to throw it away.
You said you were gonna fix this.
You swore he'd go away.
Oh, enough about your stupid brother!
We're in trouble here!
This is a...
Enemies are at the gates!
Inside the gates!
Fornicating with our cookware!
What is the point of you?
What?
The point.
What is the point of you?
You're supposed to be a fixer.
Nothing's fixed.
Everything's broken.
They sent my wife a sex tape.
Why would your wife wanna watch your brother have sex?
Not him, dummy, me!
Ray, in a wig, pretending to...
He shaved his mustache!
He and that... whore.
And you were supposed to stop them!
Don't come here moaning about, "we're in trouble."
Who was the one who found ermentraub, the go-between which led to varga?
Where was the diligence, the due diligence?
You said...
I wanted to go deeper, but you said...
"Enemies at the gates," who let them in?
I never.
You need to unchain me.
If I was free, my hands, i could...
Your brother wouldn't bother us again.
It's the Delilah.
This floozy is pushing him, putting ideas in his head.
And now, they think, my family, that I'm some kind of...
When all I ever did was...
And there's...
Look at me, there's good inside, a good person.
Of course there is.
Think of the children, the lives you help.
I'm not some kind of weakling that can't control his...
Twenty-five years, and never once did I look at a woman sideways.
Sit-down meetings with the doors open, professional always.
You're a model, a role model.
I look up to you.
Everyone I know.
You've gotta fix this.
Whatever it takes.
Shackles off?
And throw away the key.
(Sobs)
(Sniffing)
I met with the widow goldfarb...
Not...
Okay.
I can't...
So, nope, say it again?
(Sighs) I'm saying Maurice, the fellow with his head caved in, it wasn't a random robbery.
He was hired by another fellow to rob somebody.
His brother.
Maurice's brother?
No, the brother of the fella that hired Maurice, both named stussy.
-Like your stepdad.
-Gloria:
Exactly.
Probably gave Maurice an address for the brother, except he lost it.
Or forgot it, at which point,
Maurice makes the wrong choice.
Drives to the wrong town, takes a name out of the phone book.
Also stussy.
And you know what happens next.
New chief's not gonna like this.
(Sighs) He doesn't have to like it, it's factual, we think.
Makes more sense than the other at least.
Donny:
He's still not gonna like it.
Well, you don't have to like the truth for it to be true.
You sure?
We're gonna visit the parole office today either way, face the hiring brother.
And see if you can't track down this Vanessa who rented the apartment that lost an air-conditioner.
I'm thinking they might be connected.
What do you think?
Bigger size.
Don't you think it'd be more comfortable?
Ray:
Yeah?
We have something in a 44.
Nikki:
We'll try that.
You're sweating.
It's just... (Softly) It's a lot of money, 100 grand.
Are you sure?
I mean, we could ask for less...
Are we worth less?
You and me, our value, I'm saying, to the world?
What makes him rich, and us not?
Larceny.
Your brother stole from you, your birthright, like the snake in the garden, and then he built this falsehood.
Self-made man, my ass.
That business is your business, that mansion is your mansion on account of the stamps.
What he used to build this empire.
What's fair here is complete surrender.
We're compromising by asking for 100 grand.
He is getting off easy.
Here you go.
Oh, yeah.
(Cell phone buzzes)
You got me.
Sy:
Congratulations, you'reofficially thestupidestpersonalive.
Who is this?
It's menachem begin.
Who do you think it is?
You made a sex tape and gave it straight to the wife.
No...

Tears, were there?
Sheleft, and took the mother-in-law.
So, whatever leverage you think you have...
He's gonna pay.
Forwhat?
Sheleft.
The way we figure it, that's money owed for startup fees.
Collateralray putdownas ayouth.
He's part owner in the enterprise, in other words.
We're not gonna stop till we get what's ours.
We should meet, you and me, hammer out an end to this.
The end is, you pay.
Sy:
She watched the tape.
Asshole.
Asshole.
She watched the tape.
So, she believes, right now, her husband slipping dick to a redhead is a true story?
Factual?
We were asking100 grand to keep her from knowing, now I'm saying 200 grand to tell her the other truth.
Thereisno othertruth.
You sure about that?
We got video evidence emmit's screwing his secretary.
It's a fact.
It never happened!
That doesn't make it any less of a fact.
And I'm saying the price to convince her of the other truth is 200 grand.
Stussylot350,one hour.
Baby, look at you.
Is it all right?
It's amazing.
I gotta do a girl thing.
I'll see you at home later?
You want me to come?
It's not like I gotta work.
You're sweet.
(Cell phone ringing)
What do you want?
Emmit:
You'redead,do youhearme?
Oh, I'm dead?
That's...
You got some nerve after...
Shesawit !
Stella, the tape.
Bigwhoop,I'mout ofa job.
She left me.
Oh, well, you know, reap what you sow.
You should've done what's right when you had the chance.
Buddy, when I'm done with you, they'll be sponging you off the floor.
Yeah?
You'll be in the poor house making soup out of your dirty socks.
Fuck you.
Me?
Is that... is that what you're saying?
Fuck me?
-(Brakes screeching) -(Ray shouting indistinctly)
Youwannafuckme?
I'll tattoo it on my fist and come over there!
Stuffed and mounted like a goddamn...
Yeah, fuck you!
So,ifyouknow what'sgoodforyou , pay the damn money and pray that I'm satisfied!
Hello?
God damn it!
My mom.
(Indistinct chattering)
Gloria:
Mr. stussy!
(Car doors closing)
Chief burgle, we met yesterday.
Uh, you know officer Lopez.
Ray:
What's, uh...
We just had a few more questions.
I thought you said you weren't together?
We had an intersection of interest.
Shouldn't take long.
You wanna come inside, or...
Oh.
Better you come to the station with us.
Cleaner.
Okay.
I gotta be back by 6:00.
There's... (Stammers) I got an appointment.
Oh, sure, we'll have you back.
Ray:
Look, I understand you got threads to pull.
I'm on the job, too, in probationary guise, but, still, we're both officers of the court.
Gloria:
Got yourself fired yesterday is how I heard it.
Just now at your office.
That's...
Okay, I'm taking a little time.
Continuing my education, exploring a few...
'Cause it hit me one day.
You know, what if I could do more good in, like, a lawyer capacity?
You're going to law school?
Not, you know, officially, but...
Met with Mr. feltz?
Sy feltz?
He runs your brother's...
Oh, yeah, that's...
Like I said, there's no hard feelings there.
Just a minor traffic skirmish.
Winnie:
You're saying Mr. feltz was the driver of the offending vehicle?
No.
Why?
What did he say?
Look, it's a family matter is my philosophy.
Whatever past disagreements, bygones.
You know?
Think of Jesus, his actions.
So, there's bad blood between you and Mr. feltz?
-No, I wouldn't say...
-What about between you and...
-What's the brother's name?
-Winnie:
Emmit.
Right, emmit.
Emmit stussy, who lives in Eden prairie?
Did sy... has he been making accusations?
'Cause I got...
literally, my conscience is clear.
-Your conscience?
-Right.
I'm saying if we're being honest here and not to cast aspersions, but I've seen a lot of snakes in my day, and that man is a scorpion.
So, whatever he told you,
I'd take that with a huge sack of salt.
Maybe if you tell us how your car came to be damaged.
Like I said, it was an accident.
Winnie:
He backed into your corvette two times.
Mr. feltz.
He's... (Sighs)
There's jealousy there, how close we are.
Me and emmit, our bond.
So, you're saying there's no beef with emmit?
There's no bad blood?
No.
Emmit, we're...
I was best man at his wedding.
And his daughter's wedding, they had it in, uh, Mexico.
The invitation said "no shoes."
Can you imagine a wedding with no shoes?
(Women laughing)
Tell me more about your man, Maurice lefay.
Well, he's not my... (Sighs)
Just a number on a file, uh, one of the faceless masses.
Blew his piss test, like I said.
Uh, i would have rounded him up, except air-conditioner.
And, um, just so I'm clear, when's the last time you... (Knock on door)
One sec.
-We said 6:00, yeah?
-Yeah.
-Moe:
No.
-Sheriff, before you...
I talked to Donny, let it go.
He told me what you're up to.
We're not up to anything, there's a suspect in the box.
A suspect of what?
Winnie Lopez, St. cloud Metro.
(Clears throat) We got a conflagration of names here.
Your victim, ennis stussy, Eden valley, was murdered by the parolee of ray stussy, currently in the box, whose brother, emmit stussy, lives in Eden prairie.
-And?
-And, there's bad blood between the brothers, a run-in, one vehicle against another.
So, we're thinking things escalated.
Ray hires the ex-con to...
Listen to me.
There's a girl in england.
Nine years old.
Laura buxton, she's got a red balloon.
She ties a note to it.
"If found,
"please return to Laura buxton,"
and her address.
She lets it go.
Damn thing flies 30, 40, 50 miles, comes down in a field.
The words found by another little girl, also nine, also named, wait for it, Laura buxton.
That's...
A true story.
These things happen all the time.
Coincidence, random life.
Okay.
Here's another story.
Once upon a time, a guy named stussy hired an idiot to rob his brother, and the idiot drove to the wrong town and killed the wrong stussy.
I hate that story.
You know why?
You can't prove it.
Now, pack him up and get him out of here.
We got work to do.
(Choral music playing on radio)
(Varga sighs)
How's your wife?
My wife?
Please thank her for dinner the other night.
Those pork chops were delightful.
I, uh...
Yeah, she's a hell of a cook.
I'm not sure we can trust the Jew.
-Who?
-Feltz.
There's been some sneaking around.
Do you trust him?
Sy?
Some people think he's colluding with your brother.
What?
Who?
People talk, that's all I'm saying.
People you don't want to be talking.
I heard he broke into your bank.
Sy?
Raymond.
Access to a safety deposit box, et cetera, and, now, he would've needed a key, and where he might've gotten one?
An insider.
No, that's...
Buck drilled the lock is what sy said.
Is what sy says.
Or either, it's possible that your consigliere making a move and he's using your brother as a diversion, or worse, a straw man after all.
The name on the marquee is "stussy lots,"
but nowhere does it specify which stussy.
That's... he's...
I talked to sy.
He's onboard, all in with this, with us.
Trust me.
And he hates, trust me, hates ray.
Wishes I'd cut him out a long time ago.
Look.
We are making a souffle here.
Do you understand?
Lines of credit, capital acquisition, increased valuation.
It's how you turn a small business into a big business.
And it is fluffy, and it is delicious.
But you can't agitate while it rises, otherwise...
Poof.
It's... he...
He knows it's not sy, that this isn't...
He just wants to protect me.
From success?
I'll talk to him.
That's all I ask.
(Door closes)
(Elevator bell dings)
(Clicks tongue) Any calls?
Receptionist:
I left the slips on your desk.
Also, there's a man waiting to see you.
Oh.
Mr. stussy.
I'm agent dollard from the IRS.
Emmit:
That's...
What is this about?
Just a routine visit, or...
Well, maybe we could go to your office?
Great.
It's, uh, right back here.
-Do you mind if I...
-Please.
-(Emmit clears throat) -(Unlatches suitcase)
So, you said that this was just a routine drop in, or... (Chuckles) Yes.
And, no.
Routine, in that we make these kind of calls all the time, so routine for me. (Chuckles)
You made a withdrawal in the amount of $10,000 cash earlier this week.
-(Whispers) Motherfucker.
-Excuse me?
-What?
-You said?
Since when was it a crime for a citizen, a tax paying citizen to use their own money?
(Laughs)
No, sir, it's not a crime.
Not exactly.
But, uh, any transaction, deposit or withdrawal greater than $9,999.99, it triggers an alarm with us.
An alarm?
Not an actual alarm like at a fire station, that would be funny.
Spinning light, maybe get a pole.
No, it's more of an alert, a computer alert.
So, I've been dispatched by hq to ask a few questions.
They're simple questions.
Maybe take a look at your books.
My books?
Think of it like...
You been to the airport?
Recently?
In life, I'm saying you've been to an airport?
Yes.
Well, sometimes at the airport, when you go through the detector, the metal detector, or the radiographic scan, you get selected for additional screening, a pat down.
Maybe they swab your hands for explosives residue.
-What?
-Residue.
To make sure you haven't been, you know, building a bomb.
What are we talking about here?
Nobody's been building any...
No, of course not. (Chuckles) That's what I'm saying.
But because of your withdrawal, which I am required by law to question, you've been selected for additional review.
Screening, minimally invasive, day surgery, versus, say, having your colon removed.
Little IRS humor.
Isn't this... uh...
Don't you need a warrant for this?
Oh, no, sir, that's the FBI.
Uh, this is more of an informal kick-the-tires and all that, so that we can avert an actual audit.
An audit?
Are you crazy?
Sir?
It's... we...
-I'm sorry.
-Sure.
Our records are pristine, our books.
You could eat off them if that was your...
And that other gentleman in the next office, that would be Mr., uh...
Feltz?
It might be.
Sir?
No.
Uh, Mr. feltz is off today.
Family matter.
Oh, I see.
Well, I would need to talk to him as well, and any other senior members of your staff.
How many partners do you have?
Just how much time...
Like I said, this is just a baby step.
I'll park myself in an office, you know, do a few interviews, maybe look over your books.
An office?
Exactly.
Or a conference room, if that's easier.
Heck, I spent three months in the mailroom of a novelty store once surrounded by plastic poop and rubber vomit, so it doesn't have to be the riviera.
Okay.
Not a problem.
Uh...
I know just where to put you.
-Oh, good.
-(Laughs)
(Emmit clears throat)
(Unlatches suitcase)
Well, I appreciate it.
Shall we say 8:00 A.M.?
How about 7:30?
Perfect.
I'll see you then.
You betcha.
(Elevator bell dings)
Is he married?
What?
Was he wearing a ring?
Did he mention kids?
That can be used.
I have no idea what you're saying to me right now.
We can't...
The jig is up.
This isn't...
He's gonna park himself in an office.
An office!
Days, weeks, asking questions, reviewing the books.
He asked to see the books?
Yes.
That's all right.
We'll show him the fake ones.
That's... wait.
We have fake books?
(Ominous music playing)
(Upbeat jazz music playing)
Let's go deeper.
Away from the road.
Forty grand.
That, plus the 10 you stole, puts it 50.
My thought, then, is you should leave the state.
(Scoffs)
Two hundred.
And we want the stamp.
For what?
It's the principle.
What's this?
Nothing.
Something else.
It's okay, I got it.
(Clicking tongue) Sy, sy...
What's the matter, buddy?
You drank from the holy cup, but here you are.
Not being a good boy.
Sy:
This isn't that.
I'm sorry.
Who are you?
(Speaking in other language)
What?
He said pretty girls should only open their mouths
-when they see a dick.
-Oh.
And, just so I'm clear, which one of you is the dick?
-(Yuri laughing)
-Enough.
I'm handling this.
Okay.
Have you been to Siberia?
Have I been to Siberia, is that the question?
It's very much like this.
Except the dirt.
The earth soaking in blood, frozen red.
All of Russia.
Hundreds of years, millions the tsar killed, then it was Lenin, then Stalin.
Ten thousand, 20,000.
(Imitates gunshots)
But here you have, like, what?
Malls.
Few dead Indians.
Twenty million Russian died fighting Hitler, 20 million.
I see from your face that you can't even imagine that.
The pogroms, the starvation, 20 million more.
Mothers cooking and eating their babies.
That's why the snow falls white.
To hide the blood.
(Scoffs)
I'm leaving.
Ahh!
No!
(Groaning)
You don't have to... (Continues groaning)
This is what comes after the cup.

Phew.
Had a little scare for a minute.
The police, which...
I don't have to tell you, got my heart going real good.
But all fine now.
Babe?
Babe?
Nikki, what... honey?
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
Honey?

MAC DAVIS:
Back a few months ago,
I was headlining' a great big nightclub, and they put me up a couple days early.
I came in a couple days early, and they put me up in what they call the "Star Suite."
Now here I am, headlining' in one of the biggest nightclubs in the country, and I wake up at 8:00 in the morning in this "Star Suite"
all by myself.
AUDIENCE:
Aw!
DAVIS:
Yeah, that's what I said, "Aw."
But I did what I've always done, man, to cheer myself up,
I picked up my guitar,
I sat down, and I wrote me a little song.
Now this is how it feels to be alone at the top of the hill, tryin' to figure out why.

Oh, Emmit!
On the sofa, I thought, unless you're attached to a more classic bed narrative.
Non-descript, though, you know, the furnishings, so they can't tie it to us.
That's...
I think you solved it.
We can keep you in a shirt, hiding your difference.
Maybe in a cowgirl, or a doggy scenario, favoring our rears, in other words, keeping our faces slightly absurd.
"Obscured."
What did I say?
I'm glad we're doing this, babe.
Taking control.
This whole time, we've been playing to draw.
It's time we start playing to win.
I know, but blackmail...
We lost the high roller, babe.
Zip.
Gone.
I know, and I'm so sorry.
It's not your fault.
A day like you had,
I would have stopped for a sidecar, too.
I just lost track...
I know.
This thing with your brother has got us both upset.
To deprive a man of his career, endanger his female...
I panicked.
You're too hard on yourself.
You rallied, didn't you, in the end?
You're here.
We're together.
Maybe I can call the guy, the high roller,
- and say...
- What?
Really?
'Cause you lost your job at the parole board on account of banging your clients?
No, because I fell in love.
That's sweet.
You're sweet.
Hon.
Where did you go?
I...
Jesus!
I just love you so much.
No.
For Pete's sake, I'm wearing a hooker wig!
- Just hold on.
- Sorry.
No, just...
That's got to be bad luck.
Okay.
Now, go.
Babe, you're my everything.
I want we should spend the rest of our lives together.
You gotta ask.
Oh.
Right.
Nikki Swango, will you marry me?
Yes, Raymond Stussy, I will marry you.

(BOTH MOANING)
What the goddamn hell?
You have a fat wife.
Excuse me?
Which part of what I just said is giving you trouble?
This is my office.
A fat woman is inherently untrustworthy as she is a sensualist who sees no real difference between a pastrami sandwich and a dick in the mouth.
There's no call for that kind of language.
No.
A female Jew is especially vulnerable to the zaftig seduction of the forbidden, being part animal.
What are you doing?
Ah!
Do you know what a chicken is?
- What?
- A chicken.
Do you know what a chicken is?
A chicken is an egg's way of making another egg.
You see, it's all a matter of perspective.
The chicken sees it one way, the egg another, so let's start again.
This is not your office, just as your wife would not be your wife if I came to her in the night with a platter of cold cuts.
YURI:
Sit down, my friend.
You have shock.
All is well.
I'm just...
I'm not...
I need a minute.
No problem, no problem.
VARGA:
Have a drink, you'll feel better.
No.
Are you out of your mind?
YURI:
Nice drink, refreshing.
Are you threatening me?
(GUN COCKS)
No, no, no, the whole thing.
(CHOKING)
(COUGHS)
(RETCHING)
VARGA:
Yuri tells me you spoke to the police yesterday.
You can ask her, she came to me.
Not about anything, but there was a...
One of our cars was...
Some kind of accident.
A fender bender.
So, you know, unconnected to this completely.
You may have, during the course of the day, a strong impulse to act.
It's perfectly normal, a man of your station being forced to play the cuckold.
But remember, it's all a matter of perspective.
What's happening here is good.
You and I are partners now.
Contracts have been signed by the majordomo himself.
So, you see, lives are changing for the better.
And all you have to do is review the accounts, write up the deals, and approve the paperwork.
Do you understand?
Ah.
Yuri will show you to your new office.
Don't forget your mug.

Mrs. Goldfarb.
You must be Sy.
I am so glad we finally get to meet.
I've been pinching Buck's ear every time I see him.
Yes, yes, he told me.
And I must admit, I'm curious.
(CORK POPS)
(LAUGHS)
Are you all right?
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
Uh...
Of course, I just...
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
I had an upsetting experience this morning.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
To be honest,
I feel as if I've left the known world.
(CHUCKLES)
You ever had that feeling?
Like you, uh, stepped off the map into the, well, unknown, I guess?
That's how I felt when my Torvald died.
Oh.
My husband made his first million in mortuaries.
SY:
Hmm.
"Everybody dies, Ruby," he told me,
"You can't just leave them on the sofa."
(SY LAUGHS)
One night, he was eating a three-pound lobster and he had a stroke, and with it, a revelation.
Self-storage, that was the future.
The two businesses are surprisingly similar when you think about it, a place to put the things you'll never use again.
He died last year.
Complications from polio.
For six months, I wore black and tore my sleeves.
And then, I had a revelation of my own.
Parking lots.
The final piece to the storage triptych.
People are always going to need a place to park.
Amen.
I'll be honest with you, Mr. Feltz.
At my age, I'm not looking for a partner.
My preference would be to acquire the entire company, Stussy Lots Ltd., and I would be happy to let you keep the name intact if that worries you.
A second choice would be to buy several lots independently and build the business that way, but let's be honest.
That would make me your competitor, and, as my late husband always used to say,
"You don't want a Goldfarb for an enemy."
- I'm sure that's true.
- Mmm.
It's interesting that you should come to us now.
Problems?
No, not problems.
More of a softening of the will.
You see, Emmit Stussy, whom you'll meet, is a great man, a philanthropist, a leader, and, of late, he's been talking with increased regularity about dedicating himself in total to his good works,
i.e., the betterment of mankind.
Now, I suggested he take a step back and allow me to run the day-to-day, but he seems adamant that we stick together.
Pre-schools in Mumbai, health clinics in Inner Mongolia, better access to veterinary care.
And after all, how much money does one man need?
A lot, actually.
Women, more so.
And you'd be okay with that, selling a business that you worked so hard to build?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
I'm sorry.
There's... _
Uh... (STAMMERS) I forgot a very important...
We're closing on a new line of credit, and my girl got my calendar confused.
You go ahead.
Play hard to get.
(CHUCKLES) No, no, no, that's not...

Really.
I mean, at the right price.
But we should talk more.

We're in trouble here!
This is a...
Enemies are at the gates!
Inside the gates!
Fornicating with our cookware!
What is the point of you?
What?
The point.
What is the point of you?
You're supposed to be a fixer.
Nothing's fixed.
Everything's broken.
They sent my wife a sex tape.
Why would your wife wanna watch your brother have sex?
Not him, dummy, me!
Ray, in a wig, pretending to...
He shaved his mustache!
He and that... whore.
And you were supposed to stop them!
Don't come here moaning about, "We're in trouble."
Who was the one who found Ermentraub, the go-between which led to Varga?
Where was the diligence, the due diligence?
You said...
I wanted to go deeper, but you said...
"Enemies at the gates," who let them in?
I never.
You need to unchain me.
If I was free, my hands, I could...
Your brother wouldn't bother us again.
It's the Delilah.
This floozy is pushing him, putting ideas in his head.
And now, they think, my family, that I'm some kind of...
When all I ever did was...
And there's...
Look at me, there's good inside, a good person.
Of course there is.
Think of the children, the lives you help.
I'm not some kind of weakling that can't control his...
Twenty-five years, and never once did I look at a woman sideways.
Sit-down meetings with the doors open, professional always.
You're a model, a role model.
I look up to you.
Everyone I know.
You've gotta fix this.
Whatever it takes.
Shackles off?
And throw away the key.
(SOBS)
(SNIFFING)
I met with the widow Goldfarb...
Not...
Okay.
I can't...
So, nope, say it again?
(SIGHS) I'm saying Maurice, the fellow with his head caved in, it wasn't a random robbery.
He was hired by another fellow to rob somebody.
His brother.
Maurice's brother?
No, the brother of the fella that hired Maurice, both named Stussy.
- Like your stepdad.
- Exactly.
Probably gave Maurice an address for the brother, except he lost it.
Or forgot it, at which point,
Maurice makes the wrong choice.
Drives to the wrong town, takes a name out of the phone book.
Also Stussy.
And you know what happens next.
New chief's not gonna like this.
(SIGHS) He doesn't have to like it, it's factual, we think.
Makes more sense than the other at least.
DONNY:
He's still not gonna like it.
Well, you don't have to like the truth for it to be true.
You sure?
We're gonna visit the parole office today either way, face the hiring brother.
And see if you can't track down this Vanessa who rented the apartment that lost an air-conditioner.
I'm thinking they might be connected.
What do you think?
Bigger size.
Don't you think it'd be more comfortable?
RAY:
Yeah?
We have something in a 44.
NIKKI:
We'll try that.
You're sweating.
It's just... (SOFTLY) It's a lot of money, 100 grand.
Are you sure?
I mean, we could ask for less...
Are we worth less?
You and me, our value, I'm saying, to the world?
What makes him rich, and us not?
Larceny.
Your brother stole from you, your birthright, like the snake in the garden, and then he built this falsehood.
Self-made man, my ass.
That business is your business, that mansion is your mansion on account of the stamps.
What he used to build this empire.
What's fair here is complete surrender.
We're compromising by asking for 100 grand.
He is getting off easy.
Here you go.
Oh, yeah.
(CELL PHONE BUZZES)
You got me.
SY:
Congratulations, you're officially the stupidest person alive.
Who is this?
It's Menachem Begin.
Who do you think it is?
You made a sex tape and gave it straight to the wife.
No...
You left it on the stoop.
Three people live in that house.
What did you think was gonna happen?
Tears, were there?
She left, and took the mother-in-law.
So, whatever leverage you think you have...
He's gonna pay.
For what?
She left.
The way we figure it, that's money owed for startup fees.
Collateral Ray put down as a youth.
He's part owner in the enterprise, in other words.
We're not gonna stop till we get what's ours.
We should meet, you and me, hammer out an end to this.
The end is, you pay.
SY:
She watched the tape.
Asshole.
Asshole.
She watched the tape.
So, she believes, right now, her husband slipping dick to a redhead is a true story?
Factual?
We were asking 100 grand to keep her from knowing, now I'm saying 200 grand to tell her the other truth.
There is no other truth.
You sure about that?
We got video evidence
Emmit's screwing his secretary.
It's a fact.
It never happened!
That doesn't make it any less of a fact.
And I'm saying the price to convince her of the other truth is 200 grand.
Stussy Lot 350, one hour.
Baby, look at you.
Is it all right?
It's amazing.
I gotta do a girl thing.
I'll see you at home later?
You want me to come?
It's not like I gotta work.
You're sweet.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
What do you want?
EMMIT:
You're dead, do you hear me?
Oh, I'm dead?
That's...
- You got some nerve after...
- She saw it!
Stella, the tape.
Big whoop, I'm out of a job.
She left me.
Oh, well, you know, reap what you sow.
You should've done what's right when you had the chance.
Buddy, when I'm done with you, they'll be sponging you off the floor.
Yeah?
You'll be in the poor house making soup out of your dirty socks.
Fuck you.
Me?
Is that...
Is that what you're saying?
Fuck me?
- (BRAKES SCREECHING) - (RAY SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
You wanna fuck me?
I'll tattoo it on my fist and come over there!
Stuffed and mounted like a goddamn...
Yeah, fuck you!
So, if you know what's good for you, pay the damn money and pray that I'm satisfied!
Hello?
God damn it!
My mom.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
GLORIA:
Mr. Stussy!
(CAR DOORS CLOSING)
Chief Burgle, we met yesterday.
Uh, you know Officer Lopez.
RAY:
What's, uh...
We just had a few more questions.
I thought you said you weren't together?
We had an intersection of interest.
Shouldn't take long.
You wanna come inside, or...
Oh.
Better you come to the station with us.
Cleaner.
Okay.
I gotta be back by 6:00.
There's...
I got an appointment.
Oh, sure, we'll have you back.
RAY:
Look, I understand you got threads to pull.
I'm on the job, too, in probationary guise, but, still, we're both officers of the court.
GLORIA:
Got yourself fired yesterday is how I heard it.
Just now at your office.
That's...
Okay, I'm taking a little time.
Continuing my education, exploring a few...
'Cause it hit me one day.
You know, what if I could do more good in, like, a lawyer capacity?
You're going to law school?
Not, you know, officially, but...
Met with Mr. Feltz?
Sy Feltz?
He runs your brother's...
Oh, yeah, that's...
Like I said, there's no hard feelings there.
Just a minor traffic skirmish.
WINNIE:
You're saying Mr. Feltz was the driver of the offending vehicle?
No.
Why?
What did he say?
Look, it's a family matter is my philosophy.
Whatever past disagreements, bygones.
You know?
Think of Jesus, His actions.
So, there's bad blood between you and Mr. Feltz?
- No, I wouldn't say...
- What about between you and...
- What's the brother's name?
- Emmit.
Right, Emmit.
Emmit Stussy, who lives in Eden Prairie?
Did Sy...
Has he been making accusations?
'Cause I got...
Literally, my conscience is clear.
- Your conscience?
- Right.
I'm saying if we're being honest here and not to cast aspersions, but I've seen a lot of snakes in my day, and that man is a scorpion.
So, whatever he told you,
I'd take that with a huge sack of salt.
Maybe if you tell us how your car came to be damaged.
Like I said, it was an accident.
WINNIE:
He backed into your Corvette two times.
Mr. Feltz.
He's... (SIGHS)
There's jealousy there, how close we are.
Me and Emmit, our bond.
So, you're saying there's no beef with Emmit?
There's no bad blood?
No.
Emmit, we're...
I was best man at his wedding.
And his daughter's wedding, they had it in, uh, Mexico.
The invitation said "no shoes."
Can you imagine a wedding with no shoes?
(WOMEN LAUGHING)
Tell me more about your man, Maurice LeFay.
Well, he's not my... (SIGHS)
Just a number on a file, uh, one of the faceless masses.
Blew his piss test, like I said.
Uh, I would have rounded him up, except air-conditioner.
And, um, just so I'm clear, when's the last time you... (KNOCK ON DOOR)
One sec.
- We said 6:00, yeah?
- Yeah.
- No.
- Sheriff, before you...
I talked to Donny, let it go.
He told me what you're up to.
We're not up to anything, there's a suspect in the box.
A suspect of what?
Winnie Lopez, St. Cloud Metro.
We got a conflagration of names here.
Your victim, Ennis Stussy, Eden Valley, was murdered by the parolee of Ray Stussy, currently in the box, whose brother, Emmit Stussy, lives in Eden Prairie.
- And?
- And, there's bad blood between the brothers, a run-in, one vehicle against another.
So, we're thinking things escalated.
Ray hires the ex-con to...
Listen to me.
There's a girl in England.
Nine years old.
Laura Buxton, she's got a red balloon.
She ties a note to it.
"If found, please return to Laura Buxton,"
and her address.
She lets it go.
Damn thing flies 30, 40, 50 miles, comes down in a field.
The words found by another little girl, also nine, also named, wait for it, Laura Buxton.
That's...
A true story.
These things happen all the time.
Coincidence, random life.
Okay.
Here's another story.
Once upon a time, a guy named Stussy hired an idiot to rob his brother, and the idiot drove to the wrong town and killed the wrong Stussy.
I hate that story.
You know why?
You can't prove it.
Now, pack him up and get him out of here.
We got work to do.
(VARGA SIGHS)
How's your wife?
My wife?
Please thank her for dinner the other night.
Those pork chops were delightful.
I, uh...
Yeah, she's a hell of a cook.
I'm not sure we can trust the Jew.
- Who?
- Feltz.
There's been some sneaking around.
Do you trust him?
Sy?
Some people think he's colluding with your brother.
What?
Who?
People talk, that's all I'm saying.
People you don't want to be talking.
I heard he broke into your bank.
Sy?
Raymond.
Access to a safety deposit box, et cetera, and, now, he would've needed a key, and where he might've gotten one?
An insider.
No, that's...
Buck drilled the lock is what Sy said.
Is what Sy says.
Or either, it's possible that your consigliere making a move and he's using your brother as a diversion, or worse, a straw man after all.
The name on the marquee is "Stussy Lots,"
but nowhere does it specify which Stussy.
That's...
He's...
I talked to Sy.
He's onboard, all in with this, with us.
Trust me.
And he hates, trust me, hates Ray.
Wishes I'd cut him out a long time ago.
Look.
We are making a souffle here.
Do you understand?
Lines of credit, capital acquisition, increased valuation.
It's how you turn a small business into a big business.
And it is fluffy, and it is delicious.
But you can't agitate while it rises, otherwise...
Poof.
It's...
He...
He knows it's not Sy, that this isn't...
He just wants to protect me.
From success?
I'll talk to him.
That's all I ask.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Any calls?
RECEPTIONIST:
I left the slips on your desk.
Also, there's a man waiting to see you.
Oh.
Mr. Stussy.
I'm Agent Dollard from the IRS.
EMMIT:
That's...
What is this about?
Just a routine visit, or...
Well, maybe we could go to your office?
Great.
It's, uh, right back here.
- Do you mind if I...
- Please.
- (EMMIT CLEARS THROAT) - (UNLATCHES SUITCASE)
So, you said that this was just a routine drop in, or... (CHUCKLES) Yes.
And, no.
Routine, in that we make these kind of calls all the time, so routine for me. (CHUCKLES)
You made a withdrawal in the amount of $10,000 cash earlier this week.
- Motherfucker.
- Excuse me?
- What?
- You said?
Since when was it a crime for a citizen, a tax paying citizen to use their own money?
No, sir, it's not a crime.
Not exactly.
But, uh, any transaction, deposit or withdrawal greater than $9,999.99, it triggers an alarm with us.
An alarm?
Not an actual alarm like at a fire station, that would be funny.
Spinning light, maybe get a pole.
No, it's more of an alert, a computer alert.
So, I've been dispatched by HQ to ask a few questions.
They're simple questions.
Maybe take a look at your books.
My books?
Think of it like...
You been to the airport?
Recently?
In life, I'm saying you've been to an airport?
Yes.
Well, sometimes at the airport, when you go through the detector, the metal detector, or the radiographic scan, you get selected for additional screening, a pat down.
Maybe they swab your hands for explosives residue.
- What?
- Residue.
To make sure you haven't been, you know, building a bomb.
What are we talking about here?
Nobody's been building any...
No, of course not.
That's what I'm saying.
But because of your withdrawal, which I am required by law to question, you've been selected for additional review.
Screening, minimally invasive, day surgery, versus, say, having your colon removed.
Little IRS humor.
Isn't this...
Uh...
Don't you need a warrant for this?
Oh, no, sir, that's the FBI.
Uh, this is more of an informal kick-the-tires and all that, so that we can avert an actual audit.
An audit?
Are you crazy?
Sir?
It's...
We...
- I'm sorry.
- Sure.
Our records are pristine, our books.
You could eat off them if that was your...
And that other gentleman in the next office, that would be Mr., uh...
Feltz?
It might be.
Sir?
No.
Uh, Mr. Feltz is off today.
Family matter.
Oh, I see.
Well, I would need to talk to him as well, and any other senior members of your staff.
How many partners do you have?
Just how much time...
Like I said, this is just a baby step.
I'll park myself in an office, you know, do a few interviews, maybe look over your books.
An office?
Exactly.
Or a conference room, if that's easier.
Heck, I spent three months in the mailroom of a novelty store once surrounded by plastic poop and rubber vomit, so it doesn't have to be the Riviera.
Okay.
Not a problem.
Uh...
I know just where to put you.
- Oh, good.
- (LAUGHS)
(EMMIT CLEARS THROAT)
(UNLATCHES SUITCASE)
Well, I appreciate it.
Shall we say 8:00 AM?
How about 7:30?
Perfect.
I'll see you then.
You betcha.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Is he married?
What?
Was he wearing a ring?
Did he mention kids?
That can be used.
I have no idea what you're saying to me right now.
We can't...
The jig is up.
This isn't...
He's gonna park himself in an office.
An office!
Days, weeks, asking questions, reviewing the books.
He asked to see the books?
Yes.
That's all right.
We'll show him the fake ones.
That's...
Wait.
We have fake books?
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
Let's go deeper.
Away from the road.
Forty grand.
That, plus the 10 you stole, puts it 50.
My thought, then, is you should leave the state.
(SCOFFS)
Two hundred.
And we want the stamp.
For what?
It's the principle.
What's this?
Nothing.
Something else.
It's okay, I got it.
(CLICKING TONGUE) Sy, Sy...
What's the matter, buddy?
You drank from the holy cup, but here you are.
Not being a good boy.
SY:
This isn't that.
I'm sorry.
Who are you?
(SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)
What?
He said pretty girls should only open their mouths
- when they see a dick.
- Oh.
And, just so I'm clear, which one of you is the dick?
- (YURI LAUGHING)
- Enough.
I'm handling this.
Okay.
Have you been to Siberia?
Have I been to Siberia, is that the question?
It's very much like this.
Except the dirt.
The earth soaking in blood, frozen red.
All of Russia.
Hundreds of years, millions the tsar killed, then it was Lenin, then Stalin.
Ten thousand, 20,000.
(IMITATES GUNSHOTS)
But here you have, like, what?
Malls.
Few dead Indians.
Twenty million Russian died fighting Hitler, 20 million.
I see from your face that you can't even imagine that.
The pogroms, the starvation, 20 million more.
Mothers cooking and eating their babies.
That's why the snow falls white.
To hide the blood.
(SCOFFS)
I'm leaving.
Ahh!
No!

Twice now, right?
They're probably at the Fellowship Awards.
Tonight, we honor two of our own.

I was gonna... do this another time,
- but it's been quite a night.
- What are you doing?
And, uh, why not?
Can you, uh, can you hold that for me?

I'm a little freaked out.
Yeah, no.

I don't feel great.

He's okay.
I can't think about that right now.
All right, Grace, I'm gonna need you to calm down, all right?
Calm down for me.
Take a breath.
I'm gonna take my finger out and put a stitch in this.

Extraocular movement is normal.
Reflexes are brisk.
Okay, fluid in the pericardial and peritoneal cavity.
There it is.

I like that tattoo.
Tell me about it.
What is so special about February 7th, huh?
That's the first time I got shot.
That's why it's so funny.
"February 7, 2014."
"Rival gang members open fire in a busy commuter walkway."
I know, and almost killed Charlie and I in the process.
Alex, you and Grace were at the same random shootings two years apart.
Talk about a connection.
It's actually...
It's creepy.
Let's prep her for an emergency lap and hope like hell there's no damage to her colon.
Yeah, not to mention her spleen, pancreas, and stomach...
Holy hell.
Is that a ring?
Uh, yes.
Another time, my friend.
Can you prep her for surgery?
I gotta talk to the mother.
Mrs. Summerville?
- Yes.
Are you the doctor?
- Mm-hmm.
Where's my daughter?
She's been brought up to an operating room.
She's okay, right?
I mean, she's going to be okay?
Well, she is in serious condition.
Why don't you have a seat?
No, I'm good.
I just... just tell me.
Okay, well, Grace has suffered a gunshot wound.
And the bullet has caused damage in her abdomen.
The bullet.
Another bullet.
You know, honestly, when I got the call,
I thought it was some kind of sick joke.
You and your daughter seem to have the same sense of humor.
Um...
I need a priest.
- A priest?
- Yeah.
A priest.
I mean, I can't go through this again.
There's gonna be somebody I can talk to to...
Yes, of course.
I'll find someone.
She didn't deserve this, okay?
- Any of it.
She's...
- No.
No.
No one does.
As soon as we know anything, all right?
Okay.
If you'll excuse me.
How's he doing?
If glass is made from sand, how come you can see through it?
How much morphine did you give him?
- All of it.
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.
- Hi.
I've got Sekara running triage.
It's not really filling me with confidence.
- You got him?
- Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
We're good.
Okay, as soon as imaging opens up,
- we'll get him right in there.
- See if I have any fractures.
I'm more worried about your spirits.
Oh, when the spirits are willing, maybe, but the flesh is weak.
Charlie, seriously, is there anybody here that we need to worry about?
No.
No, uh, no Crenshaws in the house.
But, um, I'm okay, 'cause I got a morphine drip.
I got my ex-wife waiting on me hand and foot.
And Jackson's bringing me nachos.
I'm all good.
You go save that girl.
Right.

- I'll...
I'll call her.
- No, no, no, no, I'll do it.

Okay, before you do anything,
I want you to stop by the lab and make sure those Fellowship cocktails are out of your system, okay?
Of course.
Call the sitter, pee in a cup, find a priest.
- Williams.
- Hey.
- Oh, you came back in.
- Oh.
Oh, great, great.
I came back in as soon as I heard.
Yeah.
Oh, good.
You know, hey.
You get to stand around with the rest of us worried schmucks, right?
You know, human component aside, would've been helpful if a few more people got shot.
What?
No.
I'm not talking about a bloodbath...
- Dr. Kinney.
- No, I just...
God, I was kidding.
Right?
Joking.
It was just that we all came running back in to help and there's nothing to do.
Bed 3.
Guy's been waiting for a plastics consult
- for over an hour.
- Thank you, Storms, for being the slowest surgeon on the planet.
Come on, let's go.
We're up.
25-year-old Dustin...
Meyer.
Hey, Dustin.
You can call me Dr. Dustiny.
Um... yeah, that's not gonna happen.
You wanna tell us what you did?
Fell off the stage.
Oh.
Ow.
Um... let's take a look here, shall we?
So, Dustin, you're a... dancer?
Stripper.
Yeah.
Down at Lumberjaxxx.
And that's with, uh, three X's.
Yeah.
Looks like a subcutaneous extrusion of an implant through the fascia.
What does that mean?
What-what happened to my ass?
Um, the force of the impact caused a fascial tear, and your gluteal implant herniated.
Your, uh, your-your fake butt flipped.
So, just... unflip it.
What?
You-you guys can fix this, right?
Blood work all checks out.
Looks like you dodged a bullet.
You know what I mean.
You're gonna be fine.
It's not me I'm worried about.
It's that girl.
Could you get that for me?
That could be the sitter.
Other pocket.
Other pocket.
Charlie Harris' phone.
You won a cruise.
Hang up.
What?
It could be a great honeymoon.
Better than that disastrous one that we spent at Niagara Falls with that heart-shaped bed that wouldn't stop vibrating.
Well, I guess it did distract us from the ant problem.
So the suspense is killing me.
What did she say?
We didn't get that far.
You're worried she's gonna say no.
You are such a guy, Charlie... in a good way.
She's gonna say yes.
Yeah, what makes you say that?
Because I've seen the way that she looks at you and...
I know that look.
Dawn?
What?
I can't feel my hand.
Oh, come on.
"Back in 20"?
Damn it!
Hey, hey.
Excuse me.
You do know you're in a chapel, right?
Yeah, sorry.
I was looking for the hospital chaplain.
Have you seen him?
Uh, no.
And good luck with that, 'cause I'm here all the time and I've yet to meet the man, so...
- Great.
- What was your name?
Alex Reid.
Emmanuel Palmer.
Vascular.
Endovascular.
Interventional radiology.
I heard about the shooting, so I...
So you came here to pray.
But before I became a doctor I was, uh, in the seminary.
So you're a priest?
Uh, a failed one.
I dropped out.
Close enough.
Come with me.
Why'd you drop out of the seminary?
Uh, long story.
Whose pee is that?
That's her.
Yeah.
Can kinda tell by the thousand-yard stare.
Oh, Jackson.
You headed to the lab?
With bells on, Dr. Reid.
- Put a rush on this for me.
- Okay.
Mrs. Summerville:
I just need her to be okay.
I'll sit with her, do what I can.
She's in good hands, okay?
So it doesn't matter if she's awake, right?
I mean, it still counts?
She'll be absolved?
- Yeah.
- What's going on?
Uh, Ruth here has asked me to deliver Last Rites to her daughter.
Ruth, why do you think she's gonna die?
Because she's cursed, and I-I wanna be sure.
- You're gonna do it, right?
- We're not there yet, Ruth.
- Okay, you don't understand...
- I promise you.
If things don't go well in that surgery, there will be time for that.
But right now I'm gonna go in that room, and I'm gonna save your daughter's life.
So your implant is hidden in the gluteal crust.
Sounds like something you get at Pizza Hut.
Which means, unfortunately, until the swelling goes down, we're not able to operate on you, Dustin, so...
No.
Nobody calls me Dustin.
Well, I'm not calling you "Doctor."
Look, why don't you go home, sit on some ice?
When everything settles, you come back in, we'll repair the implant.
Yeah, but how long until I get my butt back?
It could be several weeks.
- No dancing, obviously.
- Dude.
Guys...
Dancing's all I've got.
No show, no dough.
You have no idea what it's gonna be like to be sidelined for so long.
No, actually, Dr. Kinney is coming off of a leave of absence herself, so...
Sorry.
Not in your stars.
Hey.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
Just, um...
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Um, Dr. Kinney...
I have never understood the appeal of strip clubs, you?
- I...
- You know, apparently, some of them actually serve food.
Can you imagine?
I mean, $10.99 for a steak sandwich and a face dance?
There is not enough hand sanitizer in the world.
Uh...
What?
Everything-everything okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
Were we thorough enough in there?
We didn't exactly run through the checklist manifesto.
Keep it in your pants, Williams.
Book him a follow-up in three weeks and discharge him.
And, you know, next time you get the urge to share a personal tidbit of mine with a patient, do me a favor... don't.
Can I get more suction?
I could really use my eyes here.
More suction here, too.
Amazing she was walking around after being shot.
Bullet must've only grazed the aorta.
There's just minor bleeding from the gastrocolic vessels.
First bit of luck this girl's had.
Yeah.
Long Metz.
I'm gonna incise the reptroperitoneum and find that bullet.
Whoa!
Bleeder!
Spoke too soon.
There must be a tear in the aorta.
Reptroperitoneum must've been tamponading the injury.
Until we opened her up.
- Doctor Sharpe!
- Already on it.
Pushing more blood.
Can somebody get that?
I'll need an aortic clamp and a 4-0.
-
- Dr. Reid?
What?
The lab.
You're clear to operate.
- Oh, good thing.
- Screw that bullet.
I'm gonna cross clamp the aorta at the diaphragm.
Give us more time to find the tear.
And then suture it closed.
But once I cut off the blood supply, she's got maybe five minutes before her other organs shut down.
- Five minutes?
- Clamp.
Three minutes since the aorta's been clamped.
No other bleeds that I can see.
That's what I like to hear.
Where is it?
Come on.
Come on!
There it is above the left renal artery.
Needle driver.
Ready for the surgical version of the 100-meter dash?
- Whew.
- 1 minute 40 seconds left.
So... about that ring.
Not really a good time, Maggs.
1 minute 34 seconds.
Really not helping.
Ah...
And... we are done.
With several seconds that I am no longer counting to spare.
Sutures look good from here.
Let's get ready to ease off that clamp.
Keep an eye out for any other bleeders.
Preparing to remove clamp.
Let's hold our breath, everyone.
She may still have a leak.
Come on, Grace.
Holding.
Oozing a bit, though.
Dr. Sharpe, what's her Pro Time?
Twice normal.
That liver does look cirrhotic.
She's at major risk for bleeding out.
I need to go talk to the mother.
Okay, I'll push clotting factors and FFP like crazy.
And when you get back, we're gonna talk about that ring.
Ruth?
Grace is alive.
But she is having trouble clotting.
Does she have a liver disease that you're aware of?
She was born Hep C positive.
It was because of me.
I had her when I was 17.
I was using whatever I could get my hands on.
You know, dirty needles.
I gave her up.
She had a good family.
They were good to her.
They took care of her.
And then I came back into her life, and I ruined everything.
I'm sure that's not true.
She found me a couple years ago.
You know, one of those agencies, and, uh...
Right after we reconnected, she was shot.
For the first time.
Hey.
Hey, that's just a coincidence.
Every time.
Every time we get close, something bad happens.
Ruth, listen to me.
Luck's not in charge here.
I am.
Next few hours are critical, and we're doing everything we can to manage her bleeding.
Just hang in there and you will see her, all right?
Dr. Dustiny?
Oh, sorry.
Did I wake you?
No, dude, it's cool.
I was just, uh, just resting my ass.
Little drowsy, I guess.
Your discharge papers.
Ah, you're kicking me out of here already, with an ass like the Elephant Man.
- Just until the...
- Swelling goes down.
Yeah.
I know.
I know.
I'll get you some crutches before you head out.
Dustin, have you been using cocaine?
What?
Like recently?
I'm not judging.
Everything you say in here is privileged.
I just celebrated five years sober.
Never dance without it.
It reminds me of messier times.
Right.
Could you have a cold, maybe?
No.
Strike two, Doc.
In my line of work, you become immune to everything.
I'm like a kindergarten teacher.
Except my classroom is full of horny housewives
- pelting money at me.
- Charming.
Yeah.
You don't ever feel exploited?
No.
Men can't be exploited.
It's a scientific fact.
You know, it's not just about the money.
I like making people happy, always have.
I think I'm pretty good at it, too.
Oh.
See?
All right, I should boogie.
I know what it's like when someone's hogging the champagne room.
Thanks.
Oh.
Ah...
Dustin?
Sorry, can you walk back towards me?
You're zig-zagging.
Okay, I need you to lay down and, uh, tell me again exactly how you fell.
Dr. Kinney?
Your patient in 3, can you move him out?
I could use the bed.
And by "I," I mean Dr. Miller.
I would love to, but I don't have a patient in 3.
Your, uh, Magic Mike?
I told Williams to discharge him.
You did?
Of course you did.
Yes, 'cause, uh, she told me, and, uh, so I'll just go check...
- I'll get back...
- Sekara, why are you walking backwards?
Is your ass broken, too?
- Hey.
What's going on?
- I can explain.
- Please.
- I was following a hunch, and I think Dr. Dustiny...
I mean, Dustiny...
Dustin...
I think he has a skull fracture.
When he fell off the stage, he also fell onto his right ear, and his gait was affected.
And the clear liquid coming from his nose wasn't from drug use.
- Brain fluid?
- Good catch, Cass.
Well, I need to check with Dr. Hamza to confirm, obviously.
So?
What are you waiting for?
Go follow your hunch.
All right, Charlie.
You have a bleed that is increasing the pressure, cutting off the circulation to your arm.
So what I'm going to have to do...
You're going to thread the balloon through the catheter into my arm.
Once you find the bleed, you'll inflate the balloon, hope like hell the bleeding stops... any questions?
- Tough crowd.
- Forgot my audience for a second.
Um, you know, you guys need to top me up.
This thing's really starting to kill.
Unfortunately, you are maxed out, my friend.
- I'd like a second opinion.
- He's right.
No more meds.
Well, you're no fun.
And you're not my friend.
Charlie doesn't have any friends.
Thank you, Dawn.
No, seriously, you guys,
I'm-I'm in a lot of pain here.
Have you tried mindful breathing, Charlie?
Charlie's more of a old school kind of guy.
Old school kind of guy?
Well, old school, meet new school.
This is what I call Zen surgery.
Dawn.
You won't even know I was here, Charlie.
Like I was a-a ghost.
The lights are getting brighter and I don't know what to do.
Well... well, don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Surgically speaking.
Well, do I go towards them or run like hell?
You stay away.
Stay away from the carotid artery.
Oh, God.
Uh, Doc...
Dr. Palmer?
I'm having trouble controlling the artery.
I need to go towards the light.
The bleed must be bigger than we thought.
We need to get him to the O.R. now.
- You wait.
- No, I can't, Charlie.
We don't get you to the O.R. now, you may lose that arm.
Doc.
I'm a cardiac surgeon.
I don't need a babysitter for an arterial repair.
I wouldn't dream of it.
But another set of hands and eyes never hurts, right?
And why should those hands and eyes belong to you?
Just consider me your vascular parachute.
Oh.
No wonder I have you on nights.
All right, so what's the plan?
We find the bleed, sew it up, save Charlie's arm.
- And Plan "B"?
- There is no Plan "B."
Plan "C" is you get too frisky in there, I turf you.
But how is there a Plan "C" if there's no Plan "B"?
Well, you've obviously never operated with the Chief of Surgery before.
So was Nancy Drew right?
No, you mean...
Dr. Williams?
- Yeah.
- Well, looks like you owe your resident a steak dinner.
Oh, I'm a vegetarian.
Oh.
Then an expensive chickpea salad.
Look, the fracture runs along the anterior skull base
- through his cribriform plate.
- And if I'd sent him home?
He probably wouldn't have made it to work Monday morning.
Well, he doesn't work mornings.
What?
Just saying, he's a stripper.
This scan is from Bed 3?
Your-your patient in Bed 3?
No, no.
He needs an O.R. right away.
Yeah, that's why we're here.
When can you operate?
Me?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
My colleague, Dr. James...
he'll do the procedure.
Mm-hmm.
You know him.
Well... back in the day, after Victor, before Jonathan,
I was a committed patron at his place of business.
I just...
I-I never had you pegged for a-a Lumberjaxxx kind of guy, Shahir.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Dr. Dustiny.
Due to his obvious assets...
- and the whole doctor thing, that was...
- Mm-hmm.
He was one of my favorites.
You can still operate on him.
No, no.
No, I'm too close to this one.
You operated on Charlie twice.
Yeah, but that's different.
What I got up to at Jaxxx, it's not physically possible
- to get any closer...
- O-okay, yeah.
Just stop.
Shahir, you're the right man for this job.
Be his Shahiro, Dr. Hamza.
Yes.
Yes, I will do it.
But, Dana, I'll fix his head, but you better save that ass.
- Shahir.
- Hmm.
You're hurting me.
Okay, everybody get ready.
There's gonna be a lot of blood.
Should I, uh, be standing by with a mop?
- Oh!
- Oh, okay!
Uh, I wasn't commenting on your technique, just the amount of blood loss.
It's not that.
It's-it's this arm.
Okay, it's not a bigger bleed.
It's a different pulsatile bleed altogether.
Sponges.
More, more.
I, uh, probably don't want to see this.
Yeah, me neither.
There.
Nice tux.
Yeah.
Guess I could say the same thing for you.
Mm.
Clever Concoctions.
Sorry?
It's the catering company.
They own it.
Right.
I can help you with that bow tie.
Uh, you can't, actually.
Trust me, I've tried.
It's one of the many mysteries.
Well, it looks cool like that, too.
- It's very Clooney.
- Hmm.
Like you're at the end of a long wedding night.
Well, that's funny.
I actually proposed tonight.
It's to my doctor, isn't it?
I saw you two at the dinner.
You know, the first time we were supposed to get married,
I, um... well, we got into a car accident, and I ended up in a coma for eight months.
And when I woke up, I could talk to, um...
Dead people?
Spirits.
And because of that, the second time we were supposed to get married,
I didn't show up.
Well, you know what they say.
Third time's a charm?
- You should show up.
- Right.
Anyway, things haven't been, uh, all that great lately.
So, you decided to double down.
Put a ring on it.
Yeah, apparently I do that.
Well, can I see it?
What?
The ring.
Well, actually, she's got the hardware.
I just...
I just have the fancy box.
Oh, Dr. Kinney, I wanted you to know that Dustin's surgery went off without a hitch.
And you what?
You wanna gloat?
It's not really my style.
I prefer a quiet, self-congratulatory smugness.
I wanted to apologize.
For what?
Saving a patient's life?
I'm the one who should apologize.
Oh, no.
No, there's no need.
Really.
I can't imagine what you've been through, Dr. Kinney.
Yeah, too much to take an ass implant seriously anymore, apparently.
Getting sick and-and... coming back, I...
I'm having a hard time.
A hard time what?
Believing in anything.
I just...
Everything has changed, and I, um...
It's just, it's scaring the hell out of me.
And, um, seeing how your hunches have been bang on today, Williams, tell me, what should I do?
I don't know.
Right.
Thanks, kiddo.
Good talk.
Ruth?
Where you going?
Um, just gonna go get some air.
Don't leave.
I have to.
If the next few hours are critical,
I shouldn't be here.
Yes, you should.
Grace needs you.
She needs me to do what's right, and for the first time in my life, that's what I'm gonna do.
But you can't possibly think that this is the right thing to do.
So, what, you'd rather I just stay here and wait for something bad to happen again?
Because I'm not gonna let it.
Ruth, none of this is your fault.
Yes, it is.
I can't explain it.
Some people, you put them together, and no matter how much they love each other, they just don't work.
They just don't.
And if you deny that, it's dangerous.
I don't believe that.
You have a child who needs you, and nothing else matters.
If you walk out that door, you're gonna regret it.
Don't do it.
Is it...
No.
No, no.
Uh, it's another patient.
I'm sorry.
I've gotta go.
Dawn.
What's wrong?
The arm has been bleeding for hours.
If I could just restore perfusion...
The arm may be too far gone already.
You wanna amputate?
Is that what you're telling me?
No.
That's not an option.
All right, let's see where we're at.
Removing the clamps.
Come on, Charlie.
We have perfusion.
It's gonna be okay.
We may have saved the arm, but like I said, it's been bleeding for a while.
So you're saying you may not be able to operate again.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Okay, let's tidy up and prepare to close.
Thank you.
How many more times can we do this?
Well, look who's here.
You had us scared, Charlie.
I, um, I would've thought you'd have been used to that by now.
You in pain?
Not anymore.
You know, I've been trying to put this hunk of junk on your finger for years.
You didn't think I'd forget?
No.
Charlie?
The light's too bright.
- Charlie, what's going on?
- Oh, no.
- I just wanted to say goodbye.
- What?
What is it?
Alex, where's Grace?
She's in recovery.
Her mother's with her.
- No, she's not.
- She's fine.
No.
You need to go to her now.
- Charlie.
Charlie, I was just with her.
- Alex...
- She's fine!
- Go to her.
I'm really scared.
Go now.
Ruth.
I should've gone.
You made me stay.
She's gone.
My baby's gone.
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.
I killed her.
No!
So can we officially call this the calm after the storm and make out?
Well, we have been up for 36 hours, so... that might be the only way we can stay awake.
Hey, whoa.
Oh, jeez.
Come in!
Am I interrupting?
- No, no.
- Kind of.
Dawn, um...
I need a minute.
All right, well, I should probably get to the E.R.
You know, emergencies and whatnot.
This seems serious.
Look, uh... you have been amazing to me through my entire illness.
Are you quitting?
No.
Thank God.
But...
Dawn, I have changed.
And-and I need to be the doctor to fit that change.
I'm not following.
I'm not really sure myself.
But I-I need to...
In the time that I have left,
I need to make it count.
I want to re-certify... as a trauma surgeon.
I want to save lives, not bums.
You wanna go back to school at your age?
Careful, careful.
Watch the ageism, Chief.
Dana, residency.
You-you would be rounding with the newbies, covering call every other night.
- Think about it.
- I'm up for all of it.
So what?
You expect me to just let you jump the queue?
I think I've earned that right, yes.
Dana, with all due respect, you wouldn't last a month as a resident.
You wanna bet?
Hmm?
Come on.
Really?
You're so sure?
Put your money where your mouth is, Chief.
Name your stakes.
Give me a consult.
Anything.
I don't have anything.
What about that guy?
He has an STI that he didn't get from his wife.
Mm, he's clutching his abdomen.
That's because she slugged him there.
- Congratulations, by the way.
- Why?
- Fellowship Award.
- I'd completely forgotten.
Yeah, the night did take a turn.
When I woke up this morning, I thought,
"Maggie, you've arrived."
"You're accepting your Fellowship Award,"
"and your cancer study is gonna save the world."
And then Charlie got shot, and that poor girl's...
And I don't get to care about any of it.
Okay, what you just said, all of that's still true, no matter what happened today.
The man I might be in love with is happy.
Genuinely happy.
With a woman that I really like.
And I lost a patient today... a sweet girl whose luck ran out.
This isn't what arrived is supposed to feel like.
Good night.
Without a doubt, craziest night of my life.
I'm still buzzing.
Yeah, well, saving lives will do that.
Mm.
News travels fast.
Yeah, sorry, I'm not exactly Jaxxx material.
Says who?
You know, Jaxxx isn't the only club in the world.
Cassie, what are you doing?
Somebody told me that men can't be exploited.
Oh!
I wanna test that theory.
Maggie, hold on.
Just...
I paid one of the medics to go back and grab it.
Congratulations, Maggie Lin.
You have arrived.
Thank you.
- Good night.
- Yeah.
Hey, beautiful.
Congratulations, by the way.
"The fault, Dear Brutus, is not in our stars,"
"but in ourselves."
Think Joel used to say that before he, uh, went into surgery.
Joel loved him some Shakespeare.
Yes, he did.
Pretentious little... whoo!
Grace didn't make it, did she?
No.
Must've thrown an embolus.
She was dead by the time I got there.
But you knew that already, didn't you?
I just spent the better part of the night trying to convince a mother that she wasn't bad for her daughter, and I was...
I was wrong.
How many times can you end up in a hospital bed?
How many more miracles?
One of these times you're not gonna wake up, and I...
I can't...
I can't bear that.
What are you saying?
You think we're cursed?
Alex, that's crazy.
Charlie... you talk to ghosts.
Don't talk to me about crazy.
And I...
I love you.
I love you more than I've loved anyone in my entire life, but...
But this?
Us?
We can't keep ignoring the signs.
There's a little boy... in his crib at home.
That's a sign.
And that ring on your finger, that's a sign, too.
Yeah.
I can't.
You look beautiful tonight.
Thank you.
Who are you talking to?
My beautiful wife, of course.
Not my beautiful best friend.
David, Joy.
Hey.
Hey.
Can you believe your dad is turning 60?
So old!
You know what he means to do?
Start eating soft foods so he won't have to get dentures in a minute.
That's not how teeth work, David.
- Huh?
- Okay.
We better go work on our speeches for your father.
Y'all better bring your A-game.
I've got a little something special planned for tonight.
You don't have to say that to Sam.
He kills it every year.
Ah, I guess I do, don't I?
All right, see you guys.
Later.
These speeches make me so nervous 'cause you know Dad's just gonna pick it apart.
Ums and ahs let the audience know you're not prepared.
You know what you're gonna say?
Please.
I spent the last year crafting two pages of hilarious jokes about Dad's mustache.
Damn.
That is good.
Hey, happy birthday, Lawrence!
Oh, hey, Mom.
Hi, Daddy.
My darling.
Son.
Dad, you... you shaved your mustache.
Yes, son.
One should never stop evolving.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to welcome my guests.
Look at you two all dressed up.
- Mommy.
- Come here, sweetie.
Hey, Mommy.
And Tim, look at you.
Give me a twirl.
Come on!
I love it!
Greetings.
Greetings, all of you.
My perfect wife and I would like to welcome you to the celebration of my 60th birthday.
Now, my family teases me about being too critical of the speeches that people make at events like these.
But I think they're exaggerating.
But now, if you're gonna make a speech, pretend that there's a little, tiny baby seated way in the back facing the wall.
That baby needs to hear your speech as well.
All right.
Enough with the formalities.
I think we all know what time it is.
Let's hustle!
Are y'all ready?
Let's do it!
Hey!
Whoo!
- So let's go.
- Later!
Hey!
Ho!
Whoo!
Uh-huh!
Whoo!
I'll never forget the day Mr. Duvet looked at me and said, "Son, you must have a great plan to be a great man."
Happy birthday, Mr. Duvet.
That was very good.
Thank you, Thomas.
Remember to enunciate.
Sam, these mustache jokes are great.
Well, solid gold, baby.
But they're useless now.
Don't worry about me.
My speech gonna be just fine, okay?
Sam, take it easy on us this year.
Oh, you know I won't.
Yeah, this guy.
All right now.
What the...
There are clowns here?
That's just Mr. Bones.
He's good friends with my dad.
I've never met a clown before.
You think you could introduce me?
Tim, does a circus bear shit on a toilet?
I don't know.
Hey, Mr. Bones.
Oh, hi, Sam.
- He knows your name?
- Yeah.
Uh, Mr. Bones, I want you to meet my best friend, Tim.
Hey.
I'm a little scared.
Is it gonna hurt?
Uh, where's your joy buzzer?
I'm not working tonight.
Uh, you're in costume.
I just left a job and I have another job right after this.
Well, if you could just do a little something for me, Mr. Bones.
I'm not Mr. Bones right now.
My name is Julian and I'm at my friend's birthday party.
Please, respect my privacy.
Talking about one gag.
Young man, asking me to perform here is like asking a mailman to go for a walk on his day off.
Wait.
Was that the joke?
I guess it's kind of funny.
I bet you drive a funny little car.
I drive a 2013 Malibu.
Oh, what the...
You know, I'm not gonna get every joke.
And when... when I got down to that hospital, they told me the bill had already been paid by Mr. Duvet.
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.
Uh, thank you very much, Joy.
You see, this is why microphone placement is so important.
When it's just perfect, you can hear you even through your tears.
Thank you, Joy.
Molly, what are you doing here?
Well, officially, I'm checking out a BE on Linwood, but unofficially, your parents invited me and they sat us next to each other.
Looks like they wish we were back together.
Well, they definitely wish we were back together.
Sam, what's wrong?
Hmm?
Nothing.
You're fiddling with your balls.
You do that when you're upset.
Now, who did this to you?
You know I can have anyone thrown in jail whenever I feel like it.
I don't even need a reason.
Oh, don't say stuff like that.
There was this one guy, innocent as a newborn baby.
I cuffed and stuffed him in the back of my car just to see what would happen and I was not disappointed.
- Stop.
Stop... stop it.
- He pissed himself.
Stop talking.
No one did anything to me.
It's just...
I don't have anything for my dad's speech.
But you crush it every year.
Oh, I know.
You don't have to tell me.
Sam, you're fiddling with your balls.

Oh, hey, Molly.

Ah, it's so good to see you two.

How did you do that?
Okay, I've got something.
It's a bit of a Hail Mary...

I'm going next.

Shit!
You were gonna sing "You Are My Sunshine"?
Our dad does love that song.
That was wonderful.
Thank you so much.
Now, some of you may remember that song from the Coen Brothers' movie,
"O Brother Where Art Thou?"
based on Homer's "Odyssey".
Now, if I may quote the great Homer,
Let's hustle!
Oh, boy, clown at a buffet.

What?
I mean, that is kind of a lot of rice.
Is that a joke?
I'm just hungry.
You're not gonna get pie?

I worked hard on them.
Oh, well, I'm sorry, because by the end of the night, these pies are gonna be flying around the room.
You wasted your time, ma'am.
Hey, back off my wife, man.
Hey, back off my husband, man.

Paste some eyes on your nipples and a mouth on your belly button.
Then take a giant top hat and put it over your head and shoulders.

That's a terrible idea.
Never mind.
Don't do it.
Why not?
That guy's doing it right now.
He likes that?
Hey, bud.
Your song was super cute.
Yeah, I know I was cute.
That's what I was going for.
Well, I was just trying to be nice.
- You want to be nice?
- Yeah.
Why don't you go get me a few drinks?
That bitch waitress won't get me a beer.

Okay, sunburn.
We're done here.
Oh.

Cover your ears.
You know what?
Santa Claus isn't real.
Oh yeah?
Then who gave me this huge hog?
He asked Santa for a huge hog.
And he gave it to him.
Look at you.
He's more than just a father, he's a friend.
I love you, Dad.
To the best father... in the whole wide world.
Well done.
Well done.
Uh, uh, do you mind if I say a few words here?
Does everybody remember when Mr. Duvet had a mustache?
Yeah, of course we remember!
It's fresh in our mind.
I can hear It's a couple minutes of that.
Great, because, um, I'm not saying
Mr. Duvet's mustache was big, but if you turned him upside down, he could be a push broom.
And it even looked like a push broom too, 'cause it always had food in it.
I mean, I've heard of a salt and pepper mustache, but Mr. Duvet's mustache was salt and pepper and pickles and onions.
I-I mean, you would see corn in his mustache, be like, "Wait a minute, we haven't had corn in weeks".
Look at that picture up there.
Is that Mr. Duvet or did Cousin Itt shave everything but his mustache?
You are gonna make me throw up.
Mr. Duvet doesn't have the greatest mustache in the world.
He has the second-greatest only to Aunt Lacey!

He's got the shit out of me.
Uh, Samuel.

Hmm?

Oh, please.
Oh, look, there's Molly.

Tonight, as we celebrate all that you have been, remember, we also celebrate all that you will be.
Happy birthday, Mr. Duvet.

Mom, I know.
Oh, my God.
Oh, no.
You're gonna do a spit take, right?
No spit take?

Look around, kid.
The only clown in this room is you.
Sam, am I a clown?
Tim, I'm really freaking out right now.
I mean, I've got nothing.
What am I gonna do?
Why are you stressed out about this?
You're always so good at things like this.
I mean, Tim, I could get up there and I could tell jokes and sing a song and get hands clapping and panties dropping.
This is a family event.
That's not what I what I want, you know?
Not tonight.
I just want to let my dad know how I feel about him.
You know, let him know that as I grow older,
I see myself becoming more and more like him, and it just lets me know that I'm headed on the right path.
Samuel, that was perfect.
You projected wonderfully.
I could hear you all the way in the back of the bathroom.
Thanks, Dad.

It's a time to reflect on your life.
The past and future happenings.
I am very happy because today is my birthday.
Let's hustle!
Superior Donuts S01E11
Well, I'm off.
Arthur, put that on my tab, will you?
Oh, you out of money again?
No, I've just got it taped to my stomach.
What?
Yeah, last week I was pickpocketed, and I don't want it to happen again.
But if you insist.
Well, actually, it's $1.25.
I think I've got some change.
I hope this is a quarter, not a nipple.
No, no, no, stop, stop.
We'll call it even.
- Bless you.
- Eh.
- Hello.
- 'Sup?
Randy, my dear friend, you accidentally left that ticket on my Mercedes.
Uh, you were parked in a loading zone.
That's because I was loading my mouth with fro-yo.
Sorry, Fawz, the law's the law.
Why don't you just park in the alley?
That spot's always open.
No, no, that's my spot.
I'm gonna park my motorcycle there when I finally get one.
Then we can park the hearse there after you go for your first ride.
Well, I will fight this in court!
Well, that'll cost you more.
Then I will pay this today!
Hey, Randy, you let people park in that loading zone all the time.
Yeah, well, not this week.
They're having a contest down at the station to see who can write the most tickets, and the pot is up to 800 bucks.
- Whoa.
- You remember,
I got that kid going to Northwestern.
800 bucks?
That'll pay for at least 14 minutes of class.
Hey, baby.
Hey, Honeybutt.
How's the conference going?
Hey, Franco, what'd I tell you about video telephoning at work?
I-I don't remember, 'cause I started laughing as soon as you said "video telephoning."
Well, say good-bye to Honeybutt and go get a fresh batch of fritters.
Fine.
All right.
Well, I guess I'll see you later?
Oh, no, no, this is fine.
I can talk to you and do my job at the same time.
It's called multitasking.
Well, if that's true, tell me something.
Can you see my bra through this shirt?
No.
What about now?
Oh, damn!
Oh, damn!
Damn!
Damn!
What happened in here?
My computer.
This.
Oh... no.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You can use my typewriter anytime you want.
Brand-new ribbon.
Damn.
It's definitely broken.
They said it would cost more to fix than to buy a new one.
- That sucks.
- I know.
We've been through so much together.
Got me through high school, gave me my first e-mail address, saw me through my Asian girl phase, my big-butt phase, my big-butt Asian girl phase.
Who knows where you would have taken me next?
Long-haul lady truckers.
Man, I was gonna apply to art school with that computer.
Where am I gonna get the money?
How much you got in your savings account?
About 40 grand, but I'm saving up for a yacht.
Well, that doesn't seem like a...
I don't have a savings account, all right?
They charge $20 every time your balance goes below $200.
And right now my balance is... nine.
You really should save some money.
How?
I make minimum wage.
You know, minimum wage is not a livable wage.
And I know that from experience, because I chanted it at a Bernie rally.
Listen, Frank, I wish I could pay you more than minimum wage, but, uh, I afraid that's all I can afford.
Dude, I'm not asking for a raise, all right?
I just, uh...
I guess I got to find a second job.
But lucky for you, I've got more gigs coming in than I can handle.
How do you feel about digging pet graves?
Franco, I'm looking to hire a part-time assistant to work nights.
What kind of pets we talking about?
No, come on, you don't need another job.
All you need to do is learn to live on what you make.
You got a budget?
Yeah, I keep it down in my condo in Florida.
No, I don't have a budget.
I'm 25.
My budget is breakfast, lunch or dinner.
I'm gonna make one up for you.
You'll see.
If you're smart with your money, you can definitely support yourself on minimum wage.
Mm-hmm.
All right, but if you change your mind,
I have to bury a zoo bear tonight.
Definitely a two-man operation.
Damn this city.
What's wrong?
Nobody's breaking the law.
How am I supposed to win this contest if I can't write any tickets?
Ah, look at this guy.
He just parked legally, fed the meter.
Now he's feeding someone else's meter.
What a little bitch.
Here, let's see.
Actually, I see three violations.
Where?
Well, there's unlawful obstruction of a gas meter, consumption of food or drink on a bus, and improper number of riders on a bicycle.
Wow.
Did you memorize every single code in the book?
Of course.
You-you... you didn't?
No.
I'm attractive, and people like me.
Now come on.
I got money to win.
Hey, kid, all done with your budget.
And you'll be happy to know I found a way to make it all work.
All right, cool.
Wait. $40 a week for food?
- That's pretty high, huh?
- Uh...
How am I gonna eat on $40?
!
Well, just do what I do.
Every weekend, I fry up two pounds of ground beef.
Sunday is Taco Night.
Monday, it's Sloppy Joes.
Tuesday, it's spaghetti.
Wednesday, it's Fiesta Night!
Wait.
Wait.
Isn't that just Taco Night again?
Sí, señor.
Damn it!
Randy just wrote me a ticket for giving my wife a ride on my bicycle!
Look, Arthur, look, I appreciate you making this budget, man, but, uh, I'm young.
I want to have fun every once in a while.
Yeah, well, sometimes you have to make choices.
Besides, there's fun in there.
You get to fry up ground beef all weekend.
Fawz, look, are you still looking for a new assistant?
'Cause I can start there as soon as I'm done with my shift over here.
Great.
No, wait.
Wait a minute.
Are you crazy?
You can't work for Fawz.
You know what he is.
Yeah, he's a greedy, ruthless capitalist who would bleed people dry to make a buck.
Maya, stop!
I'm blushing.
Hey, believe me, kid.
Uh-uh, don't do that.
- Oh, you're offering me a raise?
- No...
Then don't tell me I can't take a second job.
Right now Fawz is my only choice.
So, hey, when can I start?
Hey, come by the dry cleaners when you're done here.
- We can discuss the terms.
- All right.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go fire my current assistant.
Hey, Francisco, you're fired!
Right after you drive me to lunch.
Oh, this is gonna be a long ride.
I should've thought this through.
Welcome to Fawz headquarters.
Oh, this is pretty disappointing, man.
I thought your office would be underground and filled with evil henchman and crocodiles.
I know it doesn't look like much, but first rule of business: keep your overhead low.
Besides, it has everything I need... a phone, a desk, and it's quiet.
- You get used to it!
- What?
!
You get used to it!
Yo, thanks for the opportunity, dude.
Franco, I came to America with three dollars and this eagle.
And I built all this from nothing.
And because I came from nothing, I'm very good to my employees.
- Have a seat.
- Cool.
Would you like some tea?
Yeah, sure.
My Mother-in-law.
All right, cool, man.
Um, so what would I have to do?
Well, at first, you can drive me around, maybe run some errands.
But the more you learn, the more I'll give you to do.
You'll be my right-hand man.
Word?
All right, okay.
So, what about the pay?
Ah.
Open for negotiation.
Tell me... what does Arthur pay you?
$10.50 an hour.
First lesson... never reveal your current salary.
Now I could offer you $10.75, and you'd take it.
I'll take it.
Now you counter-offer, but when you do, go high.
$20 an hour.
Opening with a joke.
Very good.
All right, $15.
I never responded!
Never negotiate against yourself.
And always be willing to walk away, like so.
Fawz?
Fawz, is that a yes?
That's a no!
Always keep them on their toes.
$13, my final offer.
- $13.50.
- Done.
- All right.
- And one more thing.
Mm-hmm.
- You're gonna work for me, you have to wear a suit.
We run a classy operation here.
Man, I ain't got money to buy a suit.
Not a problem.
What are you... a 34 short?
Mm-hmm.
- There you go.
- All right.
Won't they need this back?
Uh... not until Thursday.
Randy, you are so gonna win this contest.
I just gave a guy a ticket for loitering.
He threw it on the ground.
I gave him one for littering.
Wow.
You are on fire.
Get back out there and beat your record.
Okay.
Well, wait a minute.
Why aren't you out there?
'Cause you're doing such a great job.
You know, if I'm gonna do all the work, maybe I'll just enter the contest myself.
Oh, no, you can't do that.
We're partners.
Yeah?
Well, you weren't gonna share the money with me.
Well, what do you need money for?
Your next trip to Comic-Con?
Or, uh, Star Trek-Con?
Or Virgin-Con?
Oh, I'm just kidding.
They're all virgin-cons.
Well, good luck, okay?
Because no one knows their way around the penal code like I do.
I'm the penal master.
The penal...
Stop saying "penal."
Until I can get my body cam on.
Go.
- What's up, y'all?
- Oh!
You survived your first night with Fawz, huh?
I want all the gory details.
Uh, don't, don't start.
Not until I get a cup of coffee.
God, I wish I still smoked.
Hit me.
Actually, it was pretty interesting.
Fawz is teaching me so much.
Well, that was a waste.
Are we talking about the same Fawz?
Racist, misogynist, sexy?
Uh, I think you mean "sexist"?
I really need to get laid.
I'm telling y'all, Fawz is a smart businessman.
He actually taught me to negotiate my own salary.
Now I'm making $13.50 an hour.
Wow, Franco, that's great.
How is he able to pay you all that?
Well, he's always thinking of ways to cut costs so we can bring in more money.
You know, you should talk to him, man.
He could give you some advice and help you make this place more efficient.
Good morning, my protégé.
Or should I say, brotégé.
I brought you a suit for tonight.
Mr. Yakamora is on a cruise, so you can hold onto this one for eight more days.
Domo.
Arigato.
Hey, look.
Fawz says you have to dress for the job you want.
And apparently I want to be a tiny Japanese businessman.
Well, if Fawz says so, it must be true.
Sayonara.
Maybe it's a bald thing.
Nope, definitely not a bald thing.
Hey, Tush, what you doing?
I'm rehearsing for my TED Talk.
You're doing a TED Talk?
Not the fancy kind.
This woman pays me to talk to her husband, Ted.
He's depressed, I tell him stories about my life, and for some reason, it cheers him up.
Arthur, I need to borrow Franco for a meeting.
I hope that's okay.
Wait, who are we meeting?
The president of Fast Lube.
Oh, that's a big company.
Yeah.
If I can get my hand on those greasy jumpsuits, my bank account will be fatter than Mahira Moghadam.
She's like the Precious of Iraq.
Oh.
Yo, Arthur, is that cool?
No, it's not cool.
We don't close for another 30 minutes.
Man, come on, Arthur, there's, like, three people here.
It doesn't matter, you're still on the clock.
Well, I'll come in early tomorrow, all right?
You heard Fawz, this is a big meeting, and he needs me.
Wait a minute, you're just gonna leave?
Well, Arthur, you said it yourself, man, sometimes you got to make choices.
Come on, after the meeting, we'll drink tea and play Guess That Stain.
Arthur.
What is going on?
Last week you let him leave early 'cause he wanted to watch a marathon of Different Strokes.
Look, I'm his boss.
He shouldn't talk to me that way.
Uh-huh.
Is it that?
Or might you be just a little jealous because he's cheating on you with another older business owner?
Now you're just being crazy.
You know, it's okay to admit you want to be the guy that Franco looks up to.
Oh, come on.
He doesn't look up to Fawz.
He's just blinded by the money.
Money he really needs.
Yeah, I know.
Arthur, you've been doing the same thing around here for 40 years.
Maybe it's time to look at your own budget.
Try to find a way to give Franco a raise.
You mean I have to get rid of Fiesta Wednesdays?
Aw, Dios mío.
I'm talking about the shop.
There's got to be ways to cut some corners around here.
Excellent choice.
You sure?
This ain't too Ben Carson?
Can anything be too Ben Carson?
Franco, you have been doing a great job around here.
So great that I would like to give you a promotion.
Yeah?
How does vice president of operations sound?
Get the... yo!
Sounds like the president of operations better watch his back.
That's me.
Oh.
Well, you know what, man?
I, thank you, man, this is dope as hell.
Well, listen, Fawz Al-Shahrani is a big believer in diversity and inclusion.
And you can quote me on that.
- Okay.
- Oh, here they are.
Go ahead, quote me on that.
Hey, Fawz.
Franco Wicks, meet Marcus Brooks, the president of Fast Lube, and his associates.
Nice to meet you, Franco.
Yeah.
That's it?
I thought that handshake would have more steps.
Uh, d... uh...
Excuse us.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah.
- Yeah?
- What?
Okay.
This is why you hired me?
Huh?
Because you're all black!
Is a great color on you, wow.
Slimming.
Where have you been?
Out kicking your ass.
I just wrote 15 tickets in three hours.
I stood outside Wrigley Field and picked off the public urinators one by one.
Who's the penal expert now?
Damn.
Yep, and that contest ends in five minutes.
I got a three-ticket lead.
Sorry, nerd.
Cool kids win again.
Morning.
Morning.
How was the meeting?
Did you learn a lot?
You could say that.
Hey, you guys are out of paper towels in the ladies' room.
- I got it.
- No, no.
Uh...
Uh, we're not doing that anymore.
It's too expensive.
What?
Did you see the bath towel I put in there?
Oh.
So that's a communal towel, that's as clean as the dirtiest person who used it.
You know what, I'll just air-dry.
All right, Arthur.
I'm here to settle my tab.
Here's some change, separated by denomination and country of origin.
Should be about twenty bucks, based on exchange rates and a possible coup in Venezuela.
And there's 19 bucks left on this Circuit City gift card.
They went out of business five years ago.
You could've just said no.
Arthur, what are you doing?
Just asked Tush to pay up his tab.
Why you doing that?
Just a little belt-tightening around here, that's all.
Yeah, Arthur's trying to cut back a little so he can give you a raise.
Right.
I realize you can't live on ground beef alone.
Okay, thank you, but I don't want you changing this place.
You don't?
What about all that stuff you learned from Fawz about how to be a good businessman?
Turns out Fawz was just using me so he can bring in more "urban clientele."
You know what I really learned from Fawz is that that dude would do anything for money.
And I like that you won't.
I mean, having Tush run his tab here is what makes Superior Donuts what it is.
And you can't put a price on personal hygiene.
I don't like it any more than you do.
So that's a yes on the tab?
Great.
I just don't want you
- working for Fawz, that's all.
- Dude, I...
Trust me,
I would love to quit.
But right now I need the extra money.
Unbelievable.
My car was parked legally, and you still give me three tickets?
No, I didn't.
I did.
And we're officially tied.
Unlawfully tinted windows.
No front plate.
Oversized rims.
Mark my words, you will live to regret this.
And threatening a police officer.
That is nerds FTW, which means "nerds for the win"
Which you would know if you weren't so cool.
Damn.
I still got two minutes before the contest ends.
Hey!
You must be doing meth.
Nobody's that skinny in Chicago.
Hey, Fawz.
Maybe I can help you.
How'd you like to park your car in my space in the alley?
That would be amazing.
Thank you, Arthur.
No, I-I don't mean for free.
I mean, um, maybe I could rent it to you.
Yeah, um...
Fawz, how much are you spending a month on parking tickets?
Uh, $300.
Now I can charge you $250, and you'd take it.
I'll take it.
$275.
Are you crazy?
- Oh, well, I guess I'll just walk away.
- Yep.
You know, Shelly's Nails has been begging me
- to rent that space.
- Oh, really?
Shelly?
- Shelly would love the spot.
- Yeah.
Okay, okay. $275.
Deal.
Well, Franco, you just got a raise.
$275 a month.
Thank you, Arthur.
You're quite welcome.
All right.
And, Fawz, with all due respect, kiss my black ass.
I quit.
I am so mad at you right now!
But also proud.
Of how you screwed me over!
Which was masterful.
But I will get my revenge!
Okay, bye.
There you are.
I can see those big, beautiful eyes on my new computer.
Can you see me?
I can see you fine.
Hey, yo, thanks for the raise, dude.
This new laptop is better than my first one.
Well, I'm happy to do it.
This Skyping is amazing.
I know, right?
Hey, hold the phone up, man.
I'm getting nothing but your nose hair.
Randy, am I walking funny?
Because my pocket's feeling about $800 heavier.
Go on, have at it.
- You won.
- Yeah.
Actually, you'll be happy to know that I'm giving half my winnings to a good cause:
your daughter's college fund.
Oh, James.
You don't have to do that.
Well, like you said.
We're partners.
But I was so mean to you all week.
I feel terrible.
Then it was all worth it.
Superior Donuts S01E11
Well, I'm off.
Arthur, put that on my tab, will you?
Oh, you out of money again?
No, I've just got it taped to my stomach.

Fawz?
Fawz, is that a yes?
That's a no!
Always keep them on their toes.
$13, my final offer.
- $13.50.
- Done.
- All right.
- And one more thing.
Mm-hmm.
- You're gonna work for me, you have to wear a suit.
We run a classy operation here.
Man, I ain't got money to buy a suit.
Not a problem.
What are you... a 34 short?
Mm-hmm.
- There you go.
- All right.
Won't they need this back?
Uh... not until Thursday.
Randy, you are so gonna win this contest.
I just gave a guy a ticket for loitering.
He threw it on the ground.
I gave him one for littering.
Wow.
You are on fire.
Get back out there and beat your record.
Okay.
Well, wait a minute.
Why aren't you out there?
'Cause you're doing such a great job.
You know, if I'm gonna do all the work, maybe I'll just enter the contest myself.
Oh, no, you can't do that.
We're partners.
Yeah?
Well, you weren't gonna share the money with me.
Well, what do you need money for?
Your next trip to Comic-Con?
Or, uh, Star Trek-Con?
Or Virgin-Con?
Oh, I'm just kidding.
They're all virgin-cons.
Well, good luck, okay?
Because no one knows their way around the penal code like I do.
I'm the penal master.
The penal...
Stop saying "penal."
Until I can get my body cam on.
Go.
- What's up, y'all?
- ARTHUR:
Oh!
You survived your first night with Fawz, huh?
I want all the gory details.
Uh, don't, don't start.
Not until I get a cup of coffee.
God, I wish I still smoked.
Hit me.
(laughs) Actually, it was pretty interesting.
Fawz is teaching me so much.
Well, that was a waste.
Are we talking about the same Fawz?
Racist, misogynist, sexy?
Uh, I think you mean "sexist"?
I really need to get laid.
I'm telling y'all, Fawz is a smart businessman.
He actually taught me to negotiate my own salary.
Now I'm making $13.50 an hour.
Wow, Franco, that's great.
How is he able to pay you all that?
Well, he's always thinking of ways to cut costs so we can bring in more money.
You know, you should talk to him, man.
He could give you some advice and help you make this place more efficient.
Good morning, my protégé.
Or should I say, brotégé. (chuckles)
I brought you a suit for tonight.
Mr. Yakamora is on a cruise, so you can hold onto this one for eight more days.
Domo.
Arigato.
(laughs) Hey, look.
Fawz says you have to dress for the job you want.
And apparently I want to be a tiny Japanese businessman.
Well, if Fawz says so, it must be true.
Sayonara.
Maybe it's a bald thing.
(clears throat)
Nope, definitely not a bald thing.
♪
Hey, Tush, what you doing?
I'm rehearsing for my TED Talk.
You're doing a TED Talk?
Not the fancy kind.
This woman pays me to talk to her husband, Ted.
He's depressed, I tell him stories about my life, and for some reason, it cheers him up.
Arthur, I need to borrow Franco for a meeting.
I hope that's okay.
Wait, who are we meeting?
The president of Fast Lube.
Oh, that's a big company.
Yeah.
If I can get my hand on those greasy jumpsuits, my bank account will be fatter than Mahira Moghadam.
(laughs)
She's like the Precious of Iraq.
Oh.
Yo, Arthur, is that cool?
No, it's not cool.
We don't close for another 30 minutes.
Man, come on, Arthur, there's, like, three people here.
It doesn't matter, you're still on the clock.
Well, I'll come in early tomorrow, all right?
You heard Fawz, this is a big meeting, and he needs me.
Wait a minute, you're just gonna leave?
Well, Arthur, you said it yourself, man, sometimes you got to make choices.
Come on, after the meeting, we'll drink tea and play Guess That Stain.
(groans)
Arthur.
What is going on?
Last week you let him leave early 'cause he wanted to watch a marathon of Different Strokes.
Look, I'm his boss.
He shouldn't talk to me that way.
Uh-huh.
Is it that?
Or might you be just a little jealous because he's cheating on you with another older business owner?
Now you're just being crazy.
You know, it's okay to admit you want to be the guy that Franco looks up to.
Oh, come on.
He doesn't look up to Fawz.
He's just blinded by the money.
Money he really needs.
Yeah, I know.
Arthur, you've been doing the same thing around here for 40 years.
Maybe it's time to look at your own budget.
Try to find a way to give Franco a raise.
You mean I have to get rid of Fiesta Wednesdays?
Aw, Dios mío.
I'm talking about the shop.
There's got to be ways to cut some corners around here.
Excellent choice.
You sure?
This ain't too Ben Carson?
Can anything be too Ben Carson?
Franco, you have been doing a great job around here.
So great that I would like to give you a promotion.
Yeah?
How does vice president of operations sound?
Get the... yo!
(laughs)
Sounds like the president of operations better watch his back.
That's me.
Oh.
Well, you know what, man?
I, thank you, man, this is dope as hell.
Well, listen, Fawz Al-Shahrani is a big believer in diversity and inclusion.
And you can quote me on that.
- Okay.
- Oh, here they are.
Go ahead, quote me on that. (clears throat)
Hey, Fawz.
Franco Wicks, meet Marcus Brooks, the president of Fast Lube, and his associates.
Nice to meet you, Franco.
Yeah.
That's it?
I thought that handshake would have more steps.
Uh, d... uh...
Excuse us.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah.
- Yeah?
- What?
Okay.
This is why you hired me?
Huh?
(mechanical whirring)
(arguing indistinctly)
Because you're all black!
Is a great color on you, wow.
Slimming. (chuckles)
Where have you been?
Out kicking your ass.
I just wrote 15 tickets in three hours.
I stood outside Wrigley Field and picked off the public urinators one by one.
Who's the penal expert now?
(chuckles)
Damn.
Yep, and that contest ends in five minutes.
I got a three-ticket lead.
Sorry, nerd.
Cool kids win again.
Morning.
ARTHUR:
Morning.
How was the meeting?
Did you learn a lot?
You could say that.
Hey, you guys are out of paper towels in the ladies' room.
- I got it.
- No, no.
Uh...
Uh, we're not doing that anymore.
It's too expensive.
What?
Did you see the bath towel I put in there?
Oh.
So that's a communal towel, that's as clean as the dirtiest person who used it.
You know what, I'll just air-dry.
All right, Arthur.
I'm here to settle my tab.
Here's some change, separated by denomination and country of origin.
Should be about twenty bucks, based on exchange rates and a possible coup in Venezuela.
And there's 19 bucks left on this Circuit City gift card.
They went out of business five years ago.
You could've just said no.
Arthur, what are you doing?
Just asked Tush to pay up his tab.
Why you doing that?
Just a little belt-tightening around here, that's all.
Yeah, Arthur's trying to cut back a little so he can give you a raise.
Right.
I realize you can't live on ground beef alone.
Okay, thank you, but I don't want you changing this place.
You don't?
What about all that stuff you learned from Fawz about how to be a good businessman?
(scoffs) Turns out Fawz was just using me so he can bring in more "urban clientele."
You know what I really learned from Fawz is that that dude would do anything for money.
And I like that you won't.
I mean, having Tush run his tab here is what makes Superior Donuts what it is.
And you can't put a price on personal hygiene.
I don't like it any more than you do.
So that's a yes on the tab?
Great.
I just don't want you
- working for Fawz, that's all.
- Dude, I...
Trust me,
I would love to quit.
But right now I need the extra money.
Unbelievable.
My car was parked legally, and you still give me three tickets?
No, I didn't.
I did.
And we're officially tied.
Unlawfully tinted windows.
No front plate.
Oversized rims.
Mark my words, you will live to regret this.
And threatening a police officer.
That is nerds FTW, which means "nerds for the win"
Which you would know if you weren't so cool.
Damn.
I still got two minutes before the contest ends.
Hey!
You must be doing meth.
Nobody's that skinny in Chicago.
Hey, Fawz.
Maybe I can help you.
How'd you like to park your car in my space in the alley?
That would be amazing.
Thank you, Arthur.
No, I-I don't mean for free.
I mean, um, maybe I could rent it to you.
Yeah, um...
Fawz, how much are you spending a month on parking tickets?
Uh, $300.
(imitates buzzer, chuckles)
Now I can charge you $250, and you'd take it.
I'll take it.
(imitates buzzer) $275.
Are you crazy?
- Oh, well, I guess I'll just walk away.
- Yep.
You know, Shelly's Nails has been begging me
- to rent that space.
- Oh, really?
Shelly?
- Shelly would love the spot.
- Yeah.
Okay, okay. $275.
BOTH:
Deal.
Well, Franco, you just got a raise.
$275 a month.
Thank you, Arthur.
You're quite welcome.
All right.
And, Fawz, with all due respect, kiss my black ass.
I quit.
I am so mad at you right now!
But also proud.
Of how you screwed me over!
Which was masterful.
But I will get my revenge!
Okay, bye.
♪
There you are.
I can see those big, beautiful eyes on my new computer.
Can you see me?
I can see you fine.
Hey, yo, thanks for the raise, dude.
This new laptop is better than my first one.
Well, I'm happy to do it.
This Skyping is amazing.
I know, right?
Hey, hold the phone up, man.
I'm getting nothing but your nose hair.
(groans) Randy, am I walking funny?
Because my pocket's feeling about $800 heavier.
Go on, have at it.
- You won.
- Yeah.
Actually, you'll be happy to know that I'm giving half my winnings to a good cause:
your daughter's college fund.
Oh, James.
You don't have to do that.
Well, like you said.
We're partners.
But I was so mean to you all week.
I feel terrible.
Then it was all worth it.
My Papa was the hardest working person I ever met, spending almost every day of the year on the road.
Give it to me!
But, whenever he had time off, he would race home to see us...
Maximo!
Sara!
Your father is here.
even if he had to drive all night.
Move!
I'm okay...
My Papa always said, "You get what you work for,
"not what you wish for."
So much for hard work.
This is a nightmare.
I know it's horrible living here, but we're still a family.
I don't need a family.
What I need is somewhere to live that isn't an old wreck.
When I'm older, I'm going to be an architect.
So I can build a big house for us.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to sleep so I can be sleeping.
What are you going to do for work?
I'm going to be rich so I don't have to work.
But Papa always said that you get what you work for, not what you wish for.
And look what happened to him!
It's time to sleep, children.
We're already asleep.
Look...
This is who I'm going to be.
He didn't get that rich without having a job.
I don't want his job.
I want hers.
Maximo.
Hi Maximo.
You'll like that, Maximo.
-Thank you.
-Thank you!
Talk to me, Rafa.
What's on the menu?
Take a look at lounge chair number three.
There's a hot one over there, super rich!
I see her, I see her.
She looks delicious.
Who is she?
Peggy von Strauss.
Fifty-five, divorced...
-But she's loaded.
-Yeah?
Her family owns the biggest supermarket chain in the United States.
She's perfect.
I think I'm making you wet.
You know, no I can't.
I have my helicopter lesson this weekend.
Spot!
Spill.
Shadow!
Finished.
Maximo!
There you are, my raindrop.
I was just, just on my way to wake you
Do you know what day today is?
-Tuesday.
-No!
It's Saturday.
-Close enough.
-Happy anniversary!
Yeah.
-Just what I needed.
-Really?
So different.
This one says 9:20, this one doesn't.
I love it.
Thank you, thank you.
I love it.
-I got you something too.
-Really?
Where is it?
We have... to go... pick it up.
-How exciting!
-I know!
-I'll be right back.
-Right.
Just one second.
I'm waiting for you.
I'm ready for you.
I'll be but a second, sweetie.
One second.
I'm here.
Happy anniversary!
Darling, what a sweet thought.
Get in.
Get in!
I would, but with my knees I'm afraid it's too close to the ground for me.
Okay, forget it.
We won't get it then.
I don't want my knees to ruin our special day.
No, no, it's okay, it's okay.
Let's get in.
It could be your car too.
Yeah, I suppose that could work.
-We'll take this one.
-It's a fine choice.
You know the McLarens are like snowflakes and no two of them are the same.
Is that true?
Actually it doesn't, but...
I still think it's a lovely image with the snowflake.
Don't you think?
Are you the charmer?
Call it the romantic in me.
The guys in the floor calls me the poet, these boneheads.
They like to make fun.
And what form of payment will you be using today, sir?
Her.
Very good.
I'll see if that's an option in our system.
Are you se...
Another new car!
-Yep.
-How do you do, Mr. Maxwell?
Once you lower your expectations, Timmy, the sky is the limit.
That's the most beautiful thing I've heard in my entire life.
Four!
You don't mind if Max and I play a few holes, do you?
Not at all.
As long as you play a few holes with me later.
You are a naughty girl.
Here we are, a steak and a salad.
Aha, mama likes you slim and trim.
You want me to feed you some meat.
I want it so bad.
This first bite is all fat.
-Hey buddy.
-Oye, brother.
Millicent.
You look radiant as always.
Have I ever told you that you remind me of Senor Rojas?
He was my Spanish professor in college, with whom I had a passionate affair...
Yes, I think you mentioned it once or twice...
Or every time I see you.
-Let's hit the links.
-Yes!
Wanna grab a drink tonight?
Nope, sorry.
No offense, got me booked up.
Got a bleaching appointment.
You should try it some time.
I brush my teeth.
I'm not talking about the teeth.
-Ouch!
-Gotta keep it white and tight.
Guys like you and me, we hide in the tall grass, wait for the most beautiful gazelle to come up from the back of the pack, drops her head to get that last drink of water and then we strike.
Thrill of the hunt.
Wait.
Aren't the sickly ones usually at the back of the pack?
What do you know about animals?
What are you, Steve Irwin?
Rest in peace.
I watch a lot of animal shows.
-You're missing my point.
-You know what, Rick,
I don't have to worry about hunting old gazelles anymore because in my marriage,
I call the shots.
Would have been a lot cooler if I sank that.
I loved that you got yourself a matching McLaren.
We only played nine holes because I wanted to get back home to you.
Maximo, you're home early.
I missed you.
What's wrong?
Did you get winded trying to scrap cook again?
It was a nice refreshing beverage after the workout we did...
Hey!
You're back!
Hey, how you liking the car?
Handles like a beauty, doesn't she?
You cheated on me with a car salesman?
No, a little.
Remy.
Here you go.
The number on the bottom doesn't work anymore but the top one is good.
Call any time, okay?
You want a drink?
The bar here's incredible.
Well, I don't have to tell you.
I'm sorry, Maximo.
It's over.
You sneeze, you lose, ese.
Okay.
But, half of everything is mine.
Actually, no.
You signed a prenuptial agreement.
No, no, no.
I signed a prenup.
No.
Shit!
I can't believe this.
After I gave her my best years, and after I gave her my youth, after I gave her the best of me.
Of course, now that my boobs have sagged, she finds someone younger than me.
Shit!
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving!
Look, once I cross this threshold, I'm never coming back!
I won't come back!
I won't come back!
It's finished!
It's finished forever!
But she's going to miss me.
She'll miss my seeds.
Come harvest time, she'll miss my seeds.
I'm feeling like playing some cops and robbers tonight.
Spice things up
I think I might need to get frisked.
That polyester looks a little itchy.
It will suit you just fine.
No, no, no, you're gonna put it on, you're gonna love it.
Whatever you want, mommy gets.
That's right.
Maximo.
Rick.
-I'm sorry...
-My god!
I'm sorry, you scared me.
-Sorry, you okay?
-Yeah.
What's going on?
Peggy dumped me.
What the hell am I gonna do?
I have no money, no home, no helicopters.
My god!
Stop hitting me!
I'm sorry.
I'm on these horse testosterone pills, that Millicent makes me take and it gets me a little agitated.
Guys like you and me, we're survivors.
We do whatever it takes to come out on top.
-Yeah, yeah.
-Look at me.
-We're survivors.
That's what we do.
-Yes.
All you need to do is find yourself a new wife.
-Yes.
New and improved.
-And improved!
Someone who's richer and older than Peggy.
Absolutely, yeah.
There's plenty of fish in the sea.
All I need is a place to stay while I am fishing.
Well, I know you haven't been in touch for a while but you could always try stay at your sister's.
I'm not sure.
I mean, what about here?
-No.
-Why?
Millicent insisted every room be reserved at all times in case she wants to have a session.
There is not a room that we don't...
There is one place.
Great!
I'm so...
It's the pills, it's the pills!
I don't know how these horses do it.
This is Millicent's grand daughter's play house.
Millicent's grand daughter has excellent taste.
Millicent's grand daughter has expensive taste.
This cost a fortune.
Horrible little girl.
One time she made me salt a slug, just so she could remember how to laugh.
Anyway, sleep tight.
Thank you.
So true.
So... how do you guys know each other?
My god!
Thanks for letting me stay at your house.
I am sorry.
I thought it was a real toilet.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Leave it alone!
That's mine!
Leave me alone!
Hello?
Surprise!
It's your brother!
No sir, you've got the wrong apartment.
Sara.
-Yes?
-Sara?
Who's this?
It's me, your brother.
-Maximo?
-Yeah.
The one and only.
Open the door, will you?
Sara?
Sara?
Is this for real?
You show up today, as if it were nothing?
After you didn't even bother coming to see our dying mother,
When that avocado tree fell on her.
You didn't come to see my child when he was born.
What made you think
I'd have any desire to see you?
You can't just show up like this.
I'm not opening the door for you!
I'm not...
Hey, Sara!
Sarita!
I can't believe this.
Me neither!
You're happy to see me, right?
No.
What are you doing here?
Nothing!
I wanted to see you and my niece.
Nephew!
That!
Niece, no?
Nephew?
Niece?
What did I say?
Nephew?
Nephew.
That's it.
Nephew.
Tell me what you want, and then beat it!
Peggy kicked me out.
She took everything.
Everything!
But, wasn't everything hers to begin with?
Ok, fine.
She kept everything.
She even kept the car I picked out for her to buy for me, to give her, for our anniversary.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know you're angry with me, but...
Can I stay with you?
Here?
Here in my house?
I have nowhere else to stay.
Really?
You have honestly lost your mind!
You've lost your head.
You're my sister!
Oh, I'm your sister now, right?
You've always been my sister!
Oh, come on, Maximo!
I can't believe what comes out of your mouth!
Don't be like this.
One day, and no more?
-Come on.
-Really?
Grab your things!
What, do you think that I'll carry them?
This isn't a hotel!
-Hey, your apartment is nice.
-Thanks.
Like, outside it seemed a little...
But it's cool.
My goodness!
It's Hector!
Hugo!
Right.
What did I say?
Hugo, remember I told you I had an ugly crazy brother who was the champion of farting?
-Yes.
-That's it.
-Hey how are you?
-Meet Maximo.
Hi.
Look at you!
You must be six years old by now.
I just turned...
Ten.
Ten?
I know.
I was kidding.
Everyone's so serious around here.
It's like, who died?
My dad.
I was sorry to hear about that.
Pictures!
Hey, where's my picture?
I don't know.
Those are family photos.
-I'm family.
-Uncle Maximo...
We're having chicken rice.
Want some?
Chicken?
No.
Maybe I'll have a lobster roll.
Or maybe you don't eat?
Why don't you say grace before we start eating?
I'm really sorry.
Next time.
-This time...
-Okay, okay.
Dear Lord, even though we are eating just chicken and rice, at least we're all here together.
Well, not all of us because...
Hector's dad is dead.
Hugo!
His name is Hugo.
Yeah.
Because Hugo is dead.
-Hugo is not dead.
His fa...
-Amen.
Wait, wait, wait...
Lord, before you go, please help me find a new wife with a big heart, but not necessarily a strong heart, with a high net worth, and nice big house, who doesn't ask me to poke her that often.
Amen.
-Amen.
-Amen.
-Hey, you got a girl friend?
-No.
Really?
What's wrong with you?
He's ten, Maximo.
Late bloomer?
Hugo, I have an idea.
Why don't you tell uncle Max about your science fair project?
And this way, it will be you talking and not this dummy over here.
Okay.
Sure.
I'm sending a weather balloon with a Go Pro camera to the edge of the stratosphere.
Stratosphere, wow!
I've modified the Go Pro camera to send live video stream back to earth via FM transmitter.
Wow, transmitter, wow!
The balloon's gonna go very high up.
And then we're gonna see like a little part of the earth.
-Earth.
Wow!
-Yeah!
Now I understand why he doesn't have a girlfriend.
Stop it!
Wanna know what I'm doing, uncle Maximo?
No.
-Oops!
-You know,
I prefer my own room.
And I prefer for you to be normal.
But, we get what we get.
I'm serious.
What about upstairs?
Those are other people's apartments.
-Really?
-Really.
But, hey, why don't you go knock on their doors.
Maybe they'll take you in.
I love you!
-I love you mom.
-Sweet dreams!
What?
I guess I'll just tuck myself in.
How do you do this?
My god.
Uncle Maximo...
How long were you married?
Twenty five years.
Good night.
And you didn't have to work that whole time?
Nope.
Nightie night.
What did you do for money?
I didn't need money.
She paid for everything.
You go to sleep.
So now you have to find a new wife to pay for stuff?
Yep.
That's the plan.
Sweet dreams.
How are you going to do that?
By getting a good nights sleep.
Why haven't you ever visited us?
-I've been busy.
-Doing what?
-You just said you didn't work.
-Sara!
Sara Help!
Sara!
Emergency, Sara!
-Emergency, Sara!
-What?
I'm trying to sleep and the kid won't stop talking!
-You were talking too!
-To tell you to stop talking!
-Still talking!
-Did I tell you to stop talking?
-No, no!
-Enough!
You almost gave me a heart attack.
Mira!
I thought we were being robbed.
I was being robbed of my beauty sleep.
Go to sleep.
Both of you!
Yes, mommy.
And no more talking about not talking.
And no more talking about poking either.
Tattletale.
Poke you!
Did you put your homework in your back pack?
-Yes.
-Good.
-Morning.
-Morning...
-Morning.
-Morning.
We have rules here.
Any dish that you use, you have to wash.
-I didn't know we can do that.
-We can't.
So don't even think about it.
-James!
-Hi.
Hi!
Sorry to interrupt you, you have a guest...
I don't have a guest.
That.
That's my brother, Maximo.
Nice to meet you.
Pleasure is all mine.
You know what.
My door knob is sticking again.
Can you believe it.
-Again?
-I know.
It's crazy, right?
-Can I borrow your tools or?
-No, don't worry about it.
-I'll take care of it.
-Are you sure?
Yeah.
Easy.
Easy peasy.
I'd love to.
Got a sticky knob...
Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you there like in five minutes?
Okay.
You're the best.
Thank you.
It's nothing.
Are you a carpenter or what?
When you're both the man and the woman of the house, you have to be a handyman and do whatever is necessary.
Are you two...
What you doing?
What are you implying?
No!
I just help out when something gets jammed in his house, or there's a problem in his house.
It's an old building.
Go get dressed.
Look at you.
We have to leave in five minutes.
Hugo, get your stuff.
I'll meet you in the car.
Sticky knob.
Look, that sad man has to spin the sign like a fool for all to see.
At least he has a job.
It's more than I can say about another man in this car.
Work's for suckers.
Mom, uncle Maximo said the S word.
-That's not the S word.
-What is?
-Can I tell him?
-No!
Shit.
So, you're big time architect now.
Junior architect.
But, I still haven't got my own house to design.
So I am not going to be late for work because you take two hours to blow dry your hair.
I am trusting you with my car...
I am trusting you with my car and I am trusting you with my son.
You need to go out there and find yourself a job.
Pick me up at 5:00, okay?
Okay, I'll try to remember.
You will remember, because I have no other way to get back home.
I said I'll try.
Jeez.
5:00!
Is she always like this?
No, I just think she doesn't like you.
Wow!
I smell money.
How do you go here?
I'm in academic scholarship, that covers some of my tuition.
My mom has to pay the rest.
You can drop me off here.
Drop you off?
Are you kidding?
I'll walk you in.
Where do the rich single mom's park?
-Wait, wait, wait.
-What?
-Friend of yours?
-Arden?
No.
I wish.
She doesn't even know I exist.
Why do you say that?
Because, she's a girl and she's cute and I am me.
You make a great point, you are, you.
How old is she?
She's turning 10 next week.
I heard she's having a big birthday party.
No, no, no.
Not the kid.
Her.
That's Arden's grandmother.
She's perfect.
Name?
-I think it's Celeste.
-Celeste what?
-Celeste Birch.
-Is there a grandpa Birch?
He died last year.
Great!
Great.
That's great news.
He's dead!
I'm so very sad.
Life's a gift.
Okay kid.
Have a great day.
But I thought you wanted to walk me in.
What are you, a baby?
You can walk yourself in.
Andale vamos.
I've got work to do.
Hey!
-May I help you?
-It's me, Maximo.
I'm an old friend of Celeste's.
I feel like we've met before, right?
-I don't think so.
-I think so.
-You're Ryan, right?
-Quincy.
I knew it started with a Q or a B or a S.
Quincy.
That's a great name, Quincy.
I was named after my grandfather's dog.
The legacy lives on.
-Don't touch me.
-Yeah.
And where did you say you met Celeste?
At the sports event.
-The polo match.
-Yes, exactly.
-The one back in April.
-Yeah, that's the one.
She never went to a polo match back in April.
-May?
-No.
-June?
-No.
-July?
-No.
-August?
-No.
-September?
-No.
-October?
November?
-No.
-December?
-No.
-January, February?
-No, no.
-March.
-No.
-April.
-You already said April.
And you said?
No.
I am so sorry.
I must have gotten confused.
-March.
-No.
Of course.
Thanks.
Pizza delivery.
Hey man, what's up?
I'm a little busy.
I think I found my next wife.
You've heard of Celeste Birch?
Celeste Birch?
She's worth 10 Peggy von Strauss's.
-You ever meet her?
-I haven't had the pleasure.
But, Millicent was supposed to go her charity function today at the Pacific Woodruff.
Pacific Woodruff, today?
Yeah.
I mean, go get her.
Be the best 500 bucks you ever spent.
500 dollars!
Yes, that's the cost of the charity ticket.
That seems like the opposite of charity.
-Pizza boy...
-I've got to go.
Duty calls.
One extra large sausage.
That'll be $17.15.
I'm afraid I don't have any change.
Well, maybe we'll have to work something between us.
Maybe...
Five hundred dollars.
Hi, I need to get my car wrapped... and I need the cash upfront.
Bro.
Is he here about the bike?
-Are you here about the bike?
-No.
Bro, he's not here for this stupid tiny bike, alright?
He got the thing online, you idiot.
We all make mistakes, okay?
You're not perfect.
-I misunderstood the dimensions.
-It happens.
Anyway, you thought about what kind of edge you wanna wrap your car in?
Whatever...
This looked a lot bigger on the Internet because it had a picture with a little boy, so it seemed much bigger.
Great.
How do he not know the difference between a little boy and a grown man?
He looked older, he had a little bit of a mustache.
Look at this.
This was in the picture.
It was a boy with the mustache so I assume...
Whatever pays the most!
Sorry.
Was that rude?
I'm in a rush, that's all.
I'm in a rush.
-Man's in a rush.
-Yes, thank you.
Here's the terms.
Wrap stays on the car for ninety days.
Yes.
You take it off before that, you have to pay us the money back.
Not a problem.
Yeah.
Leave the warp on the vehicle.
Yes, I will do that.
Can we start as soon as possible?
One thousand dollars.
Keep it close, my son.
I don't think they will let me.
Good afternoon, sir.
Sir?
Would you like to buy a ticket?
Yes, I would.
Pool side.
Perfect.
Sir?
Keep the change.
Am I making you wet?
Am I making you wet?
Am I...
I look like my grandfather.
Come to papa.
Is that shit?
Am I making you wet?
Sorry.
Am I making you wet?
No, no.
Bone dry.
Thanks for asking, though.
Come on.
Unhand me, sir.
I just wanna speak to Celeste.
Listen, Menudo, you think you're the first money grabbing gigolo to throw himself at my boss?
Maybe not the first, but I'm hoping to be the last now.
Not while I'm working for her.
She's been through too much emotionally and surgically to put up with this.
You can't keep me away.
-No, I can.
-No.
-Very easily I can.
-No.
I just did.
Yes, you did.
So unless you have a written invitation to our home, you're not going anywhere near her.
Hey, there's your clown suit.
Alright, here's your...
car... toon.
I kept it close just like you asked me to, paisano.
I don't speak Spanish.
Hi bro.
Did you make a move?
I sort of made a move.
Can you talk?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Millicent's just taking a post coital cool off.
Tell me you closed her.
Tell me you closed her during silent auction.
She didn't even see me.
I'm not sure about this one.
She's impossible to get to.
I have no in.
Or maybe I do.
Sounds like you have an idea.
But I can't tell.
I can't see your face.
-Describe your face.
-My face?
Yeah.
What does it look like?
Thoughtful, very handsome with a hint of mischief.
That's the spirit.
Hey, I'm there for you, whatever you need.
Unless it's money.
Then I can't do it.
Because I'm on an allowance.
Great.
Listen.
Find out whatever you can about Celeste.
Interest, passions, hobbies.
When I'm invited to her home,
I plan on selling the deal.
-I'll ask her on the club.
-Thanks.
And I've got work to do on my end.
Hey.
Hey!
My eyes are up here.
Get in.
Usually we come here on Sundays because mom says it's too much sugar to have more than once a week.
-Yeah.
-Wow.
So, Hugo I wanna talk to you about Arden...
Froyo Lo, look out That's right
You've got to let your fantasies out For a bite
-Say your name
-Hugo.
Ain't no shame
Froyo Lo Froyo Lo
Do they make you sing that every time?
I get to sing that every time.
You know if you guess the weight of your yogurt, it's on the house.
Five pounds.
That's a lot.
I'll give you one more guess.
-Thirty pounds.
-Let's check.
Wow, they're fourteen ounces.
I was so close.
That will be six fifty.
Hey, watch me and learn.
I like your bandages.
I am...
I have a lot of rescue cats.
-Really?
-Yeah, so I'm no stranger to scratches.
I'm always bleeding.
Thank you...
-Cindy.
-Wow.
Cindy.
What an enchanting name.
Thank you.
You know, if these frozen yogurts were half as sweet as you, we're in for quite a treat.
Wow!
You said fourteen ounces, right?
Gracias, sweet Cindy.
I hope your pussy cats realize what a beautiful scratching post they have in you.
Bye.
I am a beautiful scratching post.
See what I did there?
You got us FroYo for free?
No, my skills of seduction got us FroYo for free
What if I told you I can teach you how to use your skills of seduction to get what you want.
I forgot to ask for gummy bears.
Screw the gummy bears.
I'm talking about Arden.
Hey, I can get you invited to her birthday party.
Would you like that?
You can't get me invited to Arden's birthday party.
Papa por favor.
-It's impossible.
-Somebody asked for gummy bears?
They're on the house.
Thank you, sweet Cindy.
I have gummy bears coming out of my ears, literally.
Not literally, but they are in a surprising amount of places around here.
Hey, thank you.
See, I can make things happen for you.
When do we start?
We just did.
Okay, lesson number one.
Eye contact.
Follow me.
Follow me.
Eye contact.
-Okay.
-Eye contact is power, Hugo.
Women will lust after you.
Now, it's your turn.
I am Arden, okay?
Say hello to me.
-Okay.
-Hello Hugo, I'm Arden.
Hello, Arden.
You broke eye contact.
You broke eye contact.
You threw a gummy bear at me.
What?
Life will throw gummy bears at you.
Okay.
Do it again.
Stop throwing gummy bears at me.
Stop breaking eye contact.
Hello, Arden.
Not bad.
Good eye contact.
Not bad at all.
You guys are getting real creative with these gummy bears.
Most people just eat them.
Okay, lesson number two...
Women love when men take control because women have no idea what they wants.
I'll have the steak and the lady would have the cobb salad.
What if she doesn't want the cobb salad?
Listen, a woman would rather eat something you ordered for her that she doesn't want rather than something she ordered for herself that she does want.
It doesn't make sense.
Like, at all.
You know what doesn't make sense?
What is that?
You under house arrest or what?
It's a planetary watch.
Some people call it an astronomical watch.
I'm gonna call it I'm gonna die a virgin watch.
Lose it.
Let's go.
Wait, uncle Maximo.
What is a virgin?
It's an airline.
Last lesson of the day...
Your walk.
Your walk tells more about you than your mouth ever can.
-My walk?
-Yes, your walk.
Show me your walk.
-Do I just walk?
-Just walk, walk.
-Okay.
-Like you walk.
Horse shit.
Sit and watch.
Loose stride, sleepy eyes, smiling just a little bit because you know what all the ladies are thinking.
What are the ladies thinking?
Look at that confidence, he must be great in bed.
I'm great in bed.
-What?
-I don't pee or anything anymore.
Come on now, my boy.
Let's walk.
Loose stride, sleepy eyes.
What are you doing?
Pretend there's a girl and you're walking towards her.
Feel your sexiness.
I don't feel my sexy.
What is that?
You're walking exactly like the geese.
Let's go.
Don't watch the geese, okay?
A girl pass by, turn around, walk backwards, sexy, sexy.
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
One more time.
Feel it in your crotch.
You want everyone to see down here.
No, I don't.
Look at me.
You learn from the best.
Okay, one more time.
You feel sexy right now?
-Yeah.
-Great.
Okay, one more time.
Exactly, exactly, exactly.
There you go.
Much better.
Shit.
Okay.
One more time.
Gwen,
I wanted to see if you heard back on the Robinson account.
Sara,
I was really hoping to avoid you and then ignore you a bunch before you could ask me about this.
I know, sorry.
I can ask you again tomorrow as soon as you get out of the car.
No, no.
Can't unbreak this egg.
Alright, they loved you.
They thought you were incredible.
But they're gonna go with someone who has...
-More experience.
-Sorry, can I finish?
Sorry...
Yes, yes...
Someone who has more experience.
You finished?
Yeah.
I just don't know what to do.
I can't get a job because I don't have experience and I can't get experience if I don't get a job.
-Hey mom.
-I'm here.
5:00.
I remembered.
You have nothing to complain about.
I thought you'd be happy.
I got a job.
Turning my car into a stripper mobile is not a job.
-What's a stripper?
-It's only nine days.
No, it's not.
You get this trash off my car today.
Today!
Alright now, those guys, they...
no wait, girls... they dance on the poles naked, right?
Icebergs are literally just floating ice on the water
Wow, astonishing.
So when it melts, it's like soda, it's like bubbles.
-Bubbles, wow.
-Carbon dioxide.
Where's your watch?
You mean, my die a virgin watch?
What did you say?
Die a virgin watch.
Kids.
Where do they come up with this stuff?
Uncle Maximo told me to take it off.
He's training me to get girls to like me.
He's training you?
-Yeah.
-What the hell are you doing?
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It's just silly guy talk.
It's not silly.
I learned how to undress a woman with my eyes.
And how to walk so a woman would know I'm gonna bed.
He said women have no idea what they want and you have to tell them what to do.
No, I never used those words exactly.
Sure you did.
I wrote it all down in this notebook.
-What notebook?
-Lesson number...
Mira.
Hugo needs to focus on his school work.
Hey, he has a crush on a girl at school.
I'm trying to help the kid.
You know what it's like to like someone!
Or no?
Mister "I need you to grease my door once a week"
No.
You're taking one think for another.
-And James is just a friend!
-Oh, my God.
You're changing the subject!
No more sugar mama catching training!
Hugo already has a mother.
-Understood?
-Yes, mommy.
Understood?
I don't speak English.
Don't be an idiot.
Why with a tortilla?
Hey, pull my finger.
Pull it.
-False alarm.
-Yeah.
You're writing a love letter to Arden?
No, just writing to my dad.
Your dad?
You know he'll never get those letters, right?
I know.
It's just a way for me to feel close then.
Don't you ever think about your dad?
-No.
-Never?
Never.
You remember anything about him?
I remember he worked a lot.
And he parked his truck in our house once.
There it is.
Late bloomer.
I remember a lot about my dad.
He was fun.
I think he'd be happy that you're here and that you're helping me.
That's what I was just writing him.
Uncle Maximo, can I show you my science project?
I... in the morning.
Please?
I know that you're really not sleeping.
Uncle Maximo, please?
Okay.
In the morning.
Good morning.
Uncle Maximo.
Remember when you told me that I can show you my science fair project in the morning?
Well, here it is!
My weather balloon.
And here is the Go Pro camera which will be attached to the weather balloon which will go up in space.
It's cool, right?
Amazing.
Now, will you please get it off my face so I can go back to sleep?
Get up, flojo naso!
Time to go get a job.
Here, I circled the ones that I think will be good for your qualifications like human statue, mattress tester, dog poop picker upper...
It's Sunday.
What place will even be open?
It's Thursday.
Want me to deflate the balloon?
Let's go.
The science fair is next Sunday, the school is today.
Hey, no.
Hugo!
No, Sara!
Get a job!
Hey, condos, condos!
Sorry!
I'm okay!
I am okay.
He's okay.
He's okay.
It wasn't me, it wasn't me.
I'm alright.
This neighborhood isn't that bad.
I was expecting something out of a horror movie, this is more like something out of an independent movie.
Stop trying to make me feel better.
Stop trying to make me feel better.
-Are you teasing me?
-Teasing me.
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Millicent's just fantasizing about this...
Professor Rojas.
She's got me dressing like him, talking like him, but, I can't do an accent to save my life.
And I can't sleep on an air mattress one more night.
You find any intel or Celeste Birch?
As as matter of fact, I did.
And before I share this,
I don't think she's the right mark for you.
Come on.
Celeste Birch's passions, avid mountain climber, loves train travel, favorite food, fried chicken.
Great.
This will help.
Thanks.
Alright.
It is time to go.
-Anything?
-Terrible.
It's time to go.
You sound like Dora the explorer.
Now's the go, when it's time to go.
Speedy Gonzales.
Really.
Alright.
Ola.
Everybody knows how to say that.
And somehow you screwed it up.
Hola.
-I'm positive, that's the car.
-But why would we pay him, if he's not gonna do it.
We paid him all our money.
Hey, hey, hey!
Stop!
Stop!
Well, look who it is.
No, no, no, no.
Where do you think you're going?
-Where you going, man?
-Just looking for you guys.
I was just looking for you guys.
We clearly said, don't take the wrap off.
Ever!
Yes, yes, I remember and I thought you did a great job with the wrapping.
But, you see my sister felt differently.
She's your sister.
-Yeah
-Sister.
-Women.
-Right, right.
You don't have to tell Nick and I about that.
Get his nuts.
-I got them.
-Get his nuts.
I got both of them.
I got them.
You just give us our money.
We'll be fine.
I spent it.
I spent it.
Well, I sincerely hope you bought something you really wanted or needed.
God, you're terrible with this.
Nick, just think before you talk.
Can you do that?
I made a mistake.
I'll get you your money, I promise.
Come on guys.
It's just a thousand dollars.
-One week.
You got one week.
-Yes.
Let's go.
I didn't see that coming.
Nice!
-Thought we're done, right?
-You feel that?
Two hands.
You want four hands?
-That's four hands.
-Yeah, there it is.
-That's four hands.
-One week.
One week, home boy.
We went four hands on him, man.
That was bad ass.
His balls are so big.
You get that money or next time it's eight hands.
Guy doesn't have $1000, get a job, bone head.
Froyo Lo look out That's right
You've got to let your fantasies out For a bite
Say your name...
Jose!
Ain't no shame
Froyo Lo!
Froyo Lo!
Such a good effort.
It's only lacking joy, soul, rhythm and musicality.
And I would cry way less.
Maybe not at all.
But, what if mom finds out we're training again?
Hugo, you can't live your life afraid that something bad will happen.
Or you'll never really live.
Okay.
So, you gotten her to notice you with the sexy walk.
You intrigued her with strong eye contact.
Now, it's time to talk to her.
I don't think I can.
Relax, Hugo.
It's not like you've never talked to a girl before.
Yes, it is.
I've never talked to a girl before.
-Really?
-Yeah.
They make me really nervous and then my nose start to sweat.
-Your nose sweats?
-Yeah.
-Your nose?
-Yes.
-I can't help you with that.
-Stop mocking me.
Well, come on.
Let's go.
Well, where are we going?
You're too in your head, kid.
You need to relax.
I don't like the bowling balls here.
Too slippery.
I'm gonna grab a Coke.
You want one?
Cokes have no nutritional value.
Neither do eggplants.
Okay, two Cokes.
Nice form.
Thanks.
My name is Gabi.
What's yours?
My name is Hugo.
You're cute, Hugo.
Thank you.
-See you.
-Thank you.
Thank you.
-What was that?
-She just called me cute!
-She said you were cute?
-Yes.
I guess my mom's not the only one who thinks that.
Guess not.
What is that crap on your nose?
It's sweat.
Wait!
My shoes.
Okay, I'll be right back.
-Don't get kidnapped.
-Okay.
Thank you.
Those please.
-Nice work.
-I aim to please.
Okay, remember... eye contact and confidence.
Come on, take that off.
You can do it.
Now we are talking.
Look at that, you're a Greek god.
-Abs of steel.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-Is my nose sweating?
Yeah, little bit.
But, it will wash out when you get in the water.
-Okay.
-Okay, come on.
Go get her.
You can do this.
Come on, Stalker.
Do you need a towel?
No no no.
Eye contact, eye contact!
Hi, Arden.
Hi, Hugo.
You know my name?
Yeah, I know your name.
You said you know by mean H-I, not H-I-G-H.
Okay.
Let's go ladies, practice is over.
Got to clear the pool area.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes!
-Yes?
-Yes!
-Yes?
-She invited me to her party!
She invited me to her party!
We did it!
Exactly what I needed!
-Yes!
-Yes!
-Do you see my nephew happy?
-Yes!
Yeah man, you got it!
I heard about the Pasadena project.
Yeah.
Listen, I have some ideas.
I know it's a long shot, but please take a look.
I'd love a chance.
And I promise that I'd treat like my own child.
Hey mom.
The 101 was wide open.
It's okay.
I just let him drive from around the block.
Don't worry, I'm not one of those people concerned about children.
Hugo, that's wonderful.
A party with other kids.
-So can I go?
-Of course,
I'll take you.
It'll be great.
Sara, you work so hard.
I will take him.
Are you kidding me?
I can't wait to see all his new friends.
Plus, we could see the big mansion of the grandmother, right?
Hey, no offense, but I think Hugo would mush rather go with me.
I mean, look at you.
Look at me.
-Look at you.
-Maximo, Maximo...
The words should sound right in your head before they leave the lips in your stupid face.
I don't care who brings me.
I'm just excited to go.
I'm bringing you, honey.
I'm sure uncle Maximo has better things to do on a Saturday.
Okay.
James.
Shit!
You scared me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's Maximo, Sara's brother.
Yeah, why are you hiding in my garbage?
We need to talk.
It's about Sara.
My god, what happened?
It's not what happened, it's what hasn't happened.
-I don't understand.
What do you mean?
-James,
I'm not saying I get it, but she likes you.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
Hey, I have an idea.
Take her out on Saturday.
Saturday?
Don't you think you waited long enough?
Door.
Please don't bother yourself.
You just keep doing nothing there while I cook and I open the door, and whatever else you need.
Hi.
-Hi, James.
-Hi
Is it the door again?
I'll go get my tools.
No, no, no.
Actually it's...
It's...
It's my sink.
I was just kidding about my sink.
Funny.
So, do you need something?
Or did you just come here to tell the sink joke?
No, no, no.
Actually, I didn't.
I mean, I did, but I...
I came here to ask you if you're free on Saturday and if you wanted to...
If you wanted to come out on a date with me.
What?
I don't know.
-Okay.
-Mom, are you okay?
You wanna think about it?
-I don't know.
-She's acting weird.
-Maybe?
-Yeah, she'll just think about it and get back to you.
Okay, fine.
But, you know let me know either way.
I told you.
This guy likes you.
I don't want to talk about it.
-Hey!
-I'm going to my room.
-Hey!
-Finish the dinner.
Don't come in.
I'm sleeping.
Hugo is asleep now.
Why did you act so weird?
What's wrong?
What do you think is wrong?
I'm rusty.
I don't feel ready to go out with anyone.
When was the last time?
5 years ago.
I mean, when was the last time you... 5 years.
Seriously?
Thant's enough!
Are you serious?
Si.
Okay?
Stop laughing.
The bakery has been closed for some time.
Your pastry is going to go stale.
You're such a jerk.
My God, what are you waiting for?
I don't know.
You like this little gringo?
You like the gringo!
So go, then!
I'm afraid.
You know what I do when I'm afraid?
Pray?
Drink.
My God, leave my bakery alone.
Don't talk to me about my bakery.
No, but seriously...
I don't know how you've managed to go on, in spite of all your suffering, to keep going, to always move forward...
I can because of Hugo.
Hugo, how?
When my husband died, there were days when I couldn't even breathe.
But, how do you explain to a small child that he has to take care of himself, because his mom wants to lock herself in her room and cry?
You can't.
But I have a trick for when I'm very sad to lift me up.
Anti-depressants?
No, look...
I take any sad song, and transform it into a salsa.
A sad song?
What about The Sad One?
Let's go.
You're stepping on me!
Come on.
Let's go!
The Sad One!
Come on!
I'm falling asleep this isn't a salsa.
Mom.
Mom!
Hugo!
Did we wake you up?
Yes.
You're singing very loudly and bumping into things.
Go to sleep.
Both of you.
Okay.
You see?
You're not rusty, all you need to is relax and have fun, that's all!
You honestly don't mind taking him to the party?
It would be the greatest honor of my life.
Let's go!
Come on!
Send him a text.
That's my sister!
That's my sister!
Enough!
Hugo.
You have no room to judge.
Sorry for the spill.
What the hell happened to me?
Look what the cat dragged in!
-Pay day.
-Great!
Thank you.
Hey, where's the rest of it?
Try feeding 50 cats on that kind of money.
It's meow-trageous!
Old man?
Not for long.
Give me the works.
Sorry.
Hey.
Behold the glory of God's creation.
Did you dye your hair?
All of it.
I gave myself a little makeover.
Maybe next time, they can makeover your brain.
I know perfectly well...
I look very good.
Very good.
I love you, stupid face.
I love you too, little sister.
What are you telling your dad tonight?
Just that I'm excited to go to Arden's party.
And that I'm glad you're going with me.
I patched it up for you.
So you can sleep better.
Give me a piece of paper, Hugo.
I wanna write a letter too.
To who?
My dad.
I wanna tell him about his amazing grandson.
Can we do this every night?
Sure.
It could be our thing.
Hey, pull my finger.
Too late.
Sorry.
-Today's the party!
-Really?
I haven't been thinking about it.
Mommy's taking me to get a hair cut.
Tell him not too short.
You don't have the ears for it.
Why don't you stop talking.
You don't have the mouth for it.
Hugo, come here.
Hey!
I made the wall!
Wow, what happened?
It's been kind of nice having you here.
-Right?
-It's been okay.
-Just okay?
-Okay, okay...
Been very nice having you here, uncle Maximo.
Now we're talking.
-Bye.
-See you, uncle Maximo.
Don't sprinkle the toilet.
I'll do my best.
God!
Now what?
Hey.
Guys!
I was just looking for you.
Coffee?
Coffee.
-Money!
-We're not here for coffee, man!
-Money!
-That's what we want!
That's why we are here!
We don't even like coffee!
Get the money!
Yeah.
Money.
I don't exactly have it.
What do you mean, exactly?
Means he doesn't have it.
Well, then why don't just say you don't have it.
Why even say the word exactly at all?
I'm gonna pay you, I promise.
Hey, you got a real nice place here.
By nice place, I mean a total dump.
That's what I'm talking about.
People just say what they mean, it's confusing.
Guys, this is my sister's place, please.
You know what your problem is?
You don't have any respect for money man!
-Money doesn't grow on trees.
-No, it doesn't.
-It would be cool if it did.
-Nikki, Nikki!
Please!
I'm just backing up your point.
You could literally rake it up.
-What're you doing?
-Hey...
Totally forgot what I was talking about.
-What if we took stuff of yours, sir?
-Okay, okay.
That's a good point.
What if we barged in and started taking stuff?
-What if I took this thing?
-No, please...
I don't even know what it is.
What about this?
What if I took this?
No, no!
No, no, not that!
That's my nephew's.
That's important.
-This is important to you?
-Yeah.
Then, probably don't want me to have it then?
Hey, no, don't do that please.
No, don't do that please.
Okay, okay...
What do you like?
Sports cars?
Helicopters?
Rolex watches?
I promise I am good for the money and so much more.
I don't need a Rolex, bro.
-You know something?
-What?
You seem like a very sincere guy.
I am.
But, I don't believe anything that you say you're gonna do.
So give us our money, you can have your camera back.
It's that simple.
Hey, please, please, please.
Hey.
Hey!
Have a real nice day.
And by that I mean, do not have a real nice day.
I get it.
Sometimes its funny to not say exactly what you mean.
Not the camera, hey, the camera.
Uncle Maximo, we're home.
Are you ready?
Almost.
Wow!
We look the same.
Yep.
Maximo.
Minimo.
Wow, mom!
You look pretty.
And you're so guapo.
That dress is really tight on you.
You mean, I look fat?
No, no, no.
In a good way, I mean.
Because you can see all the body parts in your body.
-I'm gonna take...
-No!
No, no, no.
Let's make some magic happen.
Yeah!
Arden, here we come.
Wow!
Look at this place!
Yep.
This will do just fine.
There she is.
Yep.
There she is.
Hey, Hugo, just remember everything I taught you, okay?
Thank you, uncle Maximo.
Go get her.
Go get her, Latino lover.
Beautiful as your uncle.
Hello.
Hello.
Have we met?
Only in my dreams.
Hugo.
Did you hurt your leg?
No baby, I was just walking.
My nephew is quiet fond of your grand daughter.
Really?
Do I have something on my face?
Yes.
You have my full attention.
Okay.
It's enchanting to meet you.
Maximo.
Maximo.
Hey baby, what do you say we like, leave this place.
What do you mean?
I have a birthday party.
-Drink?
-Allow me, please.
Excuse me...
The lady and I will have your finest champagne.
She'll have a Sprite and I'll have a Coke.
Something as refreshing and exciting as she is.
Of course.
Well...
Actually, I'll just have some water.
Thanks.
Women.
They never know what they want.
Am I right?
She'll have a Sprite, like I said.
But, of course.
I have to go.
Arden, wait.
Shall we grab a bite?
Wait, wait.
Sorry I was acting so weird.
Can we start over?
Is that a planetary watch?
Yeah.
Wanna check out the rest of my party?
-Sure.
-Come on.
Cheers.
-Beautiful party.
-Isn't it?
Yeah.
Such a beautiful day.
Mountains, trains, chickens.
That's quiet a mountain of melon balls.
You know, climbing is one of my greatest passions.
In fact, I'm training for Everest.
Of course, it's not the mountain that we conquer, but ourselves.
Sir Edmund Hilary.
Yes.
You climb?
Once upon a time.
But, not anymore.
Nonsense.
Beautiful strong woman like yourself surely has many climbs left in her.
Not this woman, I'm afraid.
Give me one good reason.
Frost bite.
South face of Everest.
Just thinking about it gives me day tremors.
I hate climbing.
You convince me.
I hate it too.
What I really love, train travel.
So classic.
Won't you agree?
-Steam locomotive, 1950.
-You have no arms?
I was playing on the tracks and got stuck.
I'm afraid I haven't much fondness for trains.
Now if you'll excuse me for a moment, please.
Chicken!
-Chicken?
-Yes, Chicken!
I'm sure you love fried chicken.
Having my limbs torn from my body, helped me to realize just how barbaric the treatment of chickens is in our country.
I'm vegetarian.
Which is why I founded
The Birch Poultry Rehabilitation Center.
Now, if you'll forgive me a moment, please.
Hey!
Chicken.
Rick?
Rick.
Hey!
-What are you doing here?
-I was just...
Waiting for me to make a fool of myself in front of Celeste?
Yes.
All that information that you gave me was wrong.
It was.
How could you do that to me?
Because, I can't take another second of Millicent.
Last night, she made me dress up as her father.
What is that about?
I think it's pretty clear.
I guess you're right.
So, leave her.
Leave her?
And end up like you with nothing?
Look, it's survival of the fittest.
Come on, bro, you know the game.
No hard feelings.
Hey, Rick...
Hey, Rick... where you going?
Rick...
I believe they're playing our song.
May I?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
I'm Rick Parsons.
-Hi.
-May I cut in?
No, I don't think that's a good idea.
I saw her first.
-Well, I was aware of her first.
-I don't care.
Let it go!
You can't...
How do I...
Sorry.
Sorry.
My liege...
-Get out!
-Yes.
-You pulled her arm?
-No, you pulled her arm.
You were my best friend.
Get off me!
They're fighting.
Hey, guys, it's a kid's birthday party...
You betrayed me.
It was just business.
It wasn't personal.
You knew how much I needed this.
You knew how desperate I was.
Celeste was my way out.
You think I'll spend the rest of my life living with my sister and nephew in their crappy little apartment?
I thought you said you liked living with us.
Hugo, no...
No, I mean... yes.
I do.
I do very much.
So you were using me to get Arden's grand mother.
Right?
No, no, no, I was helping you.
-Please don't lie.
-I swear...
Okay... a little bit.
I mean, I sort of used you.
But, it wasn't really about you.
It was more about me and in order to help me I wanted to help you.
My god, I...
You know, that sounds worse than it is.
I thought you were helping me because you liked me.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
I don't want you sleeping in my bed anymore.
I don't want you to stay in my house anymore.
My god.
Overdressed?
Absolutely not.
No.
I think everybody at the game is underdressed.
I think you really classed the whole place up.
They should've paid you to come to the game.
I'm sorry.
It's my son.
Hi, sweetie.
What?
Sorry, I forgot the code.
Is Hugo here?
Thanks to god, no thanks to you.
Can I speak with him?
-No.
-Please?
Just let me explain.
How do you explain to a child who opened his heart to you that you were only using him to seduce the grandmother of the girl he likes?
I can't believe that I was stupid enough to let you humiliate him like that.
I'm sorry, okay?
Where is Hugo's camera?
I promise I'll get it back to you.
So, you were the one who stole it.
No, I didn't steal it.
No, Sara, hey!
Don't kick me out, look...
We're family!
No.
You're not family.
You're nothing more than a lazy 46 year old freeloader who doesn't think of anyone but himself.
You didn't just steal his camera.
You stole his hopes.
You stole his dreams.
But it ends now.
You will never use me or Hugo again, understood?
I'm 39.
What?
You said I'm 46, but I'm 39.
-No, you're not.
-Of course, I am.
But I'm 42.
-So what?
-You're my older brother!
I don't know what to tell you.
You know what?
I hope you grow up one day.
But it won't be in my house.
Okay, I'm 40.
Okay, 41.
We're twins!
Okay?
You don't have to sing, please.
Say your name.
Maximo.
Cindy's home.
Thank for letting me stay.
Watch your back.
We got you some nice hot tea.
I think I got all the hairs out.
And you can stay here as long as you like.
I'm sure you'll figure out a way to pay me back.
I get it.
Eye contact.
Don't lose eye contact.
-What are you doing?
-I'm about to pay you back.
What?
God!
No, no, stop, stop.
Please stop.
-Isn't this what you want?
-No.
God, no.
Button up, just put that away.
You're not attracted to me?
-No.
-Really?
Not at all.
No, I'm attracted to like really good looking guys.
Guys with like great faces, great bodies, who are muscular, handsome and younger, much younger than you.
And tall, a lot taller.
But, that's just me.
Then, why did you give me the job?
I think I'm just drawn to helping less fortunate, damaged, sad, sad, sad, sad creatures.
Why do you think I have so many cats?
They need me, but I need them.
But, they hurt you over and over again.
This guy, right?
I know.
I mean, just because they hurt me doesn't mean they don't love me.
I take care of them and I don't expect anything in return.
These cats are my family.
I had a chance to be part of a family.
I ruined it.
I don't think you ruined it.
Because, it's never too late to make it right.
You've cat to do what you cat to do.
I've never seen that one before.
Well, you'd be happy to know that I lost everything.
Millicent found out about Celeste's party, she kicked me out.
You got a sister you can stay with?
No.
I never should have gone behind your back like that.
Wish there was something I could do to make it up to you.
There is something.
That's your idea face.
Yep.
This is it.
So, when's the kid's science fair again?
It's in three hours.
You get in there and get the camera.
I'll keep them distracted over here.
Police.
Police from the neighborhood.
Can I help you, officer?
Here for the tiny motorcycle?
He's not here for your stupid bike.
You here for the bike?
No sir, I'm not here for the vehicle.
There's a neighborhood gas leak, evacuate the premises.
Gas leak?
I didn't even know we had gas.
Situation is clear, Larry.
Yes, sir, Mr. Neighborhood Police Officer.
I'm gonna fix the...
I'm closing the door because the gas is... leaking here.
-I didn't smell any gas.
-I don't smell anything.
You wouldn't.
That's what makes the danger so dangerous.
Excuse me, officer?
What kind of handcuffs are those?
Police handcuffs.
Are they furry?
There had been some local perps, who have been having an allergic reaction to the metal.
Now, we coat it in synthetic material, health is on the uprise, crime is on the down rise.
But, I wouldn't worry your pretty head over that, ma'am.
I don't think we need it in this investigation.
-Ma'am?
-Ma'am?
Is this an investigation?
I thought this was a gas leak?
Investigation of a gas leak.
And shut up!
I'm a police officer, I want this crime scene secured.
It's not a crime scene...
Shut up!
Got you!
Take it easy, alright.
You said investigation
No!
You take it easy.
Or I'll shoot you!
You're not shooting anybody.
I'll shoot you in the Lorax!
-That's not a thing, officer.
-It's a children's book.
You sussing me boy?
You sussing me?
I am a police officer of the law.
I don't think you are.
Officer George Clooney from the 69th precinct.
Don't make me use this.
I won't.
Let it go.
We've been compromised!
Ride like the wind.
Hey, sloucher jerk!
I'm okay, I'm okay.
You have the right to remain silent.
Not in the face.
Hugo.
Hugo.
Hey, Hugo.
Hugo.
Hugo.
Hey!
Here's Hugo's camera.
If we go now, we can still make the science fair!
The fair was yesterday.
Hugo missed it.
No!
He told me Sunday at 1!
Today is Monday.
You're too late.
No, it's never too late!
This time it is.
24 hours late to be exact.
Thanks for the camera.
All I wanted to do was impress her.
Instead, I was humiliated.
I am sorry, honey.
You want me to walk you in?
No, I don't.
You can't live your life afraid something bad will happen, because then, you've really never lived.
Where did you hear that?
Uncle Maximo.
Hi, Arden.
Hugo.
I'm so glad to see you.
-You are?
-Yeah.
I thought you were mad at me.
No.
My grandma and I know you did nothing wrong.
Good.
I was worried that your grandma would be up in arms about us being friends.
Get it?
Up in arms.
Up in arms.
Get it?
Hugo, that's not funny.
That's just offensive.
I didn't mean it like that.
I'm joking.
I'm funny too, you know.
Wow, you are funny!
-I got your letter.
-My letter?
No one's ever written me an actual on real paper before.
Really?
And my answer is yes.
Well, that's great!
To what question again, I'm sorry...
I'd love to launch the weather balloon with you, silly.
Yeah, right, my weather balloon.
I forgot about that.
How could I forget about that.
Can I see that for a sec.
I just want to see if I got all my punctuations right.
-Is that okay.
-As long as you give it back.
Thank you.
"Dearest Arden,
I am sorry if I caused you any pain.
It was the last thing I wanted to do.
You are more important to me than you know.
Two, one...
Yes go!
I always wished we could be friends.
There it goes.
But, you don't get what you wish for, you get what you work for.
Sometimes love can be scary.
Alright, moment of truth, here we go.
I think...
Sometimes love can be surprising.
Is this happening?
I think so.
Sometimes we hurt the ones we love.
No!
-What the hell is that?
-I didn't know man.
But, it's never too late to make it right.
Our time on earth is short.
But, love is forever.
You make me want to be a better fifth grader.
Would you please join me in launching my weather balloon?
Yours, Hugo."
Sara.
You didn't get the house in Pasadena,
-they went with someone...
-Let me guess, more experienced.
-Yeah.
-Well, you know what I think?
-Good...
-Can I finish?
I think that I deserve a shot at my own house.
And if I'm not given my due,
I not afraid to go somewhere else where I am appreciated.
Okay.
Have you finished?
No, I am not.
A lesser woman would have given up already, ten years of drawing plans.
But, I am strong, I am determined.
And I know that I will find my dream job someday.
-Yes, you will.
-Yes, I will.
And that day is today.
What?
Okay, Hugo.
What do you think?
Glasses on or glasses off?
You look pretty either way, mommy.
Baby, it's a big day today.
Mommy's a little nervous.
Well, at least your nose isn't sweating.
Well, it's a good thing.
Wow!
A helicopter!
My goodness!
Okay...
You wait here and I will be...
right back.
-Mommy...
-Yeah?
I am proud of you.
-Mommy's gonna build a house.
-Yes!
Mrs. Dupont.
It is so nice to meet you.
Thank you.
Thank you for this opportunity
I promise that you wont regret it.
I certainly hope not.
You come very highly recommended.
By who?
Maximo?
Wow!
You didn't think
I'd be selling frozen yogurt all my life, did you?
I usually don't put much stock in what my man candy says, but he showed me your designs and I loved them.
You did?
Thank you.
Uncle Maximo.
-Uncle Maximo.
-Hey!
-Hugo!
-That's my son.
I missed you so much.
Missed you too.
Nice blazer, Uncle Maximo.
Professor Rojas, when she's around.
Such a great view.
-I'm so glad I am rich.
-Yeah, me too.
Must be nice.
Hey, don't go too far.
Or I'll put you in detention.
Have I been a bad girl?
Well, I guess Papa was wrong.
Sometimes you do get what you wish for.
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding?
This woman's a lot of work.
Ay dios mio.
Hugo, wanna go for a ride?
I don't know if momma will let me.
You know what?
I think professor Rojas has earned another chance.
Yes!
That's my older sister.
Stop it!
I am your baby sister!
Yeah, but you look older.
Honestly.
What can I tell you?
It's true.
Come here, come here.
Come here.
Thank you.
Thank you!
You helped me make my dream come true.
You earned it.
You're so talented.
I love you.
I love you.
Okay, Hugo, let's go.
Mommy's got work to do.
Don't call him "Jugo."
His name is Hugo!
Same thing.
He's not a juice.
Up you go.
Come on, co pilot.
I want the house to be beautiful.
Me too.
But eerie.
Sleek.
Seaside.
Fever dream.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Let's fly.
Bye.
I didn't know you could fly a helicopter.
Of course.
All rich people fly helicopters.
Can I drive?
I don't see why not.
Yes!
No!
No!
I thought we were in trouble there.
You got it.
Hello?
Who's that?
It's your mommy.
She wants us to come back now.
Come on.
Show me your sexy.
Camera 1...
Squeeze your body.
You look like Chaplin.
You know who Chaplin is?
No.
Unhand me, sir.
Do you want me to see if the manager's here.
She does all hiring.
Thank you very much.
Hello.
I am the manager.
Hey, guys.
Latin lover.
Latin lover.
My Papa was the hardest working person I ever met, spending almost every day of the year on the road.
Give it to me!
But, whenever he had time off, he would race home to see us...
Maximo!
Sara!
Your father is here.
even if he had to drive all night.
Move!
I'm okay...
My Papa always said, "You get what you work for,
"not what you wish for."
So much for hard work.
This is a nightmare.
I know it's horrible living here, but we're still a family.
I don't need a family.
What I need is somewhere to live that isn't an old wreck.
When I'm older, I'm going to be an architect.
So I can build a big house for us.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to sleep so I can be sleeping.
What are you going to do for work?
I'm going to be rich so I don't have to work.
But Papa always said that you get what you work for, not what you wish for.
And look what happened to him!
It's time to sleep, children.
We're already asleep.
Look...
This is who I'm going to be.
He didn't get that rich without having a job.
I don't want his job.
I want hers.
Maximo.
Hi Maximo.
You'll like that, Maximo.
-Thank you.
-Thank you!
Talk to me, Rafa.
What's on the menu?
Take a look at lounge chair number three.
There's a hot one over there, super rich!
I see her, I see her.
She looks delicious.
Who is she?
Peggy von Strauss.
Fifty-five, divorced...
-But she's loaded.
-Yeah?
Her family owns the biggest supermarket chain in the United States.
She's perfect.
I think I'm making you wet.
You know, no I can't.
I have my helicopter lesson this weekend.
Spot!
Spill.
Shadow!
Finished.
Maximo!
There you are, my raindrop.
I was just, just on my way to wake you
Do you know what day today is?
-Tuesday.
-No!
It's Saturday.
-Close enough.
-Happy anniversary!
Yeah.
-Just what I needed.
-Really?
So different.
This one says 9:20, this one doesn't.
I love it.
Thank you, thank you.
I love it.
-I got you something too.
-Really?
Where is it?
We have... to go... pick it up.
-How exciting!
-I know!
-I'll be right back.
-Right.
Just one second.
I'm waiting for you.
I'm ready for you.
I'll be but a second, sweetie.
One second.
I'm here.
Happy anniversary!
Darling, what a sweet thought.
Get in.
Get in!
I would, but with my knees I'm afraid it's too close to the ground for me.
Okay, forget it.
We won't get it then.
I don't want my knees to ruin our special day.
No, no, it's okay, it's okay.
Let's get in.
It could be your car too.
Yeah, I suppose that could work.
-We'll take this one.
-It's a fine choice.
You know the McLarens are like snowflakes and no two of them are the same.
Is that true?
Actually it doesn't, but...
I still think it's a lovely image with the snowflake.
Don't you think?
Are you the charmer?
Call it the romantic in me.
The guys in the floor calls me the poet, these boneheads.
They like to make fun.
And what form of payment will you be using today, sir?
Her.
Very good.
I'll see if that's an option in our system.
Are you se...
Another new car!
-Yep.
-How do you do, Mr. Maxwell?
Once you lower your expectations, Timmy, the sky is the limit.
That's the most beautiful thing I've heard in my entire life.
Four!
You don't mind if Max and I play a few holes, do you?
Not at all.
As long as you play a few holes with me later.
You are a naughty girl.
Here we are, a steak and a salad.
Aha, mama likes you slim and trim.
You want me to feed you some meat.
I want it so bad.
This first bite is all fat.
-Hey buddy.
-Oye, brother.
Millicent.
You look radiant as always.
Have I ever told you that you remind me of Senor Rojas?
He was my Spanish professor in college, with whom I had a passionate affair...
Yes, I think you mentioned it once or twice...
Or every time I see you.
-Let's hit the links.
-Yes!
Wanna grab a drink tonight?
Nope, sorry.
No offense, got me booked up.
Got a bleaching appointment.
You should try it some time.
I brush my teeth.
I'm not talking about the teeth.
-Ouch!
-Gotta keep it white and tight.
Guys like you and me, we hide in the tall grass, wait for the most beautiful gazelle to come up from the back of the pack, drops her head to get that last drink of water and then we strike.
Thrill of the hunt.
Wait.
Aren't the sickly ones usually at the back of the pack?
What do you know about animals?
What are you, Steve Irwin?
Rest in peace.
I watch a lot of animal shows.
-You're missing my point.
-You know what, Rick,
I don't have to worry about hunting old gazelles anymore because in my marriage,
I call the shots.
Would have been a lot cooler if I sank that.
I loved that you got yourself a matching McLaren.
We only played nine holes because I wanted to get back home to you.
Maximo, you're home early.
I missed you.
What's wrong?
Did you get winded trying to scrap cook again?
It was a nice refreshing beverage after the workout we did...
Hey!
You're back!
Hey, how you liking the car?
Handles like a beauty, doesn't she?
You cheated on me with a car salesman?
No, a little.
Remy.
Here you go.
The number on the bottom doesn't work anymore but the top one is good.
Call any time, okay?
You want a drink?
The bar here's incredible.
Well, I don't have to tell you.
I'm sorry, Maximo.
It's over.
You sneeze, you lose, ese.
Okay.
But, half of everything is mine.
Actually, no.
You signed a prenuptial agreement.
No, no, no.
I signed a prenup.
No.
Shit!
I can't believe this.
After I gave her my best years, and after I gave her my youth, after I gave her the best of me.
Of course, now that my boobs have sagged, she finds someone younger than me.
Shit!
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving!
Look, once I cross this threshold, I'm never coming back!
I won't come back!
I won't come back!
It's finished!
It's finished forever!
But she's going to miss me.
She'll miss my seeds.
Come harvest time, she'll miss my seeds.
I'm feeling like playing some cops and robbers tonight.
Spice things up
I think I might need to get frisked.
That polyester looks a little itchy.
It will suit you just fine.
No, no, no, you're gonna put it on, you're gonna love it.
Whatever you want, mommy gets.
That's right.
Maximo.
Rick.
-I'm sorry...
-My god!
I'm sorry, you scared me.
-Sorry, you okay?
-Yeah.
What's going on?
Peggy dumped me.
What the hell am I gonna do?
I have no money, no home, no helicopters.
My god!
Stop hitting me!
I'm sorry.
I'm on these horse testosterone pills, that Millicent makes me take and it gets me a little agitated.
Guys like you and me, we're survivors.
We do whatever it takes to come out on top.
-Yeah, yeah.
-Look at me.
-We're survivors.
That's what we do.
-Yes.
All you need to do is find yourself a new wife.
-Yes.
New and improved.
-And improved!
Someone who's richer and older than Peggy.
Absolutely, yeah.
There's plenty of fish in the sea.
All I need is a place to stay while I am fishing.
Well, I know you haven't been in touch for a while but you could always try stay at your sister's.
I'm not sure.
I mean, what about here?
-No.
-Why?
Millicent insisted every room be reserved at all times in case she wants to have a session.
There is not a room that we don't...
There is one place.
Great!
I'm so...
It's the pills, it's the pills!
I don't know how these horses do it.
This is Millicent's grand daughter's play house.
Millicent's grand daughter has excellent taste.
Millicent's grand daughter has expensive taste.
This cost a fortune.
Horrible little girl.
One time she made me salt a slug, just so she could remember how to laugh.
Anyway, sleep tight.
Thank you.
So true.
So... how do you guys know each other?
My god!
Thanks for letting me stay at your house.
I am sorry.
I thought it was a real toilet.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Leave it alone!
That's mine!
Leave me alone!
Hello?
Surprise!
It's your brother!
No sir, you've got the wrong apartment.
Sara.
-Yes?
-Sara?
Who's this?
It's me, your brother.
-Maximo?
-Yeah.
The one and only.
Open the door, will you?
Sara?
Sara?
Is this for real?
You show up today, as if it were nothing?
After you didn't even bother coming to see our dying mother,
When that avocado tree fell on her.
You didn't come to see my child when he was born.
What made you think
I'd have any desire to see you?
You can't just show up like this.
I'm not opening the door for you!
I'm not...
Hey, Sara!
Sarita!
I can't believe this.
Me neither!
You're happy to see me, right?
No.
What are you doing here?
Nothing!
I wanted to see you and my niece.
Nephew!
That!
Niece, no?
Nephew?
Niece?
What did I say?
Nephew?
Nephew.
That's it.
Nephew.
Tell me what you want, and then beat it!
Peggy kicked me out.
She took everything.
Everything!
But, wasn't everything hers to begin with?
Ok, fine.
She kept everything.
She even kept the car I picked out for her to buy for me, to give her, for our anniversary.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know you're angry with me, but...
Can I stay with you?
Here?
Here in my house?
I have nowhere else to stay.
Really?
You have honestly lost your mind!
You've lost your head.
You're my sister!
Oh, I'm your sister now, right?
You've always been my sister!
Oh, come on, Maximo!
I can't believe what comes out of your mouth!
Don't be like this.
One day, and no more?
-Come on.
-Really?
Grab your things!
What, do you think that I'll carry them?
This isn't a hotel!
-Hey, your apartment is nice.
-Thanks.
Like, outside it seemed a little...
But it's cool.
My goodness!
It's Hector!
Hugo!
Right.
What did I say?
Hugo, remember I told you I had an ugly crazy brother who was the champion of farting?
-Yes.
-That's it.
-Hey how are you?
-Meet Maximo.
Hi.
Look at you!
You must be six years old by now.
I just turned...
Ten.
Ten?
I know.
I was kidding.
Everyone's so serious around here.
It's like, who died?
My dad.
I was sorry to hear about that.
Pictures!
Hey, where's my picture?
I don't know.
Those are family photos.
-I'm family.
-Uncle Maximo...
We're having chicken rice.
Want some?
Chicken?
No.
Maybe I'll have a lobster roll.
Or maybe you don't eat?
Why don't you say grace before we start eating?
I'm really sorry.
Next time.
-This time...
-Okay, okay.
Dear Lord, even though we are eating just chicken and rice, at least we're all here together.
Well, not all of us because...
Hector's dad is dead.
Hugo!
His name is Hugo.
Yeah.
Because Hugo is dead.
-Hugo is not dead.
His fa...
-Amen.
Wait, wait, wait...
Lord, before you go, please help me find a new wife with a big heart, but not necessarily a strong heart, with a high net worth, and nice big house, who doesn't ask me to poke her that often.
Amen.
-Amen.
-Amen.
-Hey, you got a girl friend?
-No.
Really?
What's wrong with you?
He's ten, Maximo.
Late bloomer?
Hugo, I have an idea.
Why don't you tell uncle Max about your science fair project?
And this way, it will be you talking and not this dummy over here.
Okay.
Sure.
I'm sending a weather balloon with a Go Pro camera to the edge of the stratosphere.
Stratosphere, wow!
I've modified the Go Pro camera to send live video stream back to earth via FM transmitter.
Wow, transmitter, wow!
The balloon's gonna go very high up.
And then we're gonna see like a little part of the earth.
-Earth.
Wow!
-Yeah!
Now I understand why he doesn't have a girlfriend.
Stop it!
Wanna know what I'm doing, uncle Maximo?
No.
-Oops!
-You know,
I prefer my own room.
And I prefer for you to be normal.
But, we get what we get.
I'm serious.
What about upstairs?
Those are other people's apartments.
-Really?
-Really.
But, hey, why don't you go knock on their doors.
Maybe they'll take you in.
I love you!
-I love you mom.
-Sweet dreams!
What?
I guess I'll just tuck myself in.
How do you do this?
My god.
Uncle Maximo...
How long were you married?
Twenty five years.
Good night.
And you didn't have to work that whole time?
Nope.
Nightie night.
What did you do for money?
I didn't need money.
She paid for everything.
You go to sleep.
So now you have to find a new wife to pay for stuff?
Yep.
That's the plan.
Sweet dreams.
How are you going to do that?
By getting a good nights sleep.
Why haven't you ever visited us?
-I've been busy.
-Doing what?
-You just said you didn't work.
-Sara!
Sara Help!
Sara!
Emergency, Sara!
-Emergency, Sara!
-What?
I'm trying to sleep and the kid won't stop talking!
-You were talking too!
-To tell you to stop talking!
-Still talking!
-Did I tell you to stop talking?
-No, no!
-Enough!
You almost gave me a heart attack.
Mira!
I thought we were being robbed.
I was being robbed of my beauty sleep.
Go to sleep.
Both of you!
Yes, mommy.
And no more talking about not talking.
And no more talking about poking either.
Tattletale.
Poke you!
Did you put your homework in your back pack?
-Yes.
-Good.
-Morning.
-Morning...
-Morning.
-Morning.
We have rules here.
Any dish that you use, you have to wash.
-I didn't know we can do that.
-We can't.
So don't even think about it.
-James!
-Hi.
Hi!
Sorry to interrupt you, you have a guest...
I don't have a guest.
That.
That's my brother, Maximo.
Nice to meet you.
Pleasure is all mine.
You know what.
My door knob is sticking again.
Can you believe it.
-Again?
-I know.
It's crazy, right?
-Can I borrow your tools or?
-No, don't worry about it.
-I'll take care of it.
-Are you sure?
Yeah.
Easy.
Easy peasy.
I'd love to.
Got a sticky knob...
Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you there like in five minutes?
Okay.
You're the best.
Thank you.
It's nothing.
Are you a carpenter or what?
When you're both the man and the woman of the house, you have to be a handyman and do whatever is necessary.
Are you two...
What you doing?
What are you implying?
No!
I just help out when something gets jammed in his house, or there's a problem in his house.
It's an old building.
Go get dressed.
Look at you.
We have to leave in five minutes.
Hugo, get your stuff.
I'll meet you in the car.
Sticky knob.
Look, that sad man has to spin the sign like a fool for all to see.
At least he has a job.
It's more than I can say about another man in this car.
Work's for suckers.
Mom, uncle Maximo said the S word.
-That's not the S word.
-What is?
-Can I tell him?
-No!
Shit.
So, you're big time architect now.
Junior architect.
But, I still haven't got my own house to design.
So I am not going to be late for work because you take two hours to blow dry your hair.
I am trusting you with my car...
I am trusting you with my car and I am trusting you with my son.
You need to go out there and find yourself a job.
Pick me up at 5:00, okay?
Okay, I'll try to remember.
You will remember, because I have no other way to get back home.
I said I'll try.
Jeez.
5:00!
Is she always like this?
No, I just think she doesn't like you.
Wow!
I smell money.
How do you go here?
I'm in academic scholarship, that covers some of my tuition.
My mom has to pay the rest.
You can drop me off here.
Drop you off?
Are you kidding?
I'll walk you in.
Where do the rich single mom's park?
-Wait, wait, wait.
-What?
-Friend of yours?
-Arden?
No.
I wish.
She doesn't even know I exist.
Why do you say that?
Because, she's a girl and she's cute and I am me.
You make a great point, you are, you.
How old is she?
She's turning 10 next week.
I heard she's having a big birthday party.
No, no, no.
Not the kid.
Her.
That's Arden's grandmother.
She's perfect.
Name?
-I think it's Celeste.
-Celeste what?
-Celeste Birch.
-Is there a grandpa Birch?
He died last year.
Great!
Great.
That's great news.
He's dead!
I'm so very sad.
Life's a gift.
Okay kid.
Have a great day.
But I thought you wanted to walk me in.
What are you, a baby?
You can walk yourself in.
Andale vamos.
I've got work to do.
Hey!
-May I help you?
-It's me, Maximo.
I'm an old friend of Celeste's.
I feel like we've met before, right?
-I don't think so.
-I think so.
-You're Ryan, right?
-Quincy.
I knew it started with a Q or a B or a S.
Quincy.
That's a great name, Quincy.
I was named after my grandfather's dog.
The legacy lives on.
-Don't touch me.
-Yeah.
And where did you say you met Celeste?
At the sports event.
-The polo match.
-Yes, exactly.
-The one back in April.
-Yeah, that's the one.
She never went to a polo match back in April.
-May?
-No.
-June?
-No.
-July?
-No.
-August?
-No.
-September?
-No.
-October?
November?
-No.
-December?
-No.
-January, February?
-No, no.
-March.
-No.
-April.
-You already said April.
And you said?
No.
I am so sorry.
I must have gotten confused.
-March.
-No.
Of course.
Thanks.
Pizza delivery.
Hey man, what's up?
I'm a little busy.
I think I found my next wife.
You've heard of Celeste Birch?
Celeste Birch?
She's worth 10 Peggy von Strauss's.
-You ever meet her?
-I haven't had the pleasure.
But, Millicent was supposed to go her charity function today at the Pacific Woodruff.
Pacific Woodruff, today?
Yeah.
I mean, go get her.
Be the best 500 bucks you ever spent.
500 dollars!
Yes, that's the cost of the charity ticket.
That seems like the opposite of charity.
-Pizza boy...
-I've got to go.
Duty calls.
One extra large sausage.
That'll be $17.15.
I'm afraid I don't have any change.
Well, maybe we'll have to work something between us.
Maybe...
Five hundred dollars.
Hi, I need to get my car wrapped... and I need the cash upfront.
Bro.
Is he here about the bike?
-Are you here about the bike?
-No.
Bro, he's not here for this stupid tiny bike, alright?
He got the thing online, you idiot.
We all make mistakes, okay?
You're not perfect.
-I misunderstood the dimensions.
-It happens.
Anyway, you thought about what kind of edge you wanna wrap your car in?
Whatever...
This looked a lot bigger on the Internet because it had a picture with a little boy, so it seemed much bigger.
Great.
How do he not know the difference between a little boy and a grown man?
He looked older, he had a little bit of a mustache.
Look at this.
This was in the picture.
It was a boy with the mustache so I assume...
Whatever pays the most!
Sorry.
Was that rude?
I'm in a rush, that's all.
I'm in a rush.
-Man's in a rush.
-Yes, thank you.
Here's the terms.
Wrap stays on the car for ninety days.
Yes.
You take it off before that, you have to pay us the money back.
Not a problem.
Yeah.
Leave the warp on the vehicle.
Yes, I will do that.
Can we start as soon as possible?
One thousand dollars.
Keep it close, my son.
I don't think they will let me.
Good afternoon, sir.
Sir?
Would you like to buy a ticket?
Yes, I would.
Pool side.
Perfect.
Sir?
Keep the change.
Am I making you wet?
Am I making you wet?
Am I...
I look like my grandfather.
Come to papa.
Is that shit?
Am I making you wet?
Sorry.
Am I making you wet?
No, no.
Bone dry.
Thanks for asking, though.
Come on.
Unhand me, sir.
I just wanna speak to Celeste.
Listen, Menudo, you think you're the first money grabbing gigolo to throw himself at my boss?
Maybe not the first, but I'm hoping to be the last now.
Not while I'm working for her.
She's been through too much emotionally and surgically to put up with this.
You can't keep me away.
-No, I can.
-No.
-Very easily I can.
-No.
I just did.
Yes, you did.
So unless you have a written invitation to our home, you're not going anywhere near her.
Hey, there's your clown suit.
Alright, here's your...
car... toon.
I kept it close just like you asked me to, paisano.
I don't speak Spanish.
Hi bro.
Did you make a move?
I sort of made a move.
Can you talk?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Millicent's just taking a post coital cool off.
Tell me you closed her.
Tell me you closed her during silent auction.
She didn't even see me.
I'm not sure about this one.
She's impossible to get to.
I have no in.
Or maybe I do.
Sounds like you have an idea.
But I can't tell.
I can't see your face.
-Describe your face.
-My face?
Yeah.
What does it look like?
Thoughtful, very handsome with a hint of mischief.
That's the spirit.
Hey, I'm there for you, whatever you need.
Unless it's money.
Then I can't do it.
Because I'm on an allowance.
Great.
Listen.
Find out whatever you can about Celeste.
Interest, passions, hobbies.
When I'm invited to her home,
I plan on selling the deal.
-I'll ask her on the club.
-Thanks.
And I've got work to do on my end.
Hey.
Hey!
My eyes are up here.
Get in.
Usually we come here on Sundays because mom says it's too much sugar to have more than once a week.
-Yeah.
-Wow.
So, Hugo I wanna talk to you about Arden...
Froyo Lo, look out That's right
You've got to let your fantasies out For a bite
-Say your name
-Hugo.
Ain't no shame
Froyo Lo Froyo Lo
Do they make you sing that every time?
I get to sing that every time.
You know if you guess the weight of your yogurt, it's on the house.
Five pounds.
That's a lot.
I'll give you one more guess.
-Thirty pounds.
-Let's check.
Wow, they're fourteen ounces.
I was so close.
That will be six fifty.
Hey, watch me and learn.
I like your bandages.
I am...
I have a lot of rescue cats.
-Really?
-Yeah, so I'm no stranger to scratches.
I'm always bleeding.
Thank you...
-Cindy.
-Wow.
Cindy.
What an enchanting name.
Thank you.
You know, if these frozen yogurts were half as sweet as you, we're in for quite a treat.
Wow!
You said fourteen ounces, right?
Gracias, sweet Cindy.
I hope your pussy cats realize what a beautiful scratching post they have in you.
Bye.
I am a beautiful scratching post.
See what I did there?
You got us FroYo for free?
No, my skills of seduction got us FroYo for free
What if I told you I can teach you how to use your skills of seduction to get what you want.
I forgot to ask for gummy bears.
Screw the gummy bears.
I'm talking about Arden.
Hey, I can get you invited to her birthday party.
Would you like that?
You can't get me invited to Arden's birthday party.
Papa por favor.
-It's impossible.
-Somebody asked for gummy bears?
They're on the house.
Thank you, sweet Cindy.
I have gummy bears coming out of my ears, literally.
Not literally, but they are in a surprising amount of places around here.
Hey, thank you.
See, I can make things happen for you.
When do we start?
We just did.
Okay, lesson number one.
Eye contact.
Follow me.
Follow me.
Eye contact.
-Okay.
-Eye contact is power, Hugo.
Women will lust after you.
Now, it's your turn.
I am Arden, okay?
Say hello to me.
-Okay.
-Hello Hugo, I'm Arden.
Hello, Arden.
You broke eye contact.
You broke eye contact.
You threw a gummy bear at me.
What?
Life will throw gummy bears at you.
Okay.
Do it again.
Stop throwing gummy bears at me.
Stop breaking eye contact.
Hello, Arden.
Not bad.
Good eye contact.
Not bad at all.
You guys are getting real creative with these gummy bears.
Most people just eat them.
Okay, lesson number two...
Women love when men take control because women have no idea what they wants.
I'll have the steak and the lady would have the cobb salad.
What if she doesn't want the cobb salad?
Listen, a woman would rather eat something you ordered for her that she doesn't want rather than something she ordered for herself that she does want.
It doesn't make sense.
Like, at all.
You know what doesn't make sense?
What is that?
You under house arrest or what?
It's a planetary watch.
Some people call it an astronomical watch.
I'm gonna call it I'm gonna die a virgin watch.
Lose it.
Let's go.
Wait, uncle Maximo.
What is a virgin?
It's an airline.
Last lesson of the day...
Your walk.
Your walk tells more about you than your mouth ever can.
-My walk?
-Yes, your walk.
Show me your walk.
-Do I just walk?
-Just walk, walk.
-Okay.
-Like you walk.
Horse shit.
Sit and watch.
Loose stride, sleepy eyes, smiling just a little bit because you know what all the ladies are thinking.
What are the ladies thinking?
Look at that confidence, he must be great in bed.
I'm great in bed.
-What?
-I don't pee or anything anymore.
Come on now, my boy.
Let's walk.
Loose stride, sleepy eyes.
What are you doing?
Pretend there's a girl and you're walking towards her.
Feel your sexiness.
I don't feel my sexy.
What is that?
You're walking exactly like the geese.
Let's go.
Don't watch the geese, okay?
A girl pass by, turn around, walk backwards, sexy, sexy.
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
One more time.
Feel it in your crotch.
You want everyone to see down here.
No, I don't.
Look at me.
You learn from the best.
Okay, one more time.
You feel sexy right now?
-Yeah.
-Great.
Okay, one more time.
Exactly, exactly, exactly.
There you go.
Much better.
Shit.
Okay.
One more time.
Gwen,
I wanted to see if you heard back on the Robinson account.
Sara,
I was really hoping to avoid you and then ignore you a bunch before you could ask me about this.
I know, sorry.
I can ask you again tomorrow as soon as you get out of the car.
No, no.
Can't unbreak this egg.
Alright, they loved you.
They thought you were incredible.
But they're gonna go with someone who has...
-More experience.
-Sorry, can I finish?
Sorry...
Yes, yes...
Someone who has more experience.
You finished?
Yeah.
I just don't know what to do.
I can't get a job because I don't have experience and I can't get experience if I don't get a job.
-Hey mom.
-I'm here.
5:00.
I remembered.
You have nothing to complain about.
I thought you'd be happy.
I got a job.
Turning my car into a stripper mobile is not a job.
-What's a stripper?
-It's only nine days.
No, it's not.
You get this trash off my car today.
Today!
Alright now, those guys, they...
no wait, girls... they dance on the poles naked, right?
Icebergs are literally just floating ice on the water
Wow, astonishing.
So when it melts, it's like soda, it's like bubbles.
-Bubbles, wow.
-Carbon dioxide.
Where's your watch?
You mean, my die a virgin watch?
What did you say?
Die a virgin watch.
Kids.
Where do they come up with this stuff?
Uncle Maximo told me to take it off.
He's training me to get girls to like me.
He's training you?
-Yeah.
-What the hell are you doing?
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It's just silly guy talk.
It's not silly.
I learned how to undress a woman with my eyes.
And how to walk so a woman would know I'm gonna bed.
He said women have no idea what they want and you have to tell them what to do.
No, I never used those words exactly.
Sure you did.
I wrote it all down in this notebook.
-What notebook?
-Lesson number...
Mira.
Hugo needs to focus on his school work.
Hey, he has a crush on a girl at school.
I'm trying to help the kid.
You know what it's like to like someone!
Or no?
Mister "I need you to grease my door once a week"
No.
You're taking one think for another.
-And James is just a friend!
-Oh, my God.
You're changing the subject!
No more sugar mama catching training!
Hugo already has a mother.
-Understood?
-Yes, mommy.
Understood?
I don't speak English.
Don't be an idiot.
Why with a tortilla?
Hey, pull my finger.
Pull it.
-False alarm.
-Yeah.
You're writing a love letter to Arden?
No, just writing to my dad.
Your dad?
You know he'll never get those letters, right?
I know.
It's just a way for me to feel close then.
Don't you ever think about your dad?
-No.
-Never?
Never.
You remember anything about him?
I remember he worked a lot.
And he parked his truck in our house once.
There it is.
Late bloomer.
I remember a lot about my dad.
He was fun.
I think he'd be happy that you're here and that you're helping me.
That's what I was just writing him.
Uncle Maximo, can I show you my science project?
I... in the morning.
Please?
I know that you're really not sleeping.
Uncle Maximo, please?
Okay.
In the morning.
Good morning.
Uncle Maximo.
Remember when you told me that I can show you my science fair project in the morning?
Well, here it is!
My weather balloon.
And here is the Go Pro camera which will be attached to the weather balloon which will go up in space.
It's cool, right?
Amazing.
Now, will you please get it off my face so I can go back to sleep?
Get up, flojo naso!
Time to go get a job.
Here, I circled the ones that I think will be good for your qualifications like human statue, mattress tester, dog poop picker upper...
It's Sunday.
What place will even be open?
It's Thursday.
Want me to deflate the balloon?
Let's go.
The science fair is next Sunday, the school is today.
Hey, no.
Hugo!
No, Sara!
Get a job!
Hey, condos, condos!
Sorry!
I'm okay!
I am okay.
He's okay.
He's okay.
It wasn't me, it wasn't me.
I'm alright.
This neighborhood isn't that bad.
I was expecting something out of a horror movie, this is more like something out of an independent movie.
Stop trying to make me feel better.
Stop trying to make me feel better.
-Are you teasing me?
-Teasing me.
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Millicent's just fantasizing about this...
Professor Rojas.
She's got me dressing like him, talking like him, but, I can't do an accent to save my life.
And I can't sleep on an air mattress one more night.
You find any intel or Celeste Birch?
As as matter of fact, I did.
And before I share this,
I don't think she's the right mark for you.
Come on.
Celeste Birch's passions, avid mountain climber, loves train travel, favorite food, fried chicken.
Great.
This will help.
Thanks.
Alright.
It is time to go.
-Anything?
-Terrible.
It's time to go.
You sound like Dora the explorer.
Now's the go, when it's time to go.
Speedy Gonzales.
Really.
Alright.
Ola.
Everybody knows how to say that.
And somehow you screwed it up.
Hola.
-I'm positive, that's the car.
-But why would we pay him, if he's not gonna do it.
We paid him all our money.
Hey, hey, hey!
Stop!
Stop!
Well, look who it is.
No, no, no, no.
Where do you think you're going?
-Where you going, man?
-Just looking for you guys.
I was just looking for you guys.
We clearly said, don't take the wrap off.
Ever!
Yes, yes, I remember and I thought you did a great job with the wrapping.
But, you see my sister felt differently.
She's your sister.
-Yeah
-Sister.
-Women.
-Right, right.
You don't have to tell Nick and I about that.
Get his nuts.
-I got them.
-Get his nuts.
I got both of them.
I got them.
You just give us our money.
We'll be fine.
I spent it.
I spent it.
Well, I sincerely hope you bought something you really wanted or needed.
God, you're terrible with this.
Nick, just think before you talk.
Can you do that?
I made a mistake.
I'll get you your money, I promise.
Come on guys.
It's just a thousand dollars.
-One week.
You got one week.
-Yes.
Let's go.
I didn't see that coming.
Nice!
-Thought we're done, right?
-You feel that?
Two hands.
You want four hands?
-That's four hands.
-Yeah, there it is.
-That's four hands.
-One week.
One week, home boy.
We went four hands on him, man.
That was bad ass.
His balls are so big.
You get that money or next time it's eight hands.
Guy doesn't have $1000, get a job, bone head.
Froyo Lo look out That's right
You've got to let your fantasies out For a bite
Say your name...
Jose!
Ain't no shame
Froyo Lo!
Froyo Lo!
Such a good effort.
It's only lacking joy, soul, rhythm and musicality.
And I would cry way less.
Maybe not at all.
But, what if mom finds out we're training again?
Hugo, you can't live your life afraid that something bad will happen.
Or you'll never really live.
Okay.
So, you gotten her to notice you with the sexy walk.
You intrigued her with strong eye contact.
Now, it's time to talk to her.
I don't think I can.
Relax, Hugo.
It's not like you've never talked to a girl before.
Yes, it is.
I've never talked to a girl before.
-Really?
-Yeah.
They make me really nervous and then my nose start to sweat.
-Your nose sweats?
-Yeah.
-Your nose?
-Yes.
-I can't help you with that.
-Stop mocking me.
Well, come on.
Let's go.
Well, where are we going?
You're too in your head, kid.
You need to relax.
I don't like the bowling balls here.
Too slippery.
I'm gonna grab a Coke.
You want one?
Cokes have no nutritional value.
Neither do eggplants.
Okay, two Cokes.
Nice form.
Thanks.
My name is Gabi.
What's yours?
My name is Hugo.
You're cute, Hugo.
Thank you.
-See you.
-Thank you.
Thank you.
-What was that?
-She just called me cute!
-She said you were cute?
-Yes.
I guess my mom's not the only one who thinks that.
Guess not.
What is that crap on your nose?
It's sweat.
Wait!
My shoes.
Okay, I'll be right back.
-Don't get kidnapped.
-Okay.
Thank you.
Those please.
-Nice work.
-I aim to please.
Okay, remember... eye contact and confidence.
Come on, take that off.
You can do it.
Now we are talking.
Look at that, you're a Greek god.
-Abs of steel.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-Is my nose sweating?
Yeah, little bit.
But, it will wash out when you get in the water.
-Okay.
-Okay, come on.
Go get her.
You can do this.
Come on, Stalker.
Do you need a towel?
No no no.
Eye contact, eye contact!
Hi, Arden.
Hi, Hugo.
You know my name?
Yeah, I know your name.
You said you know by mean H-I, not H-I-G-H.
Okay.
Let's go ladies, practice is over.
Got to clear the pool area.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes!
-Yes?
-Yes!
-Yes?
-She invited me to her party!
She invited me to her party!
We did it!
Exactly what I needed!
-Yes!
-Yes!
-Do you see my nephew happy?
-Yes!
Yeah man, you got it!
I heard about the Pasadena project.
Yeah.
Listen, I have some ideas.
I know it's a long shot, but please take a look.
I'd love a chance.
And I promise that I'd treat like my own child.
Hey mom.
The 101 was wide open.
It's okay.
I just let him drive from around the block.
Don't worry, I'm not one of those people concerned about children.
Hugo, that's wonderful.
A party with other kids.
-So can I go?
-Of course,
I'll take you.
It'll be great.
Sara, you work so hard.
I will take him.
Are you kidding me?
I can't wait to see all his new friends.
Plus, we could see the big mansion of the grandmother, right?
Hey, no offense, but I think Hugo would mush rather go with me.
I mean, look at you.
Look at me.
-Look at you.
-Maximo, Maximo...
The words should sound right in your head before they leave the lips in your stupid face.
I don't care who brings me.
I'm just excited to go.
I'm bringing you, honey.
I'm sure uncle Maximo has better things to do on a Saturday.
Okay.
James.
Shit!
You scared me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's Maximo, Sara's brother.
Yeah, why are you hiding in my garbage?
We need to talk.
It's about Sara.
My god, what happened?
It's not what happened, it's what hasn't happened.
-I don't understand.
What do you mean?
-James,
I'm not saying I get it, but she likes you.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
Hey, I have an idea.
Take her out on Saturday.
Saturday?
Don't you think you waited long enough?
Door.
Please don't bother yourself.
You just keep doing nothing there while I cook and I open the door, and whatever else you need.
Hi.
-Hi, James.
-Hi
Is it the door again?
I'll go get my tools.
No, no, no.
Actually it's...
It's...
It's my sink.
I was just kidding about my sink.
Funny.
So, do you need something?
Or did you just come here to tell the sink joke?
No, no, no.
Actually, I didn't.
I mean, I did, but I...
I came here to ask you if you're free on Saturday and if you wanted to...
If you wanted to come out on a date with me.
What?
I don't know.
-Okay.
-Mom, are you okay?
You wanna think about it?
-I don't know.
-She's acting weird.
-Maybe?
-Yeah, she'll just think about it and get back to you.
Okay, fine.
But, you know let me know either way.
I told you.
This guy likes you.
I don't want to talk about it.
-Hey!
-I'm going to my room.
-Hey!
-Finish the dinner.
Don't come in.
I'm sleeping.
Hugo is asleep now.
Why did you act so weird?
What's wrong?
What do you think is wrong?
I'm rusty.
I don't feel ready to go out with anyone.
When was the last time?
5 years ago.
I mean, when was the last time you... 5 years.
Seriously?
Thant's enough!
Are you serious?
Si.
Okay?
Stop laughing.
The bakery has been closed for some time.
Your pastry is going to go stale.
You're such a jerk.
My God, what are you waiting for?
I don't know.
You like this little gringo?
You like the gringo!
So go, then!
I'm afraid.
You know what I do when I'm afraid?
Pray?
Drink.
My God, leave my bakery alone.
Don't talk to me about my bakery.
No, but seriously...
I don't know how you've managed to go on, in spite of all your suffering, to keep going, to always move forward...
I can because of Hugo.
Hugo, how?
When my husband died, there were days when I couldn't even breathe.
But, how do you explain to a small child that he has to take care of himself, because his mom wants to lock herself in her room and cry?
You can't.
But I have a trick for when I'm very sad to lift me up.
Anti-depressants?
No, look...
I take any sad song, and transform it into a salsa.
A sad song?
What about The Sad One?
Let's go.
You're stepping on me!
Come on.
Let's go!
The Sad One!
Come on!
I'm falling asleep this isn't a salsa.
Mom.
Mom!
Hugo!
Did we wake you up?
Yes.
You're singing very loudly and bumping into things.
Go to sleep.
Both of you.
Okay.
You see?
You're not rusty, all you need to is relax and have fun, that's all!
You honestly don't mind taking him to the party?
It would be the greatest honor of my life.
Let's go!
Come on!
Send him a text.
That's my sister!
That's my sister!
Enough!
Hugo.
You have no room to judge.
Sorry for the spill.
What the hell happened to me?
Look what the cat dragged in!
-Pay day.
-Great!
Thank you.
Hey, where's the rest of it?
Try feeding 50 cats on that kind of money.
It's meow-trageous!
Old man?
Not for long.
Give me the works.
Sorry.
Hey.
Behold the glory of God's creation.
Did you dye your hair?
All of it.
I gave myself a little makeover.
Maybe next time, they can makeover your brain.
I know perfectly well...
I look very good.
Very good.
I love you, stupid face.
I love you too, little sister.
What are you telling your dad tonight?
Just that I'm excited to go to Arden's party.
And that I'm glad you're going with me.
I patched it up for you.
So you can sleep better.
Give me a piece of paper, Hugo.
I wanna write a letter too.
To who?
My dad.
I wanna tell him about his amazing grandson.
Can we do this every night?
Sure.
It could be our thing.
Hey, pull my finger.
Too late.
Sorry.
-Today's the party!
-Really?
I haven't been thinking about it.
Mommy's taking me to get a hair cut.
Tell him not too short.
You don't have the ears for it.
Why don't you stop talking.
You don't have the mouth for it.
Hugo, come here.
Hey!
I made the wall!
Wow, what happened?
It's been kind of nice having you here.
-Right?
-It's been okay.
-Just okay?
-Okay, okay...
Been very nice having you here, uncle Maximo.
Now we're talking.
-Bye.
-See you, uncle Maximo.
Don't sprinkle the toilet.
I'll do my best.
God!
Now what?
Hey.
Guys!
I was just looking for you.
Coffee?
Coffee.
-Money!
-We're not here for coffee, man!
-Money!
-That's what we want!
That's why we are here!
We don't even like coffee!
Get the money!
Yeah.
Money.
I don't exactly have it.
What do you mean, exactly?
Means he doesn't have it.
Well, then why don't just say you don't have it.
Why even say the word exactly at all?
I'm gonna pay you, I promise.
Hey, you got a real nice place here.
By nice place, I mean a total dump.
That's what I'm talking about.
People just say what they mean, it's confusing.
Guys, this is my sister's place, please.
You know what your problem is?
You don't have any respect for money man!
-Money doesn't grow on trees.
-No, it doesn't.
-It would be cool if it did.
-Nikki, Nikki!
Please!
I'm just backing up your point.
You could literally rake it up.
-What're you doing?
-Hey...
Totally forgot what I was talking about.
-What if we took stuff of yours, sir?
-Okay, okay.
That's a good point.
What if we barged in and started taking stuff?
-What if I took this thing?
-No, please...
I don't even know what it is.
What about this?
What if I took this?
No, no!
No, no, not that!
That's my nephew's.
That's important.
-This is important to you?
-Yeah.
Then, probably don't want me to have it then?
Hey, no, don't do that please.
No, don't do that please.
Okay, okay...
What do you like?
Sports cars?
Helicopters?
Rolex watches?
I promise I am good for the money and so much more.
I don't need a Rolex, bro.
-You know something?
-What?
You seem like a very sincere guy.
I am.
But, I don't believe anything that you say you're gonna do.
So give us our money, you can have your camera back.
It's that simple.
Hey, please, please, please.
Hey.
Hey!
Have a real nice day.
And by that I mean, do not have a real nice day.
I get it.
Sometimes its funny to not say exactly what you mean.
Not the camera, hey, the camera.
Uncle Maximo, we're home.
Are you ready?
Almost.
Wow!
We look the same.
Yep.
Maximo.
Minimo.
Wow, mom!
You look pretty.
And you're so guapo.
That dress is really tight on you.
You mean, I look fat?
No, no, no.
In a good way, I mean.
Because you can see all the body parts in your body.
-I'm gonna take...
-No!
No, no, no.
Let's make some magic happen.
Yeah!
Arden, here we come.
Wow!
Look at this place!
Yep.
This will do just fine.
There she is.
Yep.
There she is.
Hey, Hugo, just remember everything I taught you, okay?
Thank you, uncle Maximo.
Go get her.
Go get her, Latino lover.
Beautiful as your uncle.
Hello.
Hello.
Have we met?
Only in my dreams.
Hugo.
Did you hurt your leg?
No baby, I was just walking.
My nephew is quiet fond of your grand daughter.
Really?
Do I have something on my face?
Yes.
You have my full attention.
Okay.
It's enchanting to meet you.
Maximo.
Maximo.
Hey baby, what do you say we like, leave this place.
What do you mean?
I have a birthday party.
-Drink?
-Allow me, please.
Excuse me...
The lady and I will have your finest champagne.
She'll have a Sprite and I'll have a Coke.
Something as refreshing and exciting as she is.
Of course.
Well...
Actually, I'll just have some water.
Thanks.
Women.
They never know what they want.
Am I right?
She'll have a Sprite, like I said.
But, of course.
I have to go.
Arden, wait.
Shall we grab a bite?
Wait, wait.
Sorry I was acting so weird.
Can we start over?
Is that a planetary watch?
Yeah.
Wanna check out the rest of my party?
-Sure.
-Come on.
Cheers.
-Beautiful party.
-Isn't it?
Yeah.
Such a beautiful day.
Mountains, trains, chickens.
That's quiet a mountain of melon balls.
You know, climbing is one of my greatest passions.
In fact, I'm training for Everest.
Of course, it's not the mountain that we conquer, but ourselves.
Sir Edmund Hilary.
Yes.
You climb?
Once upon a time.
But, not anymore.
Nonsense.
Beautiful strong woman like yourself surely has many climbs left in her.
Not this woman, I'm afraid.
Give me one good reason.
Frost bite.
South face of Everest.
Just thinking about it gives me day tremors.
I hate climbing.
You convince me.
I hate it too.
What I really love, train travel.
So classic.
Won't you agree?
-Steam locomotive, 1950.
-You have no arms?
I was playing on the tracks and got stuck.
I'm afraid I haven't much fondness for trains.
Now if you'll excuse me for a moment, please.
Chicken!
-Chicken?
-Yes, Chicken!
I'm sure you love fried chicken.
Having my limbs torn from my body, helped me to realize just how barbaric the treatment of chickens is in our country.
I'm vegetarian.
Which is why I founded
The Birch Poultry Rehabilitation Center.
Now, if you'll forgive me a moment, please.
Hey!
Chicken.
Rick?
Rick.
Hey!
-What are you doing here?
-I was just...
Waiting for me to make a fool of myself in front of Celeste?
Yes.
All that information that you gave me was wrong.
It was.
How could you do that to me?
Because, I can't take another second of Millicent.
Last night, she made me dress up as her father.
What is that about?
I think it's pretty clear.
I guess you're right.
So, leave her.
Leave her?
And end up like you with nothing?
Look, it's survival of the fittest.
Come on, bro, you know the game.
No hard feelings.
Hey, Rick...
Hey, Rick... where you going?
Rick...
I believe they're playing our song.
May I?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
I'm Rick Parsons.
-Hi.
-May I cut in?
No, I don't think that's a good idea.
I saw her first.
-Well, I was aware of her first.
-I don't care.
Let it go!
You can't...
How do I...
Sorry.
Sorry.
My liege...
-Get out!
-Yes.
-You pulled her arm?
-No, you pulled her arm.
You were my best friend.
Get off me!
They're fighting.
Hey, guys, it's a kid's birthday party...
You betrayed me.
It was just business.
It wasn't personal.
You knew how much I needed this.
You knew how desperate I was.
Celeste was my way out.
You think I'll spend the rest of my life living with my sister and nephew in their crappy little apartment?
I thought you said you liked living with us.
Hugo, no...
No, I mean... yes.
I do.
I do very much.
So you were using me to get Arden's grand mother.
Right?
No, no, no, I was helping you.
-Please don't lie.
-I swear...
Okay... a little bit.
I mean, I sort of used you.
But, it wasn't really about you.
It was more about me and in order to help me I wanted to help you.
My god, I...
You know, that sounds worse than it is.
I thought you were helping me because you liked me.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
I don't want you sleeping in my bed anymore.
I don't want you to stay in my house anymore.
My god.
Overdressed?
Absolutely not.
No.
I think everybody at the game is underdressed.
I think you really classed the whole place up.
They should've paid you to come to the game.
I'm sorry.
It's my son.
Hi, sweetie.
What?
Sorry, I forgot the code.
Is Hugo here?
Thanks to god, no thanks to you.
Can I speak with him?
-No.
-Please?
Just let me explain.
How do you explain to a child who opened his heart to you that you were only using him to seduce the grandmother of the girl he likes?
I can't believe that I was stupid enough to let you humiliate him like that.
I'm sorry, okay?
Where is Hugo's camera?
I promise I'll get it back to you.
So, you were the one who stole it.
No, I didn't steal it.
No, Sara, hey!
Don't kick me out, look...
We're family!
No.
You're not family.
You're nothing more than a lazy 46 year old freeloader who doesn't think of anyone but himself.
You didn't just steal his camera.
You stole his hopes.
You stole his dreams.
But it ends now.
You will never use me or Hugo again, understood?
I'm 39.
What?
You said I'm 46, but I'm 39.
-No, you're not.
-Of course, I am.
But I'm 42.
-So what?
-You're my older brother!
I don't know what to tell you.
You know what?
I hope you grow up one day.
But it won't be in my house.
Okay, I'm 40.
Okay, 41.
We're twins!
Okay?
You don't have to sing, please.
Say your name.
Maximo.
Cindy's home.
Thank for letting me stay.
Watch your back.
We got you some nice hot tea.
I think I got all the hairs out.
And you can stay here as long as you like.
I'm sure you'll figure out a way to pay me back.
I get it.
Eye contact.
Don't lose eye contact.
-What are you doing?
-I'm about to pay you back.
What?
God!
No, no, stop, stop.
Please stop.
-Isn't this what you want?
-No.
God, no.
Button up, just put that away.
You're not attracted to me?
-No.
-Really?
Not at all.
No, I'm attracted to like really good looking guys.
Guys with like great faces, great bodies, who are muscular, handsome and younger, much younger than you.
And tall, a lot taller.
But, that's just me.
Then, why did you give me the job?
I think I'm just drawn to helping less fortunate, damaged, sad, sad, sad, sad creatures.
Why do you think I have so many cats?
They need me, but I need them.
But, they hurt you over and over again.
This guy, right?
I know.
I mean, just because they hurt me doesn't mean they don't love me.
I take care of them and I don't expect anything in return.
These cats are my family.
I had a chance to be part of a family.
I ruined it.
I don't think you ruined it.
Because, it's never too late to make it right.
You've cat to do what you cat to do.
I've never seen that one before.
Well, you'd be happy to know that I lost everything.
Millicent found out about Celeste's party, she kicked me out.
You got a sister you can stay with?
No.
I never should have gone behind your back like that.
Wish there was something I could do to make it up to you.
There is something.
That's your idea face.
Yep.
This is it.
So, when's the kid's science fair again?
It's in three hours.
You get in there and get the camera.
I'll keep them distracted over here.
Police.
Police from the neighborhood.
Can I help you, officer?
Here for the tiny motorcycle?
He's not here for your stupid bike.
You here for the bike?
No sir, I'm not here for the vehicle.
There's a neighborhood gas leak, evacuate the premises.
Gas leak?
I didn't even know we had gas.
Situation is clear, Larry.
Yes, sir, Mr. Neighborhood Police Officer.
I'm gonna fix the...
I'm closing the door because the gas is... leaking here.
-I didn't smell any gas.
-I don't smell anything.
You wouldn't.
That's what makes the danger so dangerous.
Excuse me, officer?
What kind of handcuffs are those?
Police handcuffs.
Are they furry?
There had been some local perps, who have been having an allergic reaction to the metal.
Now, we coat it in synthetic material, health is on the uprise, crime is on the down rise.
But, I wouldn't worry your pretty head over that, ma'am.
I don't think we need it in this investigation.
-Ma'am?
-Ma'am?
Is this an investigation?
I thought this was a gas leak?
Investigation of a gas leak.
And shut up!
I'm a police officer, I want this crime scene secured.
It's not a crime scene...
Shut up!
Got you!
Take it easy, alright.
You said investigation
No!
You take it easy.
Or I'll shoot you!
You're not shooting anybody.
I'll shoot you in the Lorax!
-That's not a thing, officer.
-It's a children's book.
You sussing me boy?
You sussing me?
I am a police officer of the law.
I don't think you are.
Officer George Clooney from the 69th precinct.
Don't make me use this.
I won't.
Let it go.
We've been compromised!
Ride like the wind.
Hey, sloucher jerk!
I'm okay, I'm okay.
You have the right to remain silent.
Not in the face.
Hugo.
Hugo.
Hey, Hugo.
Hugo.
Hugo.
Hey!
Here's Hugo's camera.
If we go now, we can still make the science fair!
The fair was yesterday.
Hugo missed it.
No!
He told me Sunday at 1!
Today is Monday.
You're too late.
No, it's never too late!
This time it is.
24 hours late to be exact.
Thanks for the camera.
All I wanted to do was impress her.
Instead, I was humiliated.
I am sorry, honey.
You want me to walk you in?
No, I don't.
You can't live your life afraid something bad will happen, because then, you've really never lived.
Where did you hear that?
Uncle Maximo.
Hi, Arden.
Hugo.
I'm so glad to see you.
-You are?
-Yeah.
I thought you were mad at me.
No.
My grandma and I know you did nothing wrong.
Good.
I was worried that your grandma would be up in arms about us being friends.
Get it?
Up in arms.
Up in arms.
Get it?
Hugo, that's not funny.
That's just offensive.
I didn't mean it like that.
I'm joking.
I'm funny too, you know.
Wow, you are funny!
-I got your letter.
-My letter?
No one's ever written me an actual on real paper before.
Really?
And my answer is yes.
Well, that's great!
To what question again, I'm sorry...
I'd love to launch the weather balloon with you, silly.
Yeah, right, my weather balloon.
I forgot about that.
How could I forget about that.
Can I see that for a sec.
I just want to see if I got all my punctuations right.
-Is that okay.
-As long as you give it back.
Thank you.
"Dearest Arden,
I am sorry if I caused you any pain.
It was the last thing I wanted to do.
You are more important to me than you know.
Two, one...
Yes go!
I always wished we could be friends.
There it goes.
But, you don't get what you wish for, you get what you work for.
Sometimes love can be scary.
Alright, moment of truth, here we go.
I think...
Sometimes love can be surprising.
Is this happening?
I think so.
Sometimes we hurt the ones we love.
No!
-What the hell is that?
-I didn't know man.
But, it's never too late to make it right.
Our time on earth is short.
But, love is forever.
You make me want to be a better fifth grader.
Would you please join me in launching my weather balloon?
Yours, Hugo."
Sara.
You didn't get the house in Pasadena,
-they went with someone...
-Let me guess, more experienced.
-Yeah.
-Well, you know what I think?
-Good...
-Can I finish?
I think that I deserve a shot at my own house.
And if I'm not given my due,
I not afraid to go somewhere else where I am appreciated.
Okay.
Have you finished?
No, I am not.
A lesser woman would have given up already, ten years of drawing plans.
But, I am strong, I am determined.
And I know that I will find my dream job someday.
-Yes, you will.
-Yes, I will.
And that day is today.
What?
Okay, Hugo.
What do you think?
Glasses on or glasses off?
You look pretty either way, mommy.
Baby, it's a big day today.
Mommy's a little nervous.
Well, at least your nose isn't sweating.
Well, it's a good thing.
Wow!
A helicopter!
My goodness!
Okay...
You wait here and I will be...
right back.
-Mommy...
-Yeah?
I am proud of you.
-Mommy's gonna build a house.
-Yes!
Mrs. Dupont.
It is so nice to meet you.
Thank you.
Thank you for this opportunity
I promise that you wont regret it.
I certainly hope not.
You come very highly recommended.
By who?
Maximo?
Wow!
You didn't think
I'd be selling frozen yogurt all my life, did you?
I usually don't put much stock in what my man candy says, but he showed me your designs and I loved them.
You did?
Thank you.
Uncle Maximo.
-Uncle Maximo.
-Hey!
-Hugo!
-That's my son.
I missed you so much.
Missed you too.
Nice blazer, Uncle Maximo.
Professor Rojas, when she's around.
Such a great view.
-I'm so glad I am rich.
-Yeah, me too.
Must be nice.
Hey, don't go too far.
Or I'll put you in detention.
Have I been a bad girl?
Well, I guess Papa was wrong.
Sometimes you do get what you wish for.
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding?
This woman's a lot of work.
Ay dios mio.
Hugo, wanna go for a ride?
I don't know if momma will let me.
You know what?
I think professor Rojas has earned another chance.
Yes!
That's my older sister.
Stop it!
I am your baby sister!
Yeah, but you look older.
Honestly.
What can I tell you?
It's true.
Come here, come here.
Come here.
Thank you.
Thank you!
You helped me make my dream come true.
You earned it.
You're so talented.
I love you.
I love you.
Okay, Hugo, let's go.
Mommy's got work to do.
Don't call him "Jugo."
His name is Hugo!
Same thing.
He's not a juice.
Up you go.
Come on, co pilot.
I want the house to be beautiful.
Me too.
But eerie.
Sleek.
Seaside.
Fever dream.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Let's fly.
Bye.
I didn't know you could fly a helicopter.
Of course.
All rich people fly helicopters.
Can I drive?
I don't see why not.
Yes!
No!
No!
I thought we were in trouble there.
You got it.
Hello?
Who's that?
It's your mommy.
She wants us to come back now.
Come on.
Show me your sexy.
Camera 1...
Squeeze your body.
You look like Chaplin.
You know who Chaplin is?
No.
Unhand me, sir.
Do you want me to see if the manager's here.
She does all hiring.
Thank you very much.
Hello.
I am the manager.
Hey, guys.
Latin lover.
Latin lover.
My Papa was the hardest working person I ever met, spending almost every day of the year on the road.
Give it to me!
But, whenever he had time off, he would race home to see us...
Maximo!
Sara!
Your father is here.
Even if he had to drive all night.
Move!
I'm okay...
My Papa always said, "You get what you work for,
"not what you wish for."
So much for hard work.
This is a nightmare.
I know it's horrible living here, but we're still a family.
I don't need a family.
What I need is somewhere to live that isn't an old wreck.
When I'm older, I'm going to be an architect.
So I can build a big house for us.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to sleep so I can be sleeping.
What are you going to do for work?
I'm going to be rich so I don't have to work.
But Papa always said that you get what you work for, not what you wish for.
And look what happened to him!
It's time to sleep, children.
We're already asleep.
Look...
This is who I'm going to be.
He didn't get that rich without having a job.
I don't want his job.
I want hers.
Maximo.
Hi Maximo.
You'll like that, Maximo.
- Thank you.
- Thank you!
Talk to me, Rafa.
What's on the menu?
Take a look at lounge chair number three.
There's a hot one over there, super rich!
I see her, I see her.
She looks delicious.
Who is she?
Peggy Von Strauss.
Fifty-five, divorced...
- But she's loaded.
- Yeah?
Her family owns the biggest supermarket chain in the United States.
She's perfect.
I think I'm making you wet.
You know, no I can't.
I have my helicopter lesson this weekend.
Spot!
Spill.
Shadow!
Finished.
Maximo!
There you are, my raindrop.
I was just, just on my way to wake you
Do you know what day today is?
- Tuesday.
- No!
It's Saturday.
- Close enough.
- Happy anniversary!
Yeah.
- Just what I needed.
- Really?
So different.
This one says 9:20, this one doesn't.
I love it.
Thank you, thank you.
I love it.
- I got you something too.
- Really?
Where is it?
We have... to go... pick it up.
- How exciting!
- I know!
- I'll be right back.
- Right.
Just one second.
I'm waiting for you.
I'm ready for you.
I'll be but a second, sweetie.
One second.
I'm here.
Happy anniversary!
Darling, what a sweet thought.
Get in.
Get in!
I would, but with my knees I'm afraid it's too close to the ground for me.
Okay, forget it.
We won't get it then.
I don't want my knees to ruin our special day.
No, no, it's okay, it's okay.
Let's get in.
It could be your car too.
Yeah, I suppose that could work.
- We'll take this one.
- It's a fine choice.
You know the McLarens are like snowflakes and no two of them are the same.
Is that true?
Actually it doesn't, but...
I still think it's a lovely image with the snowflake.
Don't you think?
Are you the charmer?
Call it the romantic in me.
The guys in the floor calls me the poet, these boneheads.
They like to make fun.
And what form of payment will you be using today, sir?
Her.
Very good.
I'll see if that's an option in our system.
Are you se...
Another new car!
- Yep.
- How do you do, Mr. Maxwell?
Once you lower your expectations, Timmy, the sky is the limit.
That's the most beautiful thing I've heard in my entire life.
Four!
You don't mind if Max and I play a few holes, do you?
Not at all.
As long as you play a few holes with me later.
You are a naughty girl.
Here we are, a steak and a salad.
Aha, mama likes you slim and trim.
You want me to feed you some meat.
I want it so bad.
This first bite is all fat.
- Hey buddy.
- Oye, brother.
Millicent.
You look radiant as always.
Have I ever told you that you remind me of Senor Rojas?
He was my Spanish professor in college, with whom I had a passionate affair...
Yes, I think you mentioned it once or twice...
Or every time I see you.
- Let's hit the links.
- Yes!
Wanna grab a drink tonight?
Nope, sorry.
No offense, got me booked up.
Got a bleaching appointment.
You should try it some time.
I brush my teeth.
I'm not talking about the teeth.
- Ouch!
- Gotta keep it white and tight.
Guys like you and me, we hide in the tall grass, wait for the most beautiful gazelle to come up from the back of the pack, drops her head to get that last drink of water and then we strike.
Thrill of the hunt.
Wait.
Aren't the sickly ones usually at the back of the pack?
What do you know about animals?
What are you, Steve Irwin?
Rest in peace.
I watch a lot of animal shows.
- You're missing my point.
- You know what, Rick,
I don't have to worry about hunting old gazelles anymore because in my marriage,
I call the shots.
Would have been a lot cooler if I sank that.
I loved that you got yourself a matching McLaren.
We only played nine holes because I wanted to get back home to you.
Maximo, you're home early.
I missed you.
What's wrong?
Did you get winded trying to scrap cook again?
It was a nice refreshing beverage after the workout we did...
Hey!
You're back!
Hey, how you liking the car?
Handles like a beauty, doesn't she?
You cheated on me with a car salesman?
No, a little.
Remy.
Here you go.
The number on the bottom doesn't work anymore but the top one is good.
Call any time, okay?
You want a drink?
The bar here's incredible.
Well, I don't have to tell you.
I'm sorry, Maximo.
It's over.
You sneeze, you lose, ese.
Okay.
But, half of everything is mine.
Actually, no.
You signed a prenuptial agreement.
No, no, no.
I signed a prenup.
No.
Shit!
I can't believe this.
After I gave her my best years, and after I gave her my youth, after I gave her the best of me.
Of course, now that my boobs have sagged, she finds someone younger than me.
Shit!
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving!
Look, once I cross this threshold, I'm never coming back!
I won't come back!
I won't come back!
It's finished!
It's finished forever!
But she's going to miss me.
She'll miss my seeds.
Come harvest time, she'll miss my seeds.
I'm feeling like playing some cops and robbers tonight.
Spice things up
I think I might need to get frisked.
That polyester looks a little itchy.
It will suit you just fine.
No, no, no, you're gonna put it on, you're gonna love it.
Whatever you want, mommy gets.
That's right.
Maximo.
Rick.
- I'm sorry...
- My god!
I'm sorry, you scared me.
- Sorry, you okay?
- Yeah.
What's going on?
Peggy dumped me.
What the hell am I gonna do?
I have no money, no home, no helicopters.
My god!
Stop hitting me!
I'm sorry.
I'm on these horse testosterone pills, that Millicent makes me take and it gets me a little agitated.
Guys like you and me, we're survivors.
We do whatever it takes to come out on top.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Look at me.
- We're survivors.
That's what we do.
- Yes.
All you need to do is find yourself a new wife.
- Yes.
New and improved.
- And improved!
Someone who's richer and older than Peggy.
Absolutely, yeah.
There's plenty of fish in the sea.
All I need is a place to stay while I am fishing.
Well, I know you haven't been in touch for a while but you could always try stay at your sister's.
I'm not sure.
I mean, what about here?
- No.
- Why?
Millicent insisted every room be reserved at all times in case she wants to have a session.
There is not a room that we don't...
There is one place.
Great!
I'm so...
It's the pills, it's the pills!
I don't know how these horses do it.
This is Millicent's grand daughter's play house.
Millicent's grand daughter has excellent taste.
Millicent's grand daughter has expensive taste.
This cost a fortune.
Horrible little girl.
One time she made me salt a slug, just so she could remember how to laugh.
Anyway, sleep tight.
Thank you.
So true.
So... how do you guys know each other?
My god!
Thanks for letting me stay at your house.
I am sorry.
I thought it was a real toilet.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Leave it alone!
That's mine!
Leave me alone!
Hello?
Surprise!
It's your brother!
No sir, you've got the wrong apartment.
Sara.
- Yes?
- Sara?
Who's this?
It's me, your brother.
- Maximo?
- Yeah.
The one and only.
Open the door, will you?
Sara?
Sara?
Is this for real?
You show up today, as if it were nothing?
After you didn't even bother coming to see our dying mother,
When that avocado tree fell on her.
You didn't come to see my child when he was born.
What made you think
I'd have any desire to see you?
You can't just show up like this.
I'm not opening the door for you!
I'm not...
Hey, Sara!
Sarita!
I can't believe this.
Me neither!
You're happy to see me, right?
No.
What are you doing here?
Nothing!
I wanted to see you and my niece.
Nephew!
That!
Niece, no?
Nephew?
Niece?
What did I say?
Nephew?
Nephew.
That's it.
Nephew.
Tell me what you want, and then beat it!
Peggy kicked me out.
She took everything.
Everything!
But, wasn't everything hers to begin with?
Ok, fine.
She kept everything.
She even kept the car I picked out for her to buy for me, to give her, for our anniversary.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know you're angry with me, but...
Can I stay with you?
Here?
Here in my house?
I have nowhere else to stay.
Really?
You have honestly lost your mind!
You've lost your head.
You're my sister!
Oh, I'm your sister now, right?
You've always been my sister!
Oh, come on, Maximo!
I can't believe what comes out of your mouth!
Don't be like this.
One day, and no more?
- Come on.
- Really?
Grab your things!
What, do you think that I'll carry them?
This isn't a hotel!
- Hey, your apartment is nice.
- Thanks.
Like, outside it seemed a little...
But it's cool.
My goodness!
It's Hector!
Hugo!
Right.
What did I say?
Hugo, remember I told you I had an ugly crazy brother who was the champion of farting?
- Yes.
- That's it.
- Hey how are you?
- Meet Maximo.
Hi.
Look at you!
You must be six years old by now.
I just turned...
Ten.
Ten?
I know.
I was kidding.
Everyone's so serious around here.
It's like, who died?
My dad.
I was sorry to hear about that.
Pictures!
Hey, where's my picture?
I don't know.
Those are family photos.
- I'm family.
- Uncle Maximo...
We're having chicken rice.
Want some?
Chicken?
No.
Maybe I'll have a lobster roll.
Or maybe you don't eat?
Why don't you say grace before we start eating?
I'm really sorry.
Next time.
- This time...
- Okay, okay.
Dear Lord, even though we are eating just chicken and rice, at least we're all here together.
Well, not all of us because...
Hector's dad is dead.
Hugo!
His name is Hugo.
Yeah.
Because Hugo is dead.
- Hugo is not dead.
His fa...
- Amen.
Wait, wait, wait...
Lord, before you go, please help me find a new wife with a big heart, but not necessarily a strong heart, with a high net worth, and nice big house, who doesn't ask me to poke her that often.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Hey, you got a girl friend?
- No.
Really?
What's wrong with you?
He's ten, Maximo.
Late bloomer?
Hugo, I have an idea.
Why don't you tell uncle Max about your science fair project?
And this way, it will be you talking and not this dummy over here.
Okay.
Sure.
I'm sending a weather balloon with a Go Pro camera to the edge of the stratosphere.
Stratosphere, wow!
I've modified the Go Pro camera to send live video stream back to earth via FM transmitter.
Wow, transmitter, wow!
The balloon's gonna go very high up.
And then we're gonna see like a little part of the earth.
- Earth.
Wow!
- Yeah!
Now I understand why he doesn't have a girlfriend.
Stop it!
Wanna know what I'm doing, uncle Maximo?
No.
- Oops!
- You know,
I prefer my own room.
And I prefer for you to be normal.
But, we get what we get.
I'm serious.
What about upstairs?
Those are other people's apartments.
- Really?
- Really.
But, hey, why don't you go knock on their doors.
Maybe they'll take you in.
I love you!
- I love you mom.
- Sweet dreams!
What?
I guess I'll just tuck myself in.
How do you do this?
My god.
Uncle Maximo...
How long were you married?
Twenty five years.
Good night.
And you didn't have to work that whole time?
Nope.
Nightie night.
What did you do for money?
I didn't need money.
She paid for everything.
You go to sleep.
So now you have to find a new wife to pay for stuff?
Yep.
That's the plan.
Sweet dreams.
How are you going to do that?
By getting a good nights sleep.
Why haven't you ever visited us?
- I've been busy.
- Doing what?
- You just said you didn't work.
- Sara!
Sara Help!
Sara!
Emergency, Sara!
- Emergency, Sara!
- What?
I'm trying to sleep and the kid won't stop talking!
- You were talking too!
- To tell you to stop talking!
- Still talking!
- Did I tell you to stop talking?
- No, no!
- Enough!
You almost gave me a heart attack.
Mira!
I thought we were being robbed.
I was being robbed of my beauty sleep.
Go to sleep.
Both of you!
Yes, mommy.
And no more talking about not talking.
And no more talking about poking either.
Tattletale.
Poke you!
Did you put your homework in your back pack?
- Yes.
- Good.
- Morning.
- Morning...
- Morning.
- Morning.
We have rules here.
Any dish that you use, you have to wash.
- I didn't know we can do that.
- We can't.
So don't even think about it.
- James!
- Hi.
Hi!
Sorry to interrupt you, you have a guest...
I don't have a guest.
That.
That's my brother, Maximo.
Nice to meet you.
Pleasure is all mine.
You know what.
My door knob is sticking again.
Can you believe it.
- Again?
- I know.
It's crazy, right?
- Can I borrow your tools or?
- No, don't worry about it.
- I'll take care of it.
- Are you sure?
Yeah.
Easy.
Easy peasy.
I'd love to.
Got a sticky knob...
Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you there like in five minutes?
Okay.
You're the best.
Thank you.
It's nothing.
Are you a carpenter or what?
When you're both the man and the woman of the house, you have to be a handyman and do whatever is necessary.
Are you two...
What you doing?
What are you implying?
No!
I just help out when something gets jammed in his house, or there's a problem in his house.
It's an old building.
Go get dressed.
Look at you.
We have to leave in five minutes.
Hugo, get your stuff.
I'll meet you in the car.
Sticky knob.
Look, that sad man has to spin the sign like a fool for all to see.
At least he has a job.
It's more than I can say about another man in this car.
Work's for suckers.
Mom, uncle Maximo said the S word.
- That's not the S word.
- What is?
- Can I tell him?
- No!
Shit.
So, you're big time architect now.
Junior architect.
But, I still haven't got my own house to design.
So I am not going to be late for work because you take two hours to blow dry your hair.
I am trusting you with my car...
I am trusting you with my car and I am trusting you with my son.
You need to go out there and find yourself a job.
Pick me up at 5:00, okay?
Okay, I'll try to remember.
You will remember, because I have no other way to get back home.
I said I'll try.
Jeez.
5:00!
Is she always like this?
No, I just think she doesn't like you.
Wow!
I smell money.
How do you go here?
I'm in academic scholarship, that covers some of my tuition.
My mom has to pay the rest.
You can drop me off here.
Drop you off?
Are you kidding?
I'll walk you in.
Where do the rich single mom's park?
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?
- Friend of yours?
- Arden?
No.
I wish.
She doesn't even know I exist.
Why do you say that?
Because, she's a girl and she's cute and I am me.
You make a great point, you are, you.
How old is she?
She's turning 10 next week.
I heard she's having a big birthday party.
No, no, no.
Not the kid.
Her.
That's Arden's grandmother.
She's perfect.
Name?
- I think it's Celeste.
- Celeste what?
- Celeste Birch.
- Is there a grandpa Birch?
He died last year.
Great!
Great.
That's great news.
He's dead!
I'm so very sad.
Life's a gift.
Okay kid.
Have a great day.
But I thought you wanted to walk me in.
What are you, a baby?
You can walk yourself in.
Andale vamos.
I've got work to do.
Hey!
- May I help you?
- It's me, Maximo.
I'm an old friend of Celeste's.
I feel like we've met before, right?
- I don't think so.
- I think so.
- You're Ryan, right?
- Quincy.
I knew it started with a Q or a B or a S.
Quincy.
That's a great name, Quincy.
I was named after my grandfather's dog.
The legacy lives on.
- Don't touch me.
- Yeah.
And where did you say you met Celeste?
At the sports event.
- The polo match.
- Yes, exactly.
- The one back in April.
- Yeah, that's the one.
She never went to a polo match back in April.
- May?
- No.
- June?
- No.
- July?
- No.
- August?
- No.
- September?
- No.
- October?
November?
- No.
- December?
- No.
- January, February?
- No, no.
- March.
- No.
- April.
- You already said April.
And you said?
No.
I am so sorry.
I must have gotten confused.
- March.
- No.
Of course.
Thanks.
Pizza delivery.
Hey man, what's up?
I'm a little busy.
I think I found my next wife.
You've heard of Celeste Birch?
Celeste Birch?
She's worth 10 Peggy Von Strauss's.
- You ever meet her?
- I haven't had the pleasure.
But, Millicent was supposed to go her charity function today at the Pacific Woodruff.
Pacific Woodruff, today?
Yeah.
I mean, go get her.
Be the best 500 bucks you ever spent.
500 dollars!
Yes, that's the cost of the charity ticket.
That seems like the opposite of charity.
- Pizza boy...
- I've got to go.
Duty calls.
One extra large sausage.
That'll be $17.15.
I'm afraid I don't have any change.
Well, maybe we'll have to work something between us.
Maybe...
Five hundred dollars.
Hi, I need to get my car wrapped... and I need the cash upfront.
Bro.
Is he here about the bike?
- Are you here about the bike?
- No.
Bro, he's not here for this stupid tiny bike, alright?
He got the thing online, you idiot.
We all make mistakes, okay?
You're not perfect.
- I misunderstood the dimensions.
- It happens.
Anyway, you thought about what kind of edge you wanna wrap your car in?
Whatever...
This looked a lot bigger on the Internet because it had a picture with a little boy, so it seemed much bigger.
Great.
How do he not know the difference between a little boy and a grown man?
He looked older, he had a little bit of a mustache.
Look at this.
This was in the picture.
It was a boy with the mustache so I assume...
Whatever pays the most!
Sorry.
Was that rude?
I'm in a rush, that's all.
I'm in a rush.
- Man's in a rush.
- Yes, thank you.
Here's the terms.
Wrap stays on the car for ninety days.
Yes.
You take it off before that, you have to pay us the money back.
Not a problem.
Yeah.
Leave the warp on the vehicle.
Yes, I will do that.
Can we start as soon as possible?
One thousand dollars.
Keep it close, my son.
I don't think they will let me.
Good afternoon, sir.
Sir?
Would you like to buy a ticket?
Yes, I would.
Pool side.
Perfect.
Sir?
Keep the change.
Am I making you wet?
Am I making you wet?
Am I...
I look like my grandfather.
Come to papa.
Is that shit?
Am I making you wet?
Sorry.
Am I making you wet?
No, no.
Bone dry.
Thanks for asking, though.
Come on.
Unhand me, sir.
I just wanna speak to Celeste.
Listen, Menudo, you think you're the first money grabbing gigolo to throw himself at my boss?
Maybe not the first, but I'm hoping to be the last now.
Not while I'm working for her.
She's been through too much emotionally and surgically to put up with this.
You can't keep me away.
- No, I can.
- No.
- Very easily I can.
- No.
I just did.
Yes, you did.
So unless you have a written invitation to our home, you're not going anywhere near her.
Hey, there's your clown suit.
Alright, here's your...
car... toon.
I kept it close just like you asked me to, Paisano.
I don't speak Spanish.
Hi bro.
Did you make a move?
I sort of made a move.
Can you talk?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Millicent's just taking a post coital cool off.
Tell me you closed her.
Tell me you closed her during silent auction.
She didn't even see me.
I'm not sure about this one.
She's impossible to get to.
I have no in.
Or maybe I do.
Sounds like you have an idea.
But I can't tell.
I can't see your face.
- Describe your face.
- My face?
Yeah.
What does it look like?
Thoughtful, very handsome with a hint of mischief.
That's the spirit.
Hey, I'm there for you, whatever you need.
Unless it's money.
Then I can't do it.
Because I'm on an allowance.
Great.
Listen.
Find out whatever you can about Celeste.
Interest, passions, hobbies.
When I'm invited to her home,
I plan on selling the deal.
- I'll ask her on the club.
- Thanks.
And I've got work to do on my end.
Hey.
Hey!
My eyes are up here.
Get in.
Usually we come here on Sundays because mom says it's too much sugar to have more than once a week.
- Yeah.
- Wow.
So, Hugo I wanna talk to you about Arden...
Froyo Lo, look out That's right
You've got to let your fantasies out For a bite
- Say your name
- Hugo.
Ain't no shame
Froyo Lo Froyo Lo
Do they make you sing that every time?
I get to sing that every time.
You know if you guess the weight of your yogurt, it's on the house.
Five pounds.
That's a lot.
I'll give you one more guess.
- Thirty pounds.
- Let's check.
Wow, they're fourteen ounces.
I was so close.
That will be six fifty.
Hey, watch me and learn.
I like your bandages.
I am...
I have a lot of rescue cats.
- Really?
- Yeah, so I'm no stranger to scratches.
I'm always bleeding.
Thank you...
- Cindy.
- Wow.
Cindy.
What an enchanting name.
Thank you.
You know, if these frozen yogurts were half as sweet as you, we're in for quite a treat.
Wow!
You said fourteen ounces, right?
Gracias, sweet Cindy.
I hope your pussy cats realize what a beautiful scratching post they have in you.
Bye.
I am a beautiful scratching post.
See what I did there?
You got us FroYo for free?
No, my skills of seduction got us FroYo for free
What if I told you I can teach you how to use your skills of seduction to get what you want.
I forgot to ask for gummy bears.
Screw the gummy bears.
I'm talking about Arden.
Hey, I can get you invited to her birthday party.
Would you like that?
You can't get me invited to Arden's birthday party.
Papa por favor.
- It's impossible.
- Somebody asked for gummy bears?
They're on the house.
Thank you, sweet Cindy.
I have gummy bears coming out of my ears, literally.
Not literally, but they are in a surprising amount of places around here.
Hey, thank you.
See, I can make things happen for you.
When do we start?
We just did.
Okay, lesson number one.
Eye contact.
Follow me.
Follow me.
Eye contact.
- Okay.
- Eye contact is power, Hugo.
Women will lust after you.
Now, it's your turn.
I am Arden, okay?
Say hello to me.
- Okay.
- Hello Hugo, I'm Arden.
Hello, Arden.
You broke eye contact.
You broke eye contact.
You threw a gummy bear at me.
What?
Life will throw gummy bears at you.
Okay.
Do it again.
Stop throwing gummy bears at me.
Stop breaking eye contact.
Hello, Arden.
Not bad.
Good eye contact.
Not bad at all.
You guys are getting real creative with these gummy bears.
Most people just eat them.
Okay, lesson number two...
Women love when men take control because women have no idea what they wants.
I'll have the steak and the lady would have the Cobb salad.
What if she doesn't want the Cobb salad?
Listen, a woman would rather eat something you ordered for her that she doesn't want rather than something she ordered for herself that she does want.
It doesn't make sense.
Like, at all.
You know what doesn't make sense?
What is that?
You under house arrest or what?
It's a planetary watch.
Some people call it an astronomical watch.
I'm gonna call it I'm gonna die a virgin watch.
Lose it.
Let's go.
Wait, uncle Maximo.
What is a virgin?
It's an airline.
Last lesson of the day...
Your walk.
Your walk tells more about you than your mouth ever can.
- My walk?
- Yes, your walk.
Show me your walk.
- Do I just walk?
- Just walk, walk.
- Okay.
- Like you walk.
Horse shit.
Sit and watch.
Loose stride, sleepy eyes, smiling just a little bit because you know what all the ladies are thinking.
What are the ladies thinking?
Look at that confidence, he must be great in bed.
I'm great in bed.
- What?
- I don't pee or anything anymore.
Come on now, my boy.
Let's walk.
Loose stride, sleepy eyes.
What are you doing?
Pretend there's a girl and you're walking towards her.
Feel your sexiness.
I don't feel my sexy.
What is that?
You're walking exactly like the geese.
Let's go.
Don't watch the geese, okay?
A girl pass by, turn around, walk backwards, sexy, sexy.
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
One more time.
Feel it in your crotch.
You want everyone to see down here.
No, I don't.
Look at me.
You learn from the best.
Okay, one more time.
You feel sexy right now?
- Yeah.
- Great.
Okay, one more time.
Exactly, exactly, exactly.
There you go.
Much better.
Shit.
Okay.
One more time.
Gwen,
I wanted to see if you heard back on the Robinson account.
Sara,
I was really hoping to avoid you and then ignore you a bunch before you could ask me about this.
I know, sorry.
I can ask you again tomorrow as soon as you get out of the car.
No, no.
Can't unbreak this egg.
Alright, they loved you.
They thought you were incredible.
But they're gonna go with someone who has...
- More experience.
- Sorry, can I finish?
Sorry...
Yes, yes...
Someone who has more experience.
You finished?
Yeah.
I just don't know what to do.
I can't get a job because I don't have experience and I can't get experience if I don't get a job.
- Hey mom.
- I'm here.
5:00.
I remembered.
You have nothing to complain about.
I thought you'd be happy.
I got a job.
Turning my car into a stripper mobile is not a job.
- What's a stripper?
- It's only nine days.
No, it's not.
You get this trash off my car today.
Today!
Alright now, those guys, they...
no wait, girls... they dance on the poles naked, right?
Icebergs are literally just floating ice on the water
Wow, astonishing.
So when it melts, it's like soda, it's like bubbles.
- Bubbles, wow.
- Carbon dioxide.
Where's your watch?
You mean, my die a virgin watch?
What did you say?
Die a virgin watch.
Kids.
Where do they come up with this stuff?
Uncle Maximo told me to take it off.
He's training me to get girls to like me.
He's training you?
- Yeah.
- What the hell are you doing?
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It's just silly guy talk.
It's not silly.
I learned how to undress a woman with my eyes.
And how to walk so a woman would know I'm gonna bed.
He said women have no idea what they want and you have to tell them what to do.
No, I never used those words exactly.
Sure you did.
I wrote it all down in this notebook.
- What notebook?
- Lesson number...
Mira.
Hugo needs to focus on his school work.
Hey, he has a crush on a girl at school.
I'm trying to help the kid.
You know what it's like to like someone!
Or no?
Mister "I need you to grease my door once a week"
No.
You're taking one think for another.
- And James is just a friend!
- Oh, my God.
You're changing the subject!
No more sugar mama catching training!
Hugo already has a mother.
- Understood?
- Yes, mommy.
Understood?
I don't speak English.
Don't be an idiot.
Why with a tortilla?
Hey, pull my finger.
Pull it.
- False alarm.
- Yeah.
You're writing a love letter to Arden?
No, just writing to my dad.
Your dad?
You know he'll never get those letters, right?
I know.
It's just a way for me to feel close then.
Don't you ever think about your dad?
- No.
- Never?
Never.
You remember anything about him?
I remember he worked a lot.
And he parked his truck in our house once.
There it is.
Late bloomer.
I remember a lot about my dad.
He was fun.
I think he'd be happy that you're here and that you're helping me.
That's what I was just writing him.
Uncle Maximo, can I show you my science project?
I... in the morning.
Please?
I know that you're really not sleeping.
Uncle Maximo, please?
Okay.
In the morning.
Good morning.
Uncle Maximo.
Remember when you told me that I can show you my science fair project in the morning?
Well, here it is!
My weather balloon.
And here is the Go Pro camera which will be attached to the weather balloon which will go up in space.
It's cool, right?
Amazing.
Now, will you please get it off my face so I can go back to sleep?
Get up, Flojo Naso!
Time to go get a job.
Here, I circled the ones that I think will be good for your qualifications like human statue, mattress tester, dog poop picker upper...
It's Sunday.
What place will even be open?
It's Thursday.
Want me to deflate the balloon?
Let's go.
The science fair is next Sunday, the school is today.
Hey, no.
Hugo!
No, Sara!
Get a job!
Hey, condos, condos!
Sorry!
I'm okay!
I am okay.
He's okay.
He's okay.
It wasn't me, it wasn't me.
I'm alright.
This neighborhood isn't that bad.
I was expecting something out of a horror movie, this is more like something out of an independent movie.
Stop trying to make me feel better.
Stop trying to make me feel better.
- Are you teasing me?
- Teasing me.
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Millicent's just fantasizing about this...
Professor Rojas.
She's got me dressing like him, talking like him, but, I can't do an accent to save my life.
And I can't sleep on an air mattress one more night.
You find any intel or Celeste Birch?
As as matter of fact, I did.
And before I share this,
I don't think she's the right mark for you.
Come on.
Celeste Birch's passions, avid mountain climber, loves train travel, favorite food, fried chicken.
Great.
This will help.
Thanks.
Alright.
It is time to go.
- Anything?
- Terrible.
It's time to go.
You sound like Dora the explorer.
Now's the go, when it's time to go.
Speedy Gonzales.
Really.
Alright.
Ola.
Everybody knows how to say that.
And somehow you screwed it up.
Hola.
- I'm positive, that's the car.
- But why would we pay him, if he's not gonna do it.
We paid him all our money.
Hey, hey, hey!
Stop!
Stop!
Well, look who it is.
No, no, no, no.
Where do you think you're going?
- Where you going, man?
- Just looking for you guys.
I was just looking for you guys.
We clearly said, don't take the wrap off.
Ever!
Yes, yes, I remember and I thought you did a great job with the wrapping.
But, you see my sister felt differently.
She's your sister.
- Yeah
- Sister.
- Women.
- Right, right.
You don't have to tell Nick and I about that.
Get his nuts.
- I got them.
- Get his nuts.
I got both of them.
I got them.
You just give us our money.
We'll be fine.
I spent it.
I spent it.
Well, I sincerely hope you bought something you really wanted or needed.
God, you're terrible with this.
Nick, just think before you talk.
Can you do that?
I made a mistake.
I'll get you your money, I promise.
Come on guys.
It's just a thousand dollars.
- One week.
You got one week.
- Yes.
Let's go.
I didn't see that coming.
Nice!
- Thought we're done, right?
- You feel that?
Two hands.
You want four hands?
- That's four hands.
- Yeah, there it is.
- That's four hands.
- One week.
One week, home boy.
We went four hands on him, man.
That was bad ass.
His balls are so big.
You get that money or next time it's eight hands.
Guy doesn't have $1000, get a job, bone head.
Froyo Lo look out That's right
You've got to let your fantasies out For a bite
Say your name...
Jose!
Ain't no shame
Froyo Lo!
Froyo Lo!
Such a good effort.
It's only lacking joy, soul, rhythm and musicality.
And I would cry way less.
Maybe not at all.
But, what if mom finds out we're training again?
Hugo, you can't live your life afraid that something bad will happen.
Or you'll never really live.
Okay.
So, you gotten her to notice you with the sexy walk.
You intrigued her with strong eye contact.
Now, it's time to talk to her.
I don't think I can.
Relax, Hugo.
It's not like you've never talked to a girl before.
Yes, it is.
I've never talked to a girl before.
- Really?
- Yeah.
They make me really nervous and then my nose start to sweat.
- Your nose sweats?
- Yeah.
- Your nose?
- Yes.
- I can't help you with that.
- Stop mocking me.
Well, come on.
Let's go.
Well, where are we going?
You're too in your head, kid.
You need to relax.
I don't like the bowling balls here.
Too slippery.
I'm gonna grab a Coke.
You want one?
Cokes have no nutritional value.
Neither do eggplants.
Okay, two Cokes.
Nice form.
Thanks.
My name is Gabi.
What's yours?
My name is Hugo.
You're cute, Hugo.
Thank you.
- See you.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- What was that?
- She just called me cute!
- She said you were cute?
- Yes.
I guess my mom's not the only one who thinks that.
Guess not.
What is that crap on your nose?
It's sweat.
Wait!
My shoes.
Okay, I'll be right back.
- Don't get kidnapped.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Those please.
- Nice work.
- I aim to please.
Okay, remember... eye contact and confidence.
Come on, take that off.
You can do it.
Now we are talking.
Look at that, you're a Greek god.
- Abs of steel.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Is my nose sweating?
Yeah, little bit.
But, it will wash out when you get in the water.
- Okay.
- Okay, come on.
Go get her.
You can do this.
Come on, Stalker.
Do you need a towel?
No no no.
Eye contact, eye contact!
Hi, Arden.
Hi, Hugo.
You know my name?
Yeah, I know your name.
You said you know by mean H-I, not H-I-G-H.
Okay.
Let's go ladies, practice is over.
Got to clear the pool area.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes!
- Yes?
- Yes!
- Yes?
- She invited me to her party!
She invited me to her party!
We did it!
Exactly what I needed!
- Yes!
- Yes!
- Do you see my nephew happy?
- Yes!
Yeah man, you got it!
I heard about the Pasadena project.
Yeah.
Listen, I have some ideas.
I know it's a long shot, but please take a look.
I'd love a chance.
And I promise that I'd treat like my own child.
Hey mom.
The 101 was wide open.
It's okay.
I just let him drive from around the block.
Don't worry, I'm not one of those people concerned about children.
Hugo, that's wonderful.
A party with other kids.
- So can I go?
- Of course,
I'll take you.
It'll be great.
Sara, you work so hard.
I will take him.
Are you kidding me?
I can't wait to see all his new friends.
Plus, we could see the big mansion of the grandmother, right?
Hey, no offense, but I think Hugo would mush rather go with me.
I mean, look at you.
Look at me.
- Look at you.
- Maximo, Maximo...
The words should sound right in your head before they leave the lips in your stupid face.
I don't care who brings me.
I'm just excited to go.
I'm bringing you, honey.
I'm sure uncle Maximo has better things to do on a Saturday.
Okay.
James.
Shit!
You scared me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's Maximo, Sara's brother.
Yeah, why are you hiding in my garbage?
We need to talk.
It's about Sara.
My god, what happened?
It's not what happened, it's what hasn't happened.
- I don't understand.
What do you mean?
- James,
I'm not saying I get it, but she likes you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Hey, I have an idea.
Take her out on Saturday.
Saturday?
Don't you think you waited long enough?
Door.
Please don't bother yourself.
You just keep doing nothing there while I cook and I open the door, and whatever else you need.
Hi.
- Hi, James.
- Hi
Is it the door again?
I'll go get my tools.
No, no, no.
Actually it's...
It's...
It's my sink.
I was just kidding about my sink.
Funny.
So, do you need something?
Or did you just come here to tell the sink joke?
No, no, no.
Actually, I didn't.
I mean, I did, but I...
I came here to ask you if you're free on Saturday and if you wanted to...
If you wanted to come out on a date with me.
What?
I don't know.
- Okay.
- Mom, are you okay?
You wanna think about it?
- I don't know.
- She's acting weird.
- Maybe?
- Yeah, she'll just think about it and get back to you.
Okay, fine.
But, you know let me know either way.
I told you.
This guy likes you.
I don't want to talk about it.
- Hey!
- I'm going to my room.
- Hey!
- Finish the dinner.
Don't come in.
I'm sleeping.
Hugo is asleep now.
Why did you act so weird?
What's wrong?
What do you think is wrong?
I'm rusty.
I don't feel ready to go out with anyone.
When was the last time?
5 years ago.
I mean, when was the last time you... 5 years.
Seriously?
Thant's enough!
Are you serious?
Si.
Okay?
Stop laughing.
The bakery has been closed for some time.
Your pastry is going to go stale.
You're such a jerk.
My God, what are you waiting for?
I don't know.
You like this little gringo?
You like the gringo!
So go, then!
I'm afraid.
You know what I do when I'm afraid?
Pray?
Drink.
My God, leave my bakery alone.
Don't talk to me about my bakery.
No, but seriously...
I don't know how you've managed to go on, in spite of all your suffering, to keep going, to always move forward...
I can because of Hugo.
Hugo, how?
When my husband died, there were days when I couldn't even breathe.
But, how do you explain to a small child that he has to take care of himself, because his mom wants to lock herself in her room and cry?
You can't.
But I have a trick for when I'm very sad to lift me up.
Anti-depressants?
No, look...
I take any sad song, and transform it into a salsa.
A sad song?
What about The Sad One?
Let's go.
You're stepping on me!
Come on.
Let's go!
The Sad One!
Come on!
I'm falling asleep this isn't a salsa.
Mom.
Mom!
Hugo!
Did we wake you up?
Yes.
You're singing very loudly and bumping into things.
Go to sleep.
Both of you.
Okay.
You see?
You're not rusty, all you need to is relax and have fun, that's all!
You honestly don't mind taking him to the party?
It would be the greatest honor of my life.
Let's go!
Come on!
Send him a text.
That's my sister!
That's my sister!
Enough!
Hugo.
You have no room to judge.
Sorry for the spill.
What the hell happened to me?
Look what the cat dragged in!
- Pay day.
- Great!
Thank you.
Hey, where's the rest of it?
Try feeding 50 cats on that kind of money.
It's meow-trageous!
Old man?
Not for long.
Give me the works.
Sorry.
Hey.
Behold the glory of God's creation.
Did you dye your hair?
All of it.
I gave myself a little makeover.
Maybe next time, they can makeover your brain.
I know perfectly well...
I look very good.
Very good.
I love you, stupid face.
I love you too, little sister.
What are you telling your dad tonight?
Just that I'm excited to go to Arden's party.
And that I'm glad you're going with me.
I patched it up for you.
So you can sleep better.
Give me a piece of paper, Hugo.
I wanna write a letter too.
To who?
My dad.
I wanna tell him about his amazing grandson.
Can we do this every night?
Sure.
It could be our thing.
Hey, pull my finger.
Too late.
Sorry.
- Today's the party!
- Really?
I haven't been thinking about it.
Mommy's taking me to get a hair cut.
Tell him not too short.
You don't have the ears for it.
Why don't you stop talking.
You don't have the mouth for it.
Hugo, come here.
Hey!
I made the wall!
Wow, what happened?
It's been kind of nice having you here.
- Right?
- It's been okay.
- Just okay?
- Okay, okay...
Been very nice having you here, uncle Maximo.
Now we're talking.
- Bye.
- See you, uncle Maximo.
Don't sprinkle the toilet.
I'll do my best.
God!
Now what?
Hey.
Guys!
I was just looking for you.
Coffee?
Coffee.
- Money!
- We're not here for coffee, man!
- Money!
- That's what we want!
That's why we are here!
We don't even like coffee!
Get the money!
Yeah.
Money.
I don't exactly have it.
What do you mean, exactly?
Means he doesn't have it.
Well, then why don't just say you don't have it.
Why even say the word exactly at all?
I'm gonna pay you, I promise.
Hey, you got a real nice place here.
By nice place, I mean a total dump.
That's what I'm talking about.
People just say what they mean, it's confusing.
Guys, this is my sister's place, please.
You know what your problem is?
You don't have any respect for money man!
- Money doesn't grow on trees.
- No, it doesn't.
- It would be cool if it did.
- Nikki, Nikki!
Please!
I'm just backing up your point.
You could literally rake it up.
- What're you doing?
- Hey...
Totally forgot what I was talking about.
- What if we took stuff of yours, sir?
- Okay, okay.
That's a good point.
What if we barged in and started taking stuff?
- What if I took this thing?
- No, please...
I don't even know what it is.
What about this?
What if I took this?
No, no!
No, no, not that!
That's my nephew's.
That's important.
- This is important to you?
- Yeah.
Then, probably don't want me to have it then?
Hey, no, don't do that please.
No, don't do that please.
Okay, okay...
What do you like?
Sports cars?
Helicopters?
Rolex watches?
I promise I am good for the money and so much more.
I don't need a Rolex, bro.
- You know something?
- What?
You seem like a very sincere guy.
I am.
But, I don't believe anything that you say you're gonna do.
So give us our money, you can have your camera back.
It's that simple.
Hey, please, please, please.
Hey.
Hey!
Have a real nice day.
And by that I mean, do not have a real nice day.
I get it.
Sometimes its funny to not say exactly what you mean.
Not the camera, hey, the camera.
Uncle Maximo, we're home.
Are you ready?
Almost.
Wow!
We look the same.
Yep.
Maximo.
Minimo.
Wow, mom!
You look pretty.
And you're so guapo.
That dress is really tight on you.
You mean, I look fat?
No, no, no.
In a good way, I mean.
Because you can see all the body parts in your body.
- I'm gonna take...
- No!
No, no, no.
Let's make some magic happen.
Yeah!
Arden, here we come.
Wow!
Look at this place!
Yep.
This will do just fine.
There she is.
Yep.
There she is.
Hey, Hugo, just remember everything I taught you, okay?
Thank you, uncle Maximo.
Go get her.
Go get her, Latino lover.
Beautiful as your uncle.
Hello.
Hello.
Have we met?
Only in my dreams.
Hugo.
Did you hurt your leg?
No baby, I was just walking.
My nephew is quiet fond of your grand daughter.
Really?
Do I have something on my face?
Yes.
You have my full attention.
Okay.
It's enchanting to meet you.
Maximo.
Maximo.
Hey baby, what do you say we like, leave this place.
What do you mean?
I have a birthday party.
- Drink?
- Allow me, please.
Excuse me...
The lady and I will have your finest champagne.
She'll have a Sprite and I'll have a Coke.
Something as refreshing and exciting as she is.
Of course.
Well...
Actually, I'll just have some water.
Thanks.
Women.
They never know what they want.
Am I right?
She'll have a Sprite, like I said.
But, of course.
I have to go.
Arden, wait.
Shall we grab a bite?
Wait, wait.
Sorry I was acting so weird.
Can we start over?
Is that a planetary watch?
Yeah.
Wanna check out the rest of my party?
- Sure.
- Come on.
Cheers.
- Beautiful party.
- Isn't it?
Yeah.
Such a beautiful day.
Mountains, trains, chickens.
That's quiet a mountain of melon balls.
You know, climbing is one of my greatest passions.
In fact, I'm training for Everest.
Of course, it's not the mountain that we conquer, but ourselves.
Sir Edmund Hilary.
Yes.
You climb?
Once upon a time.
But, not anymore.
Nonsense.
Beautiful strong woman like yourself surely has many climbs left in her.
Not this woman, I'm afraid.
Give me one good reason.
Frost bite.
South face of Everest.
Just thinking about it gives me day tremors.
I hate climbing.
You convince me.
I hate it too.
What I really love, train travel.
So classic.
Won't you agree?
- Steam locomotive, 1950.
- You have no arms?
I was playing on the tracks and got stuck.
I'm afraid I haven't much fondness for trains.
Now if you'll excuse me for a moment, please.
Chicken!
- Chicken?
- Yes, Chicken!
I'm sure you love fried chicken.
Having my limbs torn from my body, helped me to realize just how barbaric the treatment of chickens is in our country.
I'm vegetarian.
Which is why I founded
The Birch Poultry Rehabilitation Center.
Now, if you'll forgive me a moment, please.
Hey!
Chicken.
Rick?
Rick.
Hey!
- What are you doing here?
- I was just...
Waiting for me to make a fool of myself in front of Celeste?
Yes.
All that information that you gave me was wrong.
It was.
How could you do that to me?
Because, I can't take another second of Millicent.
Last night, she made me dress up as her father.
What is that about?
I think it's pretty clear.
I guess you're right.
So, leave her.
Leave her?
And end up like you with nothing?
Look, it's survival of the fittest.
Come on, bro, you know the game.
No hard feelings.
Hey, Rick...
Hey, Rick... where you going?
Rick...
I believe they're playing our song.
May I?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
I'm Rick Parsons.
- Hi.
- May I cut in?
No, I don't think that's a good idea.
I saw her first.
- Well, I was aware of her first.
- I don't care.
Let it go!
You can't...
How do I...
Sorry.
Sorry.
My liege...
- Get out!
- Yes.
- You pulled her arm?
- No, you pulled her arm.
You were my best friend.
Get off me!
They're fighting.
Hey, guys, it's a kid's birthday party...
You betrayed me.
It was just business.
It wasn't personal.
You knew how much I needed this.
You knew how desperate I was.
Celeste was my way out.
You think I'll spend the rest of my life living with my sister and nephew in their crappy little apartment?
I thought you said you liked living with us.
Hugo, no...
No, I mean... yes.
I do.
I do very much.
So you were using me to get Arden's grand mother.
Right?
No, no, no, I was helping you.
- Please don't lie.
- I swear...
Okay... a little bit.
I mean, I sort of used you.
But, it wasn't really about you.
It was more about me and in order to help me I wanted to help you.
My god, I...
You know, that sounds worse than it is.
I thought you were helping me because you liked me.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
I don't want you sleeping in my bed anymore.
I don't want you to stay in my house anymore.
My god.
Overdressed?
Absolutely not.
No.
I think everybody at the game is underdressed.
I think you really classed the whole place up.
They should've paid you to come to the game.
I'm sorry.
It's my son.
Hi, sweetie.
What?
Sorry, I forgot the code.
Is Hugo here?
Thanks to god, no thanks to you.
Can I speak with him?
- No.
- Please?
Just let me explain.
How do you explain to a child who opened his heart to you that you were only using him to seduce the grandmother of the girl he likes?
I can't believe that I was stupid enough to let you humiliate him like that.
I'm sorry, okay?
Where is Hugo's camera?
I promise I'll get it back to you.
So, you were the one who stole it.
No, I didn't steal it.
No, Sara, hey!
Don't kick me out, look...
We're family!
No.
You're not family.
You're nothing more than a lazy 46 year old freeloader who doesn't think of anyone but himself.
You didn't just steal his camera.
You stole his hopes.
You stole his dreams.
But it ends now.
You will never use me or Hugo again, understood?
I'm 39.
What?
You said I'm 46, but I'm 39.
- No, you're not.
- Of course, I am.
But I'm 42.
- So what?
- You're my older brother!
I don't know what to tell you.
You know what?
I hope you grow up one day.
But it won't be in my house.
Okay, I'm 40.
Okay, 41.
We're twins!
Okay?
You don't have to sing, please.
Say your name.
Maximo.
Cindy's home.
Thank for letting me stay.
Watch your back.
We got you some nice hot tea.
I think I got all the hairs out.
And you can stay here as long as you like.
I'm sure you'll figure out a way to pay me back.
I get it.
Eye contact.
Don't lose eye contact.
- What are you doing?
- I'm about to pay you back.
What?
God!
No, no, stop, stop.
Please stop.
- Isn't this what you want?
- No.
God, no.
Button up, just put that away.
You're not attracted to me?
- No.
- Really?
Not at all.
No, I'm attracted to like really good looking guys.
Guys with like great faces, great bodies, who are muscular, handsome and younger, much younger than you.
And tall, a lot taller.
But, that's just me.
Then, why did you give me the job?
I think I'm just drawn to helping less fortunate, damaged, sad, sad, sad, sad creatures.
Why do you think I have so many cats?
They need me, but I need them.
But, they hurt you over and over again.
This guy, right?
I know.
I mean, just because they hurt me doesn't mean they don't love me.
I take care of them and I don't expect anything in return.
These cats are my family.
I had a chance to be part of a family.
I ruined it.
I don't think you ruined it.
Because, it's never too late to make it right.
You've cat to do what you cat to do.
I've never seen that one before.
Well, you'd be happy to know that I lost everything.
Millicent found out about Celeste's party, she kicked me out.
You got a sister you can stay with?
No.
I never should have gone behind your back like that.
Wish there was something I could do to make it up to you.
There is something.
That's your idea face.
Yep.
This is it.
So, when's the kid's science fair again?
It's in three hours.
You get in there and get the camera.
I'll keep them distracted over here.
Police.
Police from the neighborhood.
Can I help you, officer?
Here for the tiny motorcycle?
He's not here for your stupid bike.
You here for the bike?
No sir, I'm not here for the vehicle.
There's a neighborhood gas leak, evacuate the premises.
Gas leak?
I didn't even know we had gas.
Situation is clear, Larry.
Yes, sir, Mr. Neighborhood Police Officer.
I'm gonna fix the...
I'm closing the door because the gas is... leaking here.
- I didn't smell any gas.
- I don't smell anything.
You wouldn't.
That's what makes the danger so dangerous.
Excuse me, officer?
What kind of handcuffs are those?
Police handcuffs.
Are they furry?
There had been some local perps, who have been having an allergic reaction to the metal.
Now, we coat it in synthetic material, health is on the uprise, crime is on the down rise.
But, I wouldn't worry your pretty head over that, ma'am.
I don't think we need it in this investigation.
- Ma'am?
- Ma'am?
Is this an investigation?
I thought this was a gas leak?
Investigation of a gas leak.
And shut up!
I'm a police officer, I want this crime scene secured.
It's not a crime scene...
Shut up!
Got you!
Take it easy, alright.
You said investigation
No!
You take it easy.
Or I'll shoot you!
You're not shooting anybody.
I'll shoot you in the Lorax!
- That's not a thing, officer.
- It's a children's book.
You sussing me boy?
You sussing me?
I am a police officer of the law.
I don't think you are.
Officer George Clooney from the 69th precinct.
Don't make me use this.
I won't.
Let it go.
We've been compromised!
Ride like the wind.
Hey, sloucher jerk!
I'm okay, I'm okay.
You have the right to remain silent.
Not in the face.
Hugo.
Hugo.
Hey, Hugo.
Hugo.
Hugo.
Hey!
Here's Hugo's camera.
If we go now, we can still make the science fair!
The fair was yesterday.
Hugo missed it.
No!
He told me Sunday at 1!
Today is Monday.
You're too late.
No, it's never too late!
This time it is.
24 hours late to be exact.
Thanks for the camera.
All I wanted to do was impress her.
Instead, I was humiliated.
I am sorry, honey.
You want me to walk you in?
No, I don't.
You can't live your life afraid something bad will happen, because then, you've really never lived.
Where did you hear that?
Uncle Maximo.
Hi, Arden.
Hugo.
I'm so glad to see you.
- You are?
- Yeah.
I thought you were mad at me.
No.
My grandma and I know you did nothing wrong.
Good.
I was worried that your grandma would be up in arms about us being friends.
Get it?
Up in arms.
Up in arms.
Get it?
Hugo, that's not funny.
That's just offensive.
I didn't mean it like that.
I'm joking.
I'm funny too, you know.
Wow, you are funny!
- I got your letter.
- My letter?
No one's ever written me an actual on real paper before.
Really?
And my answer is yes.
Well, that's great!
To what question again, I'm sorry...
I'd love to launch the weather balloon with you, silly.
Yeah, right, my weather balloon.
I forgot about that.
How could I forget about that.
Can I see that for a sec.
I just want to see if I got all my punctuations right.
- Is that okay.
- As long as you give it back.
Thank you.
"Dearest Arden,
I am sorry if I caused you any pain.
It was the last thing I wanted to do.
You are more important to me than you know.
Two, one...
Yes go!
I always wished we could be friends.
There it goes.
But, you don't get what you wish for, you get what you work for.
Sometimes love can be scary.
Alright, moment of truth, here we go.
I think...
Sometimes love can be surprising.
Is this happening?
I think so.
Sometimes we hurt the ones we love.
No!
- What the hell is that?
- I didn't know man.
But, it's never too late to make it right.
Our time on earth is short.
But, love is forever.
You make me want to be a better fifth grader.
Would you please join me in launching my weather balloon?
Yours, Hugo."
Sara.
You didn't get the house in Pasadena,
- they went with someone...
- Let me guess, more experienced.
- Yeah.
- Well, you know what I think?
- Good...
- Can I finish?
I think that I deserve a shot at my own house.
And if I'm not given my due,
I not afraid to go somewhere else where I am appreciated.
Okay.
Have you finished?
No, I am not.
A lesser woman would have given up already, ten years of drawing plans.
But, I am strong, I am determined.
And I know that I will find my dream job someday.
- Yes, you will.
- Yes, I will.
And that day is today.
What?
Okay, Hugo.
What do you think?
Glasses on or glasses off?
You look pretty either way, mommy.
Baby, it's a big day today.
Mommy's a little nervous.
Well, at least your nose isn't sweating.
Well, it's a good thing.
Wow!
A helicopter!
My goodness!
Okay...
You wait here and I will be...
right back.
- Mommy...
- Yeah?
I am proud of you.
- Mommy's gonna build a house.
- Yes!
Mrs. Dupont.
It is so nice to meet you.
Thank you.
Thank you for this opportunity
I promise that you wont regret it.
I certainly hope not.
You come very highly recommended.
By who?
Maximo?
Wow!
You didn't think
I'd be selling frozen yogurt all my life, did you?
I usually don't put much stock in what my man candy says, but he showed me your designs and I loved them.
You did?
Thank you.
Uncle Maximo.
- Uncle Maximo.
- Hey!
- Hugo!
- That's my son.
I missed you so much.
Missed you too.
Nice blazer, Uncle Maximo.
Professor Rojas, when she's around.
Such a great view.
- I'm so glad I am rich.
- Yeah, me too.
Must be nice.
Hey, don't go too far.
Or I'll put you in detention.
Have I been a bad girl?
Well, I guess Papa was wrong.
Sometimes you do get what you wish for.
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding?
This woman's a lot of work.
Ay Dios mio.
Hugo, wanna go for a ride?
I don't know if momma will let me.
You know what?
I think professor Rojas has earned another chance.
Yes!
That's my older sister.
Stop it!
I am your baby sister!
Yeah, but you look older.
Honestly.
What can I tell you?
It's true.
Come here, come here.
Come here.
Thank you.
Thank you!
You helped me make my dream come true.
You earned it.
You're so talented.
I love you.
I love you.
Okay, Hugo, let's go.
Mommy's got work to do.
Don't call him "Jugo."
His name is Hugo!
Same thing.
He's not a juice.
Up you go.
Come on, co pilot.
I want the house to be beautiful.
Me too.
But eerie.
Sleek.
Seaside.
Fever dream.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Let's fly.
Bye.
I didn't know you could fly a helicopter.
Of course.
All rich people fly helicopters.
Can I drive?
I don't see why not.
Yes!
No!
No!
I thought we were in trouble there.
You got it.
Hello?
Who's that?
It's your mommy.
She wants us to come back now.
Come on.
Show me your sexy.
Camera 1...
Squeeze your body.
You look like Chaplin.
You know who Chaplin is?
No.
Unhand me, sir.
Do you want me to see if the manager's here.
She does all hiring.
Thank you very much.
Hello.
I am the manager.
Hey, guys.
Latin lover.
Latin lover.
My Papa was the hardest working person I ever met, spending almost every day of the year on the road.
But, whenever he had time off, he would race home to see us...
Maximo!
Sara!
Your father is here.
Even if he had to drive all night.
Move!
I'm okay...
My Papa always said, "You get what you work for,
"not what you wish for."
So much for hard work.
This is a nightmare.
I know it's horrible living here, but we're still a family.
I don't need a family.
What I need is somewhere to live that isn't an old wreck.
When I'm older, I'm going to be an architect.
So I can build a big house for us.
What are you going to do?
- I'm going to sleep so I can be sleeping.
What are you going to do for work?
I'm going to be rich so I don't have to work.
But Papa always said that you get what you work for, not what you wish for.
And look what happened to him!
It's time to sleep, children.
- We're already asleep.
Look...
This is who I'm going to be.
He didn't get that rich without having a job.
No, no, no, no.
I don't want his job.
I want hers.
Maximo.
10 YEARS LATER Acapulco, MX
Hi Maximo.
You'll like that, Maximo.
Thank you.
- Thank you!
Talk to me, Rafa.
What's on the menu?
Take a look at lounge chair number three.
There's a hot one over there, super rich!
I see her, I see her.
She looks delicious.
Who is she?
- Peggy von Strauss.
Fifty-five, divorced...
But she's loaded.
- Yeah?
Her family owns the biggest supermarket chain in the United States.
She's perfect.
Oh!
I think I'm making you wet.
25 YEARS LATER Bel Air, CA
HOW TO BE A LATIN LOVER
You know, no I can't.
I have my helicopter lesson this weekend.
Spot!
Spill.
Shadow!
Finished.
Maximo!
There you are, my raindrop.
I was just, just on my way to wake you
Do you know what day today is?
Tuesday.
- No!
It's Saturday.
Close enough.
- Happy anniversary!
Oh!
Yeah.
Just what I needed.
- Really?
So different.
This one says 9:20, this one doesn't.
I love it.
Thank you, thank you.
I love it.
I got you something too.
- Really?
Where is it?
We have... to go... pick it up.
How exciting!
- I know!
I'll be right back.
- Right.
Just one second.
- I'm waiting for you.
I'm ready for you.
I'll be but a second, sweetie.
One second.
- I'm here.
Happy anniversary!
Darling, what a sweet thought.
- Get in.
Get in!
I would, but with my knees,
I'm afraid it's too close to the ground for me.
Okay, forget it.
We won't get it then.
I don't want my knees to ruin our special day.
No, no, it's okay, it's okay.
Let's get in.
It could be your car too.
Yeah, I suppose that could work.
We'll take this one.
- It's a fine choice.
You know the McLarens are like snowflakes, and no two of them are the same.
Is that true?
- Actually it doesn't, but...
I still think it's a lovely image with the snowflake.
Don't you think?
Are you the charmer?
- Call it the romantic in me.
The guys in the floor calls me the poet, these boneheads.
They like to make fun.
And what form of payment will you be using today, sir?
Her.
Very good.
I'll see if that's an option in our system.
Are you se...
Another new car!
Yep.
- How do you do, Mr. Maxwell?
Once you lower your expectations, Timmy, the sky is the limit.
That's the most beautiful thing I've heard in my entire life.
Four!
- You don't mind if Max and I play a few holes, do you?
Not at all.
As long as you play a few holes with me later.
You are a naughty girl.
- Here we are.
A steak and a salad.
Aha, mama likes you slim and trim.
You want me to feed you some meat.
- I want it so bad.
This first bite is all fat.
- Hey buddy.
- Oye, brother.
Millicent.
You look radiant as always.
Have I ever told you that you remind me of Senor Rojas?
He was my Spanish professor in college, with whom I had a passionate affair...
Yes, I think you mentioned it once or twice...
Or every time I see you.
Let's hit the links.
- Yes!
Wanna grab a drink tonight?
- Nope, sorry.
No offense, got me booked up.
Got a bleaching appointment.
- You should try it some time.
I brush my teeth.
- I'm not talking about the teeth.
Ouch!
- Gotta keep it white and tight.
Guys like you and me, we hide in the tall grass, wait for the most beautiful gazelle to come up from the back of the pack, drops her head to get that last drink of water and then we strike.
Thrill of the hunt.
- Wait.
Aren't the sickly ones usually at the back of the pack?
What do you know about animals?
What are you, Steve Irwin?
Rest in peace.
- I watch a lot of animal shows.
You're missing my point.
- You know what, Rick,
I don't have to worry about hunting old gazelles anymore because in my marriage,
I call the shots.
Would have been a lot cooler if I sank that.
I loved that you got yourself a matching McLaren.
We only played nine holes because I wanted to get back home to you.
Maximo, you're home early.
- I missed you.
What's wrong?
Did you get winded trying to scrap cook again?
It was a nice refreshing beverage after the workout we did...
Hey!
You're back!
Hey, how you liking the car?
Handles like a beauty, doesn't she?
You cheated on me with a car salesman?
- No, a little.
Remy.
Here you go.
The number on the bottom doesn't work anymore but the top one is good.
Call any time, okay?
You want a drink?
The bar here's incredible.
Well, I don't have to tell you.
I'm sorry, Maximo.
It's over.
You sneeze, you lose, ese.
Okay.
But, half of everything is mine.
- Actually, no.
You signed a prenuptial agreement.
- No, no, no.
I signed a prenup.
No.
Shit!
I can't believe this.
After I gave her my best years, and after I gave her my youth, after I gave her the best of me.
Of course, now that my boobs have sagged, she finds someone younger than me.
Shit!
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving!
Look, once I cross this threshold, I'm never coming back!
I won't come back!
Ok.
I won't come back!
It's finished!
It's finished forever!
But she's going to miss me.
She'll miss my seeds.
Come harvest time, she'll miss my seeds.
I'm feeling like playing some cops and robbers tonight.
Spice things up
I think I might need to get frisked.
- That polyester looks a little itchy.
It will suit you just fine.
No, no, no, you're gonna put it on, you're gonna love it.
Whatever you want, mommy gets.
- That's right.
Maximo.
Rick.
I'm sorry...
- My God!
- I'm sorry, you scared me.
Sorry, you okay?
- Yeah.
- What's going on?
Peggy dumped me.
What the hell am I gonna do?
I have no money, no home, no helicopters.
- Oh!
My God!
Stop hitting me!
- I'm sorry.
I'm on these horse testosterone pills, that Millicent makes me take and it gets me a little agitated.
Guys like you and me, we're survivors.
We do whatever it takes to come out on top.
Yeah, yeah.
- Look at me.
We're survivors.
That's what we do.
- Yes.
All you need to do is find yourself a new wife.
Yes.
New and improved.
- And improved!
Someone who's richer and older than Peggy.
Absolutely, yeah.
There's plenty of fish in the sea.
All I need is a place to stay while I am fishing.
Well, I know you haven't been in touch for a while but you could always try stay at your sister's.
I'm not sure.
I mean, what about here?
No.
- Why?
- Millicent insisted every room be reserved at all times in case she wants to have a session.
There is not a room that we don't...
There is one place.
- Great!
I'm so...
It's the pills, it's the pills!
I don't know how these horses do it.
This is Millicent's grand daughter's play house.
Millicent's grand daughter has excellent taste.
- Millicent's grand daughter has expensive taste.
This cost a fortune.
Horrible little girl.
One time she made me salt a slug, just so she could remember how to laugh.
Anyway, sleep tight.
Thank you.
POOPING IS FOR EVERYONE
So true.
So... how do you guys know each other?
Oh!
Oh, my god!
Oh!
Thanks for letting me stay at your house.
I am sorry.
I thought it was a real toilet.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Leave it alone!
That's mine!
Leave me alone!
NICK SCOTT'S WRAPSTARS
Hello?
Surprise!
It's your brother!
No sir, you've got the wrong apartment.
Hej!
S...
Sara.
Yes?
- Sara?
Who's this?
It's me, your brother.
Maximo?
- Yeah.
The one and only.
Open the door, will you?
Sara?
Sara?
Is this for real?
You show up today, as if it were nothing?
After you didn't even bother coming to see our dying mother,
When that avocado tree fell on her.
You didn't come to see my child when he was born.
What made you think
I'd have any desire to see you?
You can't just show up like this.
I'm not opening the door for you!
I'm not...
Hey, Sara!
Sarita!
- I can't believe this.
Me neither!
You're happy to see me, right?
- No.
What are you doing here?
- Nothing!
I wanted to see you and my niece.
Nephew!
- That!
Niece, no?
Nephew?
Niece?
What did I say?
Nephew?
Nephew.
That's it.
Nephew.
- Tell me what you want, and then beat it!
Peggy kicked me out.
She took everything.
Everything!
But, wasn't everything hers to begin with?
- Ok, fine.
She kept everything.
She even kept the car I picked out for her to buy for me, to give her, for our anniversary.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know you're angry with me, but...
Can I stay with you?
- Here?
Here in my house?
- Yes.
I have nowhere else to stay.
- Really?
You have honestly lost your mind!
You've lost your head.
- You're my sister!
Oh, I'm your sister now, right?
- You've always been my sister!
Oh, come on, Maximo!
I can't believe what comes out of your mouth!
Don't be like this.
- Stop it!
One day, and no more?
Come on.
- Really?
Grab your things!
What, do you think, that I'll carry them?
This isn't a hotel!
Hey, your apartment is nice.
- Thanks.
Like, outside it seemed a little...
But it's cool.
Oh, my goodness!
It's Hector!
Hugo!
- Right.
What did I say?
Hugo, remember I told you I had an ugly crazy brother who was the champion of farting?
- Yes.
- That's it.
Hey how are you?
- Meet Maximo.
- Hi.
Look at you!
You must be six years old by now, a?
I just turned... ten.
Ten?
I know.
I was kidding.
Everyone's so serious around here.
It's like, who died?
- My dad.
I was sorry to hear about that.
Pictures!
Hey, where's my picture?
I don't know.
Those are family photos.
I'm family.
- Uncle Maximo...
We're having chicken rice.
Want some?
Chicken?
No.
Maybe I'll have a lobster roll.
- Or maybe you don't eat?
Why don't you say grace before we start eating?
I'm really sorry.
Next time.
This time...
- Okay, okay.
Dear Lord, even though we are eating just chicken and rice, at least we're all here together.
Well, not all of us because...
Hector's dad is dead.
Hugo!
His name is Hugo.
- Oh, yeah.
Because Hugo is dead.
- Hugo is not dead.
His fa...
- Amen.
Wait, wait, wait...
Lord, before you go, please help me find a new wife with a big heart, but not necessarily a strong heart, with a high net worth, and nice big house, who doesn't ask me to poke her that often.
Amen.
Amen.
- Amen.
Hey, you got a girl friend?
- No.
Really?
What's wrong with you?
- He's ten, Maximo.
Oh!
Late bloomer, a?
Hugo, I have an idea.
Why don't you tell uncle Max about your science fair project?
And this way, it will be you talking and not this dummy over here.
- Okay.
Sure.
I'm sending a weather balloon with a Go Pro camera to the edge of the stratosphere.
- Ou, stratosphere, wow!
I've modified the Go Pro camera to send live video stream back to earth via FM transmitter.
- Wow, transmitter, wow!
The balloon's gonna go very high up.
And then we're gonna see like a little part of the earth.
- Earth.
Wow!
- Yeah!
Now I understand why he doesn't have a girlfriend.
Stop it!
Wanna know what I'm doing, uncle Maximo?
- No.
Oops!
- You know, I prefer my own room.
And I prefer for you to be normal.
But, we get what we get.
- I'm serious.
What about upstairs?
Those are other people's apartments.
- Really?
Really.
But, hey, why don't you go knock on their doors.
Maybe they'll take you in.
I love you!
- I love you mom.
- Sweet dreams!
What?
I guess I'll just tuck myself in.
How do you do this?
My God.
Uncle Maximo...
- Mm-hm?
How long were you married?
Twenty five years.
Good night.
And you didn't have to work that whole time?
Nope.
Nightie night.
What did you do for money?
I didn't need money.
She paid for everything.
You go to sleep.
So now you have to find a new wife to pay for stuff?
Yep.
That's the plan.
Sweet dreams.
How are you going to do that?
By getting a good nights sleep.
Why haven't you ever visited us?
- I've been busy.
- Doing what?
You just said you didn't work.
- Sara!
Sara Help!
Sara!
Emergency, Sara!
Emergency, Sara!
- What?
Aaaaaaaa!
I'm trying to sleep and the kid won't stop talking!
You were talking too!
- To tell you to stop talking!
Still talking!
- Did I tell you to stop talking?
- No, no!
- Enough!
You almost gave me a heart attack.
Mira!
I thought we were being robbed.
I was being robbed of my beauty sleep.
Oh, God!
Sh!
Go to sleep.
Both of you!
- Yes, mommy.
And no more talking about not talking.
And no more talking about poking either.
Tattletale.
- Poke you!
Did you put your homework in your back pack?
- Yes.
- Good.
Morning.
- Morning...
Morning.
- Morning.
We have rules here.
Any dish that you use, you have to wash.
I didn't know we can do that.
- We can't.
So don't even think about it.
Oh, James!
- Hi.
- Hi!
Sorry to interrupt you, you have a guest...
- I don't have a guest.
Oh that?
That's my brother, Maximo.
Oh!
Oh!
Nice to meet you.
Pleasure is all mine.
Agh, you know what?
My door knob is sticking again.
Can you believe it?
Again?
- I know.
It's crazy, right?
Can I borrow your tools or?
- No, don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Easy.
Easy peasy.
I'd love to.
Got a sticky knob...
Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you there like in five minutes?
Okay.
You're the best.
Thank you.
It's nothing.
Are you a carpenter or what?
When you're both the man and the woman of the house, you have to be a handyman and do whatever is necessary.
Are you two...
What you doing?
What are you implying?
No!
I just help out when something gets jammed in his house, or there's a problem in his house.
It's an old building.
Go get dressed.
Look at you.
We have to leave in five minutes.
Hugo, get your stuff.
I'll meet you in the car.
Sticky knob.
Look, that sad man has to spin the sign like a fool for all to see.
At least he has a job.
It's more than I can say about another man in this car.
Work's for suckers.
Mom, uncle Maximo said the S word.
- That's not the S word.
What is?
- Can I tell him?
- No!
Shit.
So, you're big time architect now.
- Junior architect.
But, I still haven't got my own house to design.
So I am not going to be late for work because you take two hours to blow dry your hair.
I am trusting you with my car...
I am trusting you with my car and I am trusting you with my son.
You need to go out there and find yourself a job.
Pick me up at 5:00, okay?
Okay, I'll try to remember.
You will remember, because I have no other way to get back home.
I said I'll try.
Jeez.
- 5:00!
Is she always like this?
- No, I just think she doesn't like you.
Wow!
I smell money.
How do you go here?
- I'm in academic scholarship, that covers some of my tuition.
My mom has to pay the rest.
You can drop me off here.
- Drop you off?
Are you kidding?
I'll walk you in.
Where do the rich single mom's park?
Wait, wait, wait.
- What?
Friend of yours?
- Arden?
No.
I wish.
She doesn't even know I exist.
Why do you say that?
- Because, she's a girl, and she's cute and I am me.
You make a great point, you are, you.
How old is she?
She's turning 10 next week.
I heard she's having a big birthday party.
- No, no, no.
Not the kid.
Her.
That's Arden's grandmother.
- She's perfect.
Name?
- I think it's Celeste.
- Celeste what?
Celeste Birch.
- Is there a grandpa Birch?
He died last year.
- Great!
Great.
That's great news.
He's dead!
I'm so very sad.
Life's a gift.
Okay kid.
Have a great day.
- But I thought you wanted to walk me in.
What are you, a baby?
You can walk yourself in.
Andale vamos.
I've got work to do.
Hey!
May I help you?
- It's me, Maximo.
I'm an old friend of Celeste's.
I feel like we've met before, right?
I don't think so.
- I think so.
- You're Ryan, right?
- Quincy.
I knew it started with a Q or a B or a S. Quincy.
That's a great name, Quincy.
I was named after my grandfather's dog.
The legacy lives on.
- Don't touch me.
- Oh, yeah.
And where did you say you met Celeste?
At the sports event.
The polo match.
- Yes, exactly.
The one back in April.
- Yeah, that's the one.
She never went to a polo match back in April.
May?
- No.
- June?
- No.
July?
- No.
- August?
- No.
September?
- No.
- October?
- No.
- November?
- No.
December?
- No.
- January?
- No.
- February?
- No.
March.
- No.
April.
- You already said April.
And you said?
No.
Oh, oh, I am so sorry.
I must have gotten confused.
March.
- No.
- Of course.
Thanks.
Pizza delivery.
Hey man, what's up?
I'm a little busy.
Listen, I think I found my next wife.
- You've heard of Celeste Birch?
Celeste Birch?
She's worth 10 Peggy von Strauss's.
You ever meet her?
- I haven't had the pleasure.
But, Millicent was supposed to go her charity function today at the Pacific Woodruff.
- Pacific Woodruff, today?
Yeah.
I mean, go get her.
He's the best 500 bucks you ever spent.
500 dollars!
- Yes, that's the cost of the charity ticket.
That seems like the opposite of charity.
Pizza boy...
- I've got to go.
Duty calls.
One extra large sausage.
That'll be $17.15.
I'm afraid I don't have any change.
Well, maybe we'll have to work something between us.
Maybe...
Five hundred dollars.
PUT OUR BIZZ ON YOUR SHIZZ
CASH UP FRONT
Hi, I need to get my car wrapped...
and I need the cash up front.
Bro.
Is he here about the bike?
Are you here about the bike?
- No.
Bro, he's not here for this stupid tiny bike, alright?
He got the thing online, you idiot.
We all make mistakes, okay?
- You're not perfect.
I misunderstood the dimensions.
- It happens.
Anyway, you thought about what kind of edge you wanna wrap your car in?
Whatever...
- This looked a lot bigger on the Internet because it had a picture with a little boy, so it seemed much bigger.
Great.
- How do he not know the difference between a little boy and a grown man?
He looked older, he had a little bit of a mustache.
Look at this.
This was in the picture.
It was a boy with the mustache so I assume...
Whatever pays the most!
Oh, sorry.
Was that rude?
I'm in a rush, that's all.
I'm in a rush.
Man's in a rush.
- Yes, thank you.
Here's the terms.
Wrap stays on the car for ninety days.
Yes.
- You take it off before that, you have to pay us the money back.
Not a problem.
Yeah.
- Leave the warp on the vehicle.
Yes, I will do that.
Can we start as soon as possible?
One thousand dollars.
THE HOTTEST CLUB IN L.A.!
FULL BAR PRIVATE ROOMS AVAILABLE
Keep it close, my son.
- I don't think they will let me.
Good afternoon, sir.
Sir?
Would you like to buy a ticket?
Yes, I would.
500,00 $ per ticket
Pool side.
Perfect.
Sir?
Keep the change.
Am I making you wet?
Am I making you wet?
Am I...
I look like my grandfather.
Carnauba SHOE POLISH
Come to papa.
Is that shit?
Am I making you wet?
- Ahhh!
Sorry.
Am I making you wet?
No, no.
Bone dry.
Thanks for asking, though.
Come on.
Unhand me, sir.
I just wanna speak to Celeste.
Listen, Menudo, you think you're the first money grabbing gigolo to throw himself at my boss?
- Maybe not the first, but I'm hoping to be the last now.
Not while I'm working for her.
She's been through too much emotionally and surgically to put up with this.
- You can't keep me away.
No, I can.
- No.
- Very easily I can.
- No.
I just did.
Yes, you did.
So unless you have a written invitation to our home, you're not going anywhere near her.
Hey, there's your clown suit.
Alright, here's your...
car... toon.
I kept it close just like you asked me to, paisano.
I don't speak Spanish.
Hi bro.
Did you make a move?
- I sort of made a move.
Can you talk?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Millicent's just taking a post coital cool off.
Tell me you closed her.
Tell me you closed her during silent auction.
She didn't even see me.
I'm not sure about this one.
She's impossible to get to.
I have no in.
Or maybe I do.
Sounds like you have an idea.
But I can't tell.
I can't see your face.
Describe your face.
- My face?
- Yeah.
What does it look like?
Thoughtful, very handsome with a hint of mischief.
That's the spirit.
Hey, I'm there for you, whatever you need.
Unless it's money.
Then I can't do it.
Because I'm on an allowance.
Great.
Listen.
Find out whatever you can about Celeste.
Interest, passions, hobbies.
When I'm invited to her home,
I plan on selling the deal.
- I'll ask her on the club.
- Thanks.
And I've got work to do on my end.
Hey.
Hey!
My eyes are up here.
Get in.
Usually we come here on Sundays because mom says it's too much sugar to have more than once a week.
Yeah.
- Wow.
So, Hugo I wanna talk to you about Arden...
Froyo Lo, look out That's right
You've got to let your fantasies out For a bite
Say your name...
- Hugo. - ain't no shame
Froyo Lo, Froyo Lo
Do they make you sing that every time?
I get to sing that every time.
You know if you guess the weight of your yogurt, it's on the house.
Five pounds.
- That's a lot.
I'll give you one more guess.
- Thirty pounds.
- Let's check.
Wow, they're fourteen ounces.
- I was so close.
That will be six fifty.
- Hey, watch me and learn.
I like your bandages.
I am...
I have a lot of rescue cats.
Really?
- Yeah, so I'm no stranger to scratches.
I'm always bleeding.
Thank you...
Cindy.
- Wow.
Cindy.
What an enchanting name.
- Thank you.
You know, if these frozen yogurts were half as sweet as you, we're in for quite a treat.
Wow!
You said fourteen ounces, right?
Gracias, sweet Cindy.
I hope your pussy cats realize what a beautiful scratching post they have in you.
Bye.
I am a beautiful scratching post.
See what I did there?
- You got us FroYo for free?
No, my skills of seduction got us FroYo for free
What if I told you I can teach you how to use your skills of seduction to get what you want.
I forgot to ask for gummy bears.
Screw the gummy bears.
I'm talking about Arden.
Hey, I can get you invited to her birthday party.
Would you like that?
- You can't get me invited to Arden's birthday party.
Papa por favor.
It's impossible.
- Somebody asked for gummy bears?
They're on the house.
- Thank you, sweet Cindy.
I have gummy bears coming out of my ears, literally.
Not literally, but they are in a surprising amount of places around here.
Hey, thank you.
See, I can make things happen for you.
When do we start?
We just did.
Okay, lesson number one.
Eye contact.
Follow me.
Follow me.
Eye contact.
Okay.
- Eye contact is power, Hugo.
Women will lust after you.
Now, it's your turn.
I am Arden, okay?
Say hello to me.
Okay.
- Hello Hugo, I'm Arden.
Hello, Arden.
You broke eye contact.
You broke eye contact.
- You threw a gummy bear at me.
What?
Life will throw gummy bears at you.
Okay.
Do it again.
Stop throwing gummy bears at me.
- Stop breaking eye contact.
Hello, Arden.
Not bad.
Good eye contact.
Not bad at all.
You guys are getting real creative with these gummy bears.
Most people just eat them.
- Okay, lesson number two...
Women love when men take control because women have no idea what they wants.
I'll have the steak and the lady would have the cobb salad.
What if she doesn't want the cobb salad?
Listen, a woman would rather eat something you ordered for her, that she doesn't want rather than something she ordered for herself that she does want.
It doesn't make sense.
Like, at all.
You know what doesn't make sense?
What is that?
You under house arrest or what?
It's a planetary watch.
Some people call it an astronomical watch.
I'm gonna call it I'm gonna die a virgin watch.
Lose it.
Let's go.
Wait, uncle Maximo.
What is a virgin?
It's an airline.
Last lesson of the day...
Your walk.
Your walk tells more about you than your mouth ever can.
My walk?
- Yes, your walk.
Show me your walk.
Do I just walk?
- Just walk, walk.
- Okay.
- Like you walk.
Goddamned!
Horse shit.
Sit and watch.
Loose stride, sleepy eyes, smiling just a little bit because you know what all the ladies are thinking.
- What are the ladies thinking?
Look at that confidence, he must be great in bed.
- I'm great in bed.
What?
- I don't pee or anything anymore.
Come on now, my boy.
Let's walk.
Loose stride, sleepy eyes.
What are you doing?
Pretend there's a girl, and you're walking towards her.
Feel your sexiness.
- I don't feel my sexy.
What is that?
You're walking exactly like the geese.
Let's go.
Don't watch the geese, okay?
A girl pass by, turn around, walk backwards, sexy, sexy.
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
One more time.
Feel it in your crotch.
You want everyone to see down here.
No, I don't.
- Look at me.
You learn from the best.
Okay, one more time.
You feel sexy right now?
- Yeah.
- Great.
Okay, one more time.
Exactly, exactly, exactly.
There you go.
Much better.
Shit.
Okay.
One more time.
Gwen, I wanted to see if you heard back on the Robinson account.
Sara, before you could ask me about this.
- I know, sorry.
I can ask you again tomorrow as soon as you get out of the car.
No, no.
Can't unbreak this egg.
Alright, they loved you.
They thought you were incredible.
But they're gonna go with someone who has...
More experience.
- Sorry, can I finish?
Sorry...
Yes, yes...
Someone who has more experience.
You finished?
- Yeah.
I just don't know what to do.
I can't get a job because I don't have experience and I can't get experience if I don't get a job.
Hey mom.
- I'm here.
5:00.
I remembered.
You have nothing to complain about.
I thought you'd be happy.
I got a job.
Turning my car into a stripper mobile is not a job.
What's a stripper?
- It's only nine days.
No, it's not.
You get this trash off my car today.
Damed.
- Today!
Alright now, those guys, they...
no wait, girls... they dance on the poles naked, right?
Icebergs are literally just floating ice on the water
- Wow, astonishing.
So when it melts, it's like soda, it's like bubbles.
Bubbles, wow.
- Carbon dioxide.
- Where's your watch?
You mean, my die a virgin watch?
What did you say?
- Die a virgin watch.
Kids.
Where do they come up with this stuff?
Uncle Maximo told me to take it off.
He's training me to get girls to like me.
- He's training you?
Yeah.
- What the hell are you doing?
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It's just silly guy talk.
- It's not silly.
I learned how to undress a woman with my eyes.
And how to walk so a woman would know I'm gonna bed.
He said women have no idea what they want and you have to tell them what to do.
No, I never used those words exactly.
Sure you did.
I wrote it all down in this notebook.
What notebook?
- Lesson number...
Mira.
Hugo needs to focus on his school work.
Hey, he has a crush on a girl at school.
I'm trying to help the kid.
You know what it's like to like someone!
Or no?
Mister "I need you to grease my door once a week".
No.
You're taking one think for another.
And James is just a friend!
- Oh, my God.
- You're changing the subject!
No more sugar mama catching training!
Hugo already has a mother.
Understood?
- Yes, mommy.
Understood?
- I don't speak English.
Don't be an idiot.
- Why with a tortilla?
Hey, pull my finger.
Pull it.
False alarm.
- Yeah.
- You're writing a love letter to Arden?
No, just writing to my dad.
Your dad?
You know he'll never get those letters, right?
I know.
It's just a way for me to feel close then.
Don't you ever think about your dad?
No.
- Never?
- Never.
You remember anything about him?
I remember he worked a lot.
And he parked his truck in our house once.
There it is.
Late bloomer.
I remember a lot about my dad.
He was fun.
I think he'd be happy that you're here and that you're helping me.
That's what I was just writing him.
Uncle Maximo, can I show you my science project?
I... in the morning.
Please?
I know that you're really not sleeping.
Uncle Maximo, please?
Okay.
In the morning.
Good morning.
Uncle Maximo.
Remember when you told me that I can show you my science fair project in the morning?
Well, here it is!
My weather balloon.
And here is the Go Pro camera which will be attached to the weather balloon which will go up in space.
It's cool, right?
- Amazing.
Now, will you please get it off my face so I can go back to sleep?
Get up, flojo naso!
Time to go get a job.
Here, I circled the ones that I think will be good for your qualifications like human statue, mattress tester, dog poop picker upper...
It's Sunday.
What place will even be open?
It's Thursday.
Want me to deflate the balloon?
- Let's go Hugo.
The science fair is next Sunday, the school is today.
Hey, no.
Hugo!
Hey, Sara!
Get a job!
WESCOTT CONDOMINIUMS MOVE IN SPECIAL 99 $ OPEN HOUSE TODAY!

I am okay.
He's okay.
It wasn't me, it wasn't me.
I'm alright.
HIGHLAND CAFE
This neighborhood isn't that bad.
I was expecting something out of a horror movie, this is more like something out of an independent movie.
Stop trying to make me feel better.
- Stop trying to make me feel better.
Are you teasing me?
- Teasing me.
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Millicent's just fantasizing about this...
Professor Rojas.
She's got me dressing like him, talking like him, but, I can't do an accent to save my life.
And I can't sleep on an air mattress one more night.
You find any intel or Celeste Birch?
As as matter of fact, I did.
And before I share this,
I don't think she's the right mark for you.
- Come on.
Celeste Birch's passions, avid mountain climber, loves train travel, favorite food, fried chicken.
Great.
This will help.
Thanks.
Alright.
It is time to go.
Anything?
- Terrible.
It's time to go.
- You sound like Dora the explorer.
Now's the go, when it's time to go.
Speedy Gonzales.
Really.
- Alright.
Ola.
Everybody knows how to say that.
- And somehow you screwed it up.
Hola.
I'm positive, that's the car.
- But why would we pay him, if he's not gonna do it.
We paid him all our money.
Hey, hey, hey!
Stop!
Stop!
Well, look who it is.
No, no, no, no.
Where do you think you're going?
Where you going, man?
- Just looking for you guys.
I was just looking for you guys.
We clearly said, don't take the wrap off!
Ever!
Yes, yes, I remember and I thought you did a great job with the wrapping.
But, you see my sister felt differently.
She's your sister.
- Yeah
- Sister.
Women.
- Right, right.
- You don't have to tell Nick and I about that.
Get his nuts.
- I got them.
- Get his nuts.
I got both of them.
- I got them.
You just give us our money.
We'll be fine.
- I spent it.
I spent it.
Well, I sincerely hope you bought something you really wanted... or needed.
God, you're terrible with this.
Nick, just think before you talk.
Can you do that?
- Stop.
I made a mistake.
I'll get you your money, I promise.
Come on guys.
It's just a thousand dollars.
One week.
You got one week.
- Yes.
Let's go.
- I didn't see that coming.
Nice!
Thought we're done, right?
You feel that?
Two hands.
You want four hands?
- That's four hands.
- Yeah, there it is.
That's four hands.
- One week.
One week, home boy.
We went four hands on him, man.
- That was bad ass.
His balls are so big.
You get that money or next time it's eight hands.
Guy doesn't have $1000, get a job, bone head.
Froyo Lo look out That's right
You've got to let your fantasies out For a bite
Say your name...
Jose!
Ain't no shame
Froyo Lo!
Froyo Lo!
Such a good effort.
It's only lacking joy, soul, rhythm and musicality.
And I would cry way less.
Maybe not at all.
But, what if mom finds out we're training again?
Hugo, you can't live your life afraid that something bad will happen.
Or you'll never really live.
- Okay.
So, you gotten her to notice you with the sexy walk.
You intrigued her with strong eye contact.
Now, it's time to talk to her.
I don't think I can.
Relax, Hugo.
It's not like you've never talked to a girl before.
Yes, it is.
I've never talked to a girl before.
- Really?
- Yeah.
They make me really nervous and then my nose start to sweat.
Your nose sweats?
- Yeah.
Your nose?
- Yes.
I can't help you with that.
- Stop mocking me.
Well, come on.
Let's go.
- Well, where are we going?
You're too in your head, kid.
You need to relax.
I don't like the bowling balls here.
Too slippery.
I'm gonna grab a Coke.
You want one?
Cokes have no nutritional value.
Neither do eggplants.
Okay, two Cokes.
Nice form.
Thanks.
- My name is Gabi.
What's yours?
My name is Hugo.
- You're cute, Hugo.
Thank you.
- See you.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
What was that?
- She just called me cute!
She said you were cute?
- Yes.
I guess my mom's not the only one who thinks that.
- Guess not.
What is that crap on your nose?
- It's sweat.
BOWLING
Oh!
Wait!
My shoes.
Okay, I'll be right back.
Don't get kidnapped.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Those please.
Nice work.
- I aim to please.
Okay, remember...
Eye contact and confidence.
Come on, take that off.
You can do it.
Now we are talking.
Look at that, you're a Greek god.
Abs of steel.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Is my nose sweating?
Yeah, little bit.
But, it will wash out when you get in the water.
Okay.
- Okay, come on.
Go get her.
You can do this.
Come on, Stalker.
Do you need a towel?
- No, no, no.
Eye contact, eye contact!
Hi, Arden.
- Hi, Hugo.
You know my name?
- Yeah, I know your name.
You said you know by mean H-I, not H-I-G-H.
Okay.
Let's go ladies, practice is over.
Got to clear the pool area.
Hurry up.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes!
Yes?
- Yes!
Yes?
- She invited me to her party!
She invited me to her party!
We did it!
Exactly what I needed!
Yes!
- Yes!
- Do you see my nephew happy?
- Yes!
Yeah man, you got it!
I heard about the Pasadena project.
- Yeah.
Listen, I have some ideas.
I know it's a long shot, but please take a look.
I'd love a chance.
And I promise that I'd treat like my own child.
Hey mom.
The 101 was wide open.
It's okay.
I just let him drive from around the block.
Don't worry, I'm not one of those people concerned about children.
Hugo, that's wonderful.
A party with other kids.
So can I go?
- Of course, I'll take you.
It'll be great.
Ou, ou, ou, ou!
Sara, you work so hard.
I will take him.
Are you kidding me?
I can't wait to see all his new friends.
Plus, we could see the big mansion of the grandmother, right?
Hey, no offense, but I think Hugo would mush rather go with me.
I mean, look at you.
Look at me.
Look at you.
- Maximo, Maximo...
The words should sound right in your head before they leave the lips in your stupid face.
I don't care who brings me.
I'm just excited to go.
I'm bringing you, honey.
I'm sure uncle Maximo has better things to do on a Saturday.
- Okay.
James.
- Shit!
You scared me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- It's Maximo, Sara's brother.
Yeah, why are you hiding in my garbage?
We need to talk.
It's about Sara.
My God, what happened?
- It's not what happened, it's what hasn't happened.
I don't understand.
What do you mean?
- James,
I'm not saying I get it, but she likes you.
Yeah?
- Yeah.
Hey, I have an idea.
Take her out on Saturday.
Saturday?
- Don't you think you waited long enough?
Door.
Please don't bother yourself.
You just keep doing nothing there while I cook and I open the door, and whatever else you need.
Hi.
- Hi, James.
- Hi
Is it the door again?
I'll go get my tools.
- No, no, no.
Actually it's...
It's...
It's my sink.
I was just kidding about my sink.
Funny.
- So, do you need something?
Or did you just come here to tell the sink joke?
No, no, no.
Actually, I didn't.
I mean, I did, but I...
I came here to ask you if you're free on Saturday and if you wanted to...
If you wanted to come out on a date with me.
What?
I don't know.
Okay.
- Mom, are you okay?
You wanna think about it?
- I don't know.
- She's acting weird.
Maybe?
- Yeah, she'll just think about it and get back to you.
Okay, fine.
But, you know let me know either way.
I told you.
- This guy likes you.
I don't want to talk about it.
- Hey!
- I'm going to my room.
Hey!
- Finish the dinner.
Don't come in.
I'm sleeping.
- Hugo is asleep now.
Why did you act so weird?
What's wrong?
What do you think is wrong?
I'm rusty.
I don't feel ready to go out with anyone.
When was the last time?
5 years ago.
- I mean, when was the last time you... 5 years.
Seriously?
- Thant's enough!
Are you serious?
- Si.
Okay?
Stop laughing.
The bakery has been closed for some time.
Your pastry is going to go stale.
- You're such a jerk.
My God, what are you waiting for?
I don't know.
You like this little gringo?
You like the gringo!
So go, then!
I'm afraid.
You know what I do when I'm afraid?
- Pray?
Drink.
My God, leave my bakery alone.
Don't talk to me about my bakery.
No, but seriously...
I don't know how you've managed to go on, in spite of all your suffering, to keep going, to always move forward...
I can because of Hugo.
- Hugo, how?
When my husband died, there were days when I couldn't even breathe.
But, how do you explain to a small child that he has to take care of himself, because his mom wants to lock herself in her room and cry?
You can't.
But I have a trick for when I'm very sad to lift me up.
Anti-depressants?
- No.
No, look...
I take any sad song, and transform it into a salsa.
- A sad song?
What about The Sad One?
Let's go.
You're stepping on me!
Come on.
Let's go!
The Sad One!
Come on!
I'm falling asleep this isn't a salsa.
Mom.
Mom!
Hugo!
Did we wake you up?
Yes.
You're singing very loudly and bumping into things.
Go to sleep.
Both of you.
Okay.
You see?
You're not rusty, all you need to is relax and have fun, that's all!
You honestly don't mind taking him to the party?
- No.
It would be the greatest honor of my life.
Let's go!
Come on!
- Send him a text.
That's my sister!
That's my sister!
- Enough!
Hugo.
You have no room to judge.
Sorry for the spill.
What the hell happened to me?
Look what the cat dragged in!
- Pay day.
- Oh, great!
Thank you.
Hey, where's the rest of it?
Try feeding 50 cats on that kind of money.
It's meow-trageous!
Time is up
Pay us now or we'll lick your ass
Sorry, KICK your ass ©
Sorry again meant DH, not ©

Old man?
VARTAN Salon
OPEN
SPA 50 $ Works
56,34 $ Not for long.
Give me the works.
Sorry.
Hey.
Behold the glory of God's creation.
Did you dye your hair?
- All of it.
I gave myself a little makeover.
- Maybe next time, they can makeover your brain.
I know perfectly well...
I look very good.
Very good.
I love you, stupid face.
- I love you too, little sister.
What are you telling your dad tonight?
Just that I'm excited to go to Arden's party.
And that I'm glad you're going with me.
I patched it up for you.
So you can sleep better.
Give me a piece of paper, Hugo.
I wanna write a letter too.
- To who?
My dad.
I wanna tell him about his amazing grandson.
Can we do this every night?
- Sure.
It could be our thing.
Hey, pull my finger.
Too late.
- Oh.
- Sorry.
Today's the party!
- Really?
I haven't been thinking about it.
Mommy's taking me to get a hair cut.
Tell him not too short.
You don't have the ears for it.
Why don't you stop talking.
You don't have the mouth for it.
Hugo, come here.
Hey!
I made the wall!
Wow, what happened?
It's been kind of nice having you here.
Right?
- It's been okay.
- Just okay?
- Okay, okay...
Been very nice having you here, uncle Maximo.
- Now we're talking.
Bye.
- See you, uncle Maximo.
Don't sprinkle the toilet.
- I'll do my best.
God!
Now what?
Hey.
Guys!
I was just looking for you.
Coffee?
- Coffee.
Money!
- We're not here for coffee, man!
Money!
- That's what we want!
That's why we are here!
We don't even like coffee!
- Get the money!
Yeah.
Money.
I don't exactly have it.
What do you mean, exactly?
Means he doesn't have it.
Well, then why don't just say you don't have it.
Why even say the word exactly at all?
I'm gonna pay you, I promise.
- Hey, you got a real nice place here.
By nice place, I mean a total dump.
- That's what I'm talking about.
People just say what they mean, it's confusing.
Guys, this is my sister's place, please.
- You know what your problem is?
You don't have any respect for money man!
Money doesn't grow on trees.
- No, it doesn't.
It would be cool if it did.
- Nikki, Nikki!
Please!
I'm just backing up your point.
You could literally rake it up.
What're you doing?
- Hey...
- Totally forgot what I was talking about.
What if we took stuff of yours, sir?
- Okay, okay.
That's a good point.
What if we barged in and started taking stuff?
What if I took this thing?
- No, please...
- I don't even know what it is.
What about this?
What if I took this?
- No, no!
No, no, not that!
That's my nephew's.
That's important.
This is important to you?
- Yeah.
- Then, probably don't want me to have it then?
Hey, no, don't do that please.
No, don't do that please.
Okay, okay...
What do you like?
Sports cars?
Helicopters?
Rolex watches?
I promise I am good for the money and so much more.
I don't need a Rolex, bro.
You know something?
- What?
You seem like a very sincere guy.
- I am.
But, I don't believe anything that you say you're gonna do.
So give us our money, you can have your camera back.
It's that simple.
Hey, please, please, please.
Hey.
Hey!
Have a real nice day.
And by that I mean, do not have a real nice day.
I get it.
Sometimes its funny to not say exactly what you mean.
Not the camera, hey, the camera.
Uncle Maximo, we're home.
Are you ready?
Almost.
Wow!
We look the same.
- Yep.
Maximo.
Minimo.
Wow, mom!
You look pretty.
And you're so guapo.
- That dress is really tight on you.
You mean, I look fat?
- No, no, no.
In a good way, I mean.
Because you can see all the body parts in your body.
I'm gonna take...
- No!
No, no, no.
Let's make some magic happen.
- Yeah!
Arden, here we come.
Valet Parking Please Pull Forward
Wow!
Look at this place!
Yep.
This will do just fine.
There she is.
Yep.
There she is.
Hey, Hugo, just remember everything I taught you, okay?
Thank you, uncle Maximo.
Go get her.
Go get her, Latino lover.
Beautiful as your uncle.
Hello.
Have we met?
- Only in my dreams.
Oh, Hugo!
Did you hurt your leg?
- No baby, I was just walking.
My nephew is quiet fond of your grand daughter.
Really?
Do I have something on my face?
Yes.
You have my full attention.
Okay.
- It's enchanting to meet you.
Maximo.
Hey baby, what do you say we like, leave this place.
What do you mean?
I have a birthday party.
Drink?
- Allow me, please.
Excuse me...
- The lady and I will have your finest champagne.
She'll have a Sprite and I'll have a Coke.
Something as refreshing and exciting as she is.
Of course.
- Well...
Actually, I'll just have some water.
Thanks.
Women.
They never know what they want.
Am I right?
She'll have a Sprite, like I said.
- But, of course.
I have to go.
Arden, wait.
- Shall we grab a bite?
Wait, wait.
Sorry I was acting so weird.
Can we start over?
- Is that a planetary watch?
Yeah.
Wanna check out the rest of my party?
- Sure.
- Come on.
Cheers.
Beautiful party.
- Isn't it?
Yeah.
- Such a beautiful day.
Mountains, trains, chickens.
That's quiet a mountain of melon balls.
You know, climbing is one of my greatest passions.
In fact, I'm training for Everest.
Of course, it's not the mountain that we conquer, but ourselves.
- Sir Edmund Hilary.
Yes.
You climb?
Once upon a time.
But, not anymore.
- Nonsense.
Beautiful strong woman like yourself surely has many climbs left in her.
Not this woman, I'm afraid.
- Give me one good reason.
Frost bite.
South face of Everest.
Just thinking about it gives me day tremors.
I hate climbing.
You convince me.
I hate it too.
What I really love, train travel.
So classic.
Won't you agree?
Steam locomotive, 1950.
- You have no arms?
I was playing on the tracks and got stuck.
I'm afraid I haven't much fondness for trains.
Now if you'll excuse me for a moment, please.
Chicken!
Chicken?
- Yes, Chicken!
I'm sure you love fried chicken.
Having my limbs torn from my body, helped me to realize just how barbaric the treatment of chickens is in our country.
I'm vegetarian.
- Which is why I founded
The Birch Poultry Rehabilitation Center.
Now, if you'll forgive me a moment, please.
Hey, hey, hey!
Chicken.
Rick?
Rick.
Hey!
What are you doing here?
- I was just...
Waiting for me to make a fool of myself in front of Celeste?
Yes.
- All that information that you gave me was wrong.
It was.
- How could you do that to me?
Because, I can't take another second of Millicent.
Last night, she made me dress up as her father.
What is that about?
- I think it's pretty clear.
I guess you're right.
- So, leave her.
Leave her?
And end up like you with nothing?
Look, it's survival of the fittest.
Come on, bro, you know the game.
No hard feelings.
Hey, Rick...
Hey, Rick... where you going?
Rick...
I believe they're playing our song.
May I?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
- I'm Rick Parsons.
Hi.
- May I cut in?
No, I don't think that's a good idea.
- I saw her first.
Well, I was aware of her first.
- I don't care.
- Let it go!
You can't...
How do I...
Sorry.
Sorry.
- My liege...
- Get out!
- Yes.
You pulled her arm?
- No, you pulled her arm.
You were my best friend.
Get off me!
They're fighting.
Hey, guys, it's a kid's birthday party...
- You betrayed me.
It was just business.
It wasn't personal.
You knew how much I needed this.
- You knew how desperate I was.
Celeste was my way out.
You think I'll spend the rest of my life living with my sister and nephew in their crappy little apartment?
I thought you said you liked living with us.
Hugo, no...
No, I mean... yes.
I do.
I do very much.
So you were using me to get Arden's grand mother.
Right?
No, no, no, I was helping you.
- Please don't lie.
- I swear...
Okay... a little bit.
I mean, I sort of used you.
But, it wasn't really about you.
It was more about me and in order to help me I wanted to help you.
My God, I...
You know, that sounds worse than it is.
I thought you were helping me because you liked me.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
- I don't want you sleeping in my bed anymore.
I don't want you to stay in my house anymore.
Oh, my God.
Overdressed?
- Absolutely not.
No.
I think everybody at the game is underdressed.
I think you really classed the whole place up.
They should've paid you to come to the game.
I'm sorry.
It's my son.
Hi, sweetie.
What?
Sorry, I forgot the code.
Is Hugo here?
Thanks to god, no thanks to you.
- Can I speak with him?
No.
- Please?
Just let me explain.
How do you explain to a child who opened his heart to you that you were only using him to seduce the grandmother of the girl he likes?
I can't believe that I was stupid enough to let you humiliate him like that.
- I'm sorry, okay?
Where is Hugo's camera?
I promise I'll get it back to you.
So, you were the one who stole it.
- No, I didn't steal it.
No, Sara, hey!
Don't kick me out, look...
We're family!
- No.
You're not family.
You're nothing more than a lazy 46 year old freeloader who doesn't think of anyone but himself.
You didn't just steal his camera.
You stole his hopes.
You stole his dreams.
But it ends now.
You will never use me or Hugo again, understood?
I'm 39.
- What?
You said I'm 46, but I'm 39.
No, you're not.
- Of course, I am.
- No, you're not.
- I am.
But I'm 42.
- So what?
- You're my older brother!
I don't know what to tell you.
You know what?
I hope you grow up one day.
But it won't be in my house.
Okay, I'm 40.
Okay, 41.
We're twins!
Okay?
You don't have to sing, please.
- Say your name.
Say your name.
Maximo.
Cindy's home.
- Thank for letting me stay.
Watch your back.
We got you some nice hot tea.
I think I got all the hairs out.
And you can stay here as long as you like.
I'm sure you'll figure out a way to pay me back.
I get it.
Eye contact.
Don't lose eye contact.
What are you doing?
- I'm about to pay you back.
- What?
God!
No, no, stop, stop.
Please stop.
Isn't this what you want?
- No.
God, no.
Button up, just put that away.
You're not attracted to me?
- No.
- Really?
Not at all.
No, I'm attracted to like really good looking guys.
Guys with like great faces, great bodies, who are muscular, handsome and younger, much younger than you.
And tall, a lot taller.
But, that's just me.
Then, why did you give me the job?
I think I'm just drawn to helping less fortunate, damaged, sad, sad, sad, sad creatures.
Why do you think I have so many cats?
They need me, but I need them.
But, they hurt you over and over again.
This guy, right?
I know.
I mean, just because they hurt me doesn't mean they don't love me.
I take care of them and I don't expect anything in return.
These cats are my family.
I had a chance to be part of a family.
I ruined it.
I don't think you ruined it.
Because, it's never too late to make it right.
You've cat to do what you cat to do.
I've never seen that one before.
Well, you'd be happy to know that I lost everything.
Millicent found out about Celeste's party, she kicked me out.
You got a sister you can stay with?
- No.
I never should have gone behind your back like that.
Wish there was something I could do to make it up to you.
There is something.
That's your idea face.
- Yep.
This is it.
So, when's the kid's science fair again?
- It's in three hours.
You get in there and get the camera.
I'll keep them distracted over here.
Police.
Police from the neighborhood.
Can I help you, officer?
Here for the tiny motorcycle?
He's not here for your stupid bike.
You here for the bike?
No sir, I'm not here for the vehicle.
There's a neighborhood gas leak, evacuate the premises.
Gas leak?
I didn't even know we had gas.
Situation is clear, Larry.
Yes, sir, Mr. Neighborhood Police Officer.
I'm gonna fix the...
I'm closing the door because the gas is... leaking here.
- I didn't smell any gas.
- I don't smell anything.
You wouldn't.
That's what makes the danger so dangerous.
Excuse me, officer?
-What kind of handcuffs are those?
Police handcuffs.
- Are they furry?
There had been some local perps, who have been having an allergic reaction to the metal.
Now, we coat it in synthetic material, health is on the uprise, crime is on the down rise.
But, I wouldn't worry your pretty head over that, ma'am.
I don't think we need it in this investigation.
- Ma'am?
- Ma'am?
Is this an investigation?
I thought this was a gas leak?
Investigation of a gas leak.
And shut up!
I'm a police officer, I want this crime scene secured.
It's not a crime scene...
- Shut up!
Got you!
Take it easy, alright.
You said investigation
- No!
You take it easy.
Or I'll shoot you!
- You're not shooting anybody.
I'll shoot you in the Lorax!
That's not a thing, officer.
- It's a children's book.
You sussing me boy?
You sussing me?
I am a police officer of the law.
I don't think you are.
Officer George Clooney from the 69th precinct.
Don't make me use this.
- I won't.
Let it go.
- We've been compromised!
Ride like the wind.
Hey, sloucher jerk!
I'm okay, I'm okay.
You have the right to remain silent.
Not in the face.
Hugo.
Hugo.
Hey, Hugo.
Hugo.
Hugo.
Hey!
Here's Hugo's camera.
If we go now, we can still make the science fair!
The fair was yesterday.
Hugo missed it.
No!
He told me Sunday at 1!
Today is Monday.
You're too late.
No, it's never too late!
- This time it is.
24 hours late to be exact.
Thanks for the camera.
All I wanted to do was impress her.
Instead, I was humiliated.
- I am sorry, honey.
You want me to walk you in?
- No, I don't.
You can't live your life afraid something bad will happen, because then, you've really never lived.
Where did you hear that?
- Uncle Maximo.
Hi, Arden.
- Hugo.
I'm so glad to see you.
You are?
- Yeah.
- I thought you were mad at me.
No.
My grandma and I know you did nothing wrong.
Good.
I was worried that your grandma would be up in arms about us being friends.
Get it?
Up in arms.
Up in arms.
Get it?
Hugo, that's not funny.
That's just offensive.
I didn't mean it like that.
- I'm joking.
I'm funny too, you know.
- Wow, you are funny!
I got your letter.
- My letter?
No one's ever written me an actual on real paper before.
Really?
- And my answer is yes.
Well, that's great!
To what question again, I'm sorry...
I'd love to launch the weather balloon with you, silly.
Yeah, right, my weather balloon.
I forgot about that.
How could I forget about that.
Can I see that for a sec.
I just want to see if I got all my punctuations right.
Is that okay.
- As long as you give it back.
- Thank you.
"Dearest Arden,
I am sorry if I caused you any pain.
It was the last thing I wanted to do.
You are more important to me than you know.
Two, one...
Yes go!
I always wished we could be friends.
- There it goes.
But, you don't get what you wish for, you get what you work for.
Sometimes love can be scary.
Alright, moment of truth, here we go.
I think...
Sometimes love can be surprising.
Is this happening?
- I think so.
Sometimes we hurt the ones we love.
No!
- What the hell is that?
- I didn't know man.
But, it's never too late to make it right.
Our time on earth is short.
But, love is forever.
You make me want to be a better fifth grader.
Would you please join me in launching my weather balloon?
Yours, Hugo."
Oh, Sara.
- You didn't get the house in Pasadena, they went with someone...
- Let me guess, more experienced.
Yeah.
- Well, you know what I think?
Good...
- Can I finish?
I think that I deserve a shot at my own house.
And if I'm not given my due,
I not afraid to go somewhere else where I am appreciated.
Okay.
Have you finished?
- No, I am not.
A lesser woman would have given up already, ten years of drawing plans.
But, I am strong, I am determined.
And I know that I will find my dream job someday.
Yes, you will.
- Yes, I will.
- And that day is today.
What?
Okay, Hugo.
What do you think?
Glasses on or glasses off?
You look pretty either way, mommy.
Baby, it's a big day today.
Mommy's a little nervous.
Well, at least your nose isn't sweating.
- Well, it's a good thing.
Wow!
A helicopter!
Oh my Goodness!
Okay...
You wait here and I will be... right back.
Mommy...
- Yeah?
I am proud of you.
Mommy's gonna build a house.
- Yes!
Mrs. Dupont.
It is so nice to meet you.
Thank you.
Thank you for this opportunity
I promise that you wont regret it.
I certainly hope not.
You come very highly recommended.
By who?
Maximo?
- Wow!
You didn't think I'd be selling frozen yogurt all my life, did you?
I usually don't put much stock in what my man candy says, but he showed me your designs and I loved them.
You did?
Thank you.
- Uncle Maximo.
Uncle Maximo.
- Hey!
Hugo!
- That's my son.
- I missed you so much.
Missed you too.
Nice blazer, Uncle Maximo.
Professor Rojas, when she's around.
Such a great view.
I'm so glad I am rich.
- Yeah, me too.
Must be nice.
- Hey, don't go too far.
Or I'll put you in detention.
Have I been a bad girl?
Well, I guess Papa was wrong.
Sometimes you do get what you wish for.
- Are you kidding?
This woman's a lot of work.
- Ay dios mio.
Hugo, wanna go for a ride?
I don't know if momma will let me.
- You know what?
I think professor Rojas has earned another chance.
Yes!
- That's my older sister.
Stop it!
I am your baby sister!
Yeah, but you look older.
Honestly.
What can I tell you?
It's true.
- Come here, come here.
Come here.
Thank you.
Thank you!
You helped me make my dream come true.
You earned it.
You're so talented.
I love you.
I love you.
Okay, Hugo, let's go.
Mommy's got work to do.
Don't call him "Jugo." His name is Hugo!
Same thing.
- He's not a juice.
Up you go.
Come on, co pilot.
I want the house to be beautiful.
- Me too.
But eerie.
Sleek.
Seaside.
Fever dream.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Let's fly.
Bye.
I didn't know you could fly a helicopter.
Of course.
All rich people fly helicopters.
Can I drive?
- I don't see why not.
Yes!
No!
No!
I thought we were in trouble there.
- You got it.
Hello?
- Who's that?
It's your mommy.
She wants us to come back now.
Come on.
Show me your sexy.
Camera 1...
Squeeze your body.
You look like Chaplin.
You know who Chaplin is?
- No.
Unhand me, sir.
Do you want me to see if the manager's here.
She does all hiring.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Hello.
I am the manager.
Hey, guys.
Latin lover.
- Latin lover.

My Papa was the hardest working person I ever met, spending almost every day of the year on the road.
But, whenever he had time off, he would race home to see us...
Maximo!
Sara!
Your father is here.
Even if he had to drive all night.
Move!
I'm okay...
My Papa always said, "You get what you work for,
"not what you wish for."
So much for hard work.
This is a nightmare.
I know it's horrible living here, but we're still a family.
I don't need a family.
What I need is somewhere to live that isn't an old wreck.
When I'm older, I'm going to be an architect.
So I can build a big house for us.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to sleep so I can be sleeping.
What are you going to do for work?
I'm going to be rich so I don't have to work.
But Papa always said that you get what you work for, not what you wish for.
And look what happened to him!
It's time to sleep, children.
We're already asleep.
Look...
This is who I'm going to be.
He didn't get that rich without having a job.
I don't want his job.
I want hers.
Maximo.
Hi Maximo.
You'll like that, Maximo.
-Thank you.
-Thank you!
Talk to me, Rafa.
What's on the menu?
Take a look at lounge chair number three.
There's a hot one over there, super rich!
I see her, I see her.
She looks delicious.
Who is she?
Peggy von Strauss.
Fifty-five, divorced...
-But she's loaded.
-Yeah?
Her family owns the biggest supermarket chain in the United States.
She's perfect.
I think I'm making you wet.
You know, no I can't.
I have my helicopter lesson this weekend.
Spot!
Spill.
Shadow!
Finished.
Maximo!
There you are, my raindrop.
I was just, just on my way to wake you
Do you know what day today is?
-Tuesday.
-No!
It's Saturday.
-Close enough.
-Happy anniversary!
Yeah.
-Just what I needed.
-Really?
So different.
This one says 9:20, this one doesn't.
I love it.
Thank you, thank you.
I love it.
-I got you something too.
-Really?
Where is it?
We have... to go... pick it up.
-How exciting!
-I know!
-I'll be right back.
-Right.
Just one second.
I'm waiting for you.
I'm ready for you.
I'll be but a second, sweetie.
One second.
I'm here.
Happy anniversary!
Darling, what a sweet thought.
Get in.
Get in!
I would, but with my knees I'm afraid it's too close to the ground for me.
Okay, forget it.
We won't get it then.
I don't want my knees to ruin our special day.
No, no, it's okay, it's okay.
Let's get in.
It could be your car too.
Yeah, I suppose that could work.
-We'll take this one.
-It's a fine choice.
You know the McLarens are like snowflakes and no two of them are the same.
Is that true?
Actually it doesn't, but...
I still think it's a lovely image with the snowflake.
Don't you think?
Are you the charmer?
Call it the romantic in me.
The guys in the floor calls me the poet, these boneheads.
They like to make fun.
And what form of payment will you be using today, sir?
Her.
Very good.
I'll see if that's an option in our system.
Are you se...
Another new car!
-Yep.
-How do you do, Mr. Maxwell?
Once you lower your expectations, Timmy, the sky is the limit.
That's the most beautiful thing I've heard in my entire life.
Four!
You don't mind if Max and I play a few holes, do you?
Not at all.
As long as you play a few holes with me later.
You are a naughty girl.
Here we are, a steak and a salad.
Aha, mama likes you slim and trim.
You want me to feed you some meat.
I want it so bad.
This first bite is all fat.
-Hey buddy.
-Oye, brother.
Millicent.
You look radiant as always.
Have I ever told you that you remind me of Senor Rojas?
He was my Spanish professor in college, with whom I had a passionate affair...
Yes, I think you mentioned it once or twice...
Or every time I see you.
-Let's hit the links.
-Yes!
Wanna grab a drink tonight?
Nope, sorry.
No offense, got me booked up.
Got a bleaching appointment.
You should try it some time.
I brush my teeth.
I'm not talking about the teeth.
-Ouch!
-Gotta keep it white and tight.
Guys like you and me, we hide in the tall grass, wait for the most beautiful gazelle to come up from the back of the pack, drops her head to get that last drink of water and then we strike.
Thrill of the hunt.
Wait.
Aren't the sickly ones usually at the back of the pack?
What do you know about animals?
What are you, Steve Irwin?
Rest in peace.
I watch a lot of animal shows.
-You're missing my point.
-You know what, Rick,
I don't have to worry about hunting old gazelles anymore because in my marriage,
I call the shots.
Would have been a lot cooler if I sank that.
I loved that you got yourself a matching McLaren.
We only played nine holes because I wanted to get back home to you.
Maximo, you're home early.
I missed you.
What's wrong?
Did you get winded trying to scrap cook again?
It was a nice refreshing beverage after the workout we did...
Hey!
You're back!
Hey, how you liking the car?
Handles like a beauty, doesn't she?
You cheated on me with a car salesman?
No, a little.
Remy.
Here you go.
The number on the bottom doesn't work anymore but the top one is good.
Call any time, okay?
You want a drink?
The bar here's incredible.
Well, I don't have to tell you.
I'm sorry, Maximo.
It's over.
You sneeze, you lose, ese.
Okay.
But, half of everything is mine.
Actually, no.
You signed a prenuptial agreement.
No, no, no.
I signed a prenup.
No.
Shit!
I can't believe this.
After I gave her my best years, and after I gave her my youth, after I gave her the best of me.
Of course, now that my boobs have sagged, she finds someone younger than me.
Shit!
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving!
Look, once I cross this threshold, I'm never coming back!
I won't come back!
I won't come back!
It's finished!
It's finished forever!
But she's going to miss me.
She'll miss my seeds.
Come harvest time, she'll miss my seeds.
I'm feeling like playing some cops and robbers tonight.
Spice things up
I think I might need to get frisked.
That polyester looks a little itchy.
It will suit you just fine.
No, no, no, you're gonna put it on, you're gonna love it.
Whatever you want, mommy gets.
That's right.
Maximo.
Rick.
-I'm sorry...
-My god!
I'm sorry, you scared me.
-Sorry, you okay?
-Yeah.
What's going on?
Peggy dumped me.
What the hell am I gonna do?
I have no money, no home, no helicopters.
My god!
Stop hitting me!
I'm sorry.
I'm on these horse testosterone pills, that Millicent makes me take and it gets me a little agitated.
Guys like you and me, we're survivors.
We do whatever it takes to come out on top.
-Yeah, yeah.
-Look at me.
-We're survivors.
That's what we do.
-Yes.
All you need to do is find yourself a new wife.
-Yes.
New and improved.
-And improved!
Someone who's richer and older than Peggy.
Absolutely, yeah.
There's plenty of fish in the sea.
All I need is a place to stay while I am fishing.
Well, I know you haven't been in touch for a while but you could always try stay at your sister's.
I'm not sure.
I mean, what about here?
-No.
-Why?
Millicent insisted every room be reserved at all times in case she wants to have a session.
There is not a room that we don't...
There is one place.
Great!
I'm so...
It's the pills, it's the pills!
I don't know how these horses do it.
This is Millicent's grand daughter's play house.
Millicent's grand daughter has excellent taste.
Millicent's grand daughter has expensive taste.
This cost a fortune.
Horrible little girl.
One time she made me salt a slug, just so she could remember how to laugh.
Anyway, sleep tight.
Thank you.
So true.
So... how do you guys know each other?
My god!
Thanks for letting me stay at your house.
I am sorry.
I thought it was a real toilet.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Leave it alone!
That's mine!
Leave me alone!
Hello?
Surprise!
It's your brother!
No sir, you've got the wrong apartment.
Sara.
-Yes?
-Sara?
Who's this?
It's me, your brother.
-Maximo?
-Yeah.
The one and only.
Open the door, will you?
Sara?
Sara?
Is this for real?
You show up today, as if it were nothing?
After you didn't even bother coming to see our dying mother,
When that avocado tree fell on her.
You didn't come to see my child when he was born.
What made you think
I'd have any desire to see you?
You can't just show up like this.
I'm not opening the door for you!
I'm not...
Hey, Sara!
Sarita!
I can't believe this.
Me neither!
-You're happy to see me, right?
-No.
What are you doing here?
Nothing!
I wanted to see you and my niece.
Nephew!
That!
Niece, no?
Nephew?
Niece?
What did I say?
Nephew?
Nephew.
That's it.
Nephew.
Tell me what you want, and then beat it!
Peggy kicked me out.
She took everything.
Everything!
But, wasn't everything hers to begin with?
Ok, fine.
She kept everything.
She even kept the car I picked out for her to buy for me, to give her, for our anniversary.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know you're angry with me, but...
Can I stay with you?
Here?
Here in my house?
I have nowhere else to stay.
Really?
You have honestly lost your mind!
You've lost your head.
You're my sister!
Oh, I'm your sister now, right?
You've always been my sister!
Oh, come on, Maximo!
I can't believe what comes out of your mouth!
Don't be like this.
One day, and no more?
-Come on.
-Really?
Grab your things!
What, do you think that I'll carry them?
This isn't a hotel!
-Hey, your apartment is nice.
-Thanks.
Like, outside it seemed a little...
But it's cool.
My goodness!
It's Hector!
Hugo!
Right.
What did I say?
Hugo, remember I told you I had an ugly crazy brother who was the champion of farting?
-Yes.
-That's it.
-Hey how are you?
-Meet Maximo.
Hi.
Look at you!
You must be six years old by now.
I just turned...
Ten.
Ten?
I know.
I was kidding.
Everyone's so serious around here.
It's like, who died?
My dad.
I was sorry to hear about that.
Pictures!
Hey, where's my picture?
I don't know.
Those are family photos.
-I'm family.
-Uncle Maximo...
We're having chicken rice.
Want some?
Chicken?
No.
Maybe I'll have a lobster roll.
Or maybe you don't eat?
Why don't you say grace before we start eating?
I'm really sorry.
Next time.
-This time...
-Okay, okay.
Dear Lord, even though we are eating just chicken and rice, at least we're all here together.
Well, not all of us because...
Hector's dad is dead.
Hugo!
His name is Hugo.
Yeah.
Because Hugo is dead.
-Hugo is not dead.
His fa...
-Amen.
Wait, wait, wait...
Lord, before you go, please help me find a new wife with a big heart, but not necessarily a strong heart, with a high net worth, and nice big house, who doesn't ask me to poke her that often.
Amen.
-Amen.
-Amen.
-Hey, you got a girl friend?
-No.
Really?
What's wrong with you?
He's ten, Maximo.
Late bloomer?
Hugo, I have an idea.
Why don't you tell uncle Max about your science fair project?
And this way, it will be you talking and not this dummy over here.
Okay.
Sure.
I'm sending a weather balloon with a Go Pro camera to the edge of the stratosphere.
Stratosphere, wow!
I've modified the Go Pro camera to send live video stream back to earth via FM transmitter.
Wow, transmitter, wow!
The balloon's gonna go very high up.
And then we're gonna see like a little part of the earth.
-Earth.
Wow!
-Yeah!
Now I understand why he doesn't have a girlfriend.
Stop it!
Wanna know what I'm doing, uncle Maximo?
No.
-Oops!
-You know,
I prefer my own room.
And I prefer for you to be normal.
But, we get what we get.
I'm serious.
What about upstairs?
Those are other people's apartments.
-Really?
-Really.
But, hey, why don't you go knock on their doors.
Maybe they'll take you in.
I love you!
-I love you mom.
-Sweet dreams!
What?
I guess I'll just tuck myself in.
How do you do this?
My god.
Uncle Maximo...
How long were you married?
Twenty five years.
Good night.
And you didn't have to work that whole time?
Nope.
Nightie night.
What did you do for money?
I didn't need money.
She paid for everything.
You go to sleep.
So now you have to find a new wife to pay for stuff?
Yep.
That's the plan.
Sweet dreams.
How are you going to do that?
By getting a good nights sleep.
Why haven't you ever visited us?
-I've been busy.
-Doing what?
-You just said you didn't work.
-Sara!
Sara Help!
Sara!
Emergency, Sara!
-Emergency, Sara!
-What?
I'm trying to sleep and the kid won't stop talking!
-You were talking too!
-To tell you to stop talking!
-Still talking!
-Did I tell you to stop talking?
-No, no!
-Enough!
You almost gave me a heart attack.
Mira!
I thought we were being robbed.
I was being robbed of my beauty sleep.
Go to sleep.
Both of you!
Yes, mommy.
And no more talking about not talking.
And no more talking about poking either.
Tattletale.
Poke you!
Did you put your homework in your back pack?
-Yes.
-Good.
-Morning.
-Morning...
-Morning.
-Morning.
We have rules here.
Any dish that you use, you have to wash.
-I didn't know we can do that.
-We can't.
So don't even think about it.
-James!
-Hi.
Hi!
Sorry to interrupt you, you have a guest...
I don't have a guest.
That.
That's my brother, Maximo.
Nice to meet you.
Pleasure is all mine.
You know what.
My door knob is sticking again.
Can you believe it.
-Again?
-I know.
It's crazy, right?
-Can I borrow your tools or?
-No, don't worry about it.
-I'll take care of it.
-Are you sure?
Yeah.
Easy.
Easy peasy.
I'd love to.
Got a sticky knob...
Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you there like in five minutes?
Okay.
You're the best.
Thank you.
It's nothing.
Are you a carpenter or what?
When you're both the man and the woman of the house, you have to be a handyman and do whatever is necessary.
Are you two...
What you doing?
What are you implying?
No!
I just help out when something gets jammed in his house, or there's a problem in his house.
It's an old building.
Go get dressed.
Look at you.
We have to leave in five minutes.
Hugo, get your stuff.
I'll meet you in the car.
Sticky knob.
Look, that sad man has to spin the sign like a fool for all to see.
At least he has a job.
It's more than I can say about another man in this car.
Work's for suckers.
Mom, uncle Maximo said the S word.
-That's not the S word.
-What is?
-Can I tell him?
-No!
Shit.
So, you're big time architect now.
Junior architect.
But, I still haven't got my own house to design.
So I am not going to be late for work because you take two hours to blow dry your hair.
I am trusting you with my car...
I am trusting you with my car and I am trusting you with my son.
You need to go out there and find yourself a job.
Pick me up at 5:00, okay?
Okay, I'll try to remember.
You will remember, because I have no other way to get back home.
I said I'll try.
Jeez.
5:00!
Is she always like this?
No, I just think she doesn't like you.
Wow!
I smell money.
How do you go here?
I'm in academic scholarship, that covers some of my tuition.
My mom has to pay the rest.
You can drop me off here.
Drop you off?
Are you kidding?
I'll walk you in.
Where do the rich single mom's park?
-Wait, wait, wait.
-What?
-Friend of yours?
-Arden?
No.
I wish.
She doesn't even know I exist.
Why do you say that?
Because, she's a girl and she's cute and I am me.
You make a great point, you are, you.
How old is she?
She's turning 10 next week.
I heard she's having a big birthday party.
No, no, no.
Not the kid.
Her.
That's Arden's grandmother.
She's perfect.
Name?
-I think it's Celeste.
-Celeste what?
-Celeste Birch.
-Is there a grandpa Birch?
He died last year.
Great!
Great.
That's great news.
He's dead!
I'm so very sad.
Life's a gift.
Okay kid.
Have a great day.
But I thought you wanted to walk me in.
What are you, a baby?
You can walk yourself in.
Andale vamos.
I've got work to do.
Hey!
-May I help you?
-It's me, Maximo.
I'm an old friend of Celeste's.
I feel like we've met before, right?
-I don't think so.
-I think so.
-You're Ryan, right?
-Quincy.
I knew it started with a Q or a B or a S.
Quincy.
That's a great name, Quincy.
I was named after my grandfather's dog.
The legacy lives on.
-Don't touch me.
-Yeah.
And where did you say you met Celeste?
At the sports event.
-The polo match.
-Yes, exactly.
-The one back in April.
-Yeah, that's the one.
She never went to a polo match back in April.
-May?
-No.
-June?
-No.
-July?
-No.
-August?
-No.
-September?
-No.
-October?
November?
-No.
-December?
-No.
-January, February?
-No, no.
-March.
-No.
-April.
-You already said April.
And you said?
No.
I am so sorry.
I must have gotten confused.
-March.
-No.
Of course.
Thanks.
Pizza delivery.
Hey man, what's up?
I'm a little busy.
I think I found my next wife.
You've heard of Celeste Birch?
Celeste Birch?
She's worth 10 Peggy von Strauss's.
-You ever meet her?
-I haven't had the pleasure.
But, Millicent was supposed to go her charity function today at the Pacific Woodruff.
Pacific Woodruff, today?
Yeah.
I mean, go get her.
Be the best 500 bucks you ever spent.
500 dollars!
Yes, that's the cost of the charity ticket.
That seems like the opposite of charity.
-Pizza boy...
-I've got to go.
Duty calls.
One extra large sausage.
That'll be $17.15.
I'm afraid I don't have any change.
Well, maybe we'll have to work something between us.
Maybe...
Five hundred dollars.
Hi, I need to get my car wrapped... and I need the cash upfront.
Bro.
Is he here about the bike?
-Are you here about the bike?
-No.
Bro, he's not here for this stupid tiny bike, alright?
He got the thing online, you idiot.
We all make mistakes, okay?
You're not perfect.
-I misunderstood the dimensions.
-It happens.
Anyway, you thought about what kind of edge you wanna wrap your car in?
Whatever...
This looked a lot bigger on the Internet because it had a picture with a little boy, so it seemed much bigger.
Great.
How do he not know the difference between a little boy and a grown man?
He looked older, he had a little bit of a mustache.
Look at this.
This was in the picture.
It was a boy with the mustache so I assume...
Whatever pays the most!
Sorry.
Was that rude?
I'm in a rush, that's all.
I'm in a rush.
-Man's in a rush.
-Yes, thank you.
Here's the terms.
Wrap stays on the car for ninety days.
Yes.
You take it off before that, you have to pay us the money back.
Not a problem.
Yeah.
Leave the warp on the vehicle.
Yes, I will do that.
Can we start as soon as possible?
One thousand dollars.
Keep it close, my son.
I don't think they will let me.
Good afternoon, sir.
Sir?
Would you like to buy a ticket?
Yes, I would.
Pool side.
Perfect.
Sir?
Keep the change.
Am I making you wet?
Am I making you wet?
Am I...
I look like my grandfather.
Come to papa.
Is that shit?
Am I making you wet?
Sorry.
Am I making you wet?
No, no.
Bone dry.
Thanks for asking, though.
Come on.
Unhand me, sir.
I just wanna speak to Celeste.
Listen, Menudo, you think you're the first money grabbing gigolo to throw himself at my boss?
Maybe not the first, but I'm hoping to be the last now.
Not while I'm working for her.
She's been through too much emotionally and surgically to put up with this.
You can't keep me away.
-No, I can.
-No.
-Very easily I can.
-No.
I just did.
Yes, you did.
So unless you have a written invitation to our home, you're not going anywhere near her.
Hey, there's your clown suit.
Alright, here's your...
car... toon.
I kept it close just like you asked me to, paisano.
I don't speak Spanish.
Hi bro.
Did you make a move?
I sort of made a move.
Can you talk?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Millicent's just taking a post coital cool off.
Tell me you closed her.
Tell me you closed her during silent auction.
She didn't even see me.
I'm not sure about this one.
She's impossible to get to.
I have no in.
Or maybe I do.
Sounds like you have an idea.
But I can't tell.
I can't see your face.
-Describe your face.
-My face?
Yeah.
What does it look like?
Thoughtful, very handsome with a hint of mischief.
That's the spirit.
Hey, I'm there for you, whatever you need.
Unless it's money.
Then I can't do it.
Because I'm on an allowance.
Great.
Listen.
Find out whatever you can about Celeste.
Interest, passions, hobbies.
When I'm invited to her home,
I plan on selling the deal.
-I'll ask her on the club.
-Thanks.
And I've got work to do on my end.
Hey.
Hey!
My eyes are up here.
Get in.
Usually we come here on Sundays because mom says it's too much sugar to have more than once a week.
-Yeah.
-Wow.
So, Hugo I wanna talk to you about Arden...
Froyo Lo, look out That's right
You've got to let your fantasies out For a bite
-Say your name
-Hugo.
Ain't no shame
Froyo Lo Froyo Lo
Do they make you sing that every time?
I get to sing that every time.
You know if you guess the weight of your yogurt, it's on the house.
Five pounds.
That's a lot.
I'll give you one more guess.
-Thirty pounds.
-Let's check.
Wow, they're fourteen ounces.
I was so close.
That will be six fifty.
Hey, watch me and learn.
I like your bandages.
I am...
I have a lot of rescue cats.
-Really?
-Yeah, so I'm no stranger to scratches.
I'm always bleeding.
Thank you...
-Cindy.
-Wow.
Cindy.
What an enchanting name.
Thank you.
You know, if these frozen yogurts were half as sweet as you, we're in for quite a treat.
Wow!
You said fourteen ounces, right?
Gracias, sweet Cindy.
I hope your pussy cats realize what a beautiful scratching post they have in you.
Bye.
I am a beautiful scratching post.
See what I did there?
You got us FroYo for free?
No, my skills of seduction got us FroYo for free
What if I told you I can teach you how to use your skills of seduction to get what you want.
I forgot to ask for gummy bears.
Screw the gummy bears.
I'm talking about Arden.
Hey, I can get you invited to her birthday party.
Would you like that?
You can't get me invited to Arden's birthday party.
Papa por favor.
-It's impossible.
-Somebody asked for gummy bears?
They're on the house.
Thank you, sweet Cindy.
I have gummy bears coming out of my ears, literally.
Not literally, but they are in a surprising amount of places around here.
Hey, thank you.
See, I can make things happen for you.
When do we start?
We just did.
Okay, lesson number one.
Eye contact.
Follow me.
Follow me.
Eye contact.
-Okay.
-Eye contact is power, Hugo.
Women will lust after you.
Now, it's your turn.
I am Arden, okay?
Say hello to me.
-Okay.
-Hello Hugo, I'm Arden.
Hello, Arden.
You broke eye contact.
You broke eye contact.
You threw a gummy bear at me.
What?
Life will throw gummy bears at you.
Okay.
Do it again.
Stop throwing gummy bears at me.
Stop breaking eye contact.
Hello, Arden.
Not bad.
Good eye contact.
Not bad at all.
You guys are getting real creative with these gummy bears.
Most people just eat them.
Okay, lesson number two...
Women love when men take control because women have no idea what they wants.
I'll have the steak and the lady would have the cobb salad.
What if she doesn't want the cobb salad?
Listen, a woman would rather eat something you ordered for her that she doesn't want rather than something she ordered for herself that she does want.
It doesn't make sense.
Like, at all.
You know what doesn't make sense?
What is that?
You under house arrest or what?
It's a planetary watch.
Some people call it an astronomical watch.
I'm gonna call it I'm gonna die a virgin watch.
Lose it.
Let's go.
Wait, uncle Maximo.
What is a virgin?
It's an airline.
Last lesson of the day...
Your walk.
Your walk tells more about you than your mouth ever can.
-My walk?
-Yes, your walk.
Show me your walk.
-Do I just walk?
-Just walk, walk.
-Okay.
-Like you walk.
Horse shit.
Sit and watch.
Loose stride, sleepy eyes, smiling just a little bit because you know what all the ladies are thinking.
What are the ladies thinking?
Look at that confidence, he must be great in bed.
I'm great in bed.
-What?
-I don't pee or anything anymore.
Come on now, my boy.
Let's walk.
Loose stride, sleepy eyes.
What are you doing?
Pretend there's a girl and you're walking towards her.
Feel your sexiness.
I don't feel my sexy.
What is that?
You're walking exactly like the geese.
Let's go.
Don't watch the geese, okay?
A girl pass by, turn around, walk backwards, sexy, sexy.
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
One more time.
Feel it in your crotch.
You want everyone to see down here.
No, I don't.
Look at me.
You learn from the best.
Okay, one more time.
You feel sexy right now?
-Yeah.
-Great.
Okay, one more time.
Exactly, exactly, exactly.
There you go.
Much better.
Shit.
Okay.
One more time.
Gwen,
I wanted to see if you heard back on the Robinson account.
Sara,
I was really hoping to avoid you and then ignore you a bunch before you could ask me about this.
I know, sorry.
I can ask you again tomorrow as soon as you get out of the car.
No, no.
Can't unbreak this egg.
Alright, they loved you.
They thought you were incredible.
But they're gonna go with someone who has...
-More experience.
-Sorry, can I finish?
Sorry...
Yes, yes...
Someone who has more experience.
You finished?
Yeah.
I just don't know what to do.
I can't get a job because I don't have experience and I can't get experience if I don't get a job.
-Hey mom.
-I'm here.
5:00.
I remembered.
You have nothing to complain about.
I thought you'd be happy.
I got a job.
Turning my car into a stripper mobile is not a job.
-What's a stripper?
-It's only nine days.
No, it's not.
You get this trash off my car today.
Today!
Alright now, those guys, they...
no wait, girls... they dance on the poles naked, right?
Icebergs are literally just floating ice on the water
Wow, astonishing.
So when it melts, it's like soda, it's like bubbles.
-Bubbles, wow.
-Carbon dioxide.
Where's your watch?
You mean, my die a virgin watch?
What did you say?
Die a virgin watch.
Kids.
Where do they come up with this stuff?
Uncle Maximo told me to take it off.
He's training me to get girls to like me.
He's training you?
-Yeah.
-What the hell are you doing?
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It's just silly guy talk.
It's not silly.
I learned how to undress a woman with my eyes.
And how to walk so a woman would know I'm gonna bed.
He said women have no idea what they want and you have to tell them what to do.
No, I never used those words exactly.
Sure you did.
I wrote it all down in this notebook.
-What notebook?
-Lesson number...
Mira.
Hugo needs to focus on his school work.
Hey, he has a crush on a girl at school.
I'm trying to help the kid.
You know what it's like to like someone!
Or no?
Mister "I need you to grease my door once a week".
No.
You're taking one think for another.
-And James is just a friend!
-Oh, my God.
You're changing the subject!
No more sugar mama catching training!
Hugo already has a mother.
-Understood?
-Yes, mommy.
Understood?
I don't speak English.
Don't be an idiot.
Why with a tortilla?
Hey, pull my finger.
Pull it.
-False alarm.
-Yeah.
You're writing a love letter to Arden?
No, just writing to my dad.
Your dad?
You know he'll never get those letters, right?
I know.
It's just a way for me to feel close then.
Don't you ever think about your dad?
-No.
-Never?
Never.
You remember anything about him?
I remember he worked a lot.
And he parked his truck in our house once.
There it is.
Late bloomer.
I remember a lot about my dad.
He was fun.
I think he'd be happy that you're here and that you're helping me.
That's what I was just writing him.
Uncle Maximo, can I show you my science project?
I... in the morning.
Please?
I know that you're really not sleeping.
Uncle Maximo, please?
Okay.
In the morning.
Good morning.
Uncle Maximo.
Remember when you told me that I can show you my science fair project in the morning?
Well, here it is!
My weather balloon.
And here is the Go Pro camera which will be attached to the weather balloon which will go up in space.
It's cool, right?
Amazing.
Now, will you please get it off my face so I can go back to sleep?
Get up, flojo naso!
Time to go get a job.
Here, I circled the ones that I think will be good for your qualifications like human statue, mattress tester, dog poop picker upper...
It's Sunday.
What place will even be open?
It's Thursday.
Want me to deflate the balloon?
Let's go.
The science fair is next Sunday, the school is today.
Hey, no.
Hugo!
No, Sara!
Get a job!
Hey, condos, condos!
Sorry!
I'm okay!
I am okay.
He's okay.
He's okay.
It wasn't me, it wasn't me.
I'm alright.
This neighborhood isn't that bad.
I was expecting something out of a horror movie, this is more like something out of an independent movie.
Stop trying to make me feel better.
Stop trying to make me feel better.
-Are you teasing me?
-Teasing me.
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Millicent's just fantasizing about this...
Professor Rojas.
She's got me dressing like him, talking like him, but, I can't do an accent to save my life.
And I can't sleep on an air mattress one more night.
You find any intel or Celeste Birch?
As as matter of fact, I did.
And before I share this,
I don't think she's the right mark for you.
Come on.
Celeste Birch's passions, avid mountain climber, loves train travel, favorite food, fried chicken.
Great.
This will help.
Thanks.
Alright.
It is time to go.
-Anything?
-Terrible.
It's time to go.
You sound like Dora the explorer.
Now's the go, when it's time to go.
Speedy Gonzales.
Really.
Alright.
Ola.
Everybody knows how to say that.
And somehow you screwed it up.
Hola.
-I'm positive, that's the car.
-But why would we pay him, if he's not gonna do it.
We paid him all our money.
Hey, hey, hey!
Stop!
Stop!
Well, look who it is.
No, no, no, no.
Where do you think you're going?
-Where you going, man?
-Just looking for you guys.
I was just looking for you guys.
We clearly said, don't take the wrap off.
Ever!
Yes, yes, I remember and I thought you did a great job with the wrapping.
But, you see my sister felt differently.
She's your sister.
-Yeah
-Sister.
-Women.
-Right, right.
You don't have to tell Nick and I about that.
Get his nuts.
-I got them.
-Get his nuts.
I got both of them.
I got them.
You just give us our money.
We'll be fine.
I spent it.
I spent it.
Well, I sincerely hope you bought something you really wanted or needed.
God, you're terrible with this.
Nick, just think before you talk.
Can you do that?
I made a mistake.
I'll get you your money, I promise.
Come on guys.
It's just a thousand dollars.
-One week.
You got one week.
-Yes.
Let's go.
I didn't see that coming.
Nice!
-Thought we're done, right?
-You feel that?
Two hands.
You want four hands?
-That's four hands.
-Yeah, there it is.
-That's four hands.
-One week.
One week, home boy.
We went four hands on him, man.
That was bad ass.
His balls are so big.
You get that money or next time it's eight hands.
Guy doesn't have $1000, get a job, bone head.
Froyo Lo look out That's right
You've got to let your fantasies out For a bite
Say your name...
Jose!
Ain't no shame
Froyo Lo!
Froyo Lo!
Such a good effort.
It's only lacking joy, soul, rhythm and musicality.
And I would cry way less.
Maybe not at all.
But, what if mom finds out we're training again?
Hugo, you can't live your life afraid that something bad will happen.
Or you'll never really live.
Okay.
So, you gotten her to notice you with the sexy walk.
You intrigued her with strong eye contact.
Now, it's time to talk to her.
I don't think I can.
Relax, Hugo.
It's not like you've never talked to a girl before.
Yes, it is.
I've never talked to a girl before.
-Really?
-Yeah.
They make me really nervous and then my nose start to sweat.
-Your nose sweats?
-Yeah.
-Your nose?
-Yes.
-I can't help you with that.
-Stop mocking me.
Well, come on.
Let's go.
Well, where are we going?
You're too in your head, kid.
You need to relax.
I don't like the bowling balls here.
Too slippery.
I'm gonna grab a Coke.
You want one?
Cokes have no nutritional value.
Neither do eggplants.
Okay, two Cokes.
Nice form.
Thanks.
My name is Gabi.
What's yours?
My name is Hugo.
You're cute, Hugo.
Thank you.
-See you.
-Thank you.
Thank you.
-What was that?
-She just called me cute!
-She said you were cute?
-Yes.
I guess my mom's not the only one who thinks that.
Guess not.
What is that crap on your nose?
It's sweat.
Wait!
My shoes.
Okay, I'll be right back.
-Don't get kidnapped.
-Okay.
Thank you.
Those please.
-Nice work.
-I aim to please.
Okay, remember... eye contact and confidence.
Come on, take that off.
You can do it.
Now we are talking.
Look at that, you're a Greek god.
-Abs of steel.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-Is my nose sweating?
Yeah, little bit.
But, it will wash out when you get in the water.
-Okay.
-Okay, come on.
Go get her.
You can do this.
Come on, Stalker.
Do you need a towel?
No no no.
Eye contact, eye contact!
Hi, Arden.
Hi, Hugo.
You know my name?
Yeah, I know your name.
You said you know by mean H-I, not H-I-G-H.
Okay.
Let's go ladies, practice is over.
Got to clear the pool area.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes!
-Yes?
-Yes!
-Yes?
-She invited me to her party!
She invited me to her party!
We did it!
Exactly what I needed!
-Yes!
-Yes!
-Do you see my nephew happy?
-Yes!
Yeah man, you got it!
I heard about the Pasadena project.
Yeah.
Listen, I have some ideas.
I know it's a long shot, but please take a look.
I'd love a chance.
And I promise that I'd treat like my own child.
Hey mom.
The 101 was wide open.
It's okay.
I just let him drive from around the block.
Don't worry, I'm not one of those people concerned about children.
Hugo, that's wonderful.
A party with other kids.
-So can I go?
-Of course,
I'll take you.
It'll be great.
Sara, you work so hard.
I will take him.
Are you kidding me?
I can't wait to see all his new friends.
Plus, we could see the big mansion of the grandmother, right?
Hey, no offense, but I think Hugo would mush rather go with me.
I mean, look at you.
Look at me.
-Look at you.
-Maximo, Maximo...
The words should sound right in your head before they leave the lips in your stupid face.
I don't care who brings me.
I'm just excited to go.
I'm bringing you, honey.
I'm sure uncle Maximo has better things to do on a Saturday.
Okay.
James.
Shit!
You scared me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's Maximo, Sara's brother.
Yeah, why are you hiding in my garbage?
We need to talk.
It's about Sara.
My god, what happened?
It's not what happened, it's what hasn't happened.
-I don't understand.
What do you mean?
-James,
I'm not saying I get it, but she likes you.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
Hey, I have an idea.
Take her out on Saturday.
Saturday?
Don't you think you waited long enough?
Door.
Please don't bother yourself.
You just keep doing nothing there while I cook and I open the door, and whatever else you need.
Hi.
-Hi, James.
-Hi
Is it the door again?
I'll go get my tools.
No, no, no.
Actually it's...
It's...
It's my sink.
I was just kidding about my sink.
Funny.
So, do you need something?
Or did you just come here to tell the sink joke?
No, no, no.
Actually, I didn't.
I mean, I did, but I...
I came here to ask you if you're free on Saturday and if you wanted to...
If you wanted to come out on a date with me.
What?
I don't know.
-Okay.
-Mom, are you okay?
You wanna think about it?
-I don't know.
-She's acting weird.
-Maybe?
-Yeah, she'll just think about it and get back to you.
Okay, fine.
But, you know let me know either way.
I told you.
This guy likes you.
I don't want to talk about it.
-Hey!
-I'm going to my room.
-Hey!
-Finish the dinner.
Don't come in.
I'm sleeping.
Hugo is asleep now.
Why did you act so weird?
What's wrong?
What do you think is wrong?
I'm rusty.
I don't feel ready to go out with anyone.
When was the last time?
5 years ago.
I mean, when was the last time you... 5 years.
Seriously?
Thant's enough!
Are you serious?
Si.
Okay?
Stop laughing.
The bakery has been closed for some time.
Your pastry is going to go stale.
You're such a jerk.
My God, what are you waiting for?
I don't know.
You like this little gringo?
You like the gringo!
So go, then!
I'm afraid.
You know what I do when I'm afraid?
Pray?
Drink.
My God, leave my bakery alone.
Don't talk to me about my bakery.
No, but seriously...
I don't know how you've managed to go on, in spite of all your suffering, to keep going, to always move forward...
I can because of Hugo.
Hugo, how?
When my husband died, there were days when I couldn't even breathe.
But, how do you explain to a small child that he has to take care of himself, because his mom wants to lock herself in her room and cry?
You can't.
But I have a trick for when I'm very sad to lift me up.
Anti-depressants?
No, look...
I take any sad song, and transform it into a salsa.
A sad song?
What about The Sad One?
Let's go.
You're stepping on me!
Come on.
Let's go!
The Sad One!
Come on!
I'm falling asleep this isn't a salsa.
Mom.
Mom!
Hugo!
Did we wake you up?
Yes.
You're singing very loudly and bumping into things.
Go to sleep.
Both of you.
Okay.
You see?
You're not rusty, all you need to is relax and have fun, that's all!
You honestly don't mind taking him to the party?
It would be the greatest honor of my life.
Let's go!
Come on!
Send him a text.
That's my sister!
That's my sister!
Enough!
Hugo.
You have no room to judge.
Sorry for the spill.
What the hell happened to me?
Look what the cat dragged in!
-Pay day.
-Great!
Thank you.
Hey, where's the rest of it?
Try feeding 50 cats on that kind of money.
It's meow-trageous!
Old man?
Not for long.
Give me the works.
Sorry.
Hey.
Behold the glory of God's creation.
Did you dye your hair?
All of it.
I gave myself a little makeover.
Maybe next time, they can makeover your brain.
I know perfectly well...
I look very good.
Very good.
I love you, stupid face.
I love you too, little sister.
What are you telling your dad tonight?
Just that I'm excited to go to Arden's party.
And that I'm glad you're going with me.
I patched it up for you.
So you can sleep better.
Give me a piece of paper, Hugo.
I wanna write a letter too.
To who?
My dad.
I wanna tell him about his amazing grandson.
Can we do this every night?
Sure.
It could be our thing.
Hey, pull my finger.
Too late.
Sorry.
-Today's the party!
-Really?
I haven't been thinking about it.
Mommy's taking me to get a hair cut.
Tell him not too short.
You don't have the ears for it.
Why don't you stop talking.
You don't have the mouth for it.
Hugo, come here.
Hey!
I made the wall!
Wow, what happened?
It's been kind of nice having you here.
-Right?
-It's been okay.
-Just okay?
-Okay, okay...
Been very nice having you here, uncle Maximo.
Now we're talking.
-Bye.
-See you, uncle Maximo.
Don't sprinkle the toilet.
I'll do my best.
God!
Now what?
Hey.
Guys!
I was just looking for you.
Coffee?
Coffee.
-Money!
-We're not here for coffee, man!
-Money!
-That's what we want!
That's why we are here!
We don't even like coffee!
Get the money!
Yeah.
Money.
I don't exactly have it.
What do you mean, exactly?
Means he doesn't have it.
Well, then why don't just say you don't have it.
Why even say the word exactly at all?
I'm gonna pay you, I promise.
Hey, you got a real nice place here.
By nice place, I mean a total dump.
That's what I'm talking about.
People just say what they mean, it's confusing.
Guys, this is my sister's place, please.
You know what your problem is?
You don't have any respect for money man!
-Money doesn't grow on trees.
-No, it doesn't.
-It would be cool if it did.
-Nikki, Nikki!
Please!
I'm just backing up your point.
You could literally rake it up.
-What're you doing?
-Hey...
Totally forgot what I was talking about.
-What if we took stuff of yours, sir?
-Okay, okay.
That's a good point.
What if we barged in and started taking stuff?
-What if I took this thing?
-No, please...
I don't even know what it is.
What about this?
What if I took this?
No, no!
No, no, not that!
That's my nephew's.
That's important.
-This is important to you?
-Yeah.
Then, probably don't want me to have it then?
Hey, no, don't do that please.
No, don't do that please.
Okay, okay...
What do you like?
Sports cars?
Helicopters?
Rolex watches?
I promise I am good for the money and so much more.
I don't need a Rolex, bro.
-You know something?
-What?
You seem like a very sincere guy.
I am.
But, I don't believe anything that you say you're gonna do.
So give us our money, you can have your camera back.
It's that simple.
Hey, please, please, please.
Hey.
Hey!
Have a real nice day.
And by that I mean, do not have a real nice day.
I get it.
Sometimes its funny to not say exactly what you mean.
Not the camera, hey, the camera.
Uncle Maximo, we're home.
Are you ready?
Almost.
Wow!
We look the same.
Yep.
Maximo.
Minimo.
Wow, mom!
You look pretty.
And you're so guapo.
That dress is really tight on you.
You mean, I look fat?
No, no, no.
In a good way, I mean.
Because you can see all the body parts in your body.
-I'm gonna take...
-No!
No, no, no.
Let's make some magic happen.
Yeah!
Arden, here we come.
Wow!
Look at this place!
Yep.
This will do just fine.
There she is.
Yep.
There she is.
Hey, Hugo, just remember everything I taught you, okay?
Thank you, uncle Maximo.
Go get her.
Go get her, Latino lover.
Beautiful as your uncle.
Hello.
Hello.
Have we met?
Only in my dreams.
Hugo.
Did you hurt your leg?
No baby, I was just walking.
My nephew is quiet fond of your grand daughter.
Really?
Do I have something on my face?
Yes.
You have my full attention.
Okay.
It's enchanting to meet you.
Maximo.
Maximo.
Hey baby, what do you say we like, leave this place.
What do you mean?
I have a birthday party.
-Drink?
-Allow me, please.
Excuse me...
The lady and I will have your finest champagne.
She'll have a Sprite and I'll have a Coke.
Something as refreshing and exciting as she is.
Of course.
Well...
Actually, I'll just have some water.
Thanks.
Women.
They never know what they want.
Am I right?
She'll have a Sprite, like I said.
But, of course.
I have to go.
Arden, wait.
Shall we grab a bite?
Wait, wait.
Sorry I was acting so weird.
Can we start over?
Is that a planetary watch?
Yeah.
Wanna check out the rest of my party?
-Sure.
-Come on.
Cheers.
-Beautiful party.
-Isn't it?
Yeah.
Such a beautiful day.
Mountains, trains, chickens.
That's quiet a mountain of melon balls.
You know, climbing is one of my greatest passions.
In fact, I'm training for Everest.
Of course, it's not the mountain that we conquer, but ourselves.
Sir Edmund Hilary.
Yes.
You climb?
Once upon a time.
But, not anymore.
Nonsense.
Beautiful strong woman like yourself surely has many climbs left in her.
Not this woman, I'm afraid.
Give me one good reason.
Frost bite.
South face of Everest.
Just thinking about it gives me day tremors.
I hate climbing.
You convince me.
I hate it too.
What I really love, train travel.
So classic.
Won't you agree?
-Steam locomotive, 1950.
-You have no arms?
I was playing on the tracks and got stuck.
I'm afraid I haven't much fondness for trains.
Now if you'll excuse me for a moment, please.
Chicken!
-Chicken?
-Yes, Chicken!
I'm sure you love fried chicken.
Having my limbs torn from my body, helped me to realize just how barbaric the treatment of chickens is in our country.
I'm vegetarian.
Which is why I founded
The Birch Poultry Rehabilitation Center.
Now, if you'll forgive me a moment, please.
Hey!
Chicken.
Rick?
Rick.
Hey!
-What are you doing here?
-I was just...
Waiting for me to make a fool of myself in front of Celeste?
Yes.
All that information that you gave me was wrong.
It was.
How could you do that to me?
Because, I can't take another second of Millicent.
Last night, she made me dress up as her father.
What is that about?
I think it's pretty clear.
I guess you're right.
So, leave her.
Leave her?
And end up like you with nothing?
Look, it's survival of the fittest.
Come on, bro, you know the game.
No hard feelings.
Hey, Rick...
Hey, Rick... where you going?
Rick...
I believe they're playing our song.
May I?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
I'm Rick Parsons.
-Hi.
-May I cut in?
No, I don't think that's a good idea.
I saw her first.
-Well, I was aware of her first.
-I don't care.
Let it go!
You can't...
How do I...
Sorry.
Sorry.
My liege...
-Get out!
-Yes.
-You pulled her arm?
-No, you pulled her arm.
You were my best friend.
Get off me!
They're fighting.
Hey, guys, it's a kid's birthday party...
You betrayed me.
It was just business.
It wasn't personal.
You knew how much I needed this.
You knew how desperate I was.
Celeste was my way out.
You think I'll spend the rest of my life living with my sister and nephew in their crappy little apartment?
I thought you said you liked living with us.
Hugo, no...
No, I mean... yes.
I do.
I do very much.
So you were using me to get Arden's grand mother.
Right?
No, no, no, I was helping you.
-Please don't lie.
-I swear...
Okay... a little bit.
I mean, I sort of used you.
But, it wasn't really about you.
It was more about me and in order to help me I wanted to help you.
My god, I...
You know, that sounds worse than it is.
I thought you were helping me because you liked me.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
I don't want you sleeping in my bed anymore.
I don't want you to stay in my house anymore.
My god.
Overdressed?
Absolutely not.
No.
I think everybody at the game is underdressed.
I think you really classed the whole place up.
They should've paid you to come to the game.
I'm sorry.
It's my son.
Hi, sweetie.
What?
Sorry, I forgot the code.
Is Hugo here?
Thanks to god, no thanks to you.
Can I speak with him?
-No.
-Please?
Just let me explain.
How do you explain to a child who opened his heart to you that you were only using him to seduce the grandmother of the girl he likes?
I can't believe that I was stupid enough to let you humiliate him like that.
I'm sorry, okay?
Where is Hugo's camera?
I promise I'll get it back to you.
So, you were the one who stole it.
No, I didn't steal it.
No, Sara, hey!
Don't kick me out, look...
We're family!
No.
You're not family.
You're nothing more than a lazy 46 year old freeloader who doesn't think of anyone but himself.
You didn't just steal his camera.
You stole his hopes.
You stole his dreams.
But it ends now.
You will never use me or Hugo again, understood?
I'm 39.
What?
You said I'm 46, but I'm 39.
-No, you're not.
-Of course, I am.
But I'm 42.
-So what?
-You're my older brother!
I don't know what to tell you.
You know what?
I hope you grow up one day.
But it won't be in my house.
Okay, I'm 40.
Okay, 41.
We're twins!
Okay?
You don't have to sing, please.
Say your name.
Maximo.
Cindy's home.
Thank for letting me stay.
Watch your back.
We got you some nice hot tea.
I think I got all the hairs out.
And you can stay here as long as you like.
I'm sure you'll figure out a way to pay me back.
I get it.
Eye contact.
Don't lose eye contact.
-What are you doing?
-I'm about to pay you back.
What?
God!
No, no, stop, stop.
Please stop.
-Isn't this what you want?
-No.
God, no.
Button up, just put that away.
You're not attracted to me?
-No.
-Really?
Not at all.
No, I'm attracted to like really good looking guys.
Guys with like great faces, great bodies, who are muscular, handsome and younger, much younger than you.
And tall, a lot taller.
But, that's just me.
Then, why did you give me the job?
I think I'm just drawn to helping less fortunate, damaged, sad, sad, sad, sad creatures.
Why do you think I have so many cats?
They need me, but I need them.
But, they hurt you over and over again.
This guy, right?
I know.
I mean, just because they hurt me doesn't mean they don't love me.
I take care of them and I don't expect anything in return.
These cats are my family.
I had a chance to be part of a family.
I ruined it.
I don't think you ruined it.
Because, it's never too late to make it right.
You've cat to do what you cat to do.
I've never seen that one before.
Well, you'd be happy to know that I lost everything.
Millicent found out about Celeste's party, she kicked me out.
You got a sister you can stay with?
No.
I never should have gone behind your back like that.
Wish there was something I could do to make it up to you.
There is something.
That's your idea face.
Yep.
This is it.
So, when's the kid's science fair again?
It's in three hours.
You get in there and get the camera.
I'll keep them distracted over here.
Police.
Police from the neighborhood.
Can I help you, officer?
Here for the tiny motorcycle?
He's not here for your stupid bike.
You here for the bike?
No sir, I'm not here for the vehicle.
There's a neighborhood gas leak, evacuate the premises.
Gas leak?
I didn't even know we had gas.
Situation is clear, Larry.
Yes, sir, Mr. Neighborhood Police Officer.
I'm gonna fix the...
I'm closing the door because the gas is... leaking here.
-I didn't smell any gas.
-I don't smell anything.
You wouldn't.
That's what makes the danger so dangerous.
Excuse me, officer?
What kind of handcuffs are those?
Police handcuffs.
Are they furry?
There had been some local perps, who have been having an allergic reaction to the metal.
Now, we coat it in synthetic material, health is on the uprise, crime is on the down rise.
But, I wouldn't worry your pretty head over that, ma'am.
I don't think we need it in this investigation.
-Ma'am?
-Ma'am?
Is this an investigation?
I thought this was a gas leak?
Investigation of a gas leak.
And shut up!
I'm a police officer, I want this crime scene secured.
It's not a crime scene...
Shut up!
Got you!
Take it easy, alright.
You said investigation
No!
You take it easy.
Or I'll shoot you!
You're not shooting anybody.
I'll shoot you in the Lorax!
-That's not a thing, officer.
-It's a children's book.
You sussing me boy?
You sussing me?
I am a police officer of the law.
I don't think you are.
Officer George Clooney from the 69th precinct.
Don't make me use this.
I won't.
Let it go.
We've been compromised!
Ride like the wind.
Hey, sloucher jerk!
I'm okay, I'm okay.
You have the right to remain silent.
Not in the face.
Hugo.
Hugo.
Hey, Hugo.
Hugo.
Hugo.
Hey!
Here's Hugo's camera.
If we go now, we can still make the science fair!
The fair was yesterday.
Hugo missed it.
No!
He told me Sunday at 1!
Today is Monday.
You're too late.
No, it's never too late!
This time it is.
24 hours late to be exact.
Thanks for the camera.
All I wanted to do was impress her.
Instead, I was humiliated.
I am sorry, honey.
You want me to walk you in?
No, I don't.
You can't live your life afraid something bad will happen, because then, you've really never lived.
Where did you hear that?
Uncle Maximo.
Hi, Arden.
Hugo.
I'm so glad to see you.
-You are?
-Yeah.
I thought you were mad at me.
No.
My grandma and I know you did nothing wrong.
Good.
I was worried that your grandma would be up in arms about us being friends.
Get it?
Up in arms.
Up in arms.
Get it?
Hugo, that's not funny.
That's just offensive.
I didn't mean it like that.
I'm joking.
I'm funny too, you know.
Wow, you are funny!
-I got your letter.
-My letter?
No one's ever written me an actual on real paper before.
Really?
And my answer is yes.
Well, that's great!
To what question again, I'm sorry...
I'd love to launch the weather balloon with you, silly.
Yeah, right, my weather balloon.
I forgot about that.
How could I forget about that.
Can I see that for a sec.
I just want to see if I got all my punctuations right.
-Is that okay.
-As long as you give it back.
Thank you.
"Dearest Arden,
I am sorry if I caused you any pain.
It was the last thing I wanted to do.
You are more important to me than you know.
Two, one...
Yes go!
I always wished we could be friends.
There it goes.
But, you don't get what you wish for, you get what you work for.
Sometimes love can be scary.
Alright, moment of truth, here we go.
I think...
Sometimes love can be surprising.
Is this happening?
I think so.
Sometimes we hurt the ones we love.
No!
-What the hell is that?
-I didn't know man.
But, it's never too late to make it right.
Our time on earth is short.
But, love is forever.
You make me want to be a better fifth grader.
Would you please join me in launching my weather balloon?
Yours, Hugo."
Sara.
You didn't get the house in Pasadena,
-they went with someone...
-Let me guess, more experienced.
-Yeah.
-Well, you know what I think?
-Good...
-Can I finish?
I think that I deserve a shot at my own house.
And if I'm not given my due,
I not afraid to go somewhere else where I am appreciated.
Okay.
Have you finished?
No, I am not.
A lesser woman would have given up already, ten years of drawing plans.
But, I am strong, I am determined.
And I know that I will find my dream job someday.
-Yes, you will.
-Yes, I will.
And that day is today.
What?
Okay, Hugo.
What do you think?
Glasses on or glasses off?
You look pretty either way, mommy.
Baby, it's a big day today.
Mommy's a little nervous.
Well, at least your nose isn't sweating.
Well, it's a good thing.
Wow!
A helicopter!
My goodness!
Okay...
You wait here and I will be...
right back.
-Mommy...
-Yeah?
I am proud of you.
-Mommy's gonna build a house.
-Yes!
Mrs. Dupont.
It is so nice to meet you.
Thank you.
Thank you for this opportunity
I promise that you wont regret it.
I certainly hope not.
You come very highly recommended.
By who?
Maximo?
Wow!
You didn't think
I'd be selling frozen yogurt all my life, did you?
I usually don't put much stock in what my man candy says, but he showed me your designs and I loved them.
You did?
Thank you.
Uncle Maximo.
-Uncle Maximo.
-Hey!
-Hugo!
-That's my son.
I missed you so much.
Missed you too.
Nice blazer, Uncle Maximo.
Professor Rojas, when she's around.
Such a great view.
-I'm so glad I am rich.
-Yeah, me too.
Must be nice.
Hey, don't go too far.
Or I'll put you in detention.
Have I been a bad girl?
Well, I guess Papa was wrong.
Sometimes you do get what you wish for.
Are you kidding?
This woman's a lot of work.
Ay dios mio.
Hugo, wanna go for a ride?
I don't know if momma will let me.
You know what?
I think professor Rojas has earned another chance.
Yes!
That's my older sister.
Stop it!
I am your baby sister!
Yeah, but you look older.
Honestly.
What can I tell you?
It's true.
Come here, come here.
Come here.
Thank you.
Thank you!
You helped me make my dream come true.
You earned it.
You're so talented.
I love you.
I love you.
Okay, Hugo, let's go.
Mommy's got work to do.
Don't call him "Jugo."
His name is Hugo!
Same thing.
He's not a juice.
Up you go.
Come on, co pilot.
I want the house to be beautiful.
Me too.
But eerie.
Sleek.
Seaside.
Fever dream.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Let's fly.
Bye.
I didn't know you could fly a helicopter.
Of course.
All rich people fly helicopters.
Can I drive?
I don't see why not.
Yes!
No!
No!
I thought we were in trouble there.
You got it.
Hello?
Who's that?
It's your mommy.
She wants us to come back now.
Come on.
Show me your sexy.
Camera 1...
Squeeze your body.
You look like Chaplin.
You know who Chaplin is?
No.
Unhand me, sir.
Do you want me to see if the manager's here.
She does all hiring.
Thank you very much.
Hello.
I am the manager.
Hey, guys.
Latin lover.
Latin lover.
- Give it to me!
- No.
Maximo!
Sara!
Your father is here.
Papa!
Papa!
Move!
I'm okay...
This is a nightmare.
I know it's horrible living here, but we're still a family.
I don't need a family.
What I need is somewhere to live that isn't an old wreck.
When I grow up, I'm going to be an architect, so I can build a big house for us.
What are you going to do?
- I'm going to sleep.
- No.
What are you going to do for work?
I'm going to be rich, so I don't have to work.
But Papa always said that you get what you work for, not what you wish for.
And look what happened to him!
- It's time to sleep, children.
- [both] We're already asleep.
Look".
This is who I'm going to be.
IT'S TIME TO INDULGE YOURSELF
He didn't get that rich without having a job.
No,no,no.
I don't want his job.
I want hers.
Talk to me, Rafa.
What's on the menu?
Take a look at lounge chair number three.
There's a hot one over there... super rich!
I see her, I see her.
She does look it!
Who is she?
Peggy Von Strauss.
Fifty-five, divorced...
- but she's loaded.
- Yeah?
Her family owns the biggest supermarket chain in the United States.
She's perfect.
Have I ever told you that you remind me of Mr. Rojas?
He was my Spanish professor in college, with whom I had a passionate affair?
Yes, I think you mentioned it once or twice... or every time I see you.
I can't believe this.
After I gave her my best years, after I gave her my youth, after I gave her the best of me!
Of course, now that my boobs have sagged, she finds someone younger than me.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving!
Look, once I cross this threshold, I'm never coming back!
I'm not!
Okay.
I'm not coming back!
It's over!
It's over forever!
But she's going to miss me.
She'll miss my seeds.
Come harvest time, she'll miss my seeds.
It's me, your brother.
Open the door, will you?
Open... ls this for real?
You show up today, as if it were nothing?
After you didn't even bother coming to see our dying mother, when that avocado tree fell on her.
You didn't come to see my child when he was born.
What made you think I'd have any desire to see you?
You can't just show up like this.
I'm not opening the door for you!
I'm not--
Hey, Sara!
Sarita!
- I can't believe this.
- Me neither!
You're happy to see me, right?
No!
What are you doing here?
Nothing!
I wanted to see you and my niece.
- Nephew!
- That!
Niece, no?
Nephew?
Niece?
What did I say?
Nephew?
Nephew.
That's it, nephew.
Tell me what you want and then beat it!
Peggy kicked me out.
She took everything.
Everything!
But wasn't everything hers to begin with?
Okay, fine.
She kept everything.
She even kept the car I picked out for her to buy for me to give to her for our anniversary.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know you're angry with me, but... can I stay with you?
Here?
Here in my house?
Yes.
I have nowhere else to stay.
Really?
You have honestly lost your mind!
You're my sister!
- Oh, I'm your sister now?
- You've always been my sister!
- Oh, come on, Maximo!
- What?
I can't believe what comes out of your mouth!
Don't be like this.
Take that!
One day and that's it.
- Come in.
- Really?
Grab your things!
What, you think I'll carry them?
This isn't a hotel!
- Hey, your apartment is nice.
- Thanks.
Like, outside it seemed a little... but it's cool.
What's wrong?
I'm armed!
I'm armed!
Shut up!
What?
Are you a carpenter or something?
When you're both the man and the woman of the house, you have to be a handyman and do whatever is necessary.
I just help out when something gets jammed, or there's a problem in his house.
Go on, then!
I don't think they'll let me.
I look like my grandfather.
I kept it close by like you asked me, paisano.
Thank you...
Baby, please.
Fuck me.
Come on, now.
You know what it's like to like someone!
Don't you?
Mr. "I need you to grease my door once a week."
No.
- It's not the same thing.
- 'Course it is!
- And James is just a friend!
- Oh, my God.
You're changing the subject!
I don't speak English.
Don't be an idiot.
Why With a tortilla?
Get up, lazy bum!
Goddammit.
Hugo is asleep now.
Why did you act so weird?
What's wrong?
What do you think is wrong?
I'm rusty.
I don't feel ready to go out with anyone.
When was the last time?
Five years ago.
- I mean, when was the last time you--
- Five years.
Seriously?
That's enough!
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Okay?
Stop laughing-
The bakery has been closed for some time.
Your pastry is going to go stale.
You're such a jerk.
My God, what are you waiting for?
I don't know.
You like this little gringo?
You like the gringo!
So go, then!
I'm afraid.
You know what I do when I'm afraid?
Pray?
Drink.
My God, leave my bakery alone.
Don't talk to me about my bakery.
No, but seriously...
I don't know how you've managed to go on, in spite of all your suffering, to keep going, to always move forward.
- Hugo.
- That's why I admire you.
I can because of Hugo.
Hugo, how?
When my husband died, there were days when I couldn't even breathe.
But, how do you explain to a small child that he has to take care of himself, because his morn wants to lock herself in her room and cry?
You can't.
But I have a trick to cheer me up when I'm very sad.
- Anti-depressants?
- No.
No, look...
I take any sad song, and turn it into a salsa.
A sad song?
How about "El Triste"?
Let's go.
You're stepping on me!
Come on.
Let's go! "El Triste"!
- You'll see.
- Come on!
I'm falling asleep, this isn't a salsa.
There we go!
There we go!
You see?
You're not rusty!
All you need to do is relax and have fun, that's all!
Huh?
You honestly don't mind taking him to the party?
No.
It would be the greatest honor of my life.
- Come on!
- Okay.
Send him a text.
Text him!
Text him!
Come on!
Text him, come on!
Do it!
That's my sister!
That's my sister!
Enough!
Behold the glory of God's creation.
Oh, baby!
- Did you dye your hair?
- Yep!
All of it.
I gave myself a little makeover.
Maybe next time they can make over your brain.
I know perfectly well...
I look very good.
Very good.
I love you, stupid face.
I love you too, little sister.
Maximum, minimum.
Beautiful, like your uncle.
Oh, Jesus!
Bad friend!
Coward!
You have no shame!
Sorry, I forgot the code.
ls Hugo here?
Yes, thank God.
Not thanks to you.
Can I speak with him?
No.
Please?
Just let me explain.
How do you explain to a child who opened up his heart to you that you were only using him to seduce the grandmother of the girl he likes?
I can't believe that I was stupid enough to let you humiliate him and hurt him like that!
I'm sorry, okay?
Where is Hugo's camera?
I promise I'll get it back to you.
So, you were the one who stole it.
No, I didn't steal it.
Don't kick me out, look...
Sara, don't kick me out!
We're family!
No.
You're not family.
You're nothing more than a lazy 46 year old freeloader, who doesn't think of anyone but himself.
You didn't just steal his camera!
You stole his hopes.
You stole his dreams.
But it ends now.
You will never use me or Hugo again, understood?
I'm 39.
What?
You said I'm 46, but I'm 39.
- No, you're not.
- Of course I am.
- Hell no!
- Of course I am.
But I'm 42!
- So what?
- You're my older brother!
I don't know what to tell you.
You know what?
I hope you grow up one day.
Okay.
But it won't be in my house.
Okay, I'm 40.
Okay, 41.
We're twins!
Okay?
This is all for you, baby.
Look at me.
Here's Hugo's camera.
If we go now, we can still make the science fair!
The fair was yesterday.
Hugo missed it.
No!
He told me Sunday at 1:00!
Today is Monday.
You're too late.
No, no...
It's never too late...
This time it is.
24 hours late, to be exact.
- Thanks for the camera.
- Sara...
You didn't think I'd be selling frozen yogurt all my life, did you?
Young lady!
Yes, you've been a very bad girl.
- This woman's a lot of work.
- Oh, my God...
Stop it!
You wish!
What's wrong with you?
Come here, come here.
Come here!
Come...
Thank you.
Thank you!
You helped make my dream come true.
You're so talented.
I love you.
I love you.
Don't call him "jugo."
His name is Hugo!
Same thing!
Are you insane?
Come back this instant!
Bring back Hugo, my son!

I'm ready for you.
I'll be but a second, sweetie.
- (SMACKING FLESH) - (MAXIMO GROANS)
- PEGGY:
One second.
- I'm here.
Happy anniversary!
Oh.
Darling, what a sweet thought!
Get in.
Get in.
I would, but with my knees,
I'm afraid it's too close to the ground for me.
All right.
Forget it.
- We won't get it, then.
- Oh.
I don't want my knees to ruin our special day.
No, it's okay.
It's okay.
- Okay.
- Let's get it.
It could be your car, too.
Yeah, I suppose that could work.
Hey.
- We'll take this one, please.
- Oh, that's a fine choice.
You know, the McLarens are like snowflakes, in that no two are ever the same.
- Is that true?
- Actually, it isn't, but, um... well, I still think it's a lovely image with the snowflake, don't you think?
- Aren't you the charmer.
- Well...
Call it the romantic in me.
The guys on the floor call me The Poet.
These boneheads, they like to make fun.
And what form of payment will you be using today, sir?
Um... her.
Very good.
I'll see if that's an option in our system.
(ENGINE REVVING)
Are you- Sir, another new car?
- Oh...
- Yep.
How do you do it, Mr. Maximo?
Once you lower your expectations, Jimmy, the sky's the limit.
That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard in my entire life.
Fore!
You don't mind if Maximo and I play a few holes, do you?
Not at all, as long as you play a few holes with me later.
You are a naughty girl.
Here we are.
A steak and a salad.
Uh-uh.
Mama likes you slim and trim.
(MOANING)
Oh, you want me to feed you some meat?
I want it so bad.
RICK:
This first bite is all fat.
- Hey, buddy.
- Oh, hey, brother.
Millicent... mmm.
You look radiant as always.
Have I ever told you that you remind me of Mr. Rojas?
He was my Spanish professor in college, with whom I had a passionate affair?
Yes, I think you mentioned it once or twice... or every time I see you.
- Right.
Er, let's hit the links.
- Yes.
Muah!
MAXIMO:
Wanna grab a drink tonight?
RICK:
Nope, sorry.
Millicent's got me booked up.
Got a bleaching appointment.
You should try it sometime.
I bleach my teeth.
I'm not talking about my teeth.
Oh.
Ouch.
RICK:
Gotta keep it white and tight.
Guys like you and me, we hide in the tall grass, wait for the most beautiful gazelle to come up from the back of the pack.
She drops her head to get that last drink of water, and we strike.
Thrill of the hunt.
Wait, aren't the sickly ones usually at the back of the pack?
What do you know about animals?
What are you, Steve Irwin, rest in peace?
I watch a lot of animal shows.
You're missing my point.
You know what, Rick?
I don't have to worry about hunting old gazelles anymore.
Because in my marriage...
(CLICKS TONGUE)
I call the shots.
Would have been a lot cooler if I sank that.
- (MOTOR REVVING) - (MUSIC PLAYING)
Whoo!
I love that you got yourself a matching McLaren.
We only played nine holes because I wanted to get back home to you.
Maximo, you're home early.
I missed you.
What's wrong?
Oh, did you get winded trying to scrapbook again?
You deserve a nice, refreshing beverage after the workout we just...
Hey!
You're back!
Hey, how you likin' the car?
Handles like a beauty, doesn't she?
You cheated on me with a car salesman?
No.
A little.
Remy.
Here you go.
You know what, the number on the bottom doesn't work anymore, but the top one's still good.
You call any time, okay?
You want a drink?
The bar here's incredible.
Oh, I don't have to tell you.
(CHUCKLES)
PEGGY:
I'm sorry, Maximo, it's over.
You snooze, you lose, bud.
Okay.
But half of everything is mine.
Actually, no.
You signed a prenuptial agreement.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I signed a prenup.
Oh... shit.
I can't believe this.
After I gave her my best years, after I gave her my youth, after I gave her the best of me!
Of course, now that my boobs have sagged, she finds someone younger than me.
Shit!
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving!
Look, once I cross this threshold, I'm never coming back!
I'm not!
Okay.
I'm not coming back!
It's over!
It's over forever!
But she's going to miss me.
She'll miss my seeds.
Come harvest time, she'll miss my seeds.
I'm feeling like playing some cops and robbers tonight.
Mmm?
Spice things up a little?
I think I might need to get frisked.
RICK:
That polyester looks a little itchy.
MILLICENT:
Oh, it'll suit you just fine.
- RICK:
No.
- MILLICENT:
No, no, no.
You're gonna put it on, you're gonna love it.
RICK:
Whatever mommy wants, mommy gets.
MILLICENT:
That's right.
(♪♪♪)
(WHISPERS) Maximo!
Rick.
Oh!
- I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God!
- You scared me.
- (GROANS)
- I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
- Yeah.
(STAMMERS) What's going on?
Peggy dumped me.
(SIGHS)
What the hell am I gonna do?
I have
- I have no money... no home... no helicopter...
Oh!
Oh, my God.
Stop hitting me!
I'm sorry.
I am on these horse testosterone pills that Millicent makes me take and they make me a little bit agitated.
- Look...
- Oh.
Guys like you and me, we're survivors.
We do whatever it takes to come out on top.
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Huh?
Look at me.
- Yes.
- All right, we survive.
- Yes.
- That is what we do.
- Yes, yes.
- All you need to do is find yourself a new wife.
- Yes.
Yes.
New and improved.
- New and improved!
Somebody who's richer and older than Peggy.
Absolutely, yeah.
I mean, there's plenty of fish in the sea.
And all I need is a place to stay while I'm fishing.
Well, I know you haven't been in touch for a while, but you could always try staying at your sister's.
I
- I'm not sure.
I mean, what about here?
- Oh, no can do.
- Why?
Millicent insists that every room be reserved at all times in case she wants to have a session.
There's- there's not a room that we don't (SIGHS)
- There is one place.
- Great!
Oh!
- I'm so...
It's the pills.
It's the pills.
I don't know how these horses do it.
This is Millicent's granddaughter's playhouse.
(SIGHS)
Oh, Millicent's granddaughter has excellent taste.
Millicent's granddaughter has expensive taste.
The place cost a fortune.
Horrible little girl.
One time, she made me salt a slug just so she could remember how to laugh.
Anyway, sleep tight.
Thank you.
(SIGHS)
(MOTOR REVVING)
Oh!
Oh. (GROANING)
(♪♪♪)
(SIGHS)
So true.
So, um... how do you guys know each other?
- (SCREAMING)
- Oh!
Oh, oh...
Oh, my God, oh...
Thanks for letting me stay at your house.
Oh, and sorry!
I thought it was a real toilet!
(SCREAMING)
(CLARENCE ASHE'S "SHE SAID I'LL BE A FAILURE" PLAYING)
Hey!

That's mine!
Leave me alone!

(INTERCOM RINGING)
Hello?
Uh... surprise!
It's your brother!
No, sir, you got the wrong apartment.
Uh...
Sara!
Sara!
(BEEPING)
- (INTERCOM RINGS)
- Yes?
Sara?
Who's this?
It's me, your brother.
Maximo?
Yeah.
The one and only.
(DISH CLATTERS)
Open the door, will you?
- Sara?
- (INTERCOM HANGS UP)
Sara?
Open...
Is this for real?
You show up today, as if it were nothing?
After you didn't even bother coming to see our dying mother, when that avocado tree fell on her.
You didn't come to see my child when he was born.
What made you think I'd have any desire to see you?
You can't just show up like this.
I'm not opening the door for you!
- I'm not- - (KNOCK ON DOORS)
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
(LAUGHING) Hey, Sara!
Sarita!
- I can't believe this.
- Me neither!
You're happy to see me, right?
No!
What are you doing here?
Nothing!
I wanted to see you and my niece.
- Nephew!
- That!
Niece, no?
Nephew?
Niece?
What did I say?
Nephew?
Nephew.
That's it, nephew.
Tell me what you want and then beat it!
Peggy kicked me out.
She took everything.
Everything!
But wasn't everything hers to begin with?
Okay, fine.
She kept everything.
She even kept the car I picked out for her to buy for me to give to her for our anniversary.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know you're angry with me, but... can I stay with you?
Here?
Here in my house?
Yes.
I have nowhere else to stay.
Really?
You have honestly lost your mind!
You're my sister!
- Oh, I'm your sister now?
- You've always been my sister!
- Oh, come on, Maximo!
- What?
I can't believe what comes out of your mouth!
Don't be like this.
Stop it!
One day and that's it.
- Come in.
- Really?
(TUTTING)
Grab your things!
What, you think I'll carry them?
This isn't a hotel!
- Hey, your apartment is nice.
- Thanks.
Like, outside it seemed a little... but it's cool.
Wow.
(GASPS) Oh, my goodness!
It's Hector!
Hugo.
Right.
What did I say?
Hugo, remember I told you I had an ugly, crazy brother who was the champion of farting?
- Yes.
- That's it.
- (LAUGHS) Hey!
How are you?
- Uncle Maximo.
- Hi.
- Look at you!
You must be six years old by now, huh?
(CHUCKLES)
- I just turned 10.
- (STAMMERS) Ten?
I know.
I was kidding.
(CHUCKLES)
Everyone's so serious around here.
It's like, "who died?"
My Dad.
Ah...
Yeah, I was...
I was sorry to hear about that.
Pictures!
Hey, where's my picture?
I don't know.
Those are family photos.
- I'm family.
- Uncle Maximo, we're having chicken and rice.
Want some?
Um, chicken?
Ugh... you know, may- maybe I'll have a lobster roll.
Or maybe you don't eat.
Mmm.
- Mmm.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Why don't you say grace before we start eating?
Hmm, I already started.
Next time.
- This time.
- (GROANS)
Okay, okay.
Oh...
Um...
Dear Lord, even though we're just eating chicken and rice, at least we're all here together.
Well, not all of us because Hector's dad is dead.
Hugo.
His name is Hugo.
Oh, yeah.
Because Hugo is dead.
Hugo is not dead!
- His father...
- Amen.
Amen.
Oh, wait, wait, wait!
Uh...
Lord, before you go.
Please...
Please help me find a...
a new wife with a big heart.
But not necessarily a strong heart.
With a high net worth, and a nice, big house, who doesn't ask me to poke her that often.
(DISHES RATTLE)
- Amen.
- Amen.
Amen?
Hey, you got a girlfriend?
- No.
- Really?
What's wrong with you?
He's 10, Maximo.
Ah.
Late bloomer, huh?
Hugo, I have an idea.
Why don't you tell uncle Max about your science fair project?
And this way, it'll be you talking and not this dummy over here.
Okay.
Sure.
I'm sending a weather balloon with a GoPro camera to the edge of the stratosphere.
Oh, stratosphere.
Wow.
I modified the GoPro camera to send a live video stream back to Earth via FM transmitter.
Wow, transmitter.
Wow.
The balloon's gonna go very high up.
And then, we're gonna see, like, a little part of the Earth.
- Earth.
Wow.
- Yeah.
Now I understand why he doesn't have a girlfriend.
- (SILVERWARE CLATTERS)
- Stop it!
(MAXIMO BLOWING AIR)
Wanna know what I'm doing, uncle Maximo?
No.
- Oops.
- You know...
I'd prefer my own room.
And I'd prefer for you to be normal, but we get what we get.
- Bedtime.
- No, I'm serious.
What about upstairs?
Uh, those are other people's apartments.
Really?
Really.
But, hey, why don't you go knock on their door?
Maybe they'll take you in.
I love you.
- I love you, Mom.
- Sweet dreams!
(SCOFFS)
Well, I guess I'll just tuck myself in!
How you do this?
Oh!
My God.
(SIGHS)
- Uncle Maximo?
- Mmm.
How long were you married?
Twenty-five years.
Good night.
And you didn't have to work that whole time?
Nope.
Nighty-night.
But what did you do for money?
(SIGHS) I didn't need money.
She paid for everything.
Go to sleep.
So, now you have to find a new wife to pay for stuff?
(SIGHS) Yep, that's the plan.
Sweet dreams.
How are you going to do that?
(GRUMBLING)
By getting a good night's sleep.
- Why haven't you ever visited us?
- I've been busy!
Doing what?
You just said you didn't work.
Sara!
- Sara, help!
- (DOOR OPENS)
Sara!
Emergency, Sara!
- Emergency, Sara!
- What's wrong?
I'm armed!
- What?
- MAXIMO:

(YELLING)
I'm trying to go to sleep and the kid won't stop talking!
You were talking, too!
- To tell you to stop talking!
- That's still talking!
You were...
I was trying to tuck in!
- No, no, no!
- Enough!
You almost gave me a heart attack, look.
I thought we were being robbed.
I was being robbed!
Of my beauty sleep.
(GRUNTING) Shut up!
Shh!
Go to sleep!
Both of you!
Yes, Mommy.
And no more talking about not talking!
And no more talking about poking, either.

Poke you!

Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt.
You have a guest.
Uh...
I don't have a guest.
Oh, that?
That's my brother Maximo.
Oh, oh!
Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure is all mine.
- Ah.
Um, you know what?
My doorknob is sticking again.
(CHUCKLES)
- Can you believe it?
- Again?
I know!
It's crazy, right?
Uh...
Can I borrow your tools?
Or...
Oh, no, don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Easy.
Easy-peasy.
I'd love to.
Got a sticky knob.
Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you there, like, in five minutes?
Okay.
You're the best.
Thank you.
It's nothing.
What?
Are you a carpenter or something?
When you're both the man and the woman of the house, you have to be a handyman and do whatever is necessary.
Are you two...?
What are you doing?
(WHISTLING)
What are you implying?
(PANTING)
No!
I just help out when something gets jammed, or there's a problem in his house.
It's an old building!
Go get dressed!
Look at you!
We have to leave in five minutes.
Hugo, get your stuff.
I'll meet you in the car.
Sticky knob.
Look.
That sad man has to spin that sign like a fool, for all to see.
SARA:
At least he has a job.
Which is more than I can say about another man in this car.
Work's for suckers.
Mom!
Uncle Maximo said the "S" word.
- That's not the "S" word.
- What is?
- Can I tell him?
- No!
Shit.
(GASPS)
MAXIMO:
So, you're a big-time architect now.
SARA:
Junior architect.
But I still haven't gotten my own house to design, so I'm not going to be late for work because you take two hours to blow-dry your hair.
- I am trusting you with my car...
- Uh-huh.
I am trusting you with my car, and I am trusting you with my son.
You need to go out there, and find yourself a job.
- Uh-huh.
- You pick me up at 5:00, okay?
Okay, I'll try to remember.
You will remember because I have no other way to get back home.
I said I'd try.
Jeez!
Five o'clock!
Is she always like this?
No, I just think she doesn't like you.
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Wow.
I smell money.
How do you go here?
I have an academic scholarship to cover some of my tuition.
My mom has to pay the rest.
You can drop me off here.
Drop you off?
Are you kidding?
I'll walk you in.
Where do the rich, single moms park?
(CHILDREN CHATTERING)
- Wait, wait, wait.
Wait.
- What?
(♪♪♪)
Friend of yours?
Arden?
No.
I wish.
She doesn't even know I exist.
Why do you say that?
Because she's a girl and she's cute.
And I'm me.
You make a great point.
You are... you.
How old is she?
(LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING)
Oh, she's turning 10 next week.
I heard she's having a big birthday party.
No, no, not the kid.
Her.
Oh, that's Arden's grandmother.
She's perfect.

- I think it's Celeste.
- Name?
- I think it's Celeste.
- Celeste what?
- Celeste Burch.
Is there a Grandpa Burch?
He died last year.
Great.
Great!
That's great news!
He's dead.
And... so very sad.
Life's a gift.
Okay, kid.
Have a great day.
But I thought you wanted to walk me in?
What are you, a baby?
You can walk yourself in.
Go on, then!
I got work to do.
Hey!
(CHUCKLES)
May I help you?
It's me, Maximo!
I'm an old friend of Celeste's.
I feel like we've met before, right?
- I don't think so.
- I think so.
- You're Brian, right?
- Quincy.
Oh!
I knew it started with a "Q" or a "B" or an "S."
Quincy.
That's a great name, Quincy.
I was named after my grandfather's dog.
The legacy lives on.
- Don't touch me.
- Oh, yeah.
And where did you say you met Celeste?
(STAMMERS) At the sports event.
(GASPS) Oh, the polo match?
- Yes, exactly.
- Oh!
(BOTH LAUGHING)
- Oh, the one back in April?

She never went to a polo match back in April.

- Celeste Burch?
She's worth 10 Peggy Von Strausses.
- You ever meet her?
- I have not had the pleasure.
But Millicent was supposed to go to her charity function today at the Pacific Woodruff.
The Pacific Woodruff, today?
Yeah, I mean, go get her.
Be the best 500 bucks you ever spent.
(EXHALES) $500?
Yeah.
That's the cost of the charity event ticket.
Seems like the opposite of charity.
- MILLICENT:
Pizza boy!
- I gotta go.
Duty calls.
One extra-large sausage.
That'll be $17.50.
I'm afraid I don't have any change.
Well, maybe we'll just have to work something out between us.
Mmm... (CHUCKLES) Maybe.
(SIGHS) Five hundred dollars.

Hi.
Uh...
I need to get my car wrapped.
And I need the cash up front.

Are you here about the bike?

- No, bro.
He's not here for your stupid tiny bike.
All right?
He got the thing online, the idiot.
- Oh... yeah.
- We all make mistakes, okay?
You're not perfect.
I misunderstood the dimensions.
Oh, it happens.
Anyway, you thought about what kind of ad
- you wanna wrap your car in?
- Um.
I mean...
This looked a lot bigger on the Internet, because they had a picture with a little boy, so it seemed much bigger.
- Yeah, great.
Great.
- How do you not know the difference between a little boy and a grown man?
He looked older.
He had a little bit of a mustache.
Look at this.
This was in the picture.
It was a boy with a mustache, so I assumed-
Whatever pays the most!
Oh, sorry.
Was that rude?
I'm just
- I-I'm in a rush.
That's all.
I'm in a rush.
- The man's in rush.
- Yes.
Thank you.
Here are the terms.
- Wrap stays on the car for 90 days.
- Yes.
If you take it off before that, you have to pay us the money back.
Not a problem.
Yeah.
- Leave the wrap on the vehicle.
- Yes, I-I will.
Can we start as soon as possible?

I just want to speak to Celeste.
Listen, Menudo.
You think you're the first money-grubbing gigolo to throw himself at my boss?
Maybe not the first, but I'm hoping to be the last.
No.
Not while I'm working for her.
- (SCOFFS)
- She's been through too much, emotionally and surgically, to put up with this.
You can't keep me away.
- No, I can!
I can keep-
- No, you can't.
No.
- Very easily keep you away!
- No, you can't.
I just did!
No
- Well, yes, you did.
So unless you have a written invitation to her home, you're not going anywhere near her.
Hey, there's your clown suit.
All right, and here's your... car, too.
I kept it close by like you asked me, paisano.
I don't speak Spanish.
(PHONE RINGTONE PLAYING)
Hey, bro.
Did you make your move?
I sort of made a move.
Can you talk?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Millicent's just taking a post-coital cool-off.
Tell me you closed her.
Tell me you closed her during the silent auction.
She didn't even see me.
I'm not sure about this one.
She's impossible to get to.
I have no in.
- (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) - (MUSIC PLAYING)
Or maybe I do.
Sound... sounds like you have an idea, but I can't tell, 'cause I can't see your face.
- Describe your face.
- My face?
- Yeah, what's it look like?
- Eh...
Thoughtful, very handsome, with a hint of mischief.
That's the spirit.
Hey, I'm there for you, whatever you need.
Unless it's money, 'cause then I can't do it, 'cause I'm on an allowance.
Great, great, okay.
Listen, find out whatever you can about Celeste.
Interests, passions, hobbies.

Okay.
You know, if you guess the weight of your yogurt, it's on the house.
Five pounds.
That's so off.
- I'll give you one more guess.
- Thirty pounds.
Let's check.
(BEEPS)
(IMITATES BUZZER) Wow, they're 14 ounces.
(SIGHS) I was so close.
That'll be $6.50.
Hey, watch and learn.
Oh, I like your bandages.
Oh, I, um...
I have a lot of rescue cats.
- Really?
- Yeah.
So I'm no stranger to scratches.
I'm always bleeding.
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
Oh, thank you, uh...
- Cindy.
- Wow, Cindy.
What an enchanting name!
Oh, thank you.
If these frozen yogurts are half as sweet as you, we're in for quite a treat.
Wow.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
You said 14 ounces, right?
Thank you... sweet Cindy.
I hope your pussycats realize what a beautiful scratching post they have in you.
Bye.
I am a beautiful scratching post.
See what I did there?
Mmm?
You got us froyo for free?
No, my skills of seduction got us froyo for free.
- Hmm.
- What if I told you
I can teach you how to use your skills of seduction to get what you want?
Argh, I forgot to ask for gummy bears.
Screw the gummy bears!
I'm talking about Arden!
Hey, I can get you invited to her birthday party.
Hmm?
Would you like that?
You can't get me invited to Arden's birthday party.
(SCOFFS) Baby, please.
- It's impossible.
- Somebody asked for gummy bears?
- They're on the house.
- (CHUCKLES)
Thank you, sweet Cindy.
- Sure.
- Thank you.
I have gummy bears coming out of my ears.
Literally.
Not literally, but they are in a surprising amount of places around here. (LAUGHS)
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.
(CHUCKLING)
See?
I can make things happen for you.
Hmm?
(♪♪♪)
When do we start?
We just did.
Okay, lesson number one.
Eye contact.
Follow me.
Follow me.
- Eye contact.
Follow me.
- Okay.
Okay, eye contact is power, Hugo.
Women will lust after you.
Now, it's your turn, okay?
I'm Arden.
Say hello to me.
Okay.
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Hello, Hugo.
I'm Arden.
Hello, Arden.
You broke eye contact.
You broke eye contact!
'Cause you threw a gummy bear at me.
Well, life will throw gummy bears at you.
Okay, do it again.
Stop throwing gummy bears!
Stop breaking eye contact.
Hello, Arden.
Ah...
Not bad.
Good eye contact.
Not bad at all.
You guys are getting real creative with these gummy bears.
Most people just eat them.
Okay, lesson number two.
Women love when men take control, 'cause women have no idea what they want.
"Uh, I'll have the steak, and the lady will have the Cobb salad. "
But what if she doesn't want the Cobb salad?
Listen, a woman would rather eat something you order for her that she doesn't want, rather than something she ordered for herself that she does want.
It doesn't make sense.
Like, at all.
You know what doesn't make sense?
What is that?
Hmm?
You under house arrest or what?
It's a planetary watch.
Some people call it an astronomical watch.
Well, I call it an "I'm gonna die a virgin" watch.
Lose it.
Let's go.
Wait, uncle Maximo, what is a virgin?
It's an airline.
Last lesson of the day.
Your walk.
Your walk says more about you than your mouth ever can.
My walk?
Yes, your walk.
Show me your walk.
Do I just walk?
- Just walk.
Walk like you walk.
- Okay.
Fuck me.
Horseshit.
Sit and watch.
Loose stride.
Sleepy eyes.
Smiling just a little bit, because you know what all the ladies are thinking.
What are the ladies thinking?
"Look at that confidence.
He must be great in bed. "
- I'm great in bed.
- What?
I don't pee or anything anymore.
Come on, mama's boy.
Let's walk.
("SOPA DE CARACOL" PLAYING THROUGHOUT)
My God!
Loose stride.
Sleepy eyes.
What are you doing?
Pretend there is a girl, and you're walking towards her.
- Feel your sexiness.
- I don't feel my sexy.
What is that?
You're walking exactly like the geese.
Let's go.
Don't watch the geese, okay?
A girl pass by.
Turn around, walk backwards.
Sexy, sexy.
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
One more time.
Feel it in your crotch.
- You want everyone to see down here.
- No, I don't.
Look at me.
You're learning from the best.
Okay, one more time.
(INAUDIBLE)
Do you feel sexy right now?
- Yes.
- Great.
Okay, one more time.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Exactly.
There you go.
Much better.
(EXCLAIMS) Oh, shit!
(SONG ENDS)
Okay.
One more time.
SARA:
Gwen!
I wanted to see if you heard back on the Robinson account.
Sara, I was really hoping to avoid you, and then ignore you a bunch
- before you could ask me about this.
- I know, sorry.
I can ask you again tomorrow, as soon as you get out of the car.
No, no, we can't unbreak this egg.
All right.
They loved you.
They thought you were incredible.
But they're gonna go with someone who has...
More experience.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Can I finish?
(CHUCKLES)
- Oh, sorry.
No...
- (LAUGHS)
Yes, yes.
Someone who has more experience.
You finished?
Yeah.
(SIGHS) I just don't know what to do.
I can't get a job because I don't have any experience.
And I can't get experience if I don't get a job.
(HORN HONKS) Hey, Mom!
I'm here.
Five o'clock.
I remembered.
You have nothing to complain about.
I thought you'd be happy.
I got a job.
Turning my car into a stripper-mobile?
It's not a job.
- What's a stripper?
- It's only 90 days.
No, it's not.
You get this trash off my car today!
- Hey...
- Today!
HUGO:
Oh, I know!
Those guys that- no, wait, girls that dance on the poles naked, right?
(♪♪♪)
HUGO:
Icebergs.
They're literally just floating ice on the water.
Water.
Astonishing.
So when it melts, it's like, uh, soda.
- So it's like bubbles...
- Like bubbles, wow.
- ... of carbon dioxide.
- Interesting.
Hugo, where's your watch?
You mean my "die a virgin" watch?
- What did you say?
- (MAXIMO COUGHS)
- "Die a virgin" watch.
- (CHUCKLING) Kids.
Where do they come up with this stuff?
Uncle Maximo told me to take it off.
He's training me to get girls to like me.
- He's training you?
- Yes.
What the hell are you teaching my son?
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It's just silly guy talk.
It wasn't silly.
I've learned how to undress a woman with my eyes.
And how to walk so a woman will know I'm good in bed.
- (GASPS)
- He said women have no idea what they want and you have to tell them what to do.
No.
I...
I...
I never used those words exactly.
Sure you did.
I wrote it all down in this notebook.
- What notebook?
- "Lesson number... "
(CLATTERS)
(MOUTHING) Come on, now.
Look, Hugo needs to focus on his schoolwork.
He has a crush on a girl at school.
I'm trying to help the kid.
You know what it's like to like someone!
Don't you?
Mr. "I need you to grease my door once a week. "
No.
- It's not the same thing.
- 'Course it is!
- And James is just a friend!
- Oh, my God.
You're changing the subject!
No more sugar-mama-catching training!
Hugo already has a mother.
Understood?
Yes, Mommy.
Understood?
I don't speak English.
Don't be an idiot.
Why with a tortilla?
Hey, pull my finger.
Pull it.
- False alarm.
- Yeah.
Are you writing a love letter to Arden?
No, I was just writing to my dad.
Your dad?
You know he'll never get those letters, right?
I know.
It's just a way for me to feel close to him.
Don't you ever think about your dad?
- No.
- Never?
Never.
Do you remember anything about him?
Hmm, I remember he worked a lot.
Oh, and he parked his truck in our house once.
(FARTS) Oh.
There it is.
- (SNORTS)
- Late bloomer.
(SIGHS) I remember a lot about my dad.
He was fun.
I think he'd be happy that you're here, and that you're helping me.
That's what I was just writing him.
(♪♪♪)
Uncle Maximo, can I show you my science project?
(STAMMERS) Uh, in the morning.
- Please.
- (SNORES)
I know that you're really not sleeping.
- (SNORES LOUDER) - (AIR HISSING)
Uncle Maximo, please?
(HISSING STOPS)
- (AIR HISSING)
- Okay, in the morning.
Oh, God... (BREATHING HEAVILY)
It's morning.
Uncle Maximo?
Remember when you told me that I could show you my science fair project in the morning?
Well, here it is.
My weather balloon.
And here is the GoPro camera, which will be attached to the weather balloon, which will go up in space.
- It's cool, right?
- Amazing.
Now will you please get it out of my face, so I can go back to sleep?
Get up, lazy bum!
Time to go get a job!
Here, I circled the ones that I think will be good for your qualifications, like human statue, mattress tester, dog poop picker-upper.
It's Sunday.
What place would even be open?
It's Thursday.
Want me to deflate the balloon?
(SARA, CLAPPING HANDS) Let's go, Hugo!
The science fair is next Sunday.
School is today.
Hey, no, Hugo.
Hey!

This neighborhood isn't that bad.
I was expecting something out of a horror movie.
This is more like something out of an independent movie.
Stop trying to make me feel better.
"Stop trying to make me feel better. "
- Are you teasing me?
- "Are you teasing me?"
Hey!
What are you doing?
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Millicent is fantasizing about this Professor Rojas.
She's got me dressing like him, talking like him.
But I can't do an accent to save my life.
And I can't sleep on an air mattress one more night.
You find any intel on Celeste Burch?
As a matter of fact, I did.
Now before I share this-
I don't think that she's the right mark for you.
Oh, come on!
"Celeste Burch's passions.

Great.
This will help.
Thanks.

- Terrible.

We paid him a lot of money.

It's the guy.

You, stop!

Well, look who it is.
No, no, no.
Where do you think you're going?
- Where you going, man, huh?
- I was just looking for you guys.
- Where are you going?
- I was just looking for you guys.
We clearly said, "Don't take the wrap off!"
Ever!
(STAMMERS) Yes, yes.
I remember.
And I thought you did a great job with the wrapping.
But you see, my sister felt differently.
- Oh.
Oh, oh.
- Oh.
- His sister.
Yeah, I get it.
- It was his sister.
- Women!

You don't have to tell Nick and I about that.
Yeah.

I got both of 'em.

I got 'em.
You just give us our money and we'll be fine.
I spent it.
I spent it.
Well, I sincerely hope that you bought something you really wanted, or needed.
God, you're terrible at this, Nick!
Just think before you talk.
Can you do that?
It's not hard.
I made a mistake.
(STAMMERS)
I'll get you the money, I promise.

Come on, guys.
I mean, it's just $1,000.

You got one week.

Yes.

Yes!
I didn't see that coming.
Nice!

Feel that?
That's two hands.
You want four hands?
That's four hands.

Yeah, there it is!

That's four hands.

Hugo, you can't live your life afraid that something bad will happen,

- Okay.
So, you've gotten her to notice you with your sexy walk, you've intrigued her with a strong eye contact.
Now, it's time to talk to her.
I don't think I can.
(SCOFFS) Relax, Hugo.
I mean, it's not like you've never talked to a girl before.
Yes, it is.
I've never talked to a girl before.
- Really?
- Yeah.
They make me really nervous, and then my nose starts to sweat.
- Your nose sweats?
- Yeah.
- Your... your... your nose?
- Yes.

I can because of Hugo.
Hugo, how?
When my husband died, there were days when I couldn't even breathe.
But, how do you explain to a small child that he has to take care of himself, because his mom wants to lock herself in her room and cry?
You can't.
But I have a trick to cheer me up when I'm very sad.
- Anti-depressants?
- No.
No, look...
I take any sad song, and turn it into a salsa.

I haven't been thinking about it.
Mommy's taking me to get a haircut.
Tell 'em not too short.
You don't have the ears for it.
Why don't you stop talking?
You don't have the mouth for it.
Hugo, come here.
Hey!
I made the wall!

Wow!
What happened?
Huh?
It's been kind of nice having you here.
- Mmm!
- Right?
It's been okay.
- Oh, just okay?

Okay!
It's been very nice having you, uncle Maximo.
Now we're talking.

We're not here for coffee, man!
- What are you talking about?
- Money!
Give us our money.
- When did we care for coffee?
- Give us our money!
- We don't even like that.
- You stole from me!
- Give us our money!
- Get the money!
(STAMMERS) Yeah, money.
I don't exactly have it.
What do you mean, "exactly"?
He means he doesn't have it.
Well, then why not just say that you don't have it?
Why even say the word "exactly" at all?
Hey, I'm gonna pay you.
I promise.
Hey, you got a real nice place here.
By nice place, I mean a total dump.
See, that's what I'm talking about.
People should just say what they mean, that's confusing.
- Guys.

This... this is my sister's place.
Please.
SCOTT:
You know what your problem is?
You don't have any respect for money, man.
Money doesn't grow on trees.
- No, it doesn't.
- Nicky!
It would be cool if it did.
Nicky, please!
I'm just backing up your point.
You could literally rake it up.
- What are you doing?
- Hey, guys.
I totally forgot what I was talking about.
- What if we took stuff of yours, sir?
- Yeah!
Okay, that's a good point.
What if we walked in and just started taking stuff, huh?
- What if I took this thing?
- No, please.
I don't even know what it is.
- No, please.
- Huh?
What about this?
- What if I took this?
- No, no.
No, not that.
No!
That- that- that's my nephew's.
That's important.
- Please.
Yeah.
- Oh, this is important to you?
You probably don't want me to have it, then, huh?
No, please, no.
No, no.
Don't do that, please.
No.
No, don't do that, please.
Okay, okay.
What do you like?
Huh?
Sports cars?
Helicopters?
Rolex watches?
I promise I'm good for the money, and so much more.
I don't need a Rolex, bro.
- You know something?
- What?
- You seem like a very sincere guy.
- I am.
But I don't believe that you can do anything that you say you're gonna do.
So give us our money, and you can have the camera back.
It's that simple.
Please.
Hey!
Please, please, please.

Have a real nice day.
And by that I mean, do not have a real nice day.

It's my birthday party.

Allow me, please.
Uh, excuse me.
The lady and I will have your finest champagne.
She'll have a Sprite, and I'll have a Coke.
Something as refreshing and exciting as she is.

Actually, I'll just have some water.
Thanks.

She'll have a Sprite, like I said.

That's quite the mountain of melon balls.
You know, climbing is one of my greatest passions.
In fact, I'm training for Everest.
Of course... "It's not the mountain we conquer, but ourselves. "

- Oh, once upon a time, but not anymore.
Oh, nonsense.
A beautiful, strong woman like yourself surely has many climbs left in her.
Not this woman, I'm afraid.
(CHUCKLING) Give me one good reason.
- Frostbite.
- Oh, my God.
South face of Everest.
Just thinking about it gives me day tremors.
I hate climbing.
You convinced me.
I hate it, too.
Oh.
What I really love?
Train travel!
So classic.
Wouldn't you agree?

I'm afraid I haven't much fondness for trains.
Now, if you'll excuse me a moment, please.
Chicken!
Chicken!
Chicken!
Chicken!
- Chicken?
- Yes, chicken!
I'm sure you love fried chicken.
Having my limbs torn from my body...
- Okay.
- ... helped me to realize just how barbaric the treatment of chickens is in our culture.
I'm vegetarian.
- Which is why I founded...
- Of course you did.

- Give it to me!
- No.
Maximo!
Sara!
Your father is here.
Papa!
Papa!
Move!
I'm okay...
This is a nightmare.
I know it's horrible living here, but we're still a family.
I don't need a family.
What I need is somewhere to live that isn't an old wreck.
When I grow up, I'm going to be an architect, so I can build a big house for us.
What are you going to do?
- I'm going to sleep.
- No.
What are you going to do for work?
I'm going to be rich, so I don't have to work.
But Papa always said that you get what you work for, not what you wish for.
And look what happened to him!
- It's time to sleep, children.
- [both] We're already asleep.
Look".
This is who I'm going to be.
IT'S TIME TO INDULGE YOURSELF
He didn't get that rich without having a job.
No,no,no.
I don't want his job.
I want hers.
Talk to me, Rafa.
What's on the menu?
Take a look at lounge chair number three.
There's a hot one over there... super rich!
I see her, I see her.
She does look it!
Who is she?
Peggy Von Strauss.
Fifty-five, divorced...
- but she's loaded.
- Yeah?
Her family owns the biggest supermarket chain in the United States.
She's perfect.
Have I ever told you that you remind me of Mr. Rojas?
He was my Spanish professor in college, with whom I had a passionate affair?
Yes, I think you mentioned it once or twice... or every time I see you.
I can't believe this.
After I gave her my best years, after I gave her my youth, after I gave her the best of me!
Of course, now that my boobs have sagged, she finds someone younger than me.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving!
Look, once I cross this threshold, I'm never coming back!
I'm not!
Okay.
I'm not coming back!
It's over!
It's over forever!
But she's going to miss me.
She'll miss my seeds.
Come harvest time, she'll miss my seeds.
It's me, your brother.
Open the door, will you?
Open... ls this for real?
You show up today, as if it were nothing?
After you didn't even bother coming to see our dying mother, when that avocado tree fell on her.
You didn't come to see my child when he was born.
What made you think I'd have any desire to see you?
You can't just show up like this.
I'm not opening the door for you!
I'm not--
Hey, Sara!
Sarita!
- I can't believe this.
- Me neither!
You're happy to see me, right?
No!
What are you doing here?
Nothing!
I wanted to see you and my niece.
- Nephew!
- That!
Niece, no?
Nephew?
Niece?
What did I say?
Nephew?
Nephew.
That's it, nephew.
Tell me what you want and then beat it!
Peggy kicked me out.
She took everything.
Everything!
But wasn't everything hers to begin with?
Okay, fine.
She kept everything.
She even kept the car I picked out for her to buy for me to give to her for our anniversary.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know you're angry with me, but... can I stay with you?
Here?
Here in my house?
Yes.
I have nowhere else to stay.
Really?
You have honestly lost your mind!
You're my sister!
- Oh, I'm your sister now?
- You've always been my sister!
- Oh, come on, Maximo!
- What?
I can't believe what comes out of your mouth!
Don't be like this.
Take that!
One day and that's it.
- Come in.
- Really?
Grab your things!
What, you think I'll carry them?
This isn't a hotel!
- Hey, your apartment is nice.
- Thanks.
Like, outside it seemed a little... but it's cool.
What's wrong?
I'm armed!
I'm armed!
Shut up!
What?
Are you a carpenter or something?
When you're both the man and the woman of the house, you have to be a handyman and do whatever is necessary.
I just help out when something gets jammed, or there's a problem in his house.

I'm rusty.
I don't feel ready to go out with anyone.
When was the last time?
Five years ago.
- I mean, when was the last time you--
- Five years.
Seriously?
That's enough!
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Okay?
Stop laughing-
The bakery has been closed for some time.
Your pastry is going to go stale.
You're such a jerk.
My God, what are you waiting for?
I don't know.

So go, then!

My God, leave my bakery alone.
Don't talk to me about my bakery.
No, but seriously...
I don't know how you've managed to go on, in spite of all your suffering, to keep going, to always move forward.
- Hugo.
- That's why I admire you.
I can because of Hugo.
Hugo, how?
When my husband died, there were days when I couldn't even breathe.
But, how do you explain to a small child that he has to take care of himself, because his morn wants to lock herself in her room and cry?
You can't.
But I have a trick to cheer me up when I'm very sad.
- Anti-depressants?
- No.
No, look...
I take any sad song, and turn it into a salsa.
A sad song?
How about "El Triste"?
Let's go.
You're stepping on me!
Come on.
Let's go! "El Triste"!
- You'll see.
- Come on!
I'm falling asleep, this isn't a salsa.
There we go!
There we go!
You see?
You're not rusty!
All you need to do is relax and have fun, that's all!
Huh?
You honestly don't mind taking him to the party?
No.
It would be the greatest honor of my life.
- Come on!
- Okay.
Send him a text.
Text him!
Text him!
Come on!
Text him, come on!
Do it!
That's my sister!
That's my sister!
Enough!
Behold the glory of God's creation.
Oh, baby!
- Did you dye your hair?
- Yep!
All of it.
I gave myself a little makeover.
Maybe next time they can make over your brain.
I know perfectly well...
I look very good.
Very good.
I love you, stupid face.
I love you too, little sister.
Maximum, minimum.
Beautiful, like your uncle.
Oh, Jesus!
Bad friend!
Coward!
You have no shame!
Sorry, I forgot the code.
ls Hugo here?
Yes, thank God.
Not thanks to you.
Can I speak with him?
No.
Please?
Just let me explain.
How do you explain to a child who opened up his heart to you that you were only using him to seduce the grandmother of the girl he likes?
I can't believe that I was stupid enough to let you humiliate him and hurt him like that!
I'm sorry, okay?
Where is Hugo's camera?
I promise I'll get it back to you.
So, you were the one who stole it.
No, I didn't steal it.
Don't kick me out, look...
Sara, don't kick me out!
We're family!
No.
You're not family.
You're nothing more than a lazy 46 year old freeloader, who doesn't think of anyone but himself.
You didn't just steal his camera!
You stole his hopes.
You stole his dreams.
But it ends now.
You will never use me or Hugo again, understood?
I'm 39.
What?
You said I'm 46, but I'm 39.
- No, you're not.
- Of course I am.
- Hell no!
- Of course I am.
But I'm 42!
- So what?
- You're my older brother!
I don't know what to tell you.
You know what?
I hope you grow up one day.
Okay.
But it won't be in my house.
Okay, I'm 40.
Okay, 41.
We're twins!
Okay?
This is all for you, baby.
Look at me.
Here's Hugo's camera.
If we go now, we can still make the science fair!
The fair was yesterday.
Hugo missed it.
No!
He told me Sunday at 1:00!
Today is Monday.
You're too late.
No, no...
It's never too late...
This time it is.
24 hours late, to be exact.
- Thanks for the camera.
- Sara...
You didn't think I'd be selling frozen yogurt all my life, did you?
Young lady!
Yes, you've been a very bad girl.
- This woman's a lot of work.
- Oh, my God...
Stop it!
You wish!
What's wrong with you?
Come here, come here.
Come here!
Come...
Thank you.
Thank you!
You helped make my dream come true.
You're so talented.
I love you.
I love you.
Don't call him "jugo."

Same thing!
Are you insane?

Hey, it's a place where we can go up to work on our material before we go up at Goldie's.
Well, I do got some new material that could use some trying out.

Well, all men suck, so the least one of you assholes can do is buy me some fries and a Diet Pepsi.
That is the worst jingle for Kotex I ever heard.
Uh, excuse me, can we get an order of, uh, fries and a Diet Pepsi, please?
Thank you.

No matter how close I get to anything,
I'm never gonna touch it.
[laughs]
I told you this is good shit.
- Yeah...
- I gotta take a piss.
Can I just go inside?
Me too.
Hey, man, maybe you don't have to go inside.
[Edgar laughing]
[Bill] I'm no mathematician, but I'm pretty sure my piss is touching Sparky's grave.
[both laugh]
And I don't wanna be a buzzkill, but of all the graves I've pissed on, this has got to be the least satisfying.
- [laughs]
- What the fuck are you doing?
[pants zipping] [grunts]
[Bill] Dad.
Dad, please.
Get the fuck away from me!
[breathing heavily]
[Susan] Dad.
Dad, what are you doing?
You hate me this much?
[Bill] I don't hate you.
Dad, come on.
You're a sad fucking excuse for a son.
Get your stuff.

Previously on I'm Dying Up Here...
How did they not shoot you in 'Nam?
There's nothing but bamboo over there.
What tree could you have possibly fucking hid behind?
I heard Johnny had Rickles on the other night.
That's fresh.
Can't get any more "dog bites man" than that.
This is Sparky.
You didn't think he would come to Hollywood to see his big-shot brother?
He's not my brother.
I can't see the weather girl!
Sparky...
I'm saying, your manager should get you gigs, and that's it.
Shouldn't be trying to fit you into somebody else's box.
It's nice having a comedian as a girlfriend.
You've never called me that before.
Is that what this is?
Gotta love the comedian.
But to be honest, I was kind of hoping for the girlfriend.
You don't think comedy lasts?
We get something better.
We get the moment.
You know, we get the right-fucking-now.
Are you having a good time, ma'am?
Really?
All right.
Tell your face.
Guys, Vietnam's coming to an end.
That means what?
Comedians are coming home... from Canada.
I used to do a lot of handyman work, growing up.
Mostly because my dad was in the business... of breaking shit.
Well, what are you doing in here?
That hooker in the trunk ain't gonna bury herself.
All right, thank you, folks.
You've been a... slightly above average crowd.
I've been watching these Watergate hearings.
I can't help thinking how much better a president you'd have made than Tricky Dick.
Ha-ha.
I feel like a pig at a trough with all the material he's providing.
That's hell in a handbasket.
Mitch, you got a light?
Howard.
Wow, good to see you.
How are you?
Enjoying the Roman orgy of comedy that is our presidency.
Glad you stopped by to say hello.
Howard's gonna be on the show this week.
Wonderful.
Well.
Thrilled to have you back.
Better lock the door.
Ed's in the building.
Shit, uh, Mitch, can I talk to you for a sec?
Sorry, Howard, I'll have him back to you in a jiff.
It's about his drinking at work.
Ah.
Jesus, Mitch, Howard Leetch?
Last week it was Foster Brooks and Nipsey Russell.
What are we now, a fucking Dean Martin roast?
Why don't you tell that to Pepto-Bismol and Rice Krispies?
Screw the sponsors.
We're known for discovering comics, not reminding the audience which ones are still alive.
I don't care if that kid stepped in front of a Boeing 747.
Get the young guys back.
What about Disneyland?
What about-- what about Disneyland?
Didn't you ever want to meet Mickey?
I want to meet Mickey.
Hey, remember that girl who lost her mouse ears on that people-mover thingy?
She jumped on the tracks to get them and missed her car and ran out an exit.
She fell 30 feet, had to be in a body brace.
She had a pin put in her leg.
Eat up.
We gotta meet the mattress guy in an hour.
Would you jump 30 feet for ears?
I have jumped a lot farther for a lot less.
You know in Detroit, the pipes can handle a man's business.
I don't even own a plunger.
Yeah, it's obviously some sort of LA plumbing defect.
It's got nothing to do with the litter of piglets you just tried to flush, Pop.
Yeah.
Whatever you say, Billy.
You know, I was watching Looney Tunes the other day.
You know, Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny, and the boys.
And they had this cartoon about black people called
"Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat."
And I thought, boogie beat?
Finally.
A cartoon about my people with some soul.
But this shit was about a bunch of black people living in a place called Lazy Town.
Now, first of all, my people built this country for free from 1619 till about mm...yesterday.
So if anybody earned the right to take it easy, it's us.
I got so mad 'cause I was like, what?
Another racist depiction reinforcing the stereotype that all black people are lazy.
Now, I would have turned that shit off if my set wasn't halfway across the room.
But in my defense, I did have my La-Z-Boy recliner set all the way back to righteous-indignation setting.
So I was comfortable and making a statement.
You look like shit.
I see somebody's been working on their people skills while I was away.
I hear you been doing the Playboy circuit.
How's that?
Distracting.
You, uh, talk to the fellas?
Not yet.
Sorry to hear about Clay.
Good guy.
Such is life, right?
What can I do for you, Nick?
I got The Tonight Show.
Really?
I go up Wednesday.
How'd you pull that off?
Last week, working the Playboy Club in New Orleans.
One of Mitch's scouts from The Tonight Show's fucking a Bunny there, saw my act, and I landed in LA this morning.
Grandkids gonna love that story.
It's a lot more eyes on you, Nick.
Been a good boy for two years, so...
That's good to hear.
So how are you on fifth chances?
How are you on other options?
If I had a hat, it'd be in my hand.
I need to go up.
Wednesday's coming up fast.
Can't get any further west than this.
You fuck up here, you'll be performing balls-deep in seawater.
When you want to go up?
Tonight?
Be a nice perk if I could bump Bill.
You are lucky you're a funny fuck.
Arnie!
Just remember who your friends are.
Yeah, I used to wrestle in high school, but as soon as I'd come, I'd quit.
Alex, how are you?
Was the kitchen on fire?
Good to see you, kid.
Whoa, Jesus, not this asshole.
Ladies and gentlemen, we got a special treat for you tonight.
Mr. Nick Beverly.
Nick Beverly, give it up!
Come on!
Let him hear it!
Thomas Fitzgerald, everyone.
Let's keep it going for Fitzy, huh?
This is Fitzy's home club.
It's also his actual home.
So if you're feeling generous, leave a jacket behind.
He'll use it for a blanket right here in about an hour.
You got to be fucking kidding me.
How are ya?
- Who is that guy?
- Looking good.
Depends on the night.
Been thinking about social issues a lot lately.
Lot of injustice out there, you know?
Talking to a black friend of mine the other day.
The whole time, I kept thinking, this guy's dick's probably bigger than mine.
Just not fair.
That got me all philosophical, you know?
I-I came to a conclusion that if every man in the world had the same size cock, there'd be no more racism.
That would be it.
Can we agree on a size?
Can we put it to a vote?
Show of hands here?
Five inches, six inches?
Can I get a seven?
This guy's holding out.
What do you want, 15?
Come on.
I love, though, that you women want to have bigger cocks in your life.
Love it.
But why?
Why, when you don't use the cocks you have access to now?
Seriously, you know if you got a bigger cock in your life, you would stop using it in a week.
It's like that exercise bike you insisted on that sits in the corner of your bedroom with a bunch of dirty clothes hanging on it.
Baby, you want to see eight inches?
You come backstage and see me twice.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
I'm doing Carson this week.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wednesday night.
So I got to work on a couple jokes that don't have you know, dick and cock in 'em.
I got two so far so I hope you enjoy 'em.
- All right.
- So dickhead over here is at the bar with two cops, right?
- Mm-hmm.
- And-and, uh, he starts pointing at me.
Look, a bank had just been held up.
There's red pubic hair all over the crime scene.
It seems fairly obvious you're the prime suspect.
Signature move.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Pubes are everywhere.
Fuck you.
So one of the cops grabs Nick, slams him against the bar, and cuffs him, right?
So I stumble over, I'm all shitfaced.
I throw my arm around him and I'm like, what the fuck is going on?
Can you just cut to the part where you guys get locked up and start blowing guys for cigarettes?
Come on.
This isn't about the Mexican day-care system, okay, Edgar?
Ooh.
He knows your childhood.
So, turns out Nick had said some not-so-nice words to the cop.
Tell 'em what you said.
Oh, that was a long time ago.
Well, they haul-so they haul us in, and then-then we have to, uh, spend the night in...
Protective custody.
Yeah.
Wow.
White people have the best jail stories.
That's some bullshit right there.
If y'all were black, the story would have ended up of how the cops had to explain how you hung yourself with your own shoelaces.
Yeah, but, what I want to know, Nick, is where you've been the last three years.
I mean, besides being on the T-and-A circuit.
Yeah.
Where haven't I been?
Probably blowing a bunch of guys.
Fuck, Edgar.
Little one-note with the blowjob jokes, right?
I'm sorry, it's just like a song that gets stuck in your head.
Come on, let him talk.
I want to know.
All right.
Yeah, Nick, where you been?
Let's see, uh...
- Did a lot of drugs.
- Mm-hmm.
- As you all know.
- Yes, we do.
Uh, lot of drinking.
Banged my fair share of Bunnies.
Found Jesus.
Lost him again.
Easy to lose.
Entertained everything from running for office to holding up a bank.
Worked blue collar, white collar, you name it.
And in the end, the only thing that made me not want to hook a hose to my exhaust pipe was being a fuckin' comic.
So I did the one thing that no comic's ever done.
Pick up a check?
I got my shit together.
I was sort of hoping it was gonna be pick up the check because I had a waffle and I only have a dollar.
Fuck, Edgar.
That's a great story, Kerouac.
Thank you.
But let's ask the real question.
How the fuck did you get Carson?
Not gonna like the answer, Bill.
Can't dislike it any more than I do the question.
Well, Bill, it turns out that unlike you,
I'm really fucking funny.
One!
Two!
Three!
He's out!
Thank you.
Uh, next song is about love.
I had the tuna.
Oh.
Right.
Tuna for the young Ingrid Bergman.
Ingrid Bergman was a whore.
That she slept with that Guinea director, a real piece of work.
Okay.
Can I get you guys anything else?
Some pickles would be lovely, dear.
Pickles, sure thing.
Hey, Gracja, have you ever considered expanding the deli's entertainment to include actual entertainment?
That not entertainment.
Sister.
Well, you know, I was thinking an open mic for comics might work here.
A lot of places are doing it.
You already have the space.
Might bring in a few extra customers.
And comedy is very hot right now.
If I do it, will you stop talking jokes to the customers?
If I'm not on stage, it'll be nothing but soup of the day from here on out.
Okay.
I try.
But not paying anybody.
You sure you never ran a comedy club before?
Okay.
Yes?
Hey, I'm, uh, Adam Proteau.
Barton Royce sent me.
You're early.
Yeah, well, I hitchhiked, so it's kind of hard to be accurate.
It's not a zoo, Adam.
We thrive on discretion.
Yeah, I can see that.
Ours.
Not theirs.
So I don't think I caught your name.
Sonja.
So, this is your room when we don't need it.
Hey, so them girls out there, they--they prostitutes?
Models.
Barton didn't fill you in?
Roof over my head, $25 a week, and handyman work, that's about it.
We run an exclusive modeling agency that caters to a very high-end clientele.
Since when did models blow guys by swimming pools?
Since always.
Can't believe Barton didn't say nothing about this place being a whorehouse.
We like to think of ourselves as courtesans, here to entertain members of nobility.
You get a lot of nobility up in here?
That model blowing the guy by the pool?
She gets $1,000 an hour for her services.
That fucking noble enough for you?
Your work clothes.
Don't be seen without them on.
You gotta be shittin' me.
You're telling us we gotta risk our lives just because somebody might need help.
What time is your family getting back?
Dad took the dog to the vet.
Susie went with him to take pictures of what's left of the Hollywood sign.
What's the matter with him?
Dad?
Well, judging by the stool sample he provided the other day--
Sparky.
Who the fuck knows?
He's old.
Dog's a fucking asshole anyway.
"Dog's a fucking asshole."
You did not just say that.
You don't know Sparky like I do.
The total dick.
Fuck, he's a dog, Bill.
Sparky's not just a dog.
He's the son my father never had.
Seriously.
My dad would come home from work and us kids and my mom would be there and he wouldn't say one word.
He'd pick up that dog and he would hug it and kiss it.
Not like we gave a fuck.
Hey, you want to go to Canter's?
Come on, your treat.
Why?
We have a full box of Lucky Charms just waiting in my cabinet.
Come on, the guys'll probably be there.
It'll be good to get out of the house.
"The guys"?
Like Eddie or Nick?
Or Sully and Ralph.
Yeah.
What?
What?
You really gonna play stupid?
Come on, Cass.
You went all Pavlov's pussy the other night at Canter's every time Nick opened his mouth.
- Jesus, Bill.
- Am I wrong?
Why do you have to be such an asshole?
You hung on his every word.
The guy's fucking Clay without the tread marks.
Cass, come on.
I didn't mean it.
Stay.
Can't you ever try to be just a little bit better than you were the day before, ever?
Just this much?
Once?
All right.
I'm fucking sorry!
So you want us to leave this deli to go to another deli?
- It's an open mic.
- And it's gonna stay that way.
Wait, what is this place again?
Donimirski's, it's a Polish deli in the Valley.
And you gotta order something to go up.
So make sure you bring money.
Wait, I gotta pay them to go up?
I admit, it's not exactly ideal, okay?
Do I get an extra five minutes if I order, like, a side or some shit?
- Yeah.
- Hey, do they deliver?
'Cause I'll be anywhere except that fuckin' deli.
Okay, I don't understand.
we played strip clubs in Boston.
Because we got paid and we were surrounded by naked women, not old people eating while God points to his watch.
Hey, it's a place where we can go up to work on our material before we go up at Goldie's.
Well, I do got some new material that could use some trying out.
Sort of like a new direction.
You think they'd be cool with it?
Trust me, after a month of Bob Dylan's Polish aunt, short of you playing soccer with a puppy, they're game.
Well, all men suck, so the least one of you assholes can do is buy me some fries and a Diet Pepsi.
That is the worst jingle for Kotex I ever heard.
Uh, excuse me, can we get an order of, uh, fries and a Diet Pepsi, please?
Thank you.
I'll pay you back on Friday.
I know how you can pay Eddie back right now.
He's looking for comics for his new open mic at Donimirski's.
Is that a new club?
No-no-no-no-no, it's not a club.
- It's a deli.
- Mm-hmm.
Like a deli deli?
I'm waiting tables at a deli in the Valley and they got stage space so I just thought, you know, what the hell?
It's...
Hey, if there's a mic, an audience, and a plate of pierogies, I'm in.
Wait, but what about Goldie's rule of us playing at other clubs?
It's not a club.
It's a deli.
Jinx, you owe me a bag of coke.
My man from another land!
Oh, they...feed you Hollywood types well, huh?
Well, I see you still ugly as a motherfucker.
How 'bout that?
Come on, let's go to the car.
Mm.
Oh, man.
There's some white women here in LA...
- God damn.
- Oh, yeah.
Like that?
God damn!
No wonder most of us is in the halfway house 'cause you fuckin' took the rest of it.
Oh, look, that's how you know you made it.
Black ass on a white couch, huh.
You mind if I?
Nah.
- You wanna hit?
- Nah, I'm good.
Well, there's better than good.
You know what?
Other than in the case of a drink here and there,
I don't trust the stuff.
I'm clean.
I buy that.
Think it's really fucked up.
But I buy that.
Mm.
You build that?
This?
Yeah.
Took me a couple of months.
But I am almost done.
Little varnish...
Oh.
So what are you doing, man?
I'm a security guard.
That's cool.
Nigga, no it ain't.
It definitely ain't.
That shit sound terrible.
I'm going to night school.
Oh, good.
Good.
Mm-hmm.
Refrigerator repair.
That shit sound steady.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
Hey, what happened to that, uh, girl you were seeing, uh, Lorraine?
Oh, she gone.
Yeah.
Man, look at you, man.
Hollywood Ralph, boy, look at that.
It's a long way from 'Nam, ain't it?
Not long enough.
You ever, you know, think about the shit we did?
Why would I?
Oh, 'cause you can't not?
Crazy fuckin' times.
Yeah.
Mm.
- Yeah, give me that.
- Yeah.
That's what I thought.
I was recently performing comedy in Playboy Clubs across America.
Yeah, Playboy and America.
And what amazed me most was the amount of women who want to be Playboy Bunnies.
Yeah.
I had no idea that there were that many shitty fathers out there.
Seriously.
Playboy Bunnies don't just happen, people.
All right, they're not born into the wild.
A lot of serious parental neglect goes into the making of a good Bunny.
Dads, we got any dads in here?
You show up sober for one birthday party?
You're sending her down the slippery slope of a higher education.
I promise you that...
Hey, you seen Cassie?
No.
Hey, he can't do any of this on Carson.
His first five minutes were Carson.
This is actual humor.
Billy.
I think we're gonna get going.
What?
I'm going up.
Dad's worried about Sparky.
Sparky's fine, Dad.
He's been alone too long, and unless you want dog piss all over the place...
I'm up next.
Fifteen minutes.
We'll be home within the hour.
And rats?
All right.
And turn it into a shittier diamond.
I'm not married.
I am looking, though.
Relationships are hard.
What do you think?
You know?
Really.
I feel like animals have it the best.
Two dogs meet.
A sniff here, sniff there.
They get to have sex, and then it's right back to chasing squirrels.
No one's mad that no one called.
You know, there's no guilt trip.
- You never get one of those...
- Spike?
Yeah, it's Fluffy.
Fluffy, white terrier, remember?
You were off your leash, I was in heat?
You said my bark was infectious.
Uh, Fluffy, ye-uh-yeah,
- I was-I was gonna call.
- I was just gonna just gonna call.
Don't, Spike, don't.
You demean us both when you lie, okay?
Fluffy, just let me come over.
We can just...talk.
"Just talk."
You think I was born yesterday?
I'm two for Chrissake.
Fluffy, why-why-why does it have to be like this?
You're not hearing me, Spike.
You're not hearing me, okay?
If we're out, and I feel your wet snout rub across my deliciously beautiful tight, puckered anus...
I will take that as an act of aggression and I swear, I will rip that tube of lipstick you call a cock right out of its socket!
True.
Well, thank you.
Uh, you been a great audience, slightly on the older side, so I appreciate you coming out so late, seeing how it's nine o'clock and a lot of you have to get up for breakfast in about an hour.
Uh--uh-huh.
We are out of the beef barley soup.
86 beef barley.
Okay.
Our next comic is a very funny guy,
Adam Proteau, he will be up here shortly.
Thanks.
Hey, you sure that anything goes here?
'Cause all of my stuff is still pretty raw.
Well, that's what places like this are for.
Okay.
It looks like a George Romero movie in here.
Give it up for Eddie Zeidel, ladies and gentlemen...
Hey, this is how you get better, okay?
Expand your audience.
Play in rooms you're not supposed to be in.
Yeah, I mean, I definitely agree about the "I'm not supposed to be in here" part.
Um, my name's Adam...
Man, I'm sorry, I...
Well, tonight I want to talk to y'all about fucking.
Oh, God.
But you--y'all- y'all still fucking, right?
Melvin, get your black ass out here.
Coming, man.
This is what you wearing?
What, something wrong?
Man, the war is over, man.
Why you holding onto this?
This shit is beat.
Oh.
You know, when I was there, all I could think about was here.
And now I'm here, all I think about is there.
Man, you...
That's your problem.
You stuck.
You think a cop wears his uniform when he's off-duty?
Hell no.
You off-duty.
Now, give me that.
Give you what?
That jacket.
Look, my weight has fluctuated over the years so I'm sure I got something in my closet that'll fit you.
Now, give me this.
No, man.
Give me that jacket, man.
Ha, all right.
There he is.
Now, you hold on, let me get you some fly shit.
You raised by degenerate gamblers?
No, salt of the Earth, the pair of them.
Just didn't take.
Goldie tells me that Johnny's had a change of heart.
You bringing the kids back up.
Oh, yeah, I had to put my foot down with Johnny.
I told him flat out, either you bring those kids back or you don't 'cause it's your show.
I only work here.
A call would have been nice.
Pardon?
You know, a phone call?
Save you a schlep to New Orleans to find a fuckin' kid.
You are like a dog with a bone, did you know that?
I told you,
I had a guy who happened to be in New Orleans and saw him.
He's gonna be playing your club all month long.
We all win.
You're just lucky you suck so bad at cards, that's all I'm saying, Mitch.
Oh, ho, well.
I love you, too.
You know who you got to get in your club?
Is Riggs and King.
My God, did you see those numbers?
50 million people.
50 million people.
For tennis.
Can you imagine what those numbers would be for something that was actually interesting?
Well, networks are paying attention.
They want to capitalize.
Everybody is looking for things
Jane can do as well as Tarzan.
And what about comedy?
I could put together a group of women, make them pee their pants faster than bad Nielsen ratings.
Okay.
Who?
Diller?
Rivers?
We've seen the usual suspects.
I'm talking up-and-comers.
I got girls got bigger laughs in my place than you in a swimsuit.
Hey, you could call your special,
"Girls Are Funny Too."
Oh.
Eh, but only because
"Men Are Sexist Fucking Pricks"
wouldn't get past the censors.
Oh, I got the girls.
You just wouldn't dare put them on.
- I don't know.
- Mm-hmm.
All right, let me guess.
Brother and sister?
Oh. 53 years.
All right, that's disgusting.
That should be illegal.
How long did you date before you got married?
We didn't date.
He courted me.
"Courted." Oh, I love that.
I haven't been courted since I let Gary Dorfheimer get to second base in a McDonald's parking lot.
So what do you think, is there any hope for me, even though
I'm, you know, giving out free milk at McDonald's?
You just need to meet the right one.
You know, that's what everybody says.
You'll find the right one.
Well, how am I supposed to recognize that needle in the haystack?
The needle finds you.
I was going after his brother.
What a floozy!
What made you switch?
He hears me.
Oh, so, he's a good listener?
Anyone can listen.
Very few hear.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Don't rub it in, bitch.
You come up with that on the spot?
Well...
Sparky?
- Sometimes.
- Here, boy!
Really fun tonight, Bill.
Thanks.
I haven't seen Dad laugh like that since...
Mmm, Hiroshima?
You're terrible.
- Well, it's true.
- No!
No!
No!
Oh, God.
He's barely breathing.
Call an ambulance.
I don't--I don't think they come for dogs, Dad.
Then just bring the fucking car around!
You know, I really liked your idea last night.
Hm?
The women in comedy thing.
The only time Johnny opens doors for women is in restaurants.
Nah-nah-nah-nah, screw The Tonight Show.
CBS would be all over this.
Come on, Maude, The Mary Tyler Moore Show.
Well, there's nothing like a dame.
Why don't you put together a proposal, you know, see who you think makes the grade, female-comic wise?
And we'll take it out.
Together.
Run it up Freddie Silverman's pole, see if he salutes?
Why not?
Would it make me a producer?
It would make us producers.
I'm gonna do something for you
I haven't done for a man in 20 years.
Oh, yeah?
Mm, what's that?
Make you breakfast.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, fuck.
Oh, oh.
Oh, you gotta be shitting me right now.
Oh!
Hey.
It's eight in the morning.
You still got people going at it?
You see a time clock?
We're more of a "when the mood hits you" business.
You know how to work a washing machine?
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess, why?
Maid's sick.
Sheets need to be changed.
Are you seriously asking me to wash a whole bunch of whores' comed-on bed linens?
Use it as motivation.
Who knows?
Maybe one day you'll be successful and someone will be cleaning your comed-on sheets.
I'm just saying it's not cool, man, all right?
You--you just walked out on me last night.
I wanted to perform at your deli, I swear, but this opportunity came up to shove an eight-foot cactus up my ass and--I mean, you see my dilemma here.
You're such a dick.
I mean, even Cassie gets it.
She was so good last night.
Aw.
People really respond to her.
Is it just me, or did your dick move when you said that?
Oh, I--I think it did.
Yeah.
Come on, man.
Just give it a shot.
- Dude, I...
- Once.
Come on.
Come on.
What do you got to lose?
Come on.
All right, all right, fine, fine.
- Just do me one favor.
- Sure.
Move like four feet that way.
You smell like a salami farted.
Sorry.
He just buried him in my backyard.
He didn't even ask.
He just dug it.
Now I got a big dirt speed bump on the way to my hibachi.
Yeah, well, it's not like he could bring a dead dog back to Michigan, that's--
He's not going back.
Never going back.
If he does, how's he gonna put fresh flowers every week on Sparky's grave?
It's like fucking Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn.
Hey, Bill, your dad is grieving.
Why don't you cut him some slack?
What?
Why doesn't somebody cut me some slack?
I'm the guy with the tomb of the unknown terrier in his backyard.
Okay.
Where you going?
I got a singing telegram gig.
Should I meet you at your place later?
Yeah, I'm pretty tired, I think I'm just gonna do the gig and crash, but, uh, I'll call you tomorrow.
Hey.
I'm sorry about what I said about Clay.
That's not cool.
Yeah.
No, I know you're sorry, Bill.
Hey, Goofus, where's Gallant?
Hosting an open mic at a Polish deli in the Valley.
A deli?
Like, where old people eat?
Yeah.
Why is it so gross for them?
Like, old people are cute when they're shoving five bucks in your birthday card, but you ever watch them eat?
I know, it's like swallow, then talk.
Who would perform at a deli?
Cassie.
And me, apparently.
Cassie's going up at a deli, huh?
Yeah, at Donimirski's in the Valley.
Eddie set up this open mic thing.
She's going up tonight.
Bill, uh, this my buddy, Melvin.
We were in 'Nam together.
Oh, hey.
Bill.
Good to meet ya.
I never met one of Ralph's 'Nam buddies before.
Probably 'cause there ain't a lot of us left.
Uh, Melvin, this is Edgar.
Edgar, Melvin and I served together.
Oh, really?
What restaurant?
Just fucking with you, dude.
You might want to show a little respect.
Man was decorated.
Man was a Sergeant.
Uh, it's cool, brother.
It's cool.
Uh, this is what we do.
It's what we do, we fuck with each other.
It's--it's no disrespect.
Yeah.
Sorry.
It--maybe I just need a drink.
You know what?
Let's get you a drink.
Let's all get a drink.
Come on.
Hey, Raquel Welch, let's get some, uh, get some drinks over here.
- Do you like mine?
- Mm-hmm.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Um, hey, sorry, uh, hey, man, I just wanted to say how great your shit is.
And--and--and good luck on The Tonight Show.
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.
I should get back to work.
Ah...
I shouldn't--I'm sorry, I wasn't... trying to...
You could fuck her.
Yeah, I-I don't--I don't really get those hot chicks.
I get the--the chicks who look more like when the Three Stooges dress up as--as women.
You know?
That's a funny joke, man.
Thanks.
- Thanks.
- You're a comic, right?
Yeah.
In theory.
Then you're in.
Look, all funny guys are damaged.
And for some reason, women, thank God, find that sexy.
And that is their damage.
Right.
Right on.
What's your name?
Ron.
Ron Shack.
Ron Shack.
What time you going up, Ron Shack?
Uh, watch won't work.
You'll have to use a calendar.
I-I-I just do the open mic.
Oh, that's it, huh?
Mondays?
Pretty much, yeah.
Just--it's not a lot of, you know, not lot of options.
I remember when I was first starting out, it was pretty much here and old folks' homes.
I think that's still the case.
Um, anyway, I'll--I'll--I'll leave you alone.
But, uh, good luck with everything, man, seriously--
Hey--hey--hey, hold on.
I got a place you can go up right now.
What do you do?
How else do you handle what's going on in the world today?
War, riots, economy?
My mom's dead from smoking.
My dad's dead from trying to pay for her to live.
Alcohol's the only family I had left.
Or at least it was still talking to me.
I just wish I was with people who understood what I was talking about.
What the hell are we doing here?
Said you wanted an audience.
I'm not an alcoholic.
- Yeah, don't open with that.
- Op--what?
Hey, everyone, uh, this is my friend, Ron.
His first time here so he's a little bit nervous.
What the hell are you doing?
Get up there, say your name, you're an alcoholic, and let 'em have it.
I don't really know you, but I think I might hate you.
Use that.
Hi, my name is Ron.
Hi, Ron.
And I'm an alcoholic.
Oh.
Nice.
You clap before I even start.
That's awesome.
I can't hear you!
All right.
That's what I like to hear.
Okay, this next comic, he's a writer on The Sonny and Cher Show.
Huh?
Not bad.
And-and, very talented, a walking argument against "black is beautiful."
Please, give him a big hand,
Ralph Carnegie, hey!
Holy shit, man.
I still gotta go up.
To Ralph.
- To Ralph, come on.
- To Ralph.
Yeah, okay.
This might come as a surprise to you, but I was not a fan of the Civil Rights Act.
We loved having our own bathroom.
Finally, we have a place where we know for a fact no white people would go ever.
The horrors that they must've thought was going on in there when all it really was was...
Now, we love that bathroom, but why did the black drinking fountain have to be so shitty?
Just have two identical quality fountains.
One white, one black--
Tell 'em about the gook that couldn't fly.
Ha, that's-- is that you, Melvin?
It's--it's my boy, Melvin, we in town, we just having a few.
Tell 'em.
Ha-ha, I'm--I'm a--
Come on, Ralph.
Tell 'em, man.
You know, I'm-
- I'm working up here, Melvin.
This is--
Then what the hell you invite me here for, man?
I wanna hear some motherfucking jokes!
I'm telling jokes if you just give me an opportunity, Melvin.
- I got a joke.
- I'm-I'm sure you do, but this is my time, right now, Melvin.
Ralph and I served together in Vietnam.
And we was in this Huey.
And we had lost half our patrol.
And we--we had these two, uh, two--two gooks, these two gooks, these Vietnamese soldiers...
Oh, oh, so sorry.
Uh, prisoners slope motherfuckers, and and they was just sitting there.
And one of them just pulls out a cigarette.
And lights it.
That's enough, Melvin.
Now, now, ten minutes earlier, this motherfucker put a bullet in our Master Sergeant's head, but but now, he just sitting there, just--just puffing away.
Okay, Bill.
Now, Ralph...
Bill!
Get this motherfucker!
That didn't sit too well for--with--with Ralph.
- Come on, man.
- Get off me!
Edgar!
Fuck is everybody...
Now, Ralph, he he grabbed that motherfucker and he showed him how the door worked, at 1,000 feet!
Can you imagine that?
Can any of you motherfuckers imagine that shit?
And you remember what you said, Ralph?
You said,
"Those gook motherfuckers can fight.
But they sure as shit can't fly!"
You remember that, Ralph?
'Cause I remember that shit!
I sure do.
Come on, where are you, Ralph?
- Do you know what you...
- Where are you?
...just fucking did in there?
My life's the truth, man.
I live the truth every day.
You just hiding in plain sight out there.
The--you think you the only motherfucker with truth?
That's my truth!
You were there.
And now I'm here!
I ain't there no more!
You hear me?
I ain't there no more.
Why aren't you?
Why am I the only one?
There's no man left behind, right?
Yeah, I mean--I mean it's no wonder I became an alcoholic.
I mean, when I breast-fed, my mother was so hammered, her milk was 12 percent alcohol by volume.
When my old man would run out of beer, he'd just push me out of the way and start sucking.
That's a habit that kept up after the milk dried up too.
Gosh, I gotta say, this has been so eye-opening being here tonight with my fellow alchies.
I just feel really close to all you guys.
You know, wouldn't it be great if we could all just fall off the wagon together, for one night, go get a beer?
Guess that was a joke.
Anyway, that's my time.
You guys have been great.
Thank you.
You really think he threw that guy from the helicopter?
No.
Ralph's a fucking teddy bear.
His friend's fucked up.
Lot of those guys have chips.
War crime's a hell of a punch line though, huh?
Mm.
It's Ralph's business.
We should probably shut the fuck up about it.
Ralph would never throw somebody out of a helicopter unless, you know, there were, like, snacks involved.
Hey, hey where's the pride of Wink tonight?
She had a day job.
Then she said she was gonna go home and relax.
Mm.
She actually is doing a open mic in Woodland Hills.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Eddie started a open mic in a Polish deli.
People have been going up there, and I guess he suckered Cassie in.
Let's go.
You're up.
Fluff-and-fold is closed.
Clean your own jizz sheets.
Now.
Come on, baby!
Do your job!
Come on!
I'm not leaving till I come!
This member needs to be escorted out.
Escorted?
You don't escort no 200-pound angry-ass drunk out.
Where's your bouncer?
We don't have bouncers.
We're an exclusive modeling...
- ...agency.
- Agency?
Jesus, Sonja, we passed three blowjobs on the way here.
Okay, the jig is up.
Just get him out.
I said I'm not leaving till I come!
Given the... nature of your business, it's not too much to ask.
Fine.
Have at it.
Fuck.
Look.
I know you come here to have a good time, but right now you got enough scotch in your system to where you won't even remember shit, all right?
You have any fucking idea who I am?
Yeah.
You're Sam Doak.
Big time agent in CMA.
And I'm Adam Proteau, a struggling comic.
We--we met after one of my sets at Goldie's.
So you know who I...
Yeah.
Yeah, I know who you are.
And now everybody else here does too.
Look, you come here to not be seen so won't make too much sense to make one.
You dig?
Will you give me my trousers, please?
Yeah.
All right, ladies, back to your... modeling.
I'm seeing a lot of young faces here tonight.
Uh, personally, I-I can't wait to get old.
I-I been that way since I was little too.
Most kids, you know, they can't wait to turn 18 so they can drink or drive or...
have sex.
Not me.
No, I wanted to be 80.
You know, I wanted nothing more than to sit on my front porch fly undone admiring a box of balls that kids hit into my yard that I wasn't planning on giving back.
You know?
So, uh, anyway, 80 is--
Hey, can somebody tell us what the specials are?
If you just wait a sec, your waitress will help you.
You're a waitress here, aren't you?
You're sure as fuck not a comedian.
Hey, Bill, don't do this.
Do what?
Do everyone a favor by interrupting so they don't have to endure whatever the fuck this is supposed to be?
That was a good one.
I'm sorry, folks.
This is Bill Hobbs.
You might know him from... actually, why would they know you, Bill?
Stick to the specials.
It's better than your material.
That was like a B-minus.
Hey, can I go up?
Yeah.
Eddie Zeidel, ladies and gentlemen.
You know, there was a couple in here the other day.
They'd been together for 53 years.
Which, uh, is pretty sweet.
Maybe.
In their case.
But for most of us, our relationships, I think, are less lifelong commitments and more laziness and bad habit.
The telephone of a better life is just ringing off the hook, and we're too lazy to get up and pick up the phone.
Ring!
Hello?
Oh, what, guy that, uh, wants to actually take me out on a date?
Like outside-of-the-house date?
Well, I'm gonna have to get back to you, 'cause
I'm really busy right now sitting on my comfortable couch with my lukewarm boyfriend watching cartoons in between rounds of ambivalent sex.
Ring!
Hey, guy that thinks I'm hilarious and isn't threatened by my success.
I would, uh, love to go out with you, but then I'd have to really take a good hard look at myself and why I keep dating people that make me feel like shit.
Bye.
Ring!
Who could this be?
Hello?
What?
Guy who hears me?
Who really hears me?
Well, I'm just gonna have to take this call.
Um, can you just hold on for one second?
There's just something that I gotta take care of before we continue.
Bill, it's over.
Go home.
Well, I think I just invented open drama mic night.
Hm.
Yeah, well, if anybody had it coming...
There's got to be a reason I keep sticking my chin out there.
Clay wasn't like that, right?
He was a habit too.
A lovely habit, but still a habit.
Mm.
We should go on a road trip, man.
Just get in the car and...
Where?
Where we gonna go?
Oh, someplace where nobody knows who the fuck I am.
Fuck.
We don't have to leave Los Angeles to do that.
We can just park across the street.
Fuck.
Jesus.
I'm getting my ass kicked, Edgar.
I should be used to it by now, but...
You know, man, you're--you're--you're close.
You're really close.
You just...
You just gotta stop fucking up.
All right?
I had this math teacher.
He said that nothing ever really touches.
That, like, you could take an object and cut it infinite times.
It gets closer and closer, but it never touches.
Maybe that's me.
No matter how close I get to anything,
I'm never gonna touch it.
I told you this is good shit.
- Yeah...
- I gotta take a piss.
Can I just go inside?
Me too.
Hey, man, maybe you don't have to go inside.
I'm no mathematician, but I'm pretty sure my piss is touching Sparky's grave.
And I don't wanna be a buzzkill, but of all the graves I've pissed on, this has got to be the least satisfying.
What the fuck are you doing?
Dad.
Dad, please.
Get the fuck away from me!
Dad.
Dad, what are you doing?
You hate me this much?
I don't hate you.
Dad, come on.
You're a sad fucking excuse for a son.
Get your stuff.
We're going.
Are you mad I skipped the deli for an AA meeting?
Nah.
Just wasn't for you.
Hey, listen, I think what you're doing it's pretty cool.
Thanks.
And I think what you're doing is fucking nuts.
Or is it?
Ooh.
Mm.
So... how's this Nick guy?
I like him.
But...
I don't know.
He doesn't really look at you.
More like he looks through you.
You know what I mean?
Of course.
I'm a waiter.
People look through me every day.
As long as we both end up in the same place, right?
You know it, pal.
And as long as that place is not a Polish deli.
Blow me.
Gonna be tricky from that angle.
You, uh, you sure we good, brother?
Fuck yeah.
Supposed to be a little crazy.
You gonna be all right.
You know that, right?
Yes, sir,
Sergeant, sir.
Goldie.
So I had an interesting conversation with CBS today.
Tell me.
"Girls Are Funny Too." They're interested.
Freddie wants to hear the formal pitch from you.
Hello?
Oh, I'm here, I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
Oh, you're the other shoe, babe.
Turns out I'm not the only one who wants to get in bed with you.
What about producer?
What about executive producer?
Son of a bitch.
Break a leg.
However many it takes.
Buh-bye now.
That's because I have to keep lying to you and telling you you're talented and good-looking.
All right, all right, I get it.
Not anymore you aren't.
- Funny joke, Ralph.
- Thanks, man.
Mr. Beverly?
It's time.
Mr. Beverly?
We're coming back from commercial in five.
Mr. Beverly?
Mr. Beverly?
Previously on Scorpion...
Someone you're avoiding knows you're back in L.A.?
They didn't... but they will now.
It was made clear to me that everyone's feelings should be heard.
Not just mine.
You know this will flame out when you eventually snap like a rubber band.
Being genial isn't your nature.
I'm trying a new approach, and best way to help him is to throw him into the deep end.
I am running for the 16th district alderman of West Altadenia in the local upcoming election.
I-I answered everything honestly.
In politics, honesty'll get you crushed.
Throughout American history, we, the people, have had candidates known for strength, integrity... courage...
and then there's this guy.
Can Sylvester Dodd really help West Altadenia?
Only if you believe in magic spells.
Vote Patel for alderman.
They edited this to make me look ridiculous.
Yeah, it was the editing.
Politics is a bar-room brawl.
I wouldn't manage you if I didn't believe in you, kid.
When I look at you, I see everything you have to offer.
Thank you, Cabe.
But when everyone else looks at you, they see a man-child wearing a cloak.
It's time to ditch the costumes and act like an adult.
I have.
Happy told me to be myself.
There's just film of me role-playing.
In garb.
You will be the first politician taken down by a never-had-sex tape.
This city is full of incompetents.
Hey, Walt, you okay?
That's a no.
That's a hell of a shiner.
I went to Fro-Yo-Ma.
I was very much looking forward to my Cello Shell-o:
Liquid chocolate topping that dries into a delicious hard candy shell, when the intractable clerk refused to give me two punches on my loyalty card.
Why would you get two punches?
Because the loyalty card clearly states, â€œOne punch per purchase.â€ I purchased two Cello Shell-Os.
One for me, one for Ralph.
Two purchases, two punches.
One could argue that you made one purchase that included two items.
Yes, such a stupid argument could be made, and it was, by the clerk, and things got... heated.
And you got the extra punch?
Not the one I was looking for.
Morning.
Apparently not for you.
I was assaulted by a contract-breaching yogurt vendor.
Okay.
Hey, Paige?
Happy?
Got a sec?
Fro-Yo-Ma just made the list.
What are you talking about?
It's a yogurt joint.
No, I-I get that, but why are you writing it down?
To keep track.
I-I'm lost.
Keep track of what?
Let me explain.
Before you joined the team, Walter's EQ was dangerously low.
He often got into disputes with civilians he had contact with, which led him to be banned from a number of L.A. establishments:
Restaurants, hardware stores...
That a dentist?
Yeah, he's not welcome back at Dr. Goldfarb's.
It got so bad we had to create a system that measures Walt's EQ to warn of impending danger.
Yeah, it's based on the DEFCON nuclear threat system, which is apt, since when Walter's EQ is low, he is also a radioactive, destructive peril to civilization.
A five means all is well.
Purely theoretical.
It's never happened.
And a one means...
He's gone nuclear.
Since you joined the team and began helping him, he's been at a steady four.
But now that you have started this sink-or-swim plan where he's on his own, he has slipped down to a three.
Paige, you have to help him before he gets worse.
No.
I am trying to help Walter become a fully functioning human.
This is the best way to do that.
He might stumble, okay?
But eventually, he will learn.
You've had success with Walter in the past.
If you think this is the way to go, we're behind you.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Walter's gonna be a disaster.
Of biblical proportions.
You okay?
I couldn't sleep last night.
That's what happens when you realize that the men who want you dead know you're back in town.
Not to mention they saw you with Scorpion.
Our address is listed.
Those guys shot at us twice already.
When they came after us on the road, they thought I was alone.
They had no idea I was part of a group that has government ties.
They know that now, so they're not just gonna come barging in here... but at the same time...
We're a bit in the crosshairs.
I never wanted to put you all in danger.
I just need my cash, and then I'll go far away.
Here comes the rub.
That abandoned factory where we found the nuclear device?
I buried the money there.
That's why you jackhammered the floor.
I went back last week to finish and get my cash, and the workers showed up, and I bolted before they saw me, but now there's security there full-time, and I need your help to get it back.
I don't do cons anymore.
I prefer the straight life...
A stable, honest job, a secure life.
I'm so sorry.
I fell asleep for a second there.
Please, honey.
One last con for Mommy.
Saddle up, everyone.
Time to leave for Colton.
What's in Colton?
Besides cows.
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers hired us to help some sandhog workers locate a leak in a municipal waterline.
You can't go.
I need you.
This is it.
One last time.
I promise.
I get my money, and I can disappear forever.
I never liked helping you with one of your schemes, not when I was nine and certainly not now, but I... don't want my friends in danger, and I really don't want Ralph in danger,
so I will help you get the money, but this time,
I'm in charge.
Fantastic.
You have always had a natural gift for my line of work.
I cannot wait to see what you come up with.
Just... get your coat.
Hey.
You don't need me for a simple engineering job, so I'm gonna help my mom out with something.
Well, we're dealing with civilians.
It's always good to have you there as a buffer.
You'll be fine.
Besides, it's good EQ practice for Walter, and who knows?
Maybe he'll finally start acting like a... polite, normal human being.
Attention, mole rats!
They're called sandhogs.
I am aware, but the nickname is illogical.
There is no sandhog in the zoological taxonomy, and since they work underground, lack Vitamin D, and are prone to sallow skin like mole rats, a blind underground rodent is a fitting moniker.
You must be Walter O'Brien.
Heard a lot about you, apparently all true.
Cabe Gallo.
Homeland.
Sorry about him.
He's just...
There's no point in explaining.
Call me Chief.
I run this sandhog unit, and I suggest you use the proper term or one of my men might give you a matching set.
I'll, brief you over here.
This underground pipe carries water that cools the adjacent industrial fertilizer plant.
Now, a few weeks ago, the pressure readings started dropping.
Army Corps called us.
We found a fissure that we promptly fixed with the calcium hydroxide mortar.
The water pressure improved, but didn't return to normal.
So, there's a second leak.
Yes.
We just can't find it.
Army Corps said that you guys helped save a kid from a sinkhole at the beach a few years ago.
Wanted you brought in.
Well, if you and your men please stay out of our way while we work, we should have the situation rectified very shortly.
All right, how about before you bench my team, you tell me how you plan to find the leak.
Maybe this guy can use, one of his magic spells?
I'm from West Altadenia.
Wonderful.
Can I count on your vote?
No.
We'll use echolocation to find the leak.
Each of us has a remote scanner which emits sound waves.
They'll transmit data to my tablet, which will compute it and pinpoint the source of the problem.
Okay, but if you need to inspect other sections of pipe, you let me know and I'll accompany you, 'cause it could be dangerous.
What's that for?
We installed safety nets throughout the tunnels, strong enough to catch someone even if propelled by a rush of water.
You take a lot of precautions.
You said the word danger and safety two times in the last ten seconds.
You've had recent experience with accidents?
Hey.
We lost a foreman in an underground water break six months ago.
Chief knew him for 20 years, so how about you give him a little room?
We'll give him all the room he needs.
We can handle it from here.
Walter has no idea how insensitive he sounds.
This is great.
Paige's plan is going like gangbusters so far.
You're the shrink.
Straighten Walt out.
Well, my relationship with him is complicated.
He's gonna think that I'm manipulating him, and he'll resist my help.
It has to be you.
You think I have the emotional ability to handle Walt?
Absolutely not, but what choice do we have?
This is one quality fake ID, all with supplies from the corner copy shop.
I knew you had the gift.
Yeah, well, Happy taught me a few things over the years.
Here.
Do as I say.
No questions asked.
So bossy.
I love it.
Who's the foreman here?
Who's asking?
This is an inspection.
All work stops now.
This place was red-flagged weeks ago.
The basement pillars are unstable.
They've already been inspected and approved for demo.
This is a spot safety check.
Now, stop all work or this job gets a new foreman.
Wipe the grin off your face, and start the inspection or this guy won't be the only one looking for a new paycheck.
I got something in Sly's section.
Yeah, I got a ping, but I don't see any leaks.
That's because they're microleaks.
Hundreds of them, all invisible to the naked eye, leaking water into the soil above and around us.
With that many leaks, the water loss would be massive.
And since this is karst terrain underlaid by soluble limestone, that water would create an enormous, subterranean reservoir.
Which has dissolved into the limestone, weakening the ground surrounding this pipe.
Ground here is already weak.
You know, we're right above the San Fernando aquifer, one of the largest sources of drinking water for Southern California.
This is a problem.
Cover subsidence sinkholes can occur anywhere excess water dissolves soluble rock below the surface.
There is a strong likelihood a sinkhole could open up here.
Like those giant sinkholes in Florida?
Those things are portals to hell, only less hospitable.
If we disturb the soil any further, we could trigger a cave-in.
Stop the work.
That man didn't hear you.
He's wearing headphones.
He turns that thing on, he's gonna shake up the soil.
And then we have a cave in.
Too late, the earth's giving way.
Everyone evacuate, now!
Stop the work!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Everyone run as far as you can!
Here it comes!
Come on, come on!
Keep moving, keep moving!
Come on.
That building.
It only houses machinery.
There's no one inside.
But we're not out of the woods.
Sinkholes in this type of soil structure will continue to grow after the initial expanse.
This thing's gonna progressively get worse, which means we have a new problem.
That silo stores toxic chemicals for the fertilizer plant.
If this sinkhole widens much farther, the silo will fall in.
Which is bad, 'cause we're over the San Fernando aquifer.
And if the chemicals get into the sinkhole, permanently contaminating the aquifer, it'll eliminate potable drinking water for a swath of Southern California.
Millions'll lose their homes, businesses will be shut down, tens of thousands of acres of farmland will be rendered useless.
A fiscal and a humanitarian disaster.
We got to get those chemicals out of that silo before it falls in.
Is there an emergency pump system?
There is.
In the building that just got swallowed by the earth.
What about your truck?
Yeah, but it-it flows out, not in.
I can reverse it.
Joe!
Go in that silo and connect a drainage hose to the holding vat, then get out, on the double.
Copy that, Chief.
That truck's tank isn't big enough to hold whatever's in a full silo!
Yeah, he's right.
We have to pump the chemicals from the silo to the truck and then out into some kind of a giant container.
Yeah, we passed a dairy farm on the way in.
They got milk trucks.
The silo holds almost 40,000 gallons.
A large straight-chassis truck will hold 10,000.
We'll commandeer four trucks and fill 'em up one at a time.
Not to be negative or anything, but this is completely hopeless.
By my calculations, the sinkhole is spreading too fast for us to pump out the chemicals before the silo falls in.
Then we only have one choice.
We need to slow down the sinkhole.
I know you have a God complex, Walter, but you're talking about stopping the earth.
When sinkholes formed around the Dead Sea, scientists designed a canal to relieve water pressure and stop it from spreading.
So, if we can create a relief well to drain out the excess water that is pooling underground, then we can slow it down.
In the '20s, this area was full of wells that tapped into the aquifer.
Even those that are a hundred yards away are strong enough to draw water from this area, reducing the saturation and slowing this collapse.
Those wells are in sheds all over this valley.
I could show you where.
Sly, come with me.
Let's get the pumps ready on my truck.
Okay.
Remember, if Walter and Chief get into it again, you're Paige.
You have to fix him.
Is jumping in the sinkhole an option?
I'm almost done turning your outtake valve into an intake.
Toby better get here with that dairy truck.
Joe, update on the hookup!
Hose is on the tank, but the connectors don't match.
They're loose.
I'll stay here and keep it secured manually.
Copy that, but this sinkhole is within 20 feet of the silo.
These Scorpion guys are trying to slow its spread, but once it closes that gap by half, you evacuate immediately.
Understood?
Yes, sir.
You guys finish over here yet?
Outflow hose is ready.
I still don't understand how you're pulling this off.
If we explained, you probably wouldn't get it.
He didn't mean it like that.
Really?
Then how did he mean it?
Um... all he's saying is he's way smarter than you.
We all are.
Moo!
I got the cow juice jitney!
We fill this one up, the farm will lend us the other three.
I'll make sure there are no kinks in the line.
Let me guess, helping Walt didn't go well?
I might have made it worse.
Might've or did?
I'm kind of busy trying to save ten million Californians.
I don't have time to babysit that emotionally stunted genius.
You're right, we have a job to do.
Walt's on his own, just like Paige wanted.
He gets better or he doesn't.
I'm all set here!
Are the mole rats ready?
I'm going with doesn't.
The line's all good.
Set!
Joe, turn it on now.
Out of the tank and into the truck.
And out of my connection.
And into my tanker!
It's working!
Yeah, but slowly.
These hoses weren't designed for this purpose.
At this rate, we won't have all the chemicals out by the time the sinkhole reaches the silo and it falls in.
Sly and Cabe better have found that relief well, we got to stop the spread of this earth girth.
It's heavy.
That generator is off-line, but there should be a release valve at the bottom.
It's too deep to see, at least 70 feet.
It'll draw in water quickly, reducing saturation in the valley, and slowing the sink hole.
So...
I get it.
Send the old guy.
Yeah.
No problem.
Yeah.
Where's your magic wand when you need it?
We could use one of your, illumination spells.
Yes, good one.
Hey!
What'd you put in the briefcase?
Dirt samples, I found something I need to report.
What?
You know exactly what she found.
I don't.
Tell me.
Asbestos dust.
We got a call on our safety hotline that the gypsum in the concrete floor was full of it.
Absolutely.
Totally full of it.
Look, I swear I didn't know anything about asbestos.
Likely story.
I'll dispose of it properly on my own, just...
Just don't shut down my job site.
Sorry, we have to send in the soil for testing and report it.
Let's go.
You know, we could look the other way if you just made it worth our while.
Like a bribe?
No.
No, no.
No bribe.
Just clean it up.
Okay.
Okay.
Got it open!
Great work!
It should start slowing the sinkhole!
It's getting closer.
How long till I can pull my man out of that tower?
The chemicals aren't extricated yet.
Happy?
8,200 gallons down, 31,800 to go.
Chief, I secured the connections to the hose and I've come up to the top of the silo to open up the containment unit vents.
A change in pressure could get the chemical outflow moving faster.
Joe, get the hell off that roof!
I'm not keeping a man up there.
This is over!
More than you realize!
Look!
We must've tapped the relief well too late.
That silo's gonna go over!
Get your man out of there now!
Joe, abort!
Get off now!
Abort!
Man.
Chief!
Joe, don't move an inch or the silo will fall into that sinkhole with you in it!
Along with those chemicals.
Which aren't getting pumped out anymore, because the hose is crimped under the silo.
Not good.
So... would you like to hear my position on eminent domain abuse in our fair city?
No.
Okay.
It's interesting and has to do with the Supreme Court case,
Kelo v. The City of New London.
Listen, bozo, you ain't getting my vote.
No.
The rod broke!
The 1920s steel must have been corroded.
It's stuck.
What do you mean it's stuck?
Do I have to define â€œstuckâ€ for you?
It's oxidized, galvanized and now compromised steel that's been warped and stuck into place!
No dice.
It won't move.
I'm here.
Open it up.
About that...
Are you kidding me?
I got thousands of gallons of water coming up on me fast.
It'll be on me in a minute!
Sly, you got to get me out of here or I'm gonna drown!
It's no use.
We're running out of time here, kid.
You got to think of something else.
We have to cut it open.
There's a power saw on the truck, but there's no electricity in here.
Then we make our own energy.
No time to explain.
Go grab the power saw, a screwdriver from your toolbox, some oil and a lug-wrench.
Cabe, we're gonna cut you out, but it could take a while.
I don't have a while.
The water's almost at my neck.
I-I can see that.
And by the time we're done on my end, it's gonna be over your head.
Wonderful.
Hey.
Everything you asked for.
Okay, great.
Do as I say and do it quickly.
Use the screwdriver to pry the access panel off that old generator.
Kid, what's the plan here?
This old well pump was retrofitted for electricity, but originally, it was man-powered.
Out of my way.
Okay.
This wheel is where the crank went and kinetic motion generated a supply of energy by spinning a coil of conductive wire around a magnet.
Get the lug-wrench.
Frank, you will be spinning this.
Okay, out of my way.
All right.
Kid?
Hurry up!
Frank?
Spin the lug wrench as fast as you can.
Cabe, keep your fingers away from the edge of the grate.
Just-Just hold on up there, Joe.
No big moves, don't rock that boat.
What if I try to reach you through the silo's interior?
That won't cause enough movement to make it fall.
Not an option... the door's pressed against the ground.
He's got no exit.
Then we need to drill an escape hatch.
No, the vibrations will shake it, it'll fall.
Also not an option.
Fertilizer's made with hydrochloric acid.
There'll be some inside the plant.
We could use it to dissolve the steel wall and then create an exit without shaking the silo.
That'll take time.
We'll have to stabilize the silo or it'll fall in before we're done.
But how?
It's ready to topple right now.
We secure it with cables.
Cables?
Are you crazy?
I'm about as crazy as the Italian engineers who secured the Leaning Tower of Pisa for 645 years.
Is that a good enough of a test run for you?
Okay... that was a great history lesson, Walt.
Italy sounds fun.
Hey, Chief, how about you and your men gather some cable so we can secure the silo?
We'll take care of the acid in the fertilizer plant to cut through the steel and get to Joe, and I'm gonna have a quick word with Walter.
Hey, new rule:
Don't talk to Chief.
This is great.
Walt's a mess and the cops and reporters are here.
I hate to say it, but we really need the waitress.
The look on that guy's face when you threatened to write him up was priceless.
Almost as priceless as your face when I yelled at you.
Seemed like your favorite part of the con.
Yep.
It felt great.
Today wasn't like the old days.
It was...
Fun?
I was going to say less traumatic, but also fun.
Now for something less fun.
We're being followed.
Okay, let's review the plan:
After you take me to Union Station, you file a complaint with the DA that I conned you and Scorpion out of some serious cash.
That way the bad guys will think you have no idea where I am, 'cause I ripped you off, and they'll leave you alone.
And you're on a train and off somewhere, and I never see you again.
That's the way it's got to be.
I know, I-I just wish there was a better way.
Constantly looking over your shoulder isn't much of a life.
Wait, is that genuine concern for your mother?
No, it's just an observation.
Read message.
Toby says, â€œWalter is at Waltcon 2.
â€œDude is a Dumpster fire.
â€œCops and reporters everywhere.
For more details, turn on KBX560.â€ ...the situation at Colton's Central.
Fertilizer Plant, where a massive sinkhole is on the verge of toppling a chemical storage silo with a worker trapped inside.
The pit is deep and unstable.
And if the silo falls, authorities believe the worker will be unrecoverable.
My God, we got to get there.
Text Toby.
We're on our way.
What about the company following us?
Let 'em follow.
All right, we're making some progress.
Just hold on!
I got one last big breath and I'm under, kid.
I'll have you out of there in less than a minute.
Trust me.
Faster!
He's losing consciousness!
No, it broke!
Okay.
Come on!
Cabe!
Cabe, all right...
You okay?
You okay, Cabe?
I'm all right.
Good work.
Thanks.
All right.
You got my vote.
It's going over!
It's falling!
Gun it!
It's steady at 15 degrees.
Keep the engine running.
It's holding, but who knows for how long?
What's your ETA?
Well, the steel's thicker than I thought;
Might not get through in time.
See, the more the silo tilts, the more the pounds per square inch of pressure the trucks need to counterbalance, and with their horsepower, if the silo drops even four degrees more, it falls.
I won't lose another one of my guys.
We can't let this happen.
What are you doing?
I don't engage in futile endeavors.
I'll never get through the steel in time.
You're not quitting on my guy!
I am trying to save your guy, but my best chance is for you to leave me alone and let me think.
There is no time to think.
If we don't do something soon, it's the same as letting him fall!
That's it.
We let him fall.
I am so sorry.
Some of the acid must've fallen on his head and it's eating his brain.
Those safety nets you have, we tie them together, we stretch them across the sinkhole, we cut the cables, we let the silo drop onto the nets and catch it, and then Joe gets out to safety.
Those nets are designed to catch people, not buildings.
If we tie them with the right amount of give, it might flex just the right amount and hold.
You know what else they might do?
Break and send the kid plummeting to his death.
Get out of my way.
This is the only way to save your worker.
If you had my IQ, you'd understand, but I suppose you're okay with losing another man.
Why does this keep happening to me?
'Cause you suck at talking to people.
You got to convince the Chief to do your plan.
Now, Paige gave you some tools to be a quasi-human.
You just got to use them.
I...
I stated facts when I should have considered your feelings.
I was unintentionally insensitive.
I've been insensitive my whole life.
But I know how you feel because I-I've lost somebody who was close to me, too.
I believe in my plan, but time is short.
How many nets do you need?
Okay, we're ready.
Hold on, Joe.
Ready!
Okay, on three, cut the cables.
One, two... three!
Nothing but net!
Joe, hurry up and get out of there.
Joe, come in.
Joe!
I can't... stand.
My leg's broken.
Hold tight!
Help's on the way!
He's hurt, but he's okay.
Or not.
What the hell was that?
The silo's fracturing.
We have to get him off of there now!
Adding a couple hundred pounds to this mess might not be the best way to stay alive.
Move fast.
What the hell is going on here?
Silo, man trapped, Walter on top with sandhog.
Up to speed.
I see him!
Okay, here we go.
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, he's my man, I'll go.
No, you need to pull him up.
You have more upper body strength than I do.
Not a lot of square footage on that box for a clean landing.
One, two...
No!
Grab Joe's hand and pull yourself up.
Okay, here, here.
Grab onto my shoulder.
Push yourself up with your good leg, yeah, great.
Okay, now turn around.
Yeah, here we are.
Grab hold of him.
You got him?
I got him.
Frank?
What the hell happened here?
I left Walter in charge.
Let 'em in!
I'm sorry...
Wait.
They won't try to get past the cops, but they'll be waiting for me when I leave.
We'll deal with them later.
That silo looks like it's about to give!
Shake a tail feather, fellas!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Get it in gear!
What the hell happened?
I thought you guys came in to fix a leak in a pipe.
Nice and easy, Chief.
I'm spotting you.
Easy now, no pressure on that leg.
Let's get you seated.
Ambulance is on its way.
That's not environmentally friendly.
The chemicals are in.
Permeation rates in this type of geology, we're talking less than 30 minutes until they reach the aquifer and contaminate it.
How do you stop liquid that's already in a sinkhole?
Trick question, you can't.
We're screwed.
California's screwed.
If you're gonna think of something, you better do it fast, Walt.
I'm trying to find a solution.
Pestering doesn't help.
Is anyone gonna fill me in on that second black eye?
Yeah, Walt had another incident like the one this morning, where he got in a fight over frequent guest punch cards.
You mean those cards where you get one punch per visit?
It's one punch per purchase.
And now's not the time...
Wait a minute, yes, it is.
It...
It's time for the Cello Shell-o!
I love a good fro-yo as much as the next guy, but it's kind of bad form to get dessert while Southern California's being poisoned.
No.
A-A hardening shell.
That's how we prevent the chemicals from getting into the aquifer.
The sandhogs were fixing the leak with mortar made with calcium hydroxide.
They have bags of it in the tunnel.
And the fertilizer chemicals contain fluoride.
Calcium hydroxide plus fluoride will harden that chemical sludge like cement.
Or like a Cello Shell-o.
Once it solidifies, it won't be able to seep into the aquifer.
Exactly!
Now we need something to mix the solution.
I saw just the thing in the plant, but I'll need help.
Doc, come on!
We'll get the bags of mortar.
Walter.
We have a moment.
You and I need to talk.
These turbines will churn up the solution like a cake mixer, so the calcium hydroxide will react faster with the fluoride.
Speeding up the hardening of the Cello Shell-o over the aquifer.
All right.
That's the last of the mortar.
Let's mix this cake batter!
Give 'em some juice!
It's working.
The shell is forming!
It's thickening.
In a few minutes, it'll be hard as rock, and then a Hazmat team can come in to remove the toxic material piece by piece.
Walter, be careful.
Your foot...
Mom!
Today's sinkhole disaster turned tragic when Los Angeles entrepreneur Veronica Dineen fell to her death into a caustic toxic soup which was in the process of hardening to prevent seeping into a major SoCal aquifer.
Authorities believe her body will never be...
I'm worried about her being alone right now.
We're right here if she needs us.
She can handle this.
I was surprised you took my call.
You're harassing me hours after my mother's death, so it's clear you...
aren't going away until we have it out, so... what the hell do you want?
My money.
You were there.
You saw her fall into the sinkhole with her briefcase.
That money got just as eaten up by the acidic chemicals as my mother.
Did see that.
But here's the thing.
Her debts are now yours.
Let me tell you my situation.
I'm a single mom who waitressed up until two and a half years ago.
I make less than six figures a year,
I have four grand in my bank account.
You want to set up a payment plan?
Fine.
You'll be whole by 2094.
And why should I believe you?
You can believe whatever you like.
But if you don't mind, I'd like to be left alone now.
Because as much as I'm nothing like my mom, because she was selfish and unreliable, she was my mother.
And I loved her, and I'll miss her.
So, please let me grieve.
Clear!
Finally.
I could smell his cologne from in there.
I thought he'd never leave.
Go ahead.
Bad guy's gone.
Ralph!
Honey!
I want to know how you did it.
Happy wouldn't tell me.
Master plan should come from the architect.
Actually, it was your mom's idea.
Well, Ralph,
I didn't want Grandma to be on the run her whole life.
The pit is deep and unstable, and if the silo falls, authorities believe the worker will be unrecoverable.
That's when I got the idea.
Walter.
We have a moment.
You and I need to talk.
I assume you've heard I've been misbehaving.
Yeah.
We can deal with that later.
But I need you to help save my mom?
Can you get any more of those big sandhog nets?
Wesetup thenet in the broken part of the pipe that went into the sinkhole.
Walter stood in his predetermined spot, and once we knew the chemical mix was hardening, he slipped his foot under the extension cord,
I did the rest... all for the benefit of my pals who were watching from close by.
Walter.
Be careful.
Your foot...
Son of a bitch.
Our money.
Thankstoonehell of a con by my little girl,
I am now free and clear.
Speaking of which,
I have a new birth certificate, driver's license and Social Security card.
They're real McCoys, so you won't have any problems.
I... don't know what to say to all of you.
Thank you.
It's nothing.
We make fake IDs all the time.
No.
Thank you for... giving my daughter something that I couldn't.
A family.
Ralph, honey.
I'm gonna have to keep a low profile.
Otherwise I'd insist that you and I stay pen pals.
You don't get off that easily.
I built an encrypted ID scrambler so we can e-mail each other.
Of course you did.
And Walter.
What you did today, with your Cello Shell-o trick at the sinkhole, was very impressive.
Thank you.
That's the thing about real chemistry.
If you have the right ingredients, you just need to be patient, and... eventually everything will work out.
Real subtle.
Keep working at it, Pinocchio.
Someday you'll be a real boy.
I can feel it.
Well.
This is it, so...
All right.
We should all get back to work.
We don't have any work.
Read between the lines.
Beat it so they can talk alone.
I heard that nice thing you said about me.
To the man who was trying to kill you?
Yeah.
Don't let it go to your head.
They were just for the con.
Well, in order for a con to work, you have to believe what you're saying.
Maybe I believed some of it.
I'll take that as a win.
Just because I can't seem to change for you, doesn't mean that Walter can't.
I don't care for him in that way anymore, Mom.
Now you're just conning yourself.
I'll miss you.
I always miss you.
Mom.
My car keys.
I figured Homeland would reimburse you.
Good-bye, Mom.
Good-bye, sweetheart.
And, um, check your desk drawer.
I left you a little something.
Okay.
â€œDear Paige, â€œI know you've never taken any of my ill-gotten gains.
â€œBut this is for Ralph.
â€œTell him a con's not over until Grandma says it's over.â€
Love, Mom.
Guys?
I'm gonna need help opening an offshore account.

WALTER:
Previously on Scorpion...
Uh-oh.
Someone you're avoiding knows you're back in L.A.?
They didn't... but they will now.
It was made clear to me that everyone's feelings should be heard.
Not just mine.
You know this will flame out when you eventually snap like a rubber band.
Being genial isn't your nature.
PAIGE:
I'm trying a new approach, and best way to help him is to throw him into the deep end.
I am running for the 16th district alderman of West Altadenia in the local upcoming election.
I-I answered everything honestly.
In politics, honesty'll get you crushed.
NARRATOR:
Throughout American history, we, the people, have had candidates known for strength, integrity... courage...
and then there's this guy.
Can Sylvester Dodd really help West Altadenia?
Only if you believe in magic spells.
Vote Patel for alderman.
They edited this to make me look ridiculous.
Yeah, it was the editing.
Politics is a bar-room brawl.
I wouldn't manage you if I didn't believe in you, kid.
When I look at you, I see everything you have to offer.
Thank you, Cabe.
But when everyone else looks at you, they see a man-child wearing a cloak.
It's time to ditch the costumes and act like an adult.
I have.
Happy told me to be myself.
There's just film of me role-playing.
In garb.
You will be the first politician taken down by a never-had-sex tape.
(door opens, closes)
This city is full of incompetents.
Hey, Walt, you okay?
That's a no.
That's a hell of a shiner.
I went to Fro-Yo-Ma.
I was very much looking forward to my Cello Shell-o:
liquid chocolate topping that dries into a delicious hard candy shell, when the intractable clerk refused to give me two punches on my loyalty card.
Why would you get two punches?
Because the loyalty card clearly states,
"One punch per purchase." I purchased two Cello Shell-Os.
One for me, one for Ralph.
Two purchases, two punches.
One could argue that you made one purchase that included two items.
Yes, such a stupid argument could be made, and it was, by the clerk, and things got... heated.
And you got the extra punch?
Not the one I was looking for.
Morning.
Apparently not for you.
I was assaulted by a contract-breaching yogurt vendor.
Okay.
Hey, uh, Paige?
Happy?
Got a sec?
Fro-Yo-Ma just made the list.
What are you talking about?
It's a yogurt joint.
No, I-I get that, but why are you writing it down?
To keep track.
I-I'm lost.
Keep track of what?
Let me explain.
Before you joined the team, Walter's EQ was dangerously low.
He often got into disputes with civilians he had contact with, which led him to be banned from a number of L.A. establishments:
restaurants, hardware stores...
That a dentist?
Yeah, he's not welcome back at Dr. Goldfarb's.
It got so bad we had to create a system that measures Walt's EQ to warn of impending danger.
Yeah, it's based on the DEFCON nuclear threat system, which is apt, since when Walter's EQ is low, he is also a radioactive, destructive peril to civilization.
HAPPY:
A five means all is well.
Purely theoretical.
It's never happened.
PAIGE:
And a one means...
He's gone nuclear.
Since you joined the team and began helping him, he's been at a steady four.
TOBY:
But now that you have started this sink-or-swim plan where he's on his own, he has slipped down to a three.
Paige, you have to help him before he gets worse.
No.
I am trying to help Walter become a fully functioning human.
This is the best way to do that.
He might stumble, okay?
But eventually, he will learn.
You've had success with Walter in the past.
If you think this is the way to go, we're behind you.
(door creaks)
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Walter's gonna be a disaster.
Of biblical proportions.
You okay?
I couldn't sleep last night.
That's what happens when you realize that the men who want you dead know you're back in town.
Not to mention they saw you with Scorpion.
Our address is listed.
Those guys shot at us twice already.
When they came after us on the road, they thought I was alone.
They had no idea I was part of a group that has government ties.
They know that now, so they're not just gonna come barging in here... but at the same time...
We're a bit in the crosshairs.
I never wanted to put you all in danger.
I just need my cash, and then I'll go far away.
Here comes the rub.
That abandoned factory where we found the nuclear device?
I buried the money there.
That's why you jackhammered the floor.
I went back last week to finish and get my cash, and the workers showed up, and I bolted before they saw me, but now there's security there full-time, and I need your help to get it back.
I don't do cons anymore.
I prefer the straight life-- a stable, honest job, a secure life.
(snores)
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I fell asleep for a second there.
Please, honey.
One last con for Mommy.
CABE:
Saddle up, everyone.
Time to leave for Colton.
What's in Colton?
Besides cows.
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers hired us to help some sandhog workers locate a leak in a municipal waterline.
You can't go.
I need you.
This is it.
One last time.
I promise.
I get my money, and I can disappear forever.
I never liked helping you with one of your schemes, not when I was nine and certainly not now, but I... don't want my friends in danger, and I really don't want Ralph in danger,
so I will help you get the money, but this time,
I'm in charge.
Fantastic.
You have always had a natural gift for my line of work.
I cannot wait to see what you come up with.
Just... get your coat.
Oh, hey.
You don't need me for a simple engineering job, so I'm gonna help my mom out with something.
Well, we're dealing with civilians.
It's always good to have you there as a buffer.
You'll be fine.
Besides, it's good EQ practice for Walter, and who knows?
Maybe he'll finally start acting like a... polite, normal human being.
Attention, mole rats!
They're called sandhogs.
I am aware, but the nickname is illogical.
There is no "sandhog" in the zoological taxonomy, and since they work underground, lack Vitamin D, and are prone to sallow skin like mole rats, a blind underground rodent is a fitting moniker.
You must be Walter O'Brien.
Heard a lot about you, apparently all true.
Cabe Gallo.
Homeland.
Sorry about him.
He's just, uh...
There's no point in explaining.
Call me Chief.
I run this sandhog unit, and I suggest you use the proper term or one of my men might give you a matching set.
I'll, uh, brief you over here.
This underground pipe carries water that cools the adjacent industrial fertilizer plant.
Now, a few weeks ago, the pressure readings started dropping.
Army Corps called us.
We found a fissure that we promptly fixed with the calcium hydroxide mortar.
The water pressure improved, but didn't return to normal.
So, there's a second leak.
Yes.
We just can't find it.
Army Corps said that you guys helped save a kid from a sinkhole at the beach a few years ago.
Wanted you brought in.
Well, if you and your men please stay out of our way while we work, we should have the situation rectified very shortly.
All right, how about before you bench my team, you tell me how you plan to find the leak.
Maybe this guy can use, uh, one of his magic spells?
I'm from West Altadenia.
Oh, wonderful.
Can I count on your vote?
No.
We'll use echolocation to find the leak.
Each of us has a remote scanner which emits sound waves.
They'll transmit data to my tablet, which will compute it and pinpoint the source of the problem.
Okay, but if you need to inspect other sections of pipe, you let me know and I'll accompany you, 'cause it could be dangerous.
What's that for?
CHIEF:
We installed safety nets throughout the tunnels, strong enough to catch someone even if propelled by a rush of water.
You take a lot of precautions.
You said the word "danger" and "safety"
two times in the last ten seconds.
You've had recent experience with accidents?
Hey.
We lost a foreman in an underground water break six months ago.
Chief knew him for 20 years, so how about you give him a little room, huh?
Oh, we'll give him all the room he needs.
We can handle it from here.
TOBY:
Walter has no idea how insensitive he sounds.
This is great.
Paige's plan is going like gangbusters so far.
You're the shrink.
Straighten Walt out.
Well, my relationship with him is complicated.
He's gonna think that I'm manipulating him, and he'll resist my help.
It has to be you.
You think I have the emotional ability to handle Walt?
Oh, absolutely not, but what choice do we have?
(indistinct chatter)
This is one quality fake ID, all with supplies from the corner copy shop.
I knew you had the gift.
Yeah, well, Happy taught me a few things over the years.
Here.
Do as I say.
No questions asked.
So bossy.
I love it.
PAIGE:
Who's the foreman here?
Who's asking?
OSHA.
This is an inspection.
All work stops now.
This place was red-flagged weeks ago.
The basement pillars are unstable.
They've already been inspected and approved for demo.
This is a spot safety check.
Now, stop all work or this job gets a new foreman.
Wipe the grin off your face, and start the inspection or this guy won't be the only one looking for a new paycheck.
HAPPY:
I got something in Sly's section.
Yeah, I got a ping, but I don't see any leaks.
That's because they're microleaks.
Hundreds of them, all invisible to the naked eye, leaking water into the soil above and around us.
With that many leaks, the water loss would be massive.
And since this is karst terrain underlaid by soluble limestone, that water would create an enormous, subterranean reservoir.
Which has dissolved into the limestone, weakening the ground surrounding this pipe.
Ground here is already weak.
You know, we're right above the San Fernando aquifer, one of the largest sources of drinking water for Southern California.
This is a problem.
Cover subsidence sinkholes can occur anywhere excess water dissolves soluble rock below the surface.
There is a strong likelihood a sinkhole could open up here.
Like those giant sinkholes in Florida?
Those things are portals to hell, only less hospitable.
If we disturb the soil any further, we could trigger a cave-in.
Stop the work.
That man didn't hear you.
He's wearing headphones.
He turns that thing on, he's gonna shake up the soil.
And then we have a cave in.
(motor whirring)
Too late, the earth's giving way.
Everyone evacuate, now!
Stop the work!
Go, go, go, go, go!
(rumbling)
(rumbling continues)
Everyone run as far as you can!
Here it comes!
(rumbling)
♪ Scorpion 3x14 ♪ The Hole Truth Original Air Date on January 23, 2017
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Come on, come on!
Keep moving, keep moving!
Come on.
(rumbling)
That building.
It only houses machinery.
There's no one inside.
But we're not out of the woods.
Sinkholes in this type of soil structure will continue to grow after the initial expanse.
This thing's gonna progressively get worse, which means we have a new problem.
That silo stores toxic chemicals for the fertilizer plant.
If this sinkhole widens much farther, the silo will fall in.
Which is bad, 'cause we're over the San Fernando aquifer.
SYLVESTER:
And if the chemicals get into the sinkhole, permanently contaminating the aquifer, it'll eliminate potable drinking water for a swath of Southern California.
Millions'll lose their homes, businesses will be shut down, tens of thousands of acres of farmland will be rendered useless.
A fiscal and a humanitarian disaster.
We got to get those chemicals out of that silo before it falls in.
Is there an emergency pump system?
There is.
In the building that just got swallowed by the earth.
What about your truck?
Yeah, but it-it flows out, not in.
I can reverse it.
Joe!
Go in that silo and connect a drainage hose to the holding vat, then get out, on the double.
Copy that, Chief.
That truck's tank isn't big enough to hold whatever's in a full silo!
WALTER:
Yeah, he's right.
We have to pump the chemicals from the silo to the truck and then out into some kind of a giant container.
Yeah, we passed a dairy farm on the way in.
They got milk trucks.
The silo holds almost 40,000 gallons.
HAPPY:
A large straight-chassis truck will hold 10,000.
We'll commandeer four trucks and fill 'em up one at a time.
Not to be negative or anything, but this is completely hopeless.
By my calculations, the sinkhole is spreading too fast for us to pump out the chemicals before the silo falls in.
Then we only have one choice.
We need to slow down the sinkhole.
I know you have a God complex, Walter, but you're talking about stopping the earth.
WALTER:
When sinkholes formed around the Dead Sea, scientists designed a canal to relieve water pressure and stop it from spreading.
So, if we can create a relief well to drain out the excess water that is pooling underground, then we can slow it down.
CHIEF:
In the '20s, this area was full of wells that tapped into the aquifer.
Even those that are a hundred yards away are strong enough to draw water from this area, reducing the saturation and slowing this collapse.
Those wells are in sheds all over this valley.
I could show you where.
Sly, come with me.
Let's get the pumps ready on my truck.
Okay.
Remember, if Walter and Chief get into it again, you're Paige.
You have to fix him.
Is jumping in the sinkhole an option?
I'm almost done turning your outtake valve into an intake.
Toby better get here with that dairy truck.
Joe, update on the hookup!
Hose is on the tank, but the connectors don't match.
They're loose.
I'll stay here and keep it secured manually.
Copy that, but this sinkhole is within 20 feet of the silo.
These Scorpion guys are trying to slow its spread, but once it closes that gap by half, you evacuate immediately.
Understood?
Yes, sir.
You guys finish over here yet?
Outflow hose is ready.
I still don't understand how you're pulling this off.
If we explained, you probably wouldn't get it.
He didn't mean it like that.
Really?
Then how did he mean it?
Um... all he's saying is he's way smarter than you.
We all are.
TOBY:
Moo!
I got the cow juice jitney!
We fill this one up, the farm will lend us the other three.
I'll make sure there are no kinks in the line.
Let me guess, helping Walt didn't go well?
I might have made it worse.
Might've or did?
I'm kind of busy trying to save ten million Californians.
I don't have time to babysit that emotionally stunted genius.
You're right, we have a job to do.
Walt's on his own, just like Paige wanted.
He gets better or he doesn't.
I'm all set here!
Are the mole rats ready?
I'm going with "doesn't."
The line's all good.
Set!
Joe, turn it on now.
(air hissing) (grunts)
Out of the tank and into the truck.
And out of my connection.
TOBY:
And into my tanker!
It's working!
HAPPY:
Yeah, but slowly.
These hoses weren't designed for this purpose.
At this rate, we won't have all the chemicals out by the time the sinkhole reaches the silo and it falls in.
Sly and Cabe better have found that relief well, we got to stop the spread of this earth girth.
(Cabe grunts)
(gate creaking)
It's heavy.
That generator is off-line, but there should be a release valve at the bottom.
It's too deep to see, at least 70 feet.
It'll draw in water quickly, reducing saturation in the valley, and slowing the sink hole.
So...
Oh, I get it.
Send the old guy.
Yeah.
(clears throat)
No problem.
Yeah.
Where's your magic wand when you need it?
We could use one of your, uh, illumination spells.
(laughing)
Yes, good one.
FOREMAN:
Hey!
What'd you put in the briefcase?
Dirt samples, I found something I need to report.
What?
You know exactly what she found.
I don't.
Tell me.
Asbestos dust.
We got a call on our safety hotline that the gypsum in the concrete floor was full of it.
Absolutely.
Totally full of it.
Look, I swear I didn't know anything about asbestos.
Likely story.
I'll dispose of it properly on my own, just-- just don't shut down my job site.
Sorry, we have to send in the soil for testing and report it.
Let's go.
You know, we could look the other way if you just made it worth our while.
Like a bribe?
No.
No, no.
No bribe.
Just clean it up.
Okay.
Okay.
(squeaking)
Got it open!
Great work!
It should start slowing the sinkhole!
CHIEF:
It's getting closer.
How long till I can pull my man out of that tower?
The chemicals aren't extricated yet.
Happy?
8,200 gallons down, 31,800 to go.
JOE:
Chief, I secured the connections to the hose and I've come up to the top of the silo to open up the containment unit vents.
A change in pressure could get the chemical outflow moving faster.
Joe, get the hell off that roof!
I'm not keeping a man up there.
This is over!
More than you realize!
Look!
We must've tapped the relief well too late.
That silo's gonna go over!
Get your man out of there now!
Joe, abort!
Get off now!
Abort!
Oh, man.
Chief!
(metal creaking)
Joe, don't move an inch or the silo will fall into that sinkhole with you in it!
Along with those chemicals.
Which aren't getting pumped out anymore, because the hose is crimped under the silo.
Not good.
SYLVESTER:
So... would you like to hear my position on eminent domain abuse in our fair city?
No.
Okay.
It's interesting and has to do with the Supreme Court case,
Kelo v. The City of New London.
Listen, bozo, you ain't getting my vote.
(creaking, snapping)
Oh, no.
The rod broke!
The 1920s steel must have been corroded.
(grunts) It's stuck.
What do you mean it's stuck?
Do I have to define "stuck" for you?
It's oxidized, galvanized and now compromised steel that's been warped and stuck into place!
(grunts)
No dice.
It won't move.
CABE:
I'm here.
Open it up.
About that... (gate rattles) Are you kidding me?
I got thousands of gallons of water coming up on me fast.
It'll be on me in a minute!
Sly, you got to get me out of here or I'm gonna drown!
(grunts)
It's no use.
CABE:
We're running out of time here, kid.
You got to think of something else.
We have to cut it open.
There's a power saw on the truck, but there's no electricity in here.
Then we make our own energy.
No time to explain.
Go grab the power saw, a screwdriver from your toolbox, some oil and a lug-wrench.
Cabe, we're gonna cut you out, but it could take a while.
I don't have a while.
The water's almost at my neck.
I-I can see that.
And by the time we're done on my end, it's gonna be over your head.
Wonderful.
Hey.
Everything you asked for.
Okay, great.
Do as I say and do it quickly.
Use the screwdriver to pry the access panel off that old generator.
Kid, what's the plan here?
SYLVESTER:
This old well pump was retrofitted for electricity, but originally, it was man-powered.
Out of my way.
Okay.
This wheel is where the crank went and kinetic motion generated a supply of energy by spinning a coil of conductive wire around a magnet.
Get the lug-wrench.
Frank, you will be spinning this.
Okay, out of my way.
All right.
Kid?
Hurry up!
SYLVESTER:
Frank?
Spin the lug wrench as fast as you can.
Cabe, keep your fingers away from the edge of the grate.
CHIEF:
Just-Just hold on up there, Joe.
No big moves, don't rock that boat.
What if I try to reach you through the silo's interior?
That won't cause enough movement to make it fall.
Not an option-- the door's pressed against the ground.
He's got no exit.
Then we need to drill an escape hatch.
No, the vibrations will shake it, it'll fall.
Also not an option.
Fertilizer's made with hydrochloric acid.
There'll be some inside the plant.
We could use it to dissolve the steel wall and then create an exit without shaking the silo.
HAPPY:
That'll take time.
We'll have to stabilize the silo or it'll fall in before we're done.
But how?
It's ready to topple right now.
We secure it with cables.
Cables?
Are you crazy?
I'm about as crazy as the Italian engineers who secured the Leaning Tower of Pisa for 645 years.
Is that a good enough of a test run for you?
Okay-- oh, that was a great history lesson, Walt.
Italy sounds fun.
Hey, Chief, how about you and your men gather some cable so we can secure the silo?
Uh, we'll take care of the acid in the fertilizer plant to cut through the steel and get to Joe, and I'm gonna have a quick word with Walter.
(sirens chirping)
Hey, new rule:
don't talk to Chief.
This is great.
Walt's a mess and the cops and reporters are here.
I hate to say it, but we really need the waitress.
(Veronica laughs)
The look on that guy's face when you threatened to write him up was priceless.
(chuckles) Almost as priceless as your face when I yelled at you.
Seemed like your favorite part of the con.
Yep.
It felt great.
Today wasn't like the old days.
It was...
Fun?
I was going to say less traumatic, but also fun.
Now for something less fun.
We're being followed.
Okay, let's review the plan:
after you take me to Union Station, you file a complaint with the DA that I conned you and Scorpion out of some serious cash.
That way the bad guys will think you have no idea where I am, 'cause I ripped you off, and they'll leave you alone.
And you're on a train and off somewhere, and I never see you again.
That's the way it's got to be.
I know, I-I just wish there was a better way.
Constantly looking over your shoulder isn't much of a life.
Wait, is that genuine concern for your mother?
No, it's just an observation.
(alert chimes)
(beep) Read message.
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Toby says,
"Walter is at Waltcon 2.
"Dude is a Dumpster fire.
"Cops and reporters everywhere.
For more details, turn on KBX560." (beep)
REPORTER: ...the situation at Colton's Central
Fertilizer Plant, where a massive sinkhole is on the verge of toppling a chemical storage silo with a worker trapped inside.
The pit is deep and unstable.
And if the silo falls, authorities believe the worker will be unrecoverable.
Oh, my God, we got to get there.
Text Toby.
We're on our way.
(beep)
What about the company following us?
Let 'em follow.
All right, we're making some progress.
Just hold on!
I got one last big breath and I'm under, kid.
I'll have you out of there in less than a minute.
Trust me.
(gasps)
Faster!
He's losing consciousness!
No, it broke!
Okay.
Come on!
(both grunt)
(Cabe groaning) Cabe!
Oh, Cabe, all right... (panting) You okay?
You okay, Cabe?
I'm all right.
Good work.
Thanks.
(Sylvester panting)
All right.
You got my vote.
(both chuckle)
It's going over!
It's falling!
Gun it!
(engine revs)
It's steady at 15 degrees.
Keep the engine running.
It's holding, but who knows for how long?
What's your ETA?
Well, the steel's thicker than I thought;
might not get through in time.
See, the more the silo tilts, the more the pounds per square inch of pressure the trucks need to counterbalance, and with their horsepower, if the silo drops even four degrees more, it falls.
I won't lose another one of my guys.
We can't let this happen.
What are you doing?
I don't engage in futile endeavors.
I'll never get through the steel in time.
You're not quitting on my guy!
I am trying to save your guy, but my best chance is for you to leave me alone and let me think.
CHIEF:
There is no time to think.
If we don't do something soon, it's the same as letting him fall!
That's it.
We let him fall.
I am so sorry.
Some of the acid must've fallen on his head and it's eating his brain.
Those safety nets you have, we tie them together, we stretch them across the sinkhole, we cut the cables, we let the silo drop onto the nets and catch it, and then Joe gets out to safety.
Those nets are designed to catch people, not buildings.
If we tie them with the right amount of give, it might flex just the right amount and hold.
You know what else they might do?
Break and send the kid plummeting to his death.
Get out of my way.
This is the only way to save your worker.
If you had my IQ, you'd understand, but I suppose you're okay with losing another man.
Why does this keep happening to me?
'Cause you suck at talking to people.
You got to convince the Chief to do your plan.
Now, Paige gave you some tools to be a quasi-human.
You just got to use them.
I...
I stated facts when I should have considered your feelings.
I was unintentionally insensitive.
I've been insensitive my whole life.
But I know how you feel because I-I've lost somebody who was close to me, too.
I believe in my plan, but time is short.
How many nets do you need?
Okay, we're ready.
Hold on, Joe.
Ready!
Okay, on three, cut the cables.
One, two... three!
(cables snap and whip, silo creaks)
(silo creaking)
Nothing but net!
Joe, hurry up and get out of there.
Joe, come in.
Joe!
I can't... stand.
My leg's broken.
Hold tight!
Help's on the way!
He's hurt, but he's okay.
(loud creak)
Or not.
CHIEF:
What the hell was that?
The silo's fracturing.
We have to get him off of there now!
HAPPY:
Adding a couple hundred pounds to this mess might not be the best way to stay alive.
Move fast.
(car horn honks)
(vehicle pulls up)
What the hell is going on here?
Silo, man trapped, Walter on top with sandhog.
Up to speed.
WALTER:
I see him!
Okay, here we go.
CHIEF:
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, he's my man, I'll go.
No, you need to pull him up.
You have more upper body strength than I do.
Not a lot of square footage on that box for a clean landing.
(quietly):
One, two... (grunts)
No!
(Walter groans)
CHIEF:
Grab Joe's hand and pull yourself up.
(both groan)
WALTER:
Okay, here, here.
Grab onto my shoulder.
Push yourself up with your good leg, yeah, great.
Okay, now turn around.
Yeah, here we are.
Grab hold of him.
You got him?
I got him.
Frank?
(Walter grunts)
(people clamoring)
What the hell happened here?
I left Walter in charge.
Let 'em in!
I'm sorry...
Wait.
They won't try to get past the cops, but they'll be waiting for me when I leave.
We'll deal with them later.
That silo looks like it's about to give!
Shake a tail feather, fellas!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Get it in gear!
PAIGE:
What the hell happened?
I thought you guys came in to fix a leak in a pipe.
CABE:
Nice and easy, Chief.
I'm spotting you.
TOBY:
Easy now, no pressure on that leg.
Let's get you seated.
Ambulance is on its way.
(crack and hiss)
That's not environmentally friendly.
The chemicals are in.
Permeation rates in this type of geology, we're talking less than 30 minutes until they reach the aquifer and contaminate it.
How do you stop liquid that's already in a sinkhole?
Trick question, you can't.
We're screwed.
California's screwed.
If you're gonna think of something, you better do it fast, Walt.
I'm trying to find a solution.
Pestering doesn't help.
PAIGE:
Is anyone gonna fill me in on that second black eye?
Yeah, Walt had another incident like the one this morning, where he got in a fight over frequent guest punch cards.
You mean those cards where you get one punch per visit?
It's one punch per purchase.
And now's not the time...
Wait a minute, yes, it is.
It...
It's time for the Cello Shell-o!
I love a good fro-yo as much as the next guy, but it's kind of bad form to get dessert while Southern California's being poisoned.
No.
A-A hardening shell.
That's how we prevent the chemicals from getting into the aquifer.
The sandhogs were fixing the leak with mortar made with calcium hydroxide.
They have bags of it in the tunnel.
And the fertilizer chemicals contain fluoride.
Calcium hydroxide plus fluoride will harden that chemical sludge like cement.
Or like a Cello Shell-o.
HAPPY:
Once it solidifies, it won't be able to seep into the aquifer.
Exactly!
Now we need something to mix the solution.
I saw just the thing in the plant, but I'll need help.
Doc, come on!
We'll get the bags of mortar.
Walter.
We have a moment.
You and I need to talk.
HAPPY:
These turbines will churn up the solution like a cake mixer, so the calcium hydroxide will react faster with the fluoride.
TOBY:
Speeding up the hardening of the Cello Shell-o over the aquifer.
All right.
That's the last of the mortar.
Let's mix this cake batter!
(whirring)
CABE:
Give 'em some juice!
It's working.
The shell is forming!
It's thickening.
In a few minutes, it'll be hard as rock, and then a Hazmat team can come in to remove the toxic material piece by piece.
Walter, be careful.
Your foot... (screams) (shouting) Mom!
Today's sinkhole disaster turned tragic when Los Angeles entrepreneur Veronica Dineen fell to her death into a caustic toxic soup which was in the process of hardening to prevent seeping into a major SoCal aquifer.
Authorities believe her body will never be...
I'm worried about her being alone right now.
We're right here if she needs us.
She can handle this.
I was surprised you took my call.
You're harassing me hours after my mother's death, so it's clear you...
aren't going away until we have it out, so... what the hell do you want?
My money.
You were there.
You saw her fall into the sinkhole with her briefcase.
That money got just as eaten up by the acidic chemicals as my mother.
Did see that.
But here's the thing.
Her debts are now yours.
Let me tell you my situation.
I'm a single mom who waitressed up until two and a half years ago.
I make less than six figures a year,
I have four grand in my bank account.
You want to set up a payment plan?
Fine.
You'll be whole by 2094.
And why should I believe you?
You can believe whatever you like.
But if you don't mind, I'd like to be left alone now.
because as much as I'm nothing like my mom, because she was selfish and unreliable, she was my mother.
And I loved her, and I'll miss her.
So, please let me grieve.
Clear!
(exhales)
Finally.
I could smell his cologne from in there.
I thought he'd never leave.
Go ahead.
Bad guy's gone.
(gasps)
Ralph!
Honey!
Oh.
Ah...
I want to know how you did it.
Happy wouldn't tell me.
Master plan should come from the architect.
Actually, it was your mom's idea.
Well, Ralph,
I didn't want Grandma to be on the run her whole life.
REPORTER:
The pit is deep and unstable, and if the silo falls, authorities believe the worker will be unrecoverable.
PAIGE:
That's when I got the idea.
Walter.
We have a moment.
You and I need to talk.
Oh.
I assume you've heard I've been misbehaving.
Uh, yeah.
We can deal with that later.
But I need you to help save my mom?
Can you get any more of those big sandhog nets?
PAIGE:
We set up the net in the broken part of the pipe that went into the sinkhole.
Walter stood in his predetermined spot, and once we knew the chemical mix was hardening, he slipped his foot under the extension cord,
VERONICA:
I did the rest... all for the benefit of my pals who were watching from close by.
Walter.
Be careful.
Your foot... (screams) (shouting)
Son of a bitch.
Our money.
VERONICA:
Thanks to one hell of a con by my little girl,
I am now free and clear.
Speaking of which,
I have a new birth certificate, driver's license and Social Security card.
They're real McCoys, so you won't have any problems.
I... don't know what to say to all of you.
(chuckles softly) Thank you.
It's nothing.
We make fake IDs all the time.
No.
Thank you for... giving my daughter something that I couldn't.
A family.
Ralph, honey.
I'm gonna have to keep a low profile.
Otherwise I'd insist that you and I stay pen pals.
You don't get off that easily.
I built an encrypted ID scrambler so we can e-mail each other.
Of course you did.
And Walter.
What you did today, with your Cello Shell-o trick at the sinkhole, was very impressive.
Oh.
Thank you.
That's the thing about real chemistry.
If you have the right ingredients, you just need to be patient, and... eventually everything will work out.
Real subtle.
(whispers):
Keep working at it, Pinocchio.
Someday you'll be a real boy.
I can feel it.
(exhaling):
Well.
This is it, so...
All right.
We should all get back to work.
We don't have any work.
Read between the lines.
Beat it so they can talk alone.
Oh.
I heard that nice thing you said about me.
Oh, to the man who was trying to kill you?
Yeah.
Don't let it go to your head.
They were just for the con.
Well, in order for a con to work, you have to believe what you're saying.
Maybe I believed some of it.
I'll take that as a win.
Just because I can't seem to change for you, doesn't mean that Walter can't.
I don't care for him in that way anymore, Mom.
Now you're just conning yourself.
I'll miss you.
I always miss you.
(sniffles)
Mom.
My car keys.
I figured Homeland would reimburse you.
Good-bye, Mom.
Good-bye, sweetheart.
Oh, and, um, check your desk drawer.
I left you a little something.
(chuckles)
Okay.
(exhales)
"Dear Paige,
"I know you've never taken any of my ill-gotten gains.
"But this is for Ralph.
"Tell him a con's not over until Grandma says it's over."
Love, Mom."
Guys?
I'm gonna need help opening an offshore account.

Previously on Scorpion...
Uh-oh.
Someone you're avoiding knows you're back in L.A.?
They didn't... but they will now.
It was made clear to me that everyone's feelings should be heard.
Not just mine.
You know this will flame out when you eventually snap like a rubber band.
Being genial isn't your nature.
I'm trying a new approach, and best way to help him is to throw him into the deep end.
I am running for the 16th district alderman of West Altadenia in the local upcoming election.
I-I answered everything honestly.
In politics, honesty'll get you crushed.
Throughout American history, we, the people, have had candidates known for strength, integrity... courage...
and then there's this guy.
Can Sylvester Dodd really help West Altadenia?
Only if you believe in magic spells.
Vote Patel for alderman.
They edited this to make me look ridiculous.
Yeah, it was the editing.
Politics is a bar-room brawl.
I wouldn't manage you if I didn't believe in you, kid.
When I look at you, I see everything you have to offer.
Thank you, Cabe.
But when everyone else looks at you, they see a man-child wearing a cloak.
It's time to ditch the costumes and act like an adult.
I have.
Happy told me to be myself.
There's just film of me role-playing.
In garb.
You will be the first politician taken down by a never-had-sex tape.
This city is full of incompetents.
Hey, Walt, you okay?
That's a no.
That's a hell of a shiner.
I went to Fro-Yo-Ma.
I was very much looking forward to my Cello Shell-o:
liquid chocolate topping that dries into a delicious hard candy shell, when the intractable clerk refused to give me two punches on my loyalty card.
Why would you get two punches?
Because the loyalty card clearly states,
"One punch per purchase." I purchased two Cello Shell-Os.
One for me, one for Ralph.
Two purchases, two punches.
One could argue that you made one purchase that included two items.
Yes, such a stupid argument could be made, and it was, by the clerk, and things got... heated.
And you got the extra punch?
Not the one I was looking for.
Morning.
Apparently not for you.
I was assaulted by a contract-breaching yogurt vendor.
Okay.
Hey, uh, Paige?
Happy?
Got a sec?
Fro-Yo-Ma just made the list.
What are you talking about?
It's a yogurt joint.
No, I-I get that, but why are you writing it down?
To keep track.
I-I'm lost.
Keep track of what?
Let me explain.
Before you joined the team, Walter's EQ was dangerously low.
He often got into disputes with civilians he had contact with, which led him to be banned from a number of L.A. establishments:
restaurants, hardware stores...
That a dentist?
Yeah, he's not welcome back at Dr. Goldfarb's.
It got so bad we had to create a system that measures Walt's EQ to warn of impending danger.
Yeah, it's based on the DEFCON nuclear threat system, which is apt, since when Walter's EQ is low, he is also a radioactive, destructive peril to civilization.
A five means all is well.
Purely theoretical.
It's never happened.
And a one means...
He's gone nuclear.
Since you joined the team and began helping him, he's been at a steady four.
But now that you have started this sink-or-swim plan where he's on his own, he has slipped down to a three.
Paige, you have to help him before he gets worse.
No.
I am trying to help Walter become a fully functioning human.
This is the best way to do that.
He might stumble, okay?
But eventually, he will learn.
You've had success with Walter in the past.
If you think this is the way to go, we're behind you.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Walter's gonna be a disaster.
Of biblical proportions.
You okay?
I couldn't sleep last night.
That's what happens when you realize that the men who want you dead know you're back in town.
Not to mention they saw you with Scorpion.
Our address is listed.
Those guys shot at us twice already.
When they came after us on the road, they thought I was alone.
They had no idea I was part of a group that has government ties.
They know that now, so they're not just gonna come barging in here... but at the same time...
We're a bit in the crosshairs.
I never wanted to put you all in danger.
I just need my cash, and then I'll go far away.
Here comes the rub.
That abandoned factory where we found the nuclear device?
I buried the money there.
That's why you jackhammered the floor.
I went back last week to finish and get my cash, and the workers showed up, and I bolted before they saw me, but now there's security there full-time, and I need your help to get it back.
I don't do cons anymore.
I prefer the straight life-- a stable, honest job, a secure life.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I fell asleep for a second there.
Please, honey.
One last con for Mommy.
Saddle up, everyone.
Time to leave for Colton.
What's in Colton?
Besides cows.
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers hired us to help some sandhog workers locate a leak in a municipal waterline.
You can't go.
I need you.
This is it.
One last time.
I promise.
I get my money, and I can disappear forever.
I never liked helping you with one of your schemes, not when I was nine and certainly not now, but I... don't want my friends in danger, and I really don't want Ralph in danger,
so I will help you get the money, but this time,
I'm in charge.
Fantastic.
You have always had a natural gift for my line of work.
I cannot wait to see what you come up with.
Just... get your coat.
Oh, hey.
You don't need me for a simple engineering job, so I'm gonna help my mom out with something.
Well, we're dealing with civilians.
It's always good to have you there as a buffer.
You'll be fine.
Besides, it's good EQ practice for Walter, and who knows?
Maybe he'll finally start acting like a... polite, normal human being.
Attention, mole rats!
They're called sandhogs.
I am aware, but the nickname is illogical.
There is no "sandhog" in the zoological taxonomy, and since they work underground, lack Vitamin D, and are prone to sallow skin like mole rats, a blind underground rodent is a fitting moniker.
You must be Walter O'Brien.
Heard a lot about you, apparently all true.
Cabe Gallo.
Homeland.
Sorry about him.
He's just, uh...
There's no point in explaining.
Call me Chief.
I run this sandhog unit, and I suggest you use the proper term or one of my men might give you a matching set.
I'll, uh, brief you over here.
This underground pipe carries water that cools the adjacent industrial fertilizer plant.
Now, a few weeks ago, the pressure readings started dropping.
Army Corps called us.
We found a fissure that we promptly fixed with the calcium hydroxide mortar.
The water pressure improved, but didn't return to normal.
So, there's a second leak.
Yes.
We just can't find it.
Army Corps said that you guys helped save a kid from a sinkhole at the beach a few years ago.
Wanted you brought in.
Well, if you and your men please stay out of our way while we work, we should have the situation rectified very shortly.
All right, how about before you bench my team, you tell me how you plan to find the leak.
Maybe this guy can use, uh, one of his magic spells?
I'm from West Altadenia.
Oh, wonderful.
Can I count on your vote?
No.
We'll use echolocation to find the leak.
Each of us has a remote scanner which emits sound waves.
They'll transmit data to my tablet, which will compute it and pinpoint the source of the problem.
Okay, but if you need to inspect other sections of pipe, you let me know and I'll accompany you, 'cause it could be dangerous.
What's that for?
We installed safety nets throughout the tunnels, strong enough to catch someone even if propelled by a rush of water.
You take a lot of precautions.
You said the word "danger" and "safety"
two times in the last ten seconds.
You've had recent experience with accidents?
Hey.
We lost a foreman in an underground water break six months ago.
Chief knew him for 20 years, so how about you give him a little room, huh?
Oh, we'll give him all the room he needs.
We can handle it from here.
Walter has no idea how insensitive he sounds.
This is great.
Paige's plan is going like gangbusters so far.
You're the shrink.
Straighten Walt out.
Well, my relationship with him is complicated.
He's gonna think that I'm manipulating him, and he'll resist my help.
It has to be you.
You think I have the emotional ability to handle Walt?
Oh, absolutely not, but what choice do we have?
This is one quality fake ID, all with supplies from the corner copy shop.
I knew you had the gift.
Yeah, well, Happy taught me a few things over the years.
Here.
Do as I say.
No questions asked.
So bossy.
I love it.
Who's the foreman here?
Who's asking?
OSHA.
This is an inspection.
All work stops now.
This place was red-flagged weeks ago.
The basement pillars are unstable.
They've already been inspected and approved for demo.
This is a spot safety check.
Now, stop all work or this job gets a new foreman.
Wipe the grin off your face, and start the inspection or this guy won't be the only one looking for a new paycheck.
I got something in Sly's section.
Yeah, I got a ping, but I don't see any leaks.
That's because they're microleaks.
Hundreds of them, all invisible to the naked eye, leaking water into the soil above and around us.
With that many leaks, the water loss would be massive.
And since this is karst terrain underlaid by soluble limestone, that water would create an enormous, subterranean reservoir.
Which has dissolved into the limestone, weakening the ground surrounding this pipe.
Ground here is already weak.
You know, we're right above the San Fernando aquifer, one of the largest sources of drinking water for Southern California.
This is a problem.
Cover subsidence sinkholes can occur anywhere excess water dissolves soluble rock below the surface.
There is a strong likelihood a sinkhole could open up here.
Like those giant sinkholes in Florida?
Those things are portals to hell, only less hospitable.
If we disturb the soil any further, we could trigger a cave-in.
Stop the work.
That man didn't hear you.
He's wearing headphones.
He turns that thing on, he's gonna shake up the soil.
And then we have a cave in.
Too late, the earth's giving way.
Everyone evacuate, now!
Stop the work!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Everyone run as far as you can!
Here it comes!

Come on, come on!
Keep moving, keep moving!
Come on.
That building.
It only houses machinery.
There's no one inside.
But we're not out of the woods.
Sinkholes in this type of soil structure will continue to grow after the initial expanse.
This thing's gonna progressively get worse, which means we have a new problem.
That silo stores toxic chemicals for the fertilizer plant.
If this sinkhole widens much farther, the silo will fall in.
Which is bad, 'cause we're over the San Fernando aquifer.
And if the chemicals get into the sinkhole, permanently contaminating the aquifer, it'll eliminate potable drinking water for a swath of Southern California.
Millions'll lose their homes, businesses will be shut down, tens of thousands of acres of farmland will be rendered useless.
A fiscal and a humanitarian disaster.
We got to get those chemicals out of that silo before it falls in.
Is there an emergency pump system?
There is.
In the building that just got swallowed by the earth.
What about your truck?
Yeah, but it-it flows out, not in.
I can reverse it.
Joe!
Go in that silo and connect a drainage hose to the holding vat, then get out, on the double.
Copy that, Chief.
That truck's tank isn't big enough to hold whatever's in a full silo!
Yeah, he's right.
We have to pump the chemicals from the silo to the truck and then out into some kind of a giant container.
Yeah, we passed a dairy farm on the way in.
They got milk trucks.
The silo holds almost 40,000 gallons.
A large straight-chassis truck will hold 10,000.
We'll commandeer four trucks and fill 'em up one at a time.
Not to be negative or anything, but this is completely hopeless.
By my calculations, the sinkhole is spreading too fast for us to pump out the chemicals before the silo falls in.
Then we only have one choice.
We need to slow down the sinkhole.
I know you have a God complex, Walter, but you're talking about stopping the earth.
When sinkholes formed around the Dead Sea, scientists designed a canal to relieve water pressure and stop it from spreading.
So, if we can create a relief well to drain out the excess water that is pooling underground, then we can slow it down.
In the '20s, this area was full of wells that tapped into the aquifer.
Even those that are a hundred yards away are strong enough to draw water from this area, reducing the saturation and slowing this collapse.
Those wells are in sheds all over this valley.
I could show you where.
Sly, come with me.
Let's get the pumps ready on my truck.
Okay.
Remember, if Walter and Chief get into it again, you're Paige.
You have to fix him.
Is jumping in the sinkhole an option?
I'm almost done turning your outtake valve into an intake.
Toby better get here with that dairy truck.
Joe, update on the hookup!
Hose is on the tank, but the connectors don't match.
They're loose.
I'll stay here and keep it secured manually.
Copy that, but this sinkhole is within 20 feet of the silo.
These Scorpion guys are trying to slow its spread, but once it closes that gap by half, you evacuate immediately.
Understood?
Yes, sir.
You guys finish over here yet?
Outflow hose is ready.
I still don't understand how you're pulling this off.
If we explained, you probably wouldn't get it.
He didn't mean it like that.
Really?
Then how did he mean it?
Um... all he's saying is he's way smarter than you.
We all are.
Moo!
I got the cow juice jitney!
We fill this one up, the farm will lend us the other three.
I'll make sure there are no kinks in the line.
Let me guess, helping Walt didn't go well?
I might have made it worse.
Might've or did?
I'm kind of busy trying to save ten million Californians.
I don't have time to babysit that emotionally stunted genius.
You're right, we have a job to do.
Walt's on his own, just like Paige wanted.
He gets better or he doesn't.
I'm all set here!
Are the mole rats ready?
I'm going with "doesn't."
The line's all good.
Set!
Joe, turn it on now.
Out of the tank and into the truck.
And out of my connection.
And into my tanker!
It's working!
Yeah, but slowly.
These hoses weren't designed for this purpose.
At this rate, we won't have all the chemicals out by the time the sinkhole reaches the silo and it falls in.
Sly and Cabe better have found that relief well, we got to stop the spread of this earth girth.
It's heavy.
That generator is off-line, but there should be a release valve at the bottom.
It's too deep to see, at least 70 feet.
It'll draw in water quickly, reducing saturation in the valley, and slowing the sink hole.
So...
Oh, I get it.
Send the old guy.
Yeah.
No problem.
Yeah.
Where's your magic wand when you need it?
We could use one of your, uh, illumination spells.
Yes, good one.
Hey!
What'd you put in the briefcase?
Dirt samples, I found something I need to report.
What?
You know exactly what she found.
I don't.
Tell me.
Asbestos dust.
We got a call on our safety hotline that the gypsum in the concrete floor was full of it.
Absolutely.
Totally full of it.
Look, I swear I didn't know anything about asbestos.
Likely story.
I'll dispose of it properly on my own, just-- just don't shut down my job site.
Sorry, we have to send in the soil for testing and report it.
Let's go.
You know, we could look the other way if you just made it worth our while.
Like a bribe?
No.
No, no.
No bribe.
Just clean it up.
Okay.
Okay.
Got it open!
Great work!
It should start slowing the sinkhole!
It's getting closer.
How long till I can pull my man out of that tower?
The chemicals aren't extricated yet.
Happy?
8,200 gallons down, 31,800 to go.
Chief, I secured the connections to the hose and I've come up to the top of the silo to open up the containment unit vents.
A change in pressure could get the chemical outflow moving faster.
Joe, get the hell off that roof!
I'm not keeping a man up there.
This is over!
More than you realize!
Look!
We must've tapped the relief well too late.
That silo's gonna go over!
Get your man out of there now!
Joe, abort!
Get off now!
Abort!
Oh, man.
Chief!
Joe, don't move an inch or the silo will fall into that sinkhole with you in it!
Along with those chemicals.
Which aren't getting pumped out anymore, because the hose is crimped under the silo.
Not good.
So... would you like to hear my position on eminent domain abuse in our fair city?
No.
Okay.
It's interesting and has to do with the Supreme Court case,
Kelo v. The City of New London.
Listen, bozo, you ain't getting my vote.
Oh, no.
The rod broke!
The 1920s steel must have been corroded.
It's stuck.
What do you mean it's stuck?
Do I have to define "stuck" for you?
It's oxidized, galvanized and now compromised steel that's been warped and stuck into place!
No dice.
It won't move.
I'm here.
Open it up.
About that...
Are you kidding me?
I got thousands of gallons of water coming up on me fast.
It'll be on me in a minute!
Sly, you got to get me out of here or I'm gonna drown!
It's no use.
We're running out of time here, kid.
You got to think of something else.
We have to cut it open.
There's a power saw on the truck, but there's no electricity in here.
Then we make our own energy.
No time to explain.
Go grab the power saw, a screwdriver from your toolbox, some oil and a lug-wrench.
Cabe, we're gonna cut you out, but it could take a while.
I don't have a while.
The water's almost at my neck.
I-I can see that.
And by the time we're done on my end, it's gonna be over your head.
Wonderful.
Hey.
Everything you asked for.
Okay, great.
Do as I say and do it quickly.
Use the screwdriver to pry the access panel off that old generator.
Kid, what's the plan here?
This old well pump was retrofitted for electricity, but originally, it was man-powered.
Out of my way.
Okay.
This wheel is where the crank went and kinetic motion generated a supply of energy by spinning a coil of conductive wire around a magnet.
Get the lug-wrench.
Frank, you will be spinning this.
Okay, out of my way.
All right.
Kid?
Hurry up!
Frank?
Spin the lug wrench as fast as you can.
Cabe, keep your fingers away from the edge of the grate.
Just-Just hold on up there, Joe.
No big moves, don't rock that boat.
What if I try to reach you through the silo's interior?
That won't cause enough movement to make it fall.
Not an option-- the door's pressed against the ground.
He's got no exit.
Then we need to drill an escape hatch.
No, the vibrations will shake it, it'll fall.
Also not an option.
Fertilizer's made with hydrochloric acid.
There'll be some inside the plant.
We could use it to dissolve the steel wall and then create an exit without shaking the silo.
That'll take time.
We'll have to stabilize the silo or it'll fall in before we're done.
But how?
It's ready to topple right now.
We secure it with cables.
Cables?
Are you crazy?
I'm about as crazy as the Italian engineers who secured the Leaning Tower of Pisa for 645 years.
Is that a good enough of a test run for you?
Okay-- oh, that was a great history lesson, Walt.
Italy sounds fun.
Hey, Chief, how about you and your men gather some cable so we can secure the silo?
Uh, we'll take care of the acid in the fertilizer plant to cut through the steel and get to Joe, and I'm gonna have a quick word with Walter.
Hey, new rule:
don't talk to Chief.
This is great.
Walt's a mess and the cops and reporters are here.
I hate to say it, but we really need the waitress.
The look on that guy's face when you threatened to write him up was priceless.
Almost as priceless as your face when I yelled at you.
Seemed like your favorite part of the con.
Yep.
It felt great.
Today wasn't like the old days.
It was...
Fun?
I was going to say less traumatic, but also fun.
Now for something less fun.
We're being followed.
Okay, let's review the plan:
after you take me to Union Station, you file a complaint with the DA that I conned you and Scorpion out of some serious cash.
That way the bad guys will think you have no idea where I am, 'cause I ripped you off, and they'll leave you alone.
And you're on a train and off somewhere, and I never see you again.
That's the way it's got to be.
I know, I-I just wish there was a better way.
Constantly looking over your shoulder isn't much of a life.
Wait, is that genuine concern for your mother?
No, it's just an observation.
Read message.
Toby says,
"Walter is at Waltcon 2.
"Dude is a Dumpster fire.
"Cops and reporters everywhere.
For more details, turn on KBX560."
...the situation at Colton's Central
Fertilizer Plant, where a massive sinkhole is on the verge of toppling a chemical storage silo with a worker trapped inside.
The pit is deep and unstable.
And if the silo falls, authorities believe the worker will be unrecoverable.
Oh, my God, we got to get there.
Text Toby.
We're on our way.
What about the company following us?
Let 'em follow.
All right, we're making some progress.
Just hold on!
I got one last big breath and I'm under, kid.
I'll have you out of there in less than a minute.
Trust me.
Faster!
He's losing consciousness!
No, it broke!
Okay.
Come on!
Cabe!
Oh, Cabe, all right...
You okay?
You okay, Cabe?
I'm all right.
Good work.
Thanks.
All right.
You got my vote.
It's going over!
It's falling!
Gun it!
It's steady at 15 degrees.
Keep the engine running.
It's holding, but who knows for how long?
What's your ETA?
Well, the steel's thicker than I thought;
might not get through in time.
See, the more the silo tilts, the more the pounds per square inch of pressure the trucks need to counterbalance, and with their horsepower, if the silo drops even four degrees more, it falls.
I won't lose another one of my guys.
We can't let this happen.
What are you doing?
I don't engage in futile endeavors.
I'll never get through the steel in time.
You're not quitting on my guy!
I am trying to save your guy, but my best chance is for you to leave me alone and let me think.
There is no time to think.
If we don't do something soon, it's the same as letting him fall!
That's it.
We let him fall.
I am so sorry.
Some of the acid must've fallen on his head and it's eating his brain.
Those safety nets you have, we tie them together, we stretch them across the sinkhole, we cut the cables, we let the silo drop onto the nets and catch it, and then Joe gets out to safety.
Those nets are designed to catch people, not buildings.
If we tie them with the right amount of give, it might flex just the right amount and hold.
You know what else they might do?
Break and send the kid plummeting to his death.
Get out of my way.
This is the only way to save your worker.
If you had my IQ, you'd understand, but I suppose you're okay with losing another man.
Why does this keep happening to me?
'Cause you suck at talking to people.
You got to convince the Chief to do your plan.
Now, Paige gave you some tools to be a quasi-human.
You just got to use them.
I...
I stated facts when I should have considered your feelings.
I was unintentionally insensitive.
I've been insensitive my whole life.
But I know how you feel because I-I've lost somebody who was close to me, too.
I believe in my plan, but time is short.
How many nets do you need?
Okay, we're ready.
Hold on, Joe.
Ready!
Okay, on three, cut the cables.
One, two... three!
Nothing but net!
Joe, hurry up and get out of there.
Joe, come in.
Joe!
I can't... stand.
My leg's broken.
Hold tight!
Help's on the way!
He's hurt, but he's okay.
- Or not.
- What the hell was that?
The silo's fracturing.
We have to get him off of there now!
Adding a couple hundred pounds to this mess might not be the best way to stay alive.
Move fast.
What the hell is going on here?
Silo, man trapped, Walter on top with sandhog.
Up to speed.
I see him!
Okay, here we go.
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, he's my man, I'll go.
No, you need to pull him up.
You have more upper body strength than I do.
Not a lot of square footage on that box for a clean landing.
One, two...
No!
Grab Joe's hand and pull yourself up.
Okay, here, here.
Grab onto my shoulder.
Push yourself up with your good leg, yeah, great.
Okay, now turn around.
Yeah, here we are.
Grab hold of him.
You got him?
I got him.
Frank?
What the hell happened here?
I left Walter in charge.
Let 'em in!
I'm sorry...
Wait.
They won't try to get past the cops, but they'll be waiting for me when I leave.
We'll deal with them later.
That silo looks like it's about to give!
Shake a tail feather, fellas!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Get it in gear!
What the hell happened?
I thought you guys came in to fix a leak in a pipe.
Nice and easy, Chief.
I'm spotting you.
Easy now, no pressure on that leg.
Let's get you seated.
Ambulance is on its way.
That's not environmentally friendly.
The chemicals are in.
Permeation rates in this type of geology, we're talking less than 30 minutes until they reach the aquifer and contaminate it.
How do you stop liquid that's already in a sinkhole?
Trick question, you can't.
We're screwed.
California's screwed.
If you're gonna think of something, you better do it fast, Walt.
I'm trying to find a solution.
Pestering doesn't help.
Is anyone gonna fill me in on that second black eye?
Yeah, Walt had another incident like the one this morning, where he got in a fight over frequent guest punch cards.
You mean those cards where you get one punch per visit?
It's one punch per purchase.
And now's not the time...
Wait a minute, yes, it is.
It...
It's time for the Cello Shell-o!
I love a good fro-yo as much as the next guy, but it's kind of bad form to get dessert while Southern California's being poisoned.
No.
A-A hardening shell.
That's how we prevent the chemicals from getting into the aquifer.
The sandhogs were fixing the leak with mortar made with calcium hydroxide.
They have bags of it in the tunnel.
And the fertilizer chemicals contain fluoride.
Calcium hydroxide plus fluoride will harden that chemical sludge like cement.
Or like a Cello Shell-o.
Once it solidifies, it won't be able to seep into the aquifer.
Exactly!
Now we need something to mix the solution.
I saw just the thing in the plant, but I'll need help.
Doc, come on!
We'll get the bags of mortar.
Walter.
We have a moment.
You and I need to talk.
These turbines will churn up the solution like a cake mixer, so the calcium hydroxide will react faster with the fluoride.
Speeding up the hardening of the Cello Shell-o over the aquifer.
All right.
That's the last of the mortar.
Let's mix this cake batter!
Give 'em some juice!
It's working.
The shell is forming!
It's thickening.
In a few minutes, it'll be hard as rock, and then a Hazmat team can come in to remove the toxic material piece by piece.
Walter, be careful.
Your foot...
Mom!
Today's sinkhole disaster turned tragic when Los Angeles entrepreneur Veronica Dineen fell to her death into a caustic toxic soup which was in the process of hardening to prevent seeping into a major SoCal aquifer.
Authorities believe her body will never be...
I'm worried about her being alone right now.
We're right here if she needs us.
She can handle this.
I was surprised you took my call.
You're harassing me hours after my mother's death, so it's clear you...
aren't going away until we have it out, so... what the hell do you want?
My money.
You were there.
You saw her fall into the sinkhole with her briefcase.
That money got just as eaten up by the acidic chemicals as my mother.
Did see that.
But here's the thing.
Her debts are now yours.
Let me tell you my situation.
I'm a single mom who waitressed up until two and a half years ago.
I make less than six figures a year,
I have four grand in my bank account.
You want to set up a payment plan?
Fine.
You'll be whole by 2094.
And why should I believe you?
You can believe whatever you like.
But if you don't mind, I'd like to be left alone now.
because as much as I'm nothing like my mom, because she was selfish and unreliable, she was my mother.
And I loved her, and I'll miss her.
So, please let me grieve.
Clear!
Finally.
I could smell his cologne from in there.
I thought he'd never leave.
Go ahead.
Bad guy's gone.
Ralph!
Honey!
Oh.
Ah...
I want to know how you did it.
Happy wouldn't tell me.
Master plan should come from the architect.
Actually, it was your mom's idea.
Well, Ralph,
I didn't want Grandma to be on the run her whole life.
The pit is deep and unstable, and if the silo falls, authorities believe the worker will be unrecoverable.
That's when I got the idea.
Walter.
We have a moment.
You and I need to talk.
Oh.
I assume you've heard I've been misbehaving.
Uh, yeah.
We can deal with that later.
But I need you to help save my mom?
Can you get any more of those big sandhog nets?
We set up the net in the broken part of the pipe that went into the sinkhole.
Walter stood in his predetermined spot, and once we knew the chemical mix was hardening, he slipped his foot under the extension cord,
I did the rest... all for the benefit of my pals who were watching from close by.
Walter.
Be careful.
Your foot...
Son of a bitch.
Our money.
Thanks to one hell of a con by my little girl,
I am now free and clear.
Speaking of which,
I have a new birth certificate, driver's license and Social Security card.
They're real McCoys, so you won't have any problems.
I... don't know what to say to all of you.
Thank you.
It's nothing.
We make fake IDs all the time.
No.
Thank you for... giving my daughter something that I couldn't.
A family.
Ralph, honey.
I'm gonna have to keep a low profile.
Otherwise I'd insist that you and I stay pen pals.
You don't get off that easily.
I built an encrypted ID scrambler so we can e-mail each other.
Of course you did.
And Walter.
What you did today, with your Cello Shell-o trick at the sinkhole, was very impressive.
Oh.
Thank you.
That's the thing about real chemistry.
If you have the right ingredients, you just need to be patient, and... eventually everything will work out.
Real subtle.
Keep working at it, Pinocchio.
Someday you'll be a real boy.
I can feel it.
Well.
This is it, so...
All right.
We should all get back to work.
We don't have any work.
Read between the lines.
Beat it so they can talk alone.
Oh.
I heard that nice thing you said about me.
Oh, to the man who was trying to kill you?
Yeah.
Don't let it go to your head.
They were just for the con.
Well, in order for a con to work, you have to believe what you're saying.
Maybe I believed some of it.
I'll take that as a win.
Just because I can't seem to change for you, doesn't mean that Walter can't.
I don't care for him in that way anymore, Mom.
Now you're just conning yourself.
I'll miss you.
I always miss you.
Mom.

I figured Homeland would reimburse you.
Good-bye, Mom.
Good-bye, sweetheart.
Oh, and, um, check your desk drawer.

Figured it was just a matter of time before they set their sights on us.
Well, fortunately for you, we were in the area when they did.
And to what do we owe your timely intervention, Raza?
Luck.
We're actually here to pick up a friend.
- A friend?
- Tabor Calchek.
He was with a group who recently found refuge here.
Yes, we took in a large group of displaced citizens

- Great.
We're sending a shuttle down to pick him up.
I'm afraid that won't be possible, Raza.
- Why not?
- This colony's under lockdown, pending the arrival of corporate military reinforcements.
While I appreciate your desire to keep the peace,
I hope you can appreciate my desire to rescue a friend.
Your friend's safety will be ensured until the lockdown is lifted.
When I said we were sending down a shuttle,
I wasn't asking for permission.

Obviously, I sent it.
But I figured I'd explain once you got here.

Besides, her temporary absence is... better... for the both of us.
You know, you surprise me.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I mean, it's obvious there's no love lost between you two.
Misaki and I hold very different opinions on many issues, but if there's one thing we can agree on, it's our desire to support your rule.
Teku, ever the diplomat.
I heard about the loss of our research facility and the Blink Drive.
Your former friends have hurt us badly.
Yes.
And I'm in the process... of planning my response.
Yeah, our transport ship ended up getting redirected to this planet.
I barely got out with a few of Tabor's personal items and the clothes on my back.
Is it my imagination, or are we being followed?
- What do you mean?
- No, it's not your imagination.
- It's your damn eyes.
- Introductions are in order.
This is my bodyguard, Solara Shockley.
What?
Bodyguard?
What's a little twerp like you need a bodyguard for?
Little twerps in this line of work need them most of all.
Okay, here's the deal.
These workers are fed up with their terrible working conditions.
Traugott has all but abandoned this facility and the guards stationed here, because they're too busy with the war, so I've convinced the workers to take advantage of the situation,
- and proclaim their independence.
- Why?
Well, so they can cast off the yolk of oppression,
- and finally taste freedom.
- No... what's in it for you?
A 10% commission on future profits as their union representative.
You know, you do make a pretty good table.
Well...
This has been a Traugott operation going on 30 years.
Put up with a lot over that time, low pay, unsafe working conditions.
But we've been making a lot of noise lately, and the Traugott guards don't like it.
They're getting nervous.
They came in here the other day.
They tried to arrest Zem here for anticorporate activities.
We wouldn't let 'em.
They're holed up in a garrison about four clicks from here.
We have the bodies, but they have more guns, and that's the problem.
Wouldn't be if you don't attack them.
They're a danger to Zem, to all of us, so long as they're here,
- Better safe than sorry, I say.
- There's nothing safe about picking a fight with a superior enemy.
Well, that's...
Where maybe you can assist us.
Help us take out that garrison with your shuttle.
- Why don't we wait and see?
- This is not our fight.
What she means is...
We're not fighting your battle for you.
Why don't we give you two some time?
I am not signing on for this.
I'm not saying we commit, but let's not take anything off the table just yet.
We're not going down this road.
But this is exactly what we've been talking about, helping people in situations like this.
No, this is what you've been talking about.
I never said I'd be willing to get involved in a territorial dispute that has nothing to do with us.
Fine.
I've been talking, but you seem to be listening.
This is an opportunity to... to help,
- to do the right thing.
- And then what?
Watch it blow up in our faces again?
- We make terrible heroes.
- Okay.
If you're looking for a practical angle, how 'bout this.
The colonies we help now will be in a position to help us in the future, if we should ever need them.
Supplies, information, safe haven.
In this case, munitions.
It's dangerous, yes, but it's the right call, and you know it.
What the hell?
He's dead.
My God.
We told them this equipment was unsafe.
We asked them for a safety upgrade, and they refused.
I mean, this whole thing could've been avoided.
Bullshit.
You think that was an accident?
Someone planted explosives.
Traugott was gunning for Zem.
Well, they got him.
Those Traugott bastards.
You don't know for certain that it was them.
Who the hell else would it be?
They came for Zem, and when they realized they couldn't take him alive, they killed him.
You're not thinking this through.
No.
For the past two weeks, that's all we've been doing.
Now it's time for action.
You're not prepared for this fight.
You're outgunned.
You said as much yourself.
Hey...
Hey...
I said hey.
If you go through with this, more of you will die.
That's a fact.
So what do you expect us to do then?
Wait for them to hit us again?
No.
You find a way to end this without bloodshed.
And completely ignore the fact that they killed three of ours?
What is it you want?
Revenge or freedom?
'Cause I can help you get one, but not both.
So what do you suggest we do then?
Go to talk to them.
You're telling us to go over there, trust them not to shoot us on sight, and hope they're willing to talk?
Not you.
Me.
That's far enough.
I'm unarmed.
Just here to talk.
Right.
The crew of The Raza, just stopping by to pick up a friend.
We should've blasted you out of the sky when we had the chance.
Look, I'm here to help.
Sure you are.
Whether you wanna admit it or not, you and your security team are screwed.
The workers have turned against you.
You're outnumbered, and you must realize by now that backup isn't coming.
Now there's two ways this can go down.
You can dig in your heels and... fight for a corporation that's abandoned you, or... you can let me in to talk, and help reach a settlement.
No fighting.
No one dies.
You get to go home to your families.
Either way, this colony is declaring independence, and there's nothing you can do to change that.
Check him for weapons.
Raza, this is Two.
Are you there?
- Yes, Two.
- We're gonna be delayed, but not for long, hopefully.
How's it going up there?
Any closer to fixing the Blink Drive?
No, I'm afraid not.
The damage it suffered was extensive.
It may be beyond repair.
Shit.
I was running a general diagnostic when I discovered something curious.
What does that mean?
A portion of the ship's database has been quarantined.
- Why?
- I'm not sure, but I am running a decrypt program in an effort to force access.
Do you think it's another virus?
No.
In fact, it appears to have been intentionally isolated from the ship's more sensitive programs.
So what are you saying?
Somebody did this on purpose?
Yes... someone with the access codes to our ship's database.
It was one of us.
There was an explosion.
Three workers were killed, including Zem.
And they think we did it?
You tried to arrest him, and failed.
That doesn't mean we wanted him dead.
He was their leader.
You wanted him out of the picture.
We're security contingent.
Our job is to protect Traugott assets, and that includes those workers.
Now we don't wanna start anything, but if they come at us, you can be damn sure we'll be ready for 'em.
Traugott doesn't care about you or this damn colony.
Hell, forget reinforcements.
They couldn't even be bothered to extract you.
This isn't your battle anymore.
And the workers have given you the power to make a deal on their behalf?
We can reinforce any agreement we make.
- We?
- Me and my ship.
You agree to lay down your arms and walk away, and we'll guarantee you safe passage off this planet to the closest neutral space station.
Well, what about that explosion?
If they're convinced we did it, you think they're just gonna let us walk?
You let me worry about that.
We can't let this go.
We gotta answer, blood for blood.
You do that, and this will end badly for everyone.
So what do you suggest we do?
Forget our dead?
Toe the company line?
Claim your independence, but do it without bloodshed.
Show mercy now, so that later, when this war is over, they'll be more likely to seek out a nonviolent solution.
And in what reality would a corporation even bother
- negotiating with a colony?
- In a reality where that colony is backed by two dozen other independent colonies.
Show you can govern fairly, and it will go a long way toward convincing others, like the G.A. or The League of Autonomous Worlds, that you deserve a fair shake.
All right.
We'll see how your friend does with the Traugott guard.
But someone...
Someone has to pay for this.
And they will, but not with their lives.
Okay.
Now it's a matter of convincing the rest of my people.
What?
Where's Turrence?
So you think you'll be able to sell this to the workers?
Yeah.
I'm sure I can convince them that this is their best option.
Have to say, you surprise me.
Your reputation may precede you, but it's a long way from reality.
You're a good man.
No, I'm a man who has his good days.
Hey, if this all works out, after the war's over, I'd like to buy you a...
Fire!
Run!
On me!
Now!

Move it!
Retreat!
Get up!

You son of a bitch.
Back off.
I need you to calm your friend down.
She's usually the one calming me down, so this all new territory.
They murdered our friends.
Did you seriously think we were gonna let that go?
You've put one of my crew members at risk.
He put himself at risk by going over there and trying to broker a deal with those bastards.
Okay, everyone put your weapons down.
Now!
You show up out of nowhere, start telling us what to do.
You have no idea what we've been through, risking our asses for a corporate bottom line.
What do you know about it?
Okay, Turrence, just cool off.
Yeah, no, you're right.
We don't know what you've been through, but we do know about dealing with the likes of Traugott.
We were finding you an out, a way to get your freedom maybe without having to deal with reprisals.
You should've listened to us.
Now we have to clean up your mess.
Are you out of your mind?
You think I set you up?
You're saying your people just happened to be
- waiting out there?
- Those weren't my people.
A good man is dead,
- because he trusted you.
- I had nothing do with it.
Say it again.
Say it again!
Tell me how you had nothing to do with it.
Convince me, because if you don't,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your head, and end you!
Why go through all the trouble?
I could've just gotten into my shuttle, and leveled this place with a couple of wellplaced missiles.
You think about it, that would've been a bestcase scenario for those workers.
They get their independence, and the big bad crew of the "Raza" add to their rep.
I wasn't playing you.
I didn't know.
Well, I feel sorry for you then.
Why's that?
Because now we're going to respond...
And you're going to help us.
Maybe you should try talking to them first.
Six is the talker.
If he hasn't convinced them by now, nothing we say is gonna change anything.
He's right.
Like it or not, we've been backed into a corner.
We need to force the issue.
So who's going to make that particular house call?
- Me and Three.

We're all fine.
We're almost at your position.
Be careful.
Why?
What's going on?
The Traugott guards just took the facility.
Adrian and I are up on a second level walkway.
They haven't spotted us yet.
We can see everything that's going on from here.
Okay, I need details.
Exactly what's going on?
Who's where?
Okay, listen up.
Traugott is back in charge, so things are gonna be different around here.
You are effectively prisoners.
Until the arrival of reinforcements, you'll eat when we tell you, sleep when we tell you.
You will do what we tell you!
- What if they don't come?
- What was that?
What if your reinforcements don't come?
Then you'll have lots of time to get used to things.
We've confiscated your weapons.
We need to know if you're hiding any more.
We also wanna know who's responsible for the attack on our garrison.
We'll trade you for the identity of whoever set the explosives that killed our people.
You are not in a position to make offers.
I want names.
Someone is gonna be punished.
Might as well be the guilty parties.
Names!
No one's being punished.
No one else is dying today.
Put your weapons down.
It's over.
Yeah, damn right it's over.
Get down on your knees with the rest of 'em.
- No.
- What was that?
He said no.
Drop your weapons.
- And then what?
- I meant what I said.
Please don't make me a liar.
Do it.
Do it.
- Are you serious?
- Down on your knees.
Hands behind your heads.
Now.
Made any decisions?
Yeah.
We're gonna send off with the next supply ship, arrange for the authorities to pick them up at the closest station.
Hand the investigation over to the G.A.
Are you sure you wanna do that?
What do you mean?
Someone has to be responsible for setting off that blast.
I know those guards may be denying
- any involvement now, but...
- I don't think they did it.
What the hell are you saying?
It was one of my people?
It was someone who wanted to trigger this conflict,
- and they succeeded.
- But why?
Listen up, I've got news for you.
You don't need to worry about Traugott Corp anymore.
We received your message, and we're here to help.
They call me The General.
Welcome to the revolution.
What the hell are you doing here?
Hello, Griff.
It's been awhile.
Don't listen to this man.
He's a liar and a mass murderer.
He's responsible for the deaths of 10,000 innocent civilians on the Hyadum12 space station.
Well, I'm not the only one responsible for that particular attack.
But I don't deny it, because those civilians weren't so innocent.
They're complicit in a system that supports inequality and favors corporate rights over the rights of the workers.
And yes...
I've shed blood, and I have no regrets, because I fight for the weak, the defenseless,
the downtrodden.
I fight for the oppressed.
And I will fight for you.
You don't belong here.
I was invited.
- By who?
- By me.
He helped other colonies gain their independence, and he'll do the same for us.
You people stood up to the corp system.
That takes guts.
But you're gonna need a lot more than that if you're gonna survive what's coming.
You're gonna need organization, leadership.
That's something that I can give you.
Don't accept his offer.
Turn him away.
How can you ask that of me?
My people need help.
Who can we rely on when you leave?
Come on.
It's time to go.
Your ability to fashion virtual constructs is impressive.
It's wasted on this rather simplistic design, though.
Wouldn't you agree?
I can sense your presence is something far beyond a simple program.
You're complex.
I'm hoping we can talk.
I can leave, but you know I'll be back.
Now that we know you're here, we will find you...
Eventually.
I know you.
Yes, you do.
Hello, Android.
Are you there?
Can you hear me?
Please.
- Dalla?
- You have to come back.
- What's going on?
- The General.
He's rounded up prisoners, and he's g...
I don't know.
Wait, Six.
Wait.
Six!
This is the price to be paid for trying to take away our freedom.
Well, well, speak of the devil.
He and his people are outsiders.
They work as hired guns for the corporations.
They seem to think they can come here and tell you what's best for you.
Now you show them that you're with us now.
Cowards!
You may not agree with my ways, but you have to admit that I am the best chance these people have for survival.
So don't go start...
Drop 'em.
You heard him.
Now!
So what now?
Now you go back to the ship and leave.
You mean we go back to our ship, don't you?
We're not leaving you behind.
Don't think of it as leaving me behind then.
Think of it as leaving me to move forward.
You're serious?
These people need direction, leadership.
And I've been talking about wanting to do something that'll make difference, and here's my chance.
There are other ways to help.
You're right.
The "Raza" can make a difference, you know, be... become a symbol of hope for these people and others like them.
I'll let 'em know that they have a powerful ally backing them.
But you don't need me for that.
They need me more, if they'll have me, that is.
We'd be honored.
It's settled then.
If you're sure about this.
Yeah.
All right.
- We'll be checking in on you.
- You better.
Guess I'm the last man standing.
Do some good.
Yeah.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you too.
But you know where to find me.
You stay strong, and watch over them.
I will.
Okay, where to?
- What do you mean?
- Where are we dropping you off?
Actually, we were kinda hoping maybe we could stay with you guys for awhile.
You wanna stay here on our ship?
It's... it's not like we wouldn't pull our weight.
Solara's pretty handy.
And obviously, you know what I bring to the table.
We do?
Who knows what happened to Tabor?
We may never see him again.
But in the meantime, I'm running his clients.
I have all of his contacts.
And many of his annoying habits.
We can't just dump them.
Sure we can.
You don't know what it's like out there with this war going on.
It's not safe.
Trust me, it's not safe here either.
It would just be for a little while, until we can get back on our feet.
No.
Fine, you can stay for now...
But he's your responsibility.
Keep him out of trouble.
- Five?
- Hey.
Do you have a moment?
I don't feel like talking right now.
It's not about Six.
It's about someone else.
Are you saying Sarah's alive?
Yes and no.
When her stasis pod died,
I was able to rescue her digital consciousness.
Whenever you go into a deep sleep, your consciousness gets digitally uploaded into a database designed to keep the mind actively stimulated, and avoid mental atrophy over long hauls.
It gets downloaded back as part of the revival process.
So instead of downloading this digital consciousness back into her dying body, you transferred it to the ship's database?
Not at first.
I didn't know how.
I kept it on a separate storage device.
And it wasn't until recently that I was able to figure out a way to actually upload it into the computer.
Well, why didn't you tell us any of this sooner?
Because I didn't know it was gonna work, and I didn't wanna get anyone's hopes up.
So you're saying Sarah is alive as a computer program?
Well, it's a lot more complicated than that.
She's a sentient consciousness confined to our ship's database, but she has created her own virtual reality within it.
You can neurally connect to her world, visit her if you like.
I know she wants to see you.
I'm sorry.
You are this galaxy's most fearsome and formidable...
Mercenaries, bounty hunters, professional soldiers, assassins, the very best at what you do.
Your mission is twofold.
Take back what's mine, and take out the crew of the "Raza."
Previously on "Dark Matter"...
The summit on EOS-7 will come under attack, and the result will be all-out corporate war.
[Truffault] War changes everything.
Now it's all about new alliances.
[Six] Tabor Calchek.
He gets the jobs, we do the jobs.
Oh, Portia.
[Blow lands]
[Five] With the Blink Drive, you just disappear from one place and reappear somewhere else.
[Ryo] Let my scientists study it.
The android thinks the Ishida scientist tampered with it.
[Five] Sarah?
It's me, Five.
What's the situation, Corporal?
[Hendricks] A ship just dropped out of FTL.
It's the reinforcements.
They've finally arrived.
[Garrison guard A] It's not reinforcements, sir.
Satellites sensors confirm it's a Ferrous Corp ship.
[Darrow] Code blue.
[Alarm sounds]
- Get a lock on their position.
- [Hendricks] Tracking, sir.
- I've got a lock.
- [Darrow] Prep the missiles,
- ready the perimeter guns.
- Missiles are prepped.
Perimeter guns are ready.
Awaiting your command.
Open a surface to ship communication.
Yes, sir.
- Go ahead, sir.
- This is Captain Lars Darrow, commanding officer of the Cepheus-5.
Security detachment.
This is a Traugott colony.
Your presence here is in violation of interstellar law.
Retreat beyond the territorial zone, or face the consequences.
[Monitor beeping] They're powering up weapons.
Defensive protocols.
Prepare for aerial assault.
[Monitor beeping]
They've just launched a nuke.
What's that?
Another ship just dropped out of FTL,
- and it's opened fire.
- On the Ferrous Corp ship?
On the nuke.
[Explosion]
Nuke intercepted and destroyed.
[Monitor beeping]
The ships are exchanging fire.
The Ferrous Corp ship is jumping to FTL.
It's gone.
[Sighs]
Open up a comm line to the other vessel.
Cepheus-5, this is the "Raza."
You're welcome.
*DARK MATTER Season 03 Episode 03 Title: "Welcome to the Revolution"
We received word that Ferrous Corp had started launching strikes on rival assets in the outer colonies.
Figured it was just a matter of time before they set their sights on us.
Well, fortunately for you, we were in the area when they did.
And to what do we owe your timely intervention, Raza?
Luck.
We're actually here to pick up a friend.
- A friend?
- Tabor Calchek.
He was with a group who recently found refuge here.
Yes, we took in a large group of displaced citizens
- a couple weeks ago.
- Great.
We're sending a shuttle down to pick him up.
I'm afraid that won't be possible, Raza.
- [Two] Why not?
- This colony's under lockdown, pending the arrival of corporate military reinforcements.
While I appreciate your desire to keep the peace,
I hope you can appreciate my desire to rescue a friend.
Your friend's safety will be ensured until the lockdown is lifted.
When I said we were sending down a shuttle,
I wasn't asking for permission.
[Six] This colony houses a Traugott munitions factory.
If he's telling the truth, and he's got an in, it's worth checking out.
If he's telling the truth.
Guy's a thieving, scheming opportunist.
[Chuckles] Yeah, yeah.
[Two] Hello?
[Six] Hello?
Can we just skip to the part where you come out of hiding and get the jump on us?
[Guns cocking]
There.
That's better.
What do you want?
We're here to pick up a friend.
- You with Traugott?
- [Six] No, we're not.
Then how'd you get here?
You're telling us security just let you fly right in?
- We didn't give 'em a choice.
- You're lying.
[Six] Hey, we just saved all your asses by taking out that nuke before it could level
- this entire colony.
- [Man] Wait, stop, hang on.
It's okay.
They're with me.
Portia?
Thanks for coming to pick me up.
- You are not Tabor.
- No, not yet.
Oh, right, the amnesia thing.
Tabor told me.
Adrian Maro, Tabor's former assistant.
[Five] Former?
You mean Tabor's...
Yep, gone.
Soon as the war started, cashed in his savings, and just took off.
Left me a good-bye message, his place.
- And his contact list?
- [Adrian] Yeah.
That transmission you got wasn't from him.
Obviously, I sent it.
But I figured I'd explain once you got here.
- Okay, start explaining.
- Well, Tabor's gone, so I'm taking over his operation.
I was his apprentice.
Now I'm your new handler.
So we came all the way out here for you?
Well, you did save all these lives,
- so there's that.
- Friends of yours?
[Adrian] Friends?
You telling me you don't recognize who they are?
[Adrian] They are the baddest of bads, the deadliest of dead-shots, this galaxy's most notorious,
- most dangerous...
- Yeah.
- Most despicable...
- Whoa.
- Sorry, too much?
- [Two] Okay.
We're the crew of the "Raza."
The "Raza"?
Why didn't you say so?
Come on, let's get you a drink.
[Grunting, sword whooshing]
Impressive.
When do you graduate from the Academy?
[Academy student] Next year.
Come back to me when you've completed your training then.
There may be a place for you among my royal guard.
Yes, Heika, I would be honored.
Teku, have you come to do a little sparring?
Swordplay is the one thing I cannot teach you, Heika.
[Ryo chuckles]
[Teku] Where is Han-Shireikan?
Off-world.
She's meeting with General Caius.
Respectfully, Misaki's role is not to act as mediator between you and your Generals.
Her duty is here at the court, protecting her emperor.
[Ryo chuckles]
Her emperor is perfectly capable of protecting himself.
Besides, her temporary absence is... better... for the both of us.
You know, you surprise me.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I mean, it's obvious there's no love lost between you two.
Misaki and I hold very different opinions on many issues, but if there's one thing we can agree on, it's our desire to support your rule.
[Chuckles]
Teku, ever the diplomat.
I heard about the loss of our research facility and the Blink Drive.
Your former friends have hurt us badly.
Yes.
And I'm in the process... of planning my response.
Yeah, our transport ship ended up getting redirected to this planet.
I barely got out with a few of Tabor's personal items and the clothes on my back.
Is it my imagination, or are we being followed?
- What do you mean?
- No, it's not your imagination.
- It's your damn eyes.
- Introductions are in order.
This is my bodyguard, Solara Shockley.
What?
Bodyguard?
What's a little twerp like you need a bodyguard for?
Little twerps in this line of work need them most of all.
Okay, here's the deal.
These workers are fed up
- with their terrible working conditions.
- Uh-huh.
Traugott has all but abandoned this facility and the guards stationed here, because they're too busy with the war, so I've convinced the workers to take advantage of the situation,
- and proclaim their independence.
- Why?
Well, so they can cast off the yolk of oppression,
- and finally taste freedom.
- No... ..what's in it for you?
Oh, a 10% commission on future profits as their union representative.
You know, you do make a pretty good table.
Well...
This has been a Traugott operation going on 30 years.
Put up with a lot over that time, low pay, unsafe working conditions.
But we've been making a lot of noise lately, and the Traugott guards don't like it.
They're getting nervous.
They came in here the other day.
They tried to arrest Zem here for anti-corporate activities.
We wouldn't let 'em.
[Zem] They're holed up in a Garrison about four clicks from here.
We have the bodies, but they have more guns, and that's the problem.
Wouldn't be if you don't attack them.
They're a danger to Zem, to all of us, so long as they're here,
- Better safe than sorry, I say.
- There's nothing safe about picking a fight with a superior enemy.
[Zem] Well, that's... [Clears throat]...
Where maybe you can assist us.
Help us take out that Garrison with your shuttle.
- Why don't we wait and see?
- This is not our fight.
Uh, what she means is...
We're not fighting your battle for you.
[Zem clears throat] Why don't we give you two some time?
I am not signing on for this.
I'm not saying we commit, but let's not take anything off the table just yet.
We're not going down this road.
But this is exactly what we've been talking about, helping people in situations like this.
[Two] No, this is what you've been talking about.
I never said I'd be willing to get involved in a territorial dispute that has nothing to do with us.
Fine.
I've been talking, but you seem to be listening.
This is an opportunity to... to help,
- to do the right thing.
- And then what?
Watch it blow up in our faces again?
- We make terrible heroes.
- [Six] Okay.
If you're looking for a practical angle, how 'bout this.
The colonies we help now will be in a position to help us in the future, if we should ever need them.
Supplies, information, safe haven.
In this case, munitions.
It's dangerous, yes, but it's the right call, and you know it.
[Explosion, rumbling]
What the hell?
[Yelling, screaming]
He's dead.
Oh, my God.
[Dalla] We told them this equipment was unsafe.
We asked them for a safety upgrade, and they refused.
I mean, this whole thing could've been avoided.
Bullshit.
You think that was an accident?
[Turrence] Someone planted explosives.
Traugott was gunning for Zem.
Well, they got him.
Those Traugott bastards.
[Two] You don't know for certain that it was them.
Who the hell else would it be?
They came for Zem, and when they realized they couldn't take him alive, they killed him.
[Six] You're not thinking this through.
Ah, no.
For the past two weeks, that's all we've been doing.
Now it's time for action.
You're not prepared for this fight.
You're outgunned.
You said as much yourself.
[Six] Hey...
Hey!
[Gunshot]
I said hey.
If you go through with this, more of you will die.
That's a fact.
So what do you expect us to do then?
Wait for them to hit us again?
No.
You find a way to end this without bloodshed.
And completely ignore the fact that they killed three of ours?
[Six] What is it you want?
Revenge or freedom?
'Cause I can help you get one, but not both.
So what do you suggest we do then?
Go to talk to them.
[Dalla] You're telling us to go over there, trust them not to shoot us on sight, and hope they're willing to talk?
[Six] Not you.
Me.
[Garrison guard A] That's far enough.
I'm unarmed.
Just here to talk.
Right.
The crew of The Raza, just stopping by to pick up a friend.
We should've blasted you out of the sky when we had the chance.
Look, I'm here to help.
Sure you are.
Whether you wanna admit it or not, you and your security team are screwed.
The workers have turned against you.
You're outnumbered, and you must realize by now that back-up isn't coming.
Now there's two ways this can go down.
You can dig in your heels and... fight for a corporation that's abandoned you, or... you can let me in to talk, and help reach a settlement.
No fighting.
No one dies.
You get to go home to your families.
Either way, this colony is declaring independence, and there's nothing you can do to change that.
Check him for weapons.
[Two] Raza, this is Two.
Are you there?
- Yes, Two.
- [Two] We're gonna be delayed, but not for long, hopefully.
How's it going up there?
Any closer to fixing the Blink Drive?
No, I'm afraid not.
The damage it suffered was extensive.
It may be beyond repair.
Shit.
[The android] I was running a general diagnostic when I discovered something curious.
What does that mean?
A portion of the ship's database has been quarantined.
- [Two] Why?
- I'm not sure, but I am running a decrypt program in an effort to force access.
Do you think it's another virus?
No.
In fact, it appears to have been intentionally isolated from the ship's more sensitive programs.
So what are you saying?
Somebody did this on purpose?
Yes... someone with the access codes to our ship's database.
It was one of us.
[Six] There was an explosion.
Three workers were killed, including Zem.
And they think we did it?
You tried to arrest him, and failed.
That doesn't mean we wanted him dead.
He was their leader.
You wanted him out of the picture.
We're security contingent.
Our job is to protect Traugott assets, and that includes those workers.
Now we don't wanna start anything, but if they come at us, you can be damn sure we'll be ready for 'em.
[Six] Traugott doesn't care about you or this damn colony.
Hell, forget reinforcements.
They couldn't even be bothered to extract you.
This isn't your battle anymore.
And the workers have given you the power to make a deal on their behalf?
[Six] We can reinforce any agreement we make.
- We?
- [Six] Me and my ship.
You agree to lay down your arms and walk away, and we'll guarantee you safe passage off this planet to the closest neutral space station.
[Garrison guard A] Well, what about that explosion?
If they're convinced we did it, you think they're just gonna let us walk?
You let me worry about that.
We can't let this go.
We gotta answer, blood for blood.
You do that, and this will end badly for everyone.
[Dalla] So what do you suggest we do?
Forget our dead?
Toe the company line?
Claim your independence, but do it without bloodshed.
Show mercy now, so that later, when this war is over, they'll be more likely to seek out a non-violent solution.
And in what reality would a corporation even bother
- negotiating with a colony?
- In a reality where that colony is backed by two dozen other independent colonies.
Show you can govern fairly, and it will go a long way toward convincing others, like the G.A. or The League of Autonomous Worlds, that you deserve a fair shake.
All right.
We'll see how your friend does with the Traugott guard.
But someone...
Someone has to pay for this.
[Two] And they will, but not with their lives.
[Dalla] Okay.
Now it's a matter of convincing the rest of my people.
What?
Where's Turrence?
So you think you'll be able to sell this to the workers?
Yeah.
I'm sure I can convince them
- that this is their best option.
- [Darrow] Have to say, you surprise me.
Your reputation may precede you, but it's a long way from reality.
You're a good man.
No, I'm a man who has his good days.
[Darrow] Hey, if this all works out, after the war's over, I'd like to buy you a... [gunshot]
[Turrence] Fire!
[Garrison guard B] Run!
On me!
Now!
Now!
Move it!
[Turrence yells]
[Turrence] Retreat!
Get up!
[Men yelling]
Move!
Let's go!
I knew we shouldn't have trusted you.
You son of a bitch.
[Turrence groans]
Back off.
I need you to calm your friend down.
[Three] She's usually the one calming me down, so this all new territory.
[Turrence] They murdered our friends.
Did you seriously think we were gonna let that go?
You've put one of my crew members at risk.
He put himself at risk by going over there and trying to broker a deal with those bastards.
Okay, everyone put your weapons down.
Now!
You show up out of nowhere, start telling us what to do.
You have no idea what we've been through, risking our asses for a corporate bottom line.
What do you know about it, huh?
[Dalla] Okay, Turrence, just cool off.
[Two] Yeah, no, you're right.
We don't know what you've been through, but we do know about dealing with the likes of Traugott.
We were finding you an out, a way to get your freedom maybe without having to deal with reprisals.
You should've listened to us.
Now we have to clean up your mess.
Are you out of your mind?
You think I set you up?
[Garrison guard A]You're saying your people just happened to be
- waiting out there?
- Those weren't my people.
[Garrison guard A] A good man is dead,
- because he trusted you.
- I had nothing do with it.
Say it again.
Say it again!
Tell me how you had nothing to do with it.
Convince me, because if you don't,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your head, and end you!
[Six] Why go through all the trouble?
I could've just gotten into my shuttle, and leveled this place with a couple of well-placed missiles.
You think about it, that would've been a best-case scenario for those workers.
They get their independence, and the big bad crew of the "Raza" add to their rep.
I wasn't playing you.
I didn't know.
Well, I feel sorry for you then.
Why's that?
Because now we're going to respond...
[Garrison guard A] And you're going to help us.
Maybe you should try talking to them first.
Six is the talker.
If he hasn't convinced them by now, nothing we say is gonna change anything.
He's right.
Like it or not, we've been backed into a corner.
We need to force the issue.
Uh, so who's going to make that particular house call?
- Me and Three.
- [Five] I wanna help.
And you will, by staying here and keeping an eye on things.
Make sure nobody does anything stupid.
Warn us if they try.
I'll stay here and back up the kid.
The kid?
Y-younger person.
I'm coming with you.
As much as I appreciate the offer... [solara] If you plan on taking that Garrison, you're gonna need the extra body.
You're just gonna get in the way.
I'm former special forces, black ops, SDC.
Stellar Defense Corp.
Both:
Really?
- Yeah, really.
- Wow.
[Solara] It was on my résumé.
- You did read my résumé, right?
- Skimmed it.
Come on, it was super long.
You don't have to do this.
[Solara] I wanna help you save your friend.
Plus, I have to show this guy up, so...
[Sighs]
[Three] Where the hell are all the guards?
[Two] I don't like this.
You guys take this hallway.
♪♪
♪♪
[Two] No resistance.
Nothing on this end.
[Two] You guys in position?
- Yeah.
- [Two] Count of three.
One, two, three!
[Muffled yelling]
[Muffled yelling]
Six...
[Solara] Wait!
[Adrian] Hey, there you are.
[Five] Yeah, I was asked to keep an eye on things.
This spot gives me the best view.
So what's your story?
Wh-what do you mean?
You're, what, 16?
You're hanging with the most infamous mercenaries in the galaxy.
- How'd you manage that?
- I stowed away on their ship.
Okay, but when they found you, why'd they keep you?
Why didn't they just...
- Space me?
- [Adrian] Mm-hmm.
I don't know, but...
I'm one of them now.
I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
From what I hear, they're not exactly...
Not exactly what?
According to Tabor, they're great earners, but kind of volatile.
Yeah.
How long has Tabor been their handler?
Awhile.
He repped the original crew.
- Original crew?
- Yeah.
Boone, Ryo, Shrike, and Jasper.
Wait, Shrike and Jasper?
- What happened to them?
- I can't be sure, but I think Portia happened to them.
[Explosion booming] What was that?
[Screaming] Two, are you there?
Three, this is Five.
Can you hear me?
[Garrison guard A]Let's go, let's go.
On your knees.
- Look.
- Shit.
[Garrison guard A] Round them up!
All of 'em.
Let's go!
Two, Three, are you there?
Over?
Let's go!
Get 'em on their knees.
It's happening.
They're taking over the facility.
[Voice] Not to worry.
We're on our way.
[Turrence] Copy.
[Garrison guard B] Freeze!
[Guns cock]
- Do you have a gun?
- No, I don't have a gun.
I didn't think I needed one, because I have a bodyguard.
[Two] Five, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
What's going on?
We heard an explosion.
[Two] We're all fine.
We're almost at your position.
[Five] Be careful.
Why?
What's going on?
[Five] The Traugott guards just took the facility.
Adrian and I are up on a second level walkway.
They haven't spotted us yet.
We can see everything that's going on from here.
Okay, I need details.
Exactly what's going on?
Who's where?
Okay, listen up.
Traugott is back in charge, so things are gonna be different around here.
You are effectively prisoners.
Until the arrival of reinforcements, you'll eat when we tell you, sleep when we tell you.
You will do what we tell you!
- What if they don't come?
- What was that?
What if your reinforcements don't come?
Then you'll have lots of time to get used to things.
[Garrison guard A] We've confiscated your weapons.
We need to know if you're hiding any more.
We also wanna know who's responsible for the attack on our Garrison.
We'll trade you for the identity of whoever set the explosives that killed our people.
You are not in a position to make offers.
I want names.
Someone is gonna be punished.
Might as well be the guilty parties.
Names!
[Six] No one's being punished.
No one else is dying today.
Put your weapons down.
It's over.
Yeah, damn right it's over.
Get down on your knees with the rest of 'em.
- No.
- What was that?
[Two] He said no.
Drop your weapons.
- And then what?
- [Six] I meant what I said.
Please don't make me a liar.
Do it.
Do it.
- Are you serious?
- [Two] Down on your knees.
Hands behind your heads.
Now.
[Sighs]
Made any decisions?
[Sighs] Yeah.
We're gonna send off with the next supply ship, arrange for the authorities to pick them up at the closest station.
Hand the investigation over to the G.A.
Are you sure you wanna do that?
What do you mean?
Someone has to be responsible for setting off that blast.
I know those guards may be denying
- any involvement now, but...
- I don't think they did it.
What the hell are you saying?
It was one of my people?
Uh, it was someone who wanted to trigger this conflict,
- and they succeeded.
- But why?
Listen up, I've got news for you.
You don't need to worry about Traugott Corp anymore.
We received your message, and we're here to help.
They call me The General.
Welcome to the revolution.
What the hell are you doing here?
[The General] Hello, Griff.
[Chuckles]
It's been awhile.
Don't listen to this man.
He's a liar and a mass murderer.
He's responsible for the deaths of 10,000 innocent civilians on the Hyadum-12 space station.
Well, I'm not the only one responsible for that particular attack.
But I don't deny it, because those civilians weren't so innocent.
They're complicit in a system that supports inequality and favors corporate rights over the rights of the workers.
And yes...
I've shed blood, and I have no regrets, because I fight for the weak, the defenseless,
the downtrodden.
I fight for the oppressed.
[The General] And I will fight for you.
You don't belong here.
I was invited.
- By who?
- [Turrence] By me.
He helped other colonies gain their independence, and he'll do the same for us.
You people stood up to the corp system.
That takes guts.
But you're gonna need a lot more than that if you're gonna survive what's coming.
You're gonna need organization, leadership.
That's something that I can give you.
Don't accept his offer.
Turn him away.
How can you ask that of me?
My people need help.
Who can we rely on when you leave?
[Two] Come on.
It's time to go.
[The android] Your ability to fashion virtual constructs is impressive.
It's wasted on this rather simplistic design, though.
Wouldn't you agree?
I can sense your presence is something far beyond a simple program.
You're complex.
I'm hoping we can talk.
I can leave, but you know I'll be back.
Now that we know you're here, we will find you...
Eventually.
I know you.
Yes, you do.
Hello, Android.
[Dalla] Are you there?
Can you hear me?
Please.
- Dalla?
- [Dalla] You have to come back.
- What's going on?
- The General.
He's rounded up prisoners, and he's g...
I don't know.
[Gunshots, screaming]
[Radio feedback]
Wait, Six.
Wait.
Six!
[The General] This is the price to be paid for trying to take away our freedom.
Well, well, speak of the devil.
[The general] He and his people are outsiders.
They work as hired guns for the corporations.
They seem to think they can come here and tell you what's best for you.
Now you show them that you're with us now.
Cowards!
You may not agree with my ways, but you have to admit that I am the best chance these people have for survival.
So don't go start... [screaming, gasping]
Drop 'em.
[Turrence] You heard him.
Now!
[Two] So what now?
Now... you go back to the ship and leave.
You mean we go back to our ship, don't you?
We're not leaving you behind.
Uh, don't think of it as leaving me behind then.
Think of it as leaving me to move forward.
You're serious?
These people need direction, leadership.
And I've been talking about wanting to do something that'll make difference, and here's my chance.
There are other ways to help.
[Six] You're right.
The "Raza" can make a difference, you know, be... become a symbol of hope for these people and others like them.
I'll let 'em know that they have a powerful ally backing them.
But you don't need me for that.
They need me more, if they'll have me, that is.
We'd be honored.
It's settled then.
If you're sure about this.
Yeah.
[Whispers] All right.
- We'll be checking in on you.
- You better.
Guess I'm the last man standing.
[Six chuckles]
Do some good.
Yeah.
I'm gonna miss you.
[Six] I'll miss you too.
But you know where to find me.
[Chuckles]
You stay strong, and watch over them.
I will.
[Sighs]
[Chuckles]
[Two] Okay, where to?
- What do you mean?
- Where are we dropping you off?
Actually, we were kinda hoping maybe we could stay with you guys for awhile.
[Three] You wanna stay here on our ship?
It's... it's not like we wouldn't pull our weight.
Solara's pretty handy.
And obviously, you know what I bring to the table.
We do?
Who knows what happened to Tabor?
We may never see him again.
But in the meantime, I'm running his clients.
I have all of his contacts.
And many of his annoying habits.
We can't just dump them.
Sure we can.
[Sighs]
You don't know what it's like out there with this war going on.
It's not safe.
[Two] Trust me, it's not safe here either.
It would just be for a little while, until we can get back on our feet.
No.
- Fine, you can stay for now...
- Oh.
But he's your responsibility.
Keep him out of trouble.
Uh...
- Five?
- Hey.
Do you have a moment?
Uh, I don't feel like talking right now.
It's not about Six.
It's about someone else.
[Two] Are you saying Sarah's alive?
[Five] Uh, yes and no.
When her stasis pod died,
I was able to rescue her digital consciousness.
Whenever you go into a deep sleep, your consciousness gets digitally uploaded into a database designed to keep the mind actively stimulated, and avoid mental atrophy over long hauls.
It gets downloaded back as part of the revival process.
[Two] So instead of downloading this digital consciousness back into her dying body, you transferred it to the ship's database?
Not at first.
I didn't know how.
I kept it on a separate storage device.
And it wasn't until recently that I was able to figure out a way to actually upload it into the computer.
Well, why didn't you tell us any of this sooner?
[Five] Because I didn't know it was gonna work, and I didn't wanna get anyone's hopes up.
So you're saying Sarah is alive as a computer program?
[Five] Well, it's a lot more complicated than that.
[The android] She's a sentient consciousness confined to our ship's database, but she has created her own virtual reality within it.
You can neurally connect to her world, visit her if you like.
I know she wants to see you.
I'm sorry.
[Ryo] You are this galaxy's most fearsome and formidable...
Mercenaries, bounty hunters, professional soldiers, assassins, the very best at what you do.
Your mission is two-fold.
Take back what's mine, and take out the crew of the "Raza."

Previously on "Dark Matter"...
The summit on EOS-7 will come under attack, and the result will be all-out corporate war.
War changes everything.
Now it's all about new alliances.
Tabor Calchek.
He gets the jobs, we do the jobs.
Oh, Portia.
With the Blink Drive, you just disappear from one place and reappear somewhere else.
Let my scientists study it.
The android thinks the Ishida scientist tampered with it.
Sarah?
It's me, Five.
What's the situation, Corporal?
A ship just dropped out of FTL.
It's the reinforcements.
They've finally arrived.
It's not reinforcements, sir.
Satellites sensors confirm it's a Ferrous Corp ship.
Code blue.
- Get a lock on their position.
- Tracking, sir.
- I've got a lock.
- Prep the missiles,
- ready the perimeter guns.
- Missiles are prepped.
Perimeter guns are ready.
Awaiting your command.
Open a surface to ship communication.
Yes, sir.
- Go ahead, sir.
- This is Captain Lars Darrow, commanding officer of the Cepheus-5.
Security detachment.
This is a Traugott colony.
Your presence here is in violation of interstellar law.
Retreat beyond the territorial zone, or face the consequences.
They're powering up weapons.
Defensive protocols.
Prepare for aerial assault.
They've just launched a nuke.
What's that?
Another ship just dropped out of FTL,
- and it's opened fire.
- On the Ferrous Corp ship?
On the nuke.
Nuke intercepted and destroyed.
The ships are exchanging fire.
The Ferrous Corp ship is jumping to FTL.
It's gone.
Open up a comm line to the other vessel.
Cepheus-5, this is the "Raza."
You're welcome.
*DARK MATTER Season 03 Episode 03 Title: "Welcome to the Revolution"
We received word that Ferrous Corp had started launching strikes on rival assets in the outer colonies.
Figured it was just a matter of time before they set their sights on us.
Well, fortunately for you, we were in the area when they did.
And to what do we owe your timely intervention, Raza?
Luck.
We're actually here to pick up a friend.
- A friend?
- Tabor Calchek.
He was with a group who recently found refuge here.
Yes, we took in a large group of displaced citizens
- a couple weeks ago.
- Great.
We're sending a shuttle down to pick him up.
I'm afraid that won't be possible, Raza.
- Why not?
- This colony's under lockdown, pending the arrival of corporate military reinforcements.
While I appreciate your desire to keep the peace,
I hope you can appreciate my desire to rescue a friend.
Your friend's safety will be ensured until the lockdown is lifted.
When I said we were sending down a shuttle,
I wasn't asking for permission.
This colony houses a Traugott munitions factory.
If he's telling the truth, and he's got an in, it's worth checking out.
If he's telling the truth.
Guy's a thieving, scheming opportunist.
Yeah, yeah.
Hello?
Hello?
Can we just skip to the part where you come out of hiding and get the jump on us?
There.
That's better.
What do you want?
We're here to pick up a friend.
- You with Traugott?
- No, we're not.
Then how'd you get here?
You're telling us security just let you fly right in?
- We didn't give 'em a choice.
- You're lying.
Hey, we just saved all your asses by taking out that nuke before it could level
- this entire colony.
- Wait, stop, hang on.
It's okay.
They're with me.
Portia?
Thanks for coming to pick me up.
- You are not Tabor.
- No, not yet.
Oh, right, the amnesia thing.
Tabor told me.
Adrian Maro, Tabor's former assistant.
Former?
You mean Tabor's...
Yep, gone.
Soon as the war started, cashed in his savings, and just took off.
Left me a good-bye message, his place.
- And his contact list?
- Yeah.
That transmission you got wasn't from him.
Obviously, I sent it.
But I figured I'd explain once you got here.
- Okay, start explaining.
- Well, Tabor's gone, so I'm taking over his operation.
I was his apprentice.
Now I'm your new handler.
So we came all the way out here for you?
Well, you did save all these lives,
- so there's that.
- Friends of yours?
Friends?
You telling me you don't recognize who they are?
They are the baddest of bads, the deadliest of dead-shots, this galaxy's most notorious,
- most dangerous...
- Yeah.
- Most despicable...
- Whoa.
- Sorry, too much?
- Okay.
We're the crew of the "Raza."
The "Raza"?
Why didn't you say so?
Come on, let's get you a drink.
Impressive.
When do you graduate from the Academy?
Next year.
Come back to me when you've completed your training then.
There may be a place for you among my royal guard.
Yes, Heika, I would be honored.
Teku, have you come to do a little sparring?
Swordplay is the one thing I cannot teach you, Heika.
Where is Han-Shireikan?
Off-world.
She's meeting with General Caius.
Respectfully, Misaki's role is not to act as mediator between you and your Generals.
Her duty is here at the court, protecting her emperor.
Her emperor is perfectly capable of protecting himself.
Besides, her temporary absence is... better... for the both of us.
You know, you surprise me.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I mean, it's obvious there's no love lost between you two.
Misaki and I hold very different opinions on many issues, but if there's one thing we can agree on, it's our desire to support your rule.
Teku, ever the diplomat.
I heard about the loss of our research facility and the Blink Drive.
Your former friends have hurt us badly.
Yes.
And I'm in the process... of planning my response.
Yeah, our transport ship ended up getting redirected to this planet.
I barely got out with a few of Tabor's personal items and the clothes on my back.
Is it my imagination, or are we being followed?
- What do you mean?
- No, it's not your imagination.
- It's your damn eyes.
- Introductions are in order.
This is my bodyguard, Solara Shockley.
What?
Bodyguard?
What's a little twerp like you need a bodyguard for?
Little twerps in this line of work need them most of all.
Okay, here's the deal.
These workers are fed up
- with their terrible working conditions.
- Uh-huh.
Traugott has all but abandoned this facility and the guards stationed here, because they're too busy with the war, so I've convinced the workers to take advantage of the situation,
- and proclaim their independence.
- Why?
Well, so they can cast off the yolk of oppression,
- and finally taste freedom.
- No... ..what's in it for you?
Oh, a 10% commission on future profits as their union representative.
You know, you do make a pretty good table.
Well...
This has been a Traugott operation going on 30 years.
Put up with a lot over that time, low pay, unsafe working conditions.
But we've been making a lot of noise lately, and the Traugott guards don't like it.
They're getting nervous.
They came in here the other day.
They tried to arrest Zem here for anti-corporate activities.
We wouldn't let 'em.
They're holed up in a Garrison about four clicks from here.
We have the bodies, but they have more guns, and that's the problem.
Wouldn't be if you don't attack them.
They're a danger to Zem, to all of us, so long as they're here,
- Better safe than sorry, I say.
- There's nothing safe about picking a fight with a superior enemy.
Well, that's...
Where maybe you can assist us.
Help us take out that Garrison with your shuttle.
- Why don't we wait and see?
- This is not our fight.
Uh, what she means is...
We're not fighting your battle for you.
Why don't we give you two some time?
I am not signing on for this.
I'm not saying we commit, but let's not take anything off the table just yet.
We're not going down this road.
But this is exactly what we've been talking about, helping people in situations like this.
No, this is what you've been talking about.
I never said I'd be willing to get involved in a territorial dispute that has nothing to do with us.
Fine.
I've been talking, but you seem to be listening.
This is an opportunity to... to help,
- to do the right thing.
- And then what?
Watch it blow up in our faces again?
- We make terrible heroes.
- Okay.
If you're looking for a practical angle, how 'bout this.
The colonies we help now will be in a position to help us in the future, if we should ever need them.
Supplies, information, safe haven.
In this case, munitions.
It's dangerous, yes, but it's the right call, and you know it.
What the hell?
He's dead.
Oh, my God.
We told them this equipment was unsafe.
We asked them for a safety upgrade, and they refused.
I mean, this whole thing could've been avoided.
Bullshit.
You think that was an accident?
Someone planted explosives.
Traugott was gunning for Zem.
Well, they got him.
Those Traugott bastards.
You don't know for certain that it was them.
Who the hell else would it be?
They came for Zem, and when they realized they couldn't take him alive, they killed him.
You're not thinking this through.
Ah, no.
For the past two weeks, that's all we've been doing.
Now it's time for action.
You're not prepared for this fight.
You're outgunned.
You said as much yourself.
Hey...
Hey...
I said hey.
If you go through with this, more of you will die.
That's a fact.
So what do you expect us to do then?
Wait for them to hit us again?
No.
You find a way to end this without bloodshed.
And completely ignore the fact that they killed three of ours?
What is it you want?
Revenge or freedom?
'Cause I can help you get one, but not both.
So what do you suggest we do then?
Go to talk to them.
You're telling us to go over there, trust them not to shoot us on sight, and hope they're willing to talk?
Not you.
Me.
That's far enough.
I'm unarmed.
Just here to talk.
Right.
The crew of The Raza, just stopping by to pick up a friend.
We should've blasted you out of the sky when we had the chance.
Look, I'm here to help.
Sure you are.
Whether you wanna admit it or not, you and your security team are screwed.
The workers have turned against you.
You're outnumbered, and you must realize by now that back-up isn't coming.
Now there's two ways this can go down.
You can dig in your heels and... fight for a corporation that's abandoned you, or... you can let me in to talk, and help reach a settlement.
No fighting.
No one dies.
You get to go home to your families.
Either way, this colony is declaring independence, and there's nothing you can do to change that.
Check him for weapons.
Raza, this is Two.
Are you there?
- Yes, Two.
- We're gonna be delayed, but not for long, hopefully.
How's it going up there?
Any closer to fixing the Blink Drive?
No, I'm afraid not.
The damage it suffered was extensive.
It may be beyond repair.
Shit.
I was running a general diagnostic when I discovered something curious.
What does that mean?
A portion of the ship's database has been quarantined.
- Why?
- I'm not sure, but I am running a decrypt program in an effort to force access.
Do you think it's another virus?
No.
In fact, it appears to have been intentionally isolated from the ship's more sensitive programs.
So what are you saying?
Somebody did this on purpose?
Yes... someone with the access codes to our ship's database.
It was one of us.
There was an explosion.
Three workers were killed, including Zem.
And they think we did it?
You tried to arrest him, and failed.
That doesn't mean we wanted him dead.
He was their leader.
You wanted him out of the picture.
We're security contingent.
Our job is to protect Traugott assets, and that includes those workers.
Now we don't wanna start anything, but if they come at us, you can be damn sure we'll be ready for 'em.
Traugott doesn't care about you or this damn colony.
Hell, forget reinforcements.
They couldn't even be bothered to extract you.
This isn't your battle anymore.
And the workers have given you the power to make a deal on their behalf?
We can reinforce any agreement we make.
- We?
- Me and my ship.
You agree to lay down your arms and walk away, and we'll guarantee you safe passage off this planet to the closest neutral space station.
Well, what about that explosion?
If they're convinced we did it, you think they're just gonna let us walk?
You let me worry about that.
We can't let this go.
We gotta answer, blood for blood.
You do that, and this will end badly for everyone.
So what do you suggest we do?
Forget our dead?
Toe the company line?
Claim your independence, but do it without bloodshed.
Show mercy now, so that later, when this war is over, they'll be more likely to seek out a non-violent solution.
And in what reality would a corporation even bother
- negotiating with a colony?
- In a reality where that colony is backed by two dozen other independent colonies.
Show you can govern fairly, and it will go a long way toward convincing others, like the G.A. or The League of Autonomous Worlds, that you deserve a fair shake.
All right.
We'll see how your friend does with the Traugott guard.
But someone...
Someone has to pay for this.
And they will, but not with their lives.
Okay.
Now it's a matter of convincing the rest of my people.
What?
Where's Turrence?
So you think you'll be able to sell this to the workers?
Yeah.
I'm sure I can convince them that this is their best option.
Have to say, you surprise me.
Your reputation may precede you, but it's a long way from reality.
You're a good man.
No, I'm a man who has his good days.
Hey, if this all works out, after the war's over, I'd like to buy you a...
Fire!
Run!
On me!
Now!
Now!
Move it!
Retreat!
Get up!
Move!
Let's go!
I knew we shouldn't have trusted you.
You son of a bitch.
Back off.
I need you to calm your friend down.
She's usually the one calming me down, so this all new territory.
They murdered our friends.
Did you seriously think we were gonna let that go?
You've put one of my crew members at risk.
He put himself at risk by going over there and trying to broker a deal with those bastards.
Okay, everyone put your weapons down.
Now!
You show up out of nowhere, start telling us what to do.
You have no idea what we've been through, risking our asses for a corporate bottom line.
What do you know about it, huh?
Okay, Turrence, just cool off.
Yeah, no, you're right.
We don't know what you've been through, but we do know about dealing with the likes of Traugott.
We were finding you an out, a way to get your freedom maybe without having to deal with reprisals.
You should've listened to us.
Now we have to clean up your mess.
Are you out of your mind?
You think I set you up?
You're saying your people just happened to be
- waiting out there?
- Those weren't my people.
A good man is dead,
- because he trusted you.
- I had nothing do with it.
Say it again.
Say it again!
Tell me how you had nothing to do with it.
Convince me, because if you don't,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your head, and end you!
Why go through all the trouble?
I could've just gotten into my shuttle, and leveled this place with a couple of well-placed missiles.
You think about it, that would've been a best-case scenario for those workers.
They get their independence, and the big bad crew of the "Raza" add to their rep.
I wasn't playing you.
I didn't know.
Well, I feel sorry for you then.
Why's that?
Because now we're going to respond...
And you're going to help us.
Maybe you should try talking to them first.
Six is the talker.
If he hasn't convinced them by now, nothing we say is gonna change anything.
He's right.
Like it or not, we've been backed into a corner.
We need to force the issue.
Uh, so who's going to make that particular house call?
- Me and Three.
- I wanna help.
And you will, by staying here and keeping an eye on things.
Make sure nobody does anything stupid.
Warn us if they try.
I'll stay here and back up the kid.
The kid?
Y-younger person.
I'm coming with you.
As much as I appreciate the offer...
If you plan on taking that Garrison, you're gonna need the extra body.
You're just gonna get in the way.
I'm former special forces, black ops, SDC.
Stellar Defense Corp.
Both:
Really?
- Yeah, really.
- Wow.
It was on my résumé.
- You did read my résumé, right?
- Skimmed it.
Come on, it was super long.
You don't have to do this.
I wanna help you save your friend.
Plus, I have to show this guy up, so...
Where the hell are all the guards?
I don't like this.
You guys take this hallway.
♪♪
♪♪
No resistance.
Nothing on this end.
You guys in position?
- Yeah.
- Count of three.
One, two, three!
Six...
Wait!
Hey, there you are.
Yeah, I was asked to keep an eye on things.
This spot gives me the best view.
So what's your story?
Wh-what do you mean?
You're, what, 16?
You're hanging with the most infamous mercenaries in the galaxy.
- How'd you manage that?
- I stowed away on their ship.
Okay, but when they found you, why'd they keep you?
Why didn't they just...
- Space me?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't know, but...
I'm one of them now.
I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
From what I hear, they're not exactly...
Not exactly what?
According to Tabor, they're great earners, but kind of volatile.
Yeah.
How long has Tabor been their handler?
Awhile.
He repped the original crew.
- Original crew?
- Yeah.
Boone, Ryo, Shrike, and Jasper.
Wait, Shrike and Jasper?
- What happened to them?
- I can't be sure, but I think Portia happened to them.
What was that?
Two, are you there?
Three, this is Five.
Can you hear me?
Let's go, let's go.
On your knees.
- Look.
- Shit.
Round them up!
All of 'em.
Let's go!
Two, Three, are you there?
Over?
Let's go!
Get 'em on their knees.
It's happening.
They're taking over the facility.
Not to worry.
We're on our way.
Copy.
Freeze!
- Do you have a gun?
- No, I don't have a gun.
I didn't think I needed one, because I have a bodyguard.
Five, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
What's going on?
We heard an explosion.
We're all fine.
We're almost at your position.
Be careful.
Why?
What's going on?
The Traugott guards just took the facility.
Adrian and I are up on a second level walkway.
They haven't spotted us yet.
We can see everything that's going on from here.
Okay, I need details.
Exactly what's going on?
Who's where?
Okay, listen up.
Traugott is back in charge, so things are gonna be different around here.
You are effectively prisoners.
Until the arrival of reinforcements, you'll eat when we tell you, sleep when we tell you.
You will do what we tell you!
- What if they don't come?
- What was that?
What if your reinforcements don't come?
Then you'll have lots of time to get used to things.
We've confiscated your weapons.
We need to know if you're hiding any more.
We also wanna know who's responsible for the attack on our Garrison.
We'll trade you for the identity of whoever set the explosives that killed our people.
You are not in a position to make offers.
I want names.
Someone is gonna be punished.
Might as well be the guilty parties.
Names!
No one's being punished.
No one else is dying today.
Put your weapons down.
It's over.
Yeah, damn right it's over.
Get down on your knees with the rest of 'em.
- No.
- What was that?
He said no.
Drop your weapons.
- And then what?
- I meant what I said.
Please don't make me a liar.
Do it.
Do it.
- Are you serious?
- Down on your knees.
Hands behind your heads.
Now.
Made any decisions?
Yeah.
We're gonna send off with the next supply ship, arrange for the authorities to pick them up at the closest station.
Hand the investigation over to the G.A.
Are you sure you wanna do that?
What do you mean?
Someone has to be responsible for setting off that blast.
I know those guards may be denying
- any involvement now, but...
- I don't think they did it.
What the hell are you saying?
It was one of my people?
Uh, it was someone who wanted to trigger this conflict,
- and they succeeded.
- But why?
Listen up, I've got news for you.
You don't need to worry about Traugott Corp anymore.
We received your message, and we're here to help.
They call me The General.
Welcome to the revolution.
What the hell are you doing here?
Hello, Griff.
It's been awhile.
Don't listen to this man.
He's a liar and a mass murderer.
He's responsible for the deaths of 10,000 innocent civilians on the Hyadum-12 space station.
Well, I'm not the only one responsible for that particular attack.
But I don't deny it, because those civilians weren't so innocent.
They're complicit in a system that supports inequality and favors corporate rights over the rights of the workers.
And yes...
I've shed blood, and I have no regrets, because I fight for the weak, the defenseless,
the downtrodden.
I fight for the oppressed.
And I will fight for you.
You don't belong here.
I was invited.
- By who?
- By me.
He helped other colonies gain their independence, and he'll do the same for us.
You people stood up to the corp system.
That takes guts.
But you're gonna need a lot more than that if you're gonna survive what's coming.
You're gonna need organization, leadership.
That's something that I can give you.
Don't accept his offer.
Turn him away.
How can you ask that of me?
My people need help.
Who can we rely on when you leave?
Come on.
It's time to go.
Your ability to fashion virtual constructs is impressive.
It's wasted on this rather simplistic design, though.
Wouldn't you agree?
I can sense your presence is something far beyond a simple program.
You're complex.
I'm hoping we can talk.
I can leave, but you know I'll be back.
Now that we know you're here, we will find you...
Eventually.
I know you.
Yes, you do.
Hello, Android.
Are you there?
Can you hear me?
Please.
- Dalla?
- You have to come back.
- What's going on?
- The General.
He's rounded up prisoners, and he's g...
I don't know.
Wait, Six.
Wait.
Six!
This is the price to be paid for trying to take away our freedom.
Well, well, speak of the devil.
He and his people are outsiders.
They work as hired guns for the corporations.
They seem to think they can come here and tell you what's best for you.
Now you show them that you're with us now.
Cowards!
You may not agree with my ways, but you have to admit that I am the best chance these people have for survival.
So don't go start...
Drop 'em.
You heard him.
Now!
So what now?
Now... you go back to the ship and leave.
You mean we go back to our ship, don't you?
We're not leaving you behind.
Uh, don't think of it as leaving me behind then.
Think of it as leaving me to move forward.
You're serious?
These people need direction, leadership.
And I've been talking about wanting to do something that'll make difference, and here's my chance.
There are other ways to help.
You're right.
The "Raza" can make a difference, you know, be... become a symbol of hope for these people and others like them.
I'll let 'em know that they have a powerful ally backing them.
But you don't need me for that.
They need me more, if they'll have me, that is.
We'd be honored.
It's settled then.
If you're sure about this.
Yeah.
All right.
- We'll be checking in on you.
- You better.
Guess I'm the last man standing.
Do some good.
Yeah.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you too.
But you know where to find me.
You stay strong, and watch over them.
I will.
Okay, where to?
- What do you mean?
- Where are we dropping you off?
Actually, we were kinda hoping maybe we could stay with you guys for awhile.
You wanna stay here on our ship?
It's... it's not like we wouldn't pull our weight.
Solara's pretty handy.
And obviously, you know what I bring to the table.
We do?
Who knows what happened to Tabor?
We may never see him again.
But in the meantime, I'm running his clients.
I have all of his contacts.
And many of his annoying habits.
We can't just dump them.
Sure we can.
You don't know what it's like out there with this war going on.
It's not safe.
Trust me, it's not safe here either.
It would just be for a little while, until we can get back on our feet.
No.
- Fine, you can stay for now...
- Oh.
But he's your responsibility.
Keep him out of trouble.
Uh...
- Five?
- Hey.
Do you have a moment?
Uh, I don't feel like talking right now.
It's not about Six.
It's about someone else.
Are you saying Sarah's alive?
Uh, yes and no.
When her stasis pod died,
I was able to rescue her digital consciousness.
Whenever you go into a deep sleep, your consciousness gets digitally uploaded into a database designed to keep the mind actively stimulated, and avoid mental atrophy over long hauls.
It gets downloaded back as part of the revival process.
So instead of downloading this digital consciousness back into her dying body, you transferred it to the ship's database?
Not at first.
I didn't know how.
I kept it on a separate storage device.
And it wasn't until recently that I was able to figure out a way to actually upload it into the computer.
Well, why didn't you tell us any of this sooner?
Because I didn't know it was gonna work, and I didn't wanna get anyone's hopes up.
So you're saying Sarah is alive as a computer program?
Well, it's a lot more complicated than that.
She's a sentient consciousness confined to our ship's database, but she has created her own virtual reality within it.
You can neurally connect to her world, visit her if you like.
I know she wants to see you.
I'm sorry.
You are this galaxy's most fearsome and formidable...
Mercenaries, bounty hunters, professional soldiers, assassins, the very best at what you do.
Your mission is two-fold.
Take back what's mine, and take out the crew of the "Raza."

Previously on "Dark Matter"...
The summit on EOS-7 will come under attack, and the result will be all-out corporate war.
War changes everything.
Now it's all about new alliances.
Tabor Calchek.
He gets the jobs, we do the jobs.
Oh, Portia.
With the Blink Drive, you just disappear from one place, and reappear somewhere else.
Let my scientists study it.
The android thinks the Ishida scientist tampered with it.
Sarah?
It's me, Five.
What's the situation, Corporal?
A ship just dropped out of FTL.
It's the reinforcements.
They've finally arrived.
It's not reinforcements, sir.
Satellites sensors confirm it's a Ferrous Corp ship.
Code blue.
- Get a lock on their position.
- Tracking, sir.
- I've got a lock.
- Prep the missiles,
- ready the perimeter guns.
- Missiles are prepped.
Perimeter guns are ready.
Awaiting your command.
Open a surface to ship communication.
Yes, sir.
- Go ahead, sir.
- This is Captain Lars Darrow, commanding officer of the Cepheus-5.
Security detachment.
This is a Traugott colony.
Your presence here is in violation of interstellar law.
Retreat beyond the territorial zone, or face the consequences.
They're powering up weapons.
Defensive protocols.
Prepare for aerial assault.
They've just launched a nuke.
What's that?
Another ship just dropped out of FTL,
- and it's opened fire.
- On the Ferrous Corp ship?
On the nuke.
Nuke intercepted and destroyed.
The ships are exchanging fire.
The Ferrous Corp ship is jumping to FTL.
It's gone.
Open up a comm line to the other vessel.
Cepheus-5, this is the "Raza."
You're welcome.
We received word that Ferrous Corp had started launching strikes on rival assets in the outer colonies.
Figured it was just a matter of time before they set their sights on us.
Well, fortunately for you, we were in the area when they did.
And to what do we owe your timely intervention, Raza?
Luck.
We're actually here to pick up a friend.
- A friend?
- Tabor Calchek.
He was with a group who recently found refuge here.
Yes, we took in a large group of displaced citizens
- a couple weeks ago.
- Great.
We're sending a shuttle down to pick him up.
I'm afraid that won't be possible, Raza.
- Why not?
- This colony's under lockdown, pending the arrival of corporate military reinforcements.
While I appreciate your desire to keep the peace,
I hope you can appreciate my desire to rescue a friend.
Your friend's safety will be ensured until the lockdown is lifted.
When I said we were sending down a shuttle,
I wasn't asking for permission.
This colony houses a Traugott munitions factory.
If he's telling the truth, and he's got an in, it's worth checking out.
If he's telling the truth.
Guy's a thieving, scheming opportunist.
Yeah, yeah.
Hello?
Hello?
Can we just skip to the part where you come out of hiding and get the jump on us?
There.
That's better.
What do you want?
We're here to pick up a friend.
- You with Traugott?
- No, we're not.
Then how'd you get here?
You're telling us security just let you fly right in?
- We didn't give 'em a choice.
- You're lying.
Hey, we just saved all your asses by taking out that nuke before it could level
- this entire colony.
- Wait, stop, hang on.
It's okay.
They're with me.
Portia?
Thanks for coming to pick me up.
- You are not Tabor.
- No, not yet.
Oh, right, the amnesia thing.
Tabor told me.
Adrian Maro, Tabor's former assistant.
Former?
You mean Tabor's...
Yep, gone.
Soon as the war started, cashed in his savings, and just took off.
Left me a good-bye message, his place.
- And his contact list?
- Yeah.
That transmission you got wasn't from him.
Obviously, I sent it.
But I figured I'd explain once you got here.
- Okay, start explaining.
- Well, Tabor's gone, so I'm taking over his operation.
I was his apprentice.
Now I'm your new handler.
So we came all the way out here for you?
Well, you did save all these lives,
- so there's that.
- Friends of yours?
Friends?
You telling me you don't recognize who they are?
They are the baddest of bads, the deadliest of dead-shots, this galaxy's most notorious,
- most dangerous...
- Yeah.
- Most despicable...
- Whoa.
- Sorry, too much?
- Okay.
We're the crew of the "Raza."
The "Raza"?
Why didn't you say so?
Come on, let's get you a drink.
Impressive.
When do you graduate from the Academy?
Next year.
Come back to me when you've completed your training then.
There may be a place for you among my royal guard.
Yes, Heika, I would be honored.
Teku, have you come to do a little sparring?
Swordplay is the one thing I cannot teach you, Heika.
Where is Han-Shireikan?
Off-world.
She's meeting with General Caius.
Respectfully, Misaki's role is not to act as mediator between you and your generals.
Her duty is here at the court, protecting her emperor.
Her emperor is perfectly capable of protecting himself.
Besides, her temporary absence is... better for the both of us.
You know, you surprise me.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I mean, it's obvious there's no love lost between you two.
Misaki and I hold very different opinions on many issues, but if there's one thing we can agree on, it's our desire to support your rule.
Teku, ever the diplomat.
I heard about the loss of our research facility and the Blink Drive.
Your former friends have hurt us badly.
Yes.
And I'm in the process... of planning my response.
Yeah, our transport ship ended up getting redirected to this planet.
I barely got out with a few of Tabor's personal items and the clothes on my back.
Is it my imagination, or are we being followed?
- What do you mean?
- No, it's not your imagination.
- It's your damn eyes.
- Introductions are in order.
This is my bodyguard, Solara Shockley.
What?
Bodyguard?
What's a little twerp like you need a bodyguard for?
Little twerps in this line of work need them most of all.
Okay, here's the deal.
These workers are fed up with their terrible working conditions.
Uh-huh.
Traugott has all but abandoned this facility and the guards stationed here, because they're too busy with the war, so I've convinced the workers to take advantage of the situation,
- and proclaim their independence.
- Why?
Well, so they can cast off the yolk of oppression,
- and finally taste freedom.
- No... what's in it for you?
Oh, a 10% commission on future profits as their union representative.
You know, you do make a pretty good table.
Well...
This has been a Traugott operation going on 30 years.
Put up with a lot over that time, low pay, unsafe working conditions.
But we've been making a lot of noise lately, and the Traugott guards don't like it.
They're getting nervous.
They came in here the other day.
They tried to arrest Zem here for anti-corporate activities.
We wouldn't let 'em.
They're holed up in a garrison about four clicks from here.
We have the bodies, but they have more guns, and that's the problem.
Wouldn't be if you don't attack them.
They're a danger to Zem, to all of us, so long as they're here,
- Better safe than sorry, I say.
- There's nothing safe about picking a fight with a superior enemy.
Well, that's...
Where maybe you can assist us.
Help us take out that garrison with your shuttle.
- Why don't we wait and see?
- This is not our fight.
Uh, what she means is...
We're not fighting your battle for you.
Why don't we give you two some time?
I am not signing on for this.
I'm not saying we commit, but let's not take anything off the table just yet.
We're not going down this road.
But this is exactly what we've been talking about, helping people in situations like this.
No, this is what you've been talking about.
I never said I'd be willing to get involved in a territorial dispute that has nothing to do with us.
Fine.
I've been talking, but you seem to be listening.
This is an opportunity to... to help,
- to do the right thing.
- And then what?
Watch it blow up in our faces again?
- We make terrible heroes.
- Okay.
If you're looking for a practical angle, how 'bout this.
The colonies we help now will be in a position to help us in the future, if we should ever need them.
Supplies, information, safe haven.
In this case, munitions.
It's dangerous, yes, but it's the right call, and you know it.
What the hell?
He's dead.
Oh, my God.
We told them this equipment was unsafe.
We asked them for a safety upgrade, and they refused.
I mean, this whole thing could've been avoided.
Bullshit.
You think that was an accident?
Someone planted explosives.
Traugott was gunning for Zem.
Well, they got him.
Those Traugott bastards.
You don't know for certain that it was them.
Who the hell else would it be?
They came for Zem, and when they realized they couldn't take him alive, they killed him.
You're not thinking this through.
Ah, no.
For the past two weeks, that's all we've been doing.
Now it's time for action.
You're not prepared for this fight.
You're outgunned.
You said as much yourself.
Hey...
Hey...
I said hey.
If you go through with this, more of you will die.
That's a fact.
So what do you expect us to do then?
Wait for them to hit us again?
No.
You find a way to end this without bloodshed.
And completely ignore the fact that they killed three of ours?
What is it you want?
Revenge or freedom?
'Cause I can help you get one, but not both.
So what do you suggest we do then?
Go to talk to them.
You're telling us to go over there, trust them not to shoot us on sight, and hope they're willing to talk?
Not you.
Me.
That's far enough.
I'm unarmed.
Just here to talk.
Right.
The crew of The Raza, just stopping by to pick up a friend.
We should've blasted you out of the sky when we had the chance.
Look, I'm here to help.
Sure you are.
Whether you wanna admit it or not, you and your security team are screwed.
The workers have turned against you.
You're outnumbered, and you must realize by now that back-up isn't coming.
Now there's two ways this can go down.
You can dig in your heels and fight for a corporation that's abandoned you, or you can let me in to talk, and help reach a settlement.
No fighting.
No one dies.
You get to go home to your families.
Either way, this colony is declaring independence, and there's nothing you can do to change that.
Check him for weapons.
Raza, this is Two.
Are you there?
- Yes, Two.
- We're gonna be delayed, but not for long, hopefully.
How's it going up there?
Any closer to fixing the Blink Drive?
No, I'm afraid not.
The damage it suffered was extensive.
It may be beyond repair.
Shit.
I was running a general diagnostic when I discovered something curious.
What does that mean?
A portion of the ship's database has been quarantined.
- Why?
- I'm not sure, but I am running a decrypt program in an effort to force access.
Do you think it's another virus?
No.
In fact, it appears to have been intentionally isolated from the ship's more sensitive programs.
So what are you saying?
Somebody did this on purpose?
Yes... someone with the access codes to our ship's database.
It was one of us.
There was an explosion.
Three workers were killed, including Zem.
And they think we did it?
You tried to arrest him, and failed.
That doesn't mean we wanted him dead.
He was their leader.
You wanted him out of the picture.
We're security contingent.
Our job is to protect Traugott assets, and that includes those workers.
Now we don't wanna start anything, but if they come at us, you can be damn sure we'll be ready for 'em.
Traugott doesn't care about you or this damn colony.
Hell, forget reinforcements.
They couldn't even be bothered to extract you.
This isn't your battle anymore.
And the workers have given you the power to make a deal on their behalf?
We can reinforce any agreement we make.
- We?
- Me and my ship.
You agree to lay down your arms and walk away, and we'll guarantee you safe passage off this planet to the closest neutral space station.
Well, what about that explosion?
If they're convinced we did it, you think they're just gonna let us walk?
You let me worry about that.
We can't let this go.
We gotta answer, blood for blood.
You do that, and this will end badly for everyone.
So what do you suggest we do?
Forget our dead?
Toe the company line?
Claim your independence, but do it without bloodshed.
Show mercy now, so that later, when this war is over, they'll be more likely to seek out a non-violent solution.
And in what reality would a corporation even bother
- negotiating with a colony?
- In a reality where that colony is backed by two dozen other independent colonies.
Show you can govern fairly, and it will go a long way toward convincing others, like the G.A. or The League of Autonomous Worlds, that you deserve a fair shake.
All right.
We'll see how your friend does with the Traugott guard.
But someone...
Someone has to pay for this.
And they will, but not with their lives.
Okay.
Now it's a matter of convincing the rest of my people.
What?
Where's Turrence?
So you think you'll be able to sell this to the workers?
Yeah.
I'm sure I can convince them that this is their best option.
Have to say, you surprise me.
Your reputation may precede you, but it's a long way from reality.
You're a good man.
No, I'm a man who has his good days.
Hey, if this all works out, after the war's over, I'd like to buy you a...
Fire!
Run!
On me!
Now!
Now!
Move it!
Retreat!
Get up!
Move!
Let's go!
I knew we shouldn't have trusted you.
You son of a bitch.
Back off.
I need you to calm your friend down.
She's usually the one calming me down, so this all new territory.
They murdered our friends.
Did you seriously think we were gonna let that go?
You've put one of my crew members at risk.
He put himself at risk by going over there and trying to broker a deal with those bastards.
Okay, everyone put your weapons down.
Now!
You show up out of nowhere, start telling us what to do.
You have no idea what we've been through, risking our asses for a corporate bottom line.
What do you know about it, huh?
Okay, Turrence, just cool off.
Yeah, no, you're right.
We don't know what you've been through, but we do know about dealing with the likes of Traugott.
We were finding you an out, a way to get your freedom maybe without having to deal with reprisals.
You should've listened to us.
Now we have to clean up your mess.
Are you out of your mind?
You think I set you up?
You're saying your people just happened to be
- waiting out there?
- Those weren't my people.
A good man is dead,
- because he trusted you.
- I had nothing do with it.
Say it again.
Say it again!
Tell me how you had nothing to do with it.
Convince me, because if you don't,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your head, and end you!
Why go through all the trouble?
I could've just gotten into my shuttle, and leveled this place with a couple of well-placed missiles.
You think about it, that would've been a best-case scenario for those workers.
They get their independence, and the big bad crew of the "Raza" add to their rep.
I wasn't playing you.
I didn't know.
Well, I feel sorry for you then.
Why's that?
Because now we're going to respond...
And you're going to help us.
Maybe you should try talking to them first.
Six is the talker.
If he hasn't convinced them by now, nothing we say is gonna change anything.
He's right.
Like it or not, we've been backed into a corner.
We need to force the issue.
Uh, so who's going to make that particular house call?
- Me and Three.
- I wanna help.
And you will, by staying here and keeping an eye on things.
Make sure nobody does anything stupid.
Warn us if they try.
I'll stay here and back up the kid.
The kid?
Y-younger person.
I'm coming with you.
As much as I appreciate the offer...
If you plan on taking that garrison, you're gonna need the extra body.
You're just gonna get in the way.
I'm former special forces, black ops, SDC.
Stellar Defense Corp.
Both:
Really?
- Yeah, really.
- Wow.
It was on my résumé.
- You did read my résumé, right?
- Skimmed it.
Come on, it was super long.
You don't have to do this.
I wanna help you save your friend.
Plus, I have to show this guy up, so...
Where the hell are all the guards?
I don't like this.
You guys take this hallway.
No resistance.
Nothing on this end.
You guys in position?
- Yeah.
- Count of three.
One, two, three!
Six...
Wait!
Hey, there you are.
Yeah, I was asked to keep an eye on things.
This spot gives me the best view.
So what's your story?
Wh-what do you mean?
You're, what, 16?
You're hanging with the most infamous mercenaries in the galaxy.
- How'd you manage that?
- I stowed away on their ship.
Okay, but when they found you, why'd they keep you?
Why didn't they just...
- Space me?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't know, but I'm one of them now.
I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
From what I hear, they're not exactly...
Not exactly what?
According to Tabor, they're great earners, but kind of volatile.
Yeah.
How long has Tabor been their handler?
Awhile.
He repped the original crew.
- Original crew?
- Yeah.
Boone, Ryo, Shrike, and Jasper.
Wait, Shrike and Jasper?
- What happened to them?
- I can't be sure, but I think Portia happened to them.
What was that?
Two, are you there?
Three, this is Five.
Can you hear me?
Let's go, let's go.
On your knees.
- Look.
- Shit.
Round them up!
All of 'em.
Let's go!
Two, Three, are you there?
Over?
Let's go!
Get 'em on their knees.
It's happening.
They're taking over the facility.
Not to worry.
We're on our way.
Copy.
Freeze!
- Do you have a gun?
- No, I don't have a gun.
I didn't think I needed one, because I have a bodyguard.
Five, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
What's going on?
We heard an explosion.
We're all fine.
We're almost at your position.
Be careful.
Why?
What's going on?
The Traugott guards just took the facility.
Adrian and I are up on a second level walkway.
They haven't spotted us yet.
We can see everything that's going on from here.
Okay, I need details.
Exactly what's going on?
Who's where?
Okay, listen up.
Traugott is back in charge, so things are gonna be different around here.
You are effectively prisoners.
Until the arrival of reinforcements, you'll eat when we tell you, sleep when we tell you.
You will do what we tell you!
- What if they don't come?
- What was that?
What if your reinforcements don't come?
Then you'll have lots of time to get used to things.
We've confiscated your weapons.
We need to know if you're hiding any more.
We also wanna know who's responsible for the attack on our garrison.
We'll trade you for the identity of whoever set the explosives that killed our people.
You are not in a position to make offers.
I want names.
Someone is gonna be punished.
Might as well be the guilty parties.
Names!
No one's being punished.
No one else is dying today.
Put your weapons down.
It's over.
Yeah, damn right it's over.
Get down on your knees with the rest of 'em.
- No.
- What was that?
He said no.
Drop your weapons.
- And then what?
- I meant what I said.
Please don't make me a liar.
Do it.
Do it.
- Are you serious?
- Down on your knees.
Hands behind your heads.
Now.
Made any decisions?
Yeah.
We're gonna send off with the next supply ship, arrange for the authorities to pick them up at the closest station.
Hand the investigation over to the G.A.
Are you sure you wanna do that?
What do you mean?
Someone has to be responsible for setting off that blast.
I know those guards may be denying
- any involvement now, but...
- I don't think they did it.
What the hell are you saying?
It was one of my people?
Uh, it was someone who wanted to trigger this conflict,
- and they succeeded.
- But why?
Listen up, I've got news for you.
You don't need to worry about Traugott Corp anymore.
We received your message, and we're here to help.
They call me The General.
Welcome to the revolution.
What the hell are you doing here?
Hello, Griff.
It's been awhile.
Don't listen to this man.
He's a liar and a mass murderer.
He's responsible for the deaths of 10,000 innocent civilians on the Hyadum-12 space station.
Well, I'm not the only one responsible for that particular attack.
But I don't deny it, because those civilians weren't so innocent.
They're complicit in a system that supports inequality and favors corporate rights over the rights of the workers.
And yes...
I've shed blood, and I have no regrets, because I fight for the weak, the defenseless, the downtrodden.
I fight for the oppressed.
And I will fight for you.
You don't belong here.
I was invited.
- By who?
- By me.
He helped other colonies gain their independence, and he'll do the same for us.
You people stood up to the corp system.
That takes guts.
But you're gonna need a lot more than that if you're gonna survive what's coming.
You're gonna need organization, leadership.
That's something that I can give you.
Don't accept his offer.
Turn him away.
How can you ask that of me?
My people need help.
Who can we rely on when you leave?
Come on.
It's time to go.
Your ability to fashion virtual constructs is impressive.
It's wasted on this rather simplistic design, though.
Wouldn't you agree?
I can sense your presence is something far beyond a simple program.
You're complex.
I'm hoping we can talk.
I can leave, but you know I'll be back.
Now that we know you're here, we will find you...
Eventually.
I know you.
Yes, you do.
Hello, Android.
Are you there?
Can you hear me?
Please.
- Dalla?
- You have to come back.
- What's going on?
- The General.
He's rounded up prisoners, and he's g...
I don't know.
Wait, Six.
Wait.
Six!
This is the price to be paid for trying to take away our freedom.
Well, well, speak of the devil.
He and his people are outsiders.
They work as hired guns for the corporations.
They seem to think they can come here and tell you what's best for you.
Now you show them that you're with us now.
Cowards!
You may not agree with my ways, but you have to admit that I am the best chance these people have for survival.
So don't go start...
Drop 'em.
You heard him.
Now!
So what now?
Now you go back to the ship and leave.
You mean we go back to our ship, don't you?
We're not leaving you behind.
Uh, don't think of it as leaving me behind then.
Think of it as leaving me to move forward.
You're serious?
These people need direction, leadership.
And I've been talking about wanting to do something that'll make difference, and here's my chance.
There are other ways to help.
You're right.
The "Raza" can make a difference, you know, be... become a symbol of hope for these people and others like them.
I'll let 'em know that they have a powerful ally backing them.
But you don't need me for that.
They need me more, if they'll have me, that is.
We'd be honored.
It's settled then.
If you're sure about this.
Yeah.
All right.
- We'll be checking in on you.
- You better.
Guess I'm the last man standing.
Do some good.
Yeah.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you too.
But you know where to find me.
You stay strong, and watch over them.
I will.
Okay, where to?
- What do you mean?
- Where are we dropping you off?
Actually, we were kinda hoping maybe we could stay with you guys for awhile.
You wanna stay here on our ship?
It's... it's not like we wouldn't pull our weight.
Solara's pretty handy.
And obviously, you know what I bring to the table.
We do?
Who knows what happened to Tabor?
We may never see him again.
But in the meantime, I'm running his clients.
I have all of his contacts.
And many of his annoying habits.
We can't just dump them.
Sure we can.
You don't know what it's like out there with this war going on.
It's not safe.
Trust me, it's not safe here either.
It would just be for a little while, until we can get back on our feet.
No.
- Fine, you can stay for now...
- Oh.
But he's your responsibility.
Keep him out of trouble.
Uh...
- Five?
- Hey.
Do you have a moment?
Uh, I don't feel like talking right now.
It's not about Six.
It's about someone else.
Are you saying Sarah's alive?
Uh, yes and no.
When her stasis pod died,
I was able to rescue her digital consciousness.
Whenever you go into a deep sleep, your consciousness gets digitally uploaded into a database designed to keep the mind actively stimulated, and avoid mental atrophy over long hauls.
It gets downloaded back as part of the revival process.
So instead of downloading this digital consciousness back into her dying body, you transferred it to the ship's database?
Not at first.
I didn't know how.
I kept it on a separate storage device.
And it wasn't until recently that I was able to figure out a way to actually upload it into the computer.
Well, why didn't you tell us any of this sooner?
Because I didn't know it was gonna work, and I didn't wanna get anyone's hopes up.
So you're saying Sarah is alive as a computer program?
Well, it's a lot more complicated than that.
She's a sentient consciousness confined to our ship's database, but she has created her own virtual reality within it.
You can neurally connect to her world, visit her if you like.
I know she wants to see you.
I'm sorry.
You are this galaxy's most fearsome and formidable...
Mercenaries, bounty hunters, professional soldiers, assassins, the very best at what you do.
Your mission is two-fold.
Take back what's mine, and take out the crew of the "Raza."
Previously on "Dark Matter"...
The summit on EOS-7 will come under attack, and the result will be all-out corporate war.
War changes everything.
Now it's all about new alliances.
Tabor Calchek.
He gets the jobs, we do the jobs.
Oh, Portia.
With the Blink Drive, you just disappear from one place and reappear somewhere else.
Let my scientists study it.
The android thinks the Ishida scientist tampered with it.
Sarah?
It's me, Five.
What's the situation, Corporal?
A ship just dropped out of FTL.
It's the reinforcements.
They've finally arrived.
It's not reinforcements, sir.
Satellites sensors confirm it's a Ferrous Corp ship.
Code blue.
- Get a lock on their position.
- Tracking, sir.
- I've got a lock.
- Prep the missiles,
- ready the perimeter guns.
- Missiles are prepped.
Perimeter guns are ready.
Awaiting your command.
Open a surface to ship communication.
Yes, sir.
- Go ahead, sir.
- This is Captain Lars Darrow, commanding officer of the Cepheus-5.
Security detachment.
This is a Traugott colony.
Your presence here is in violation of interstellar law.
Retreat beyond the territorial zone, or face the consequences.
They're powering up weapons.
Defensive protocols.
Prepare for aerial assault.
They've just launched a nuke.
What's that?
Another ship just dropped out of FTL,
- and it's opened fire.
- On the Ferrous Corp ship?
On the nuke.
Nuke intercepted and destroyed.
The ships are exchanging fire.
The Ferrous Corp ship is jumping to FTL.
It's gone.
Open up a comm line to the other vessel.
Cepheus-5, this is the "Raza."
You're welcome.
*DARK MATTER Season 03 Episode 03 Title: "Welcome to the Revolution"
We received word that Ferrous Corp had started launching strikes on rival assets in the outer colonies.
Figured it was just a matter of time before they set their sights on us.
Well, fortunately for you, we were in the area when they did.
And to what do we owe your timely intervention, Raza?
Luck.
We're actually here to pick up a friend.
- A friend?
- Tabor Calchek.
He was with a group who recently found refuge here.
Yes, we took in a large group of displaced citizens
- a couple weeks ago.
- Great.
We're sending a shuttle down to pick him up.
I'm afraid that won't be possible, Raza.
- Why not?
- This colony's under lockdown, pending the arrival of corporate military reinforcements.
While I appreciate your desire to keep the peace,
I hope you can appreciate my desire to rescue a friend.
Your friend's safety will be ensured until the lockdown is lifted.
When I said we were sending down a shuttle,
I wasn't asking for permission.
This colony houses a Traugott munitions factory.
If he's telling the truth, and he's got an in, it's worth checking out.
If he's telling the truth.
Guy's a thieving, scheming opportunist.
Yeah, yeah.
Hello?
Hello?
Can we just skip to the part where you come out of hiding and get the jump on us?
There.
That's better.
What do you want?
We're here to pick up a friend.
- You with Traugott?
- No, we're not.
Then how'd you get here?
You're telling us security just let you fly right in?
- We didn't give 'em a choice.
- You're lying.
Hey, we just saved all your asses by taking out that nuke before it could level
- this entire colony.
- Wait, stop, hang on.
It's okay.
They're with me.
Portia?
Thanks for coming to pick me up.
- You are not Tabor.
- No, not yet.
Oh, right, the amnesia thing.
Tabor told me.
Adrian Maro, Tabor's former assistant.
Former?
You mean Tabor's...
Yep, gone.
Soon as the war started, cashed in his savings, and just took off.
Left me a good-bye message, his place.
- And his contact list?
- Yeah.
That transmission you got wasn't from him.
Obviously, I sent it.
But I figured I'd explain once you got here.
- Okay, start explaining.
- Well, Tabor's gone, so I'm taking over his operation.
I was his apprentice.
Now I'm your new handler.
So we came all the way out here for you?
Well, you did save all these lives,
- so there's that.
- Friends of yours?
Friends?
You telling me you don't recognize who they are?
They are the baddest of bads, the deadliest of dead-shots, this galaxy's most notorious,
- most dangerous...
- Yeah.
- Most despicable...
- Whoa.
- Sorry, too much?
- Okay.
We're the crew of the "Raza."
The "Raza"?
Why didn't you say so?
Come on, let's get you a drink.
Impressive.
When do you graduate from the Academy?
Next year.
Come back to me when you've completed your training then.
There may be a place for you among my royal guard.
Yes, Heika, I would be honored.
Teku, have you come to do a little sparring?
Swordplay is the one thing I cannot teach you, Heika.
Where is Han-Shireikan?
Off-world.
She's meeting with General Caius.
Respectfully, Misaki's role is not to act as mediator between you and your Generals.
Her duty is here at the court, protecting her emperor.
Her emperor is perfectly capable of protecting himself.
Besides, her temporary absence is... better... for the both of us.
You know, you surprise me.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I mean, it's obvious there's no love lost between you two.
Misaki and I hold very different opinions on many issues, but if there's one thing we can agree on, it's our desire to support your rule.
Teku, ever the diplomat.
I heard about the loss of our research facility and the Blink Drive.
Your former friends have hurt us badly.
Yes.
And I'm in the process... of planning my response.
Yeah, our transport ship ended up getting redirected to this planet.
I barely got out with a few of Tabor's personal items and the clothes on my back.
Is it my imagination, or are we being followed?
- What do you mean?
- No, it's not your imagination.
- It's your damn eyes.
- Introductions are in order.
This is my bodyguard, Solara Shockley.
What?
Bodyguard?
What's a little twerp like you need a bodyguard for?
Little twerps in this line of work need them most of all.
Okay, here's the deal.
These workers are fed up
- with their terrible working conditions.
- Uh-huh.
Traugott has all but abandoned this facility and the guards stationed here, because they're too busy with the war, so I've convinced the workers to take advantage of the situation,
- and proclaim their independence.
- Why?
Well, so they can cast off the yolk of oppression,
- and finally taste freedom.
- No... ..what's in it for you?
Oh, a 10% commission on future profits as their union representative.
You know, you do make a pretty good table.
Well...
This has been a Traugott operation going on 30 years.
Put up with a lot over that time, low pay, unsafe working conditions.
But we've been making a lot of noise lately, and the Traugott guards don't like it.
They're getting nervous.
They came in here the other day.
They tried to arrest Zem here for anti-corporate activities.
We wouldn't let 'em.
They're holed up in a garrison about four clicks from here.
We have the bodies, but they have more guns, and that's the problem.
Wouldn't be if you don't attack them.
They're a danger to Zem, to all of us, so long as they're here,
- Better safe than sorry, I say.
- There's nothing safe about picking a fight with a superior enemy.
Well, that's...
Where maybe you can assist us.
Help us take out that garrison with your shuttle.
- Why don't we wait and see?
- This is not our fight.
Uh, what she means is...
We're not fighting your battle for you.
Why don't we give you two some time?
I am not signing on for this.
I'm not saying we commit, but let's not take anything off the table just yet.
We're not going down this road.
But this is exactly what we've been talking about, helping people in situations like this.
No, this is what you've been talking about.
I never said I'd be willing to get involved in a territorial dispute that has nothing to do with us.
Fine.
I've been talking, but you seem to be listening.
This is an opportunity to... to help,
- to do the right thing.
- And then what?
Watch it blow up in our faces again?
- We make terrible heroes.
- Okay.
If you're looking for a practical angle, how 'bout this.
The colonies we help now will be in a position to help us in the future, if we should ever need them.
Supplies, information, safe haven.
In this case, munitions.
It's dangerous, yes, but it's the right call, and you know it.
What the hell?
He's dead.
Oh, my God.
We told them this equipment was unsafe.
We asked them for a safety upgrade, and they refused.
I mean, this whole thing could've been avoided.
Bullshit.
You think that was an accident?
Someone planted explosives.
Traugott was gunning for Zem.
Well, they got him.
Those Traugott bastards.
You don't know for certain that it was them.
Who the hell else would it be?
They came for Zem, and when they realized they couldn't take him alive, they killed him.
You're not thinking this through.
Ah, no.
For the past two weeks, that's all we've been doing.
Now it's time for action.
You're not prepared for this fight.
You're outgunned.
You said as much yourself.
Hey...
Hey...
I said hey.
If you go through with this, more of you will die.
That's a fact.
So what do you expect us to do then?
Wait for them to hit us again?
No.
You find a way to end this without bloodshed.
And completely ignore the fact that they killed three of ours?
What is it you want?
Revenge or freedom?
'Cause I can help you get one, but not both.
So what do you suggest we do then?
Go to talk to them.
You're telling us to go over there, trust them not to shoot us on sight, and hope they're willing to talk?
Not you.
Me.
That's far enough.
I'm unarmed.
Just here to talk.
Right.
The crew of The Raza, just stopping by to pick up a friend.
We should've blasted you out of the sky when we had the chance.
Look, I'm here to help.
Sure you are.
Whether you wanna admit it or not, you and your security team are screwed.
The workers have turned against you.
You're outnumbered, and you must realize by now that back-up isn't coming.
Now there's two ways this can go down.
You can dig in your heels and... fight for a corporation that's abandoned you, or... you can let me in to talk, and help reach a settlement.
No fighting.
No one dies.
You get to go home to your families.
Either way, this colony is declaring independence, and there's nothing you can do to change that.
Check him for weapons.
Raza, this is Two.
Are you there?
- Yes, Two.
- We're gonna be delayed, but not for long, hopefully.
How's it going up there?
Any closer to fixing the Blink Drive?
No, I'm afraid not.
The damage it suffered was extensive.
It may be beyond repair.
Shit.
I was running a general diagnostic when I discovered something curious.
What does that mean?
A portion of the ship's database has been quarantined.
- Why?
- I'm not sure, but I am running a decrypt program in an effort to force access.
Do you think it's another virus?
No.
In fact, it appears to have been intentionally isolated from the ship's more sensitive programs.
So what are you saying?
Somebody did this on purpose?
Yes... someone with the access codes to our ship's database.
It was one of us.
There was an explosion.
Three workers were killed, including Zem.
And they think we did it?
You tried to arrest him, and failed.
That doesn't mean we wanted him dead.
He was their leader.
You wanted him out of the picture.
We're security contingent.
Our job is to protect Traugott assets, and that includes those workers.
Now we don't wanna start anything, but if they come at us, you can be damn sure we'll be ready for 'em.
Traugott doesn't care about you or this damn colony.
Hell, forget reinforcements.
They couldn't even be bothered to extract you.
This isn't your battle anymore.
And the workers have given you the power to make a deal on their behalf?
We can reinforce any agreement we make.
- We?
- Me and my ship.
You agree to lay down your arms and walk away, and we'll guarantee you safe passage off this planet to the closest neutral space station.
Well, what about that explosion?
If they're convinced we did it, you think they're just gonna let us walk?
You let me worry about that.
We can't let this go.
We gotta answer, blood for blood.
You do that, and this will end badly for everyone.
So what do you suggest we do?
Forget our dead?
Toe the company line?
Claim your independence, but do it without bloodshed.
Show mercy now, so that later, when this war is over, they'll be more likely to seek out a non-violent solution.
And in what reality would a corporation even bother
- negotiating with a colony?
- In a reality where that colony is backed by two dozen other independent colonies.
Show you can govern fairly, and it will go a long way toward convincing others, like the G.A. or The League of Autonomous Worlds, that you deserve a fair shake.
All right.
We'll see how your friend does with the Traugott guard.
But someone...
Someone has to pay for this.
And they will, but not with their lives.
Okay.
Now it's a matter of convincing the rest of my people.
What?
Where's Turrence?
So you think you'll be able to sell this to the workers?
Yeah.
I'm sure I can convince them that this is their best option.
Have to say, you surprise me.
Your reputation may precede you, but it's a long way from reality.
You're a good man.
No, I'm a man who has his good days.
Hey, if this all works out, after the war's over, I'd like to buy you a...
Fire!
Run!
On me!
Now!
Now!
Move it!
Retreat!
Get up!
Move!
Let's go!
I knew we shouldn't have trusted you.
You son of a bitch.
Back off.
I need you to calm your friend down.
She's usually the one calming me down, so this all new territory.
They murdered our friends.
Did you seriously think we were gonna let that go?
You've put one of my crew members at risk.
He put himself at risk by going over there and trying to broker a deal with those bastards.
Okay, everyone put your weapons down.
Now!
You show up out of nowhere, start telling us what to do.
You have no idea what we've been through, risking our asses for a corporate bottom line.
What do you know about it, huh?
Okay, Turrence, just cool off.
Yeah, no, you're right.
We don't know what you've been through, but we do know about dealing with the likes of Traugott.
We were finding you an out, a way to get your freedom maybe without having to deal with reprisals.
You should've listened to us.
Now we have to clean up your mess.
Are you out of your mind?
You think I set you up?
You're saying your people just happened to be
- waiting out there?
- Those weren't my people.
A good man is dead,
- because he trusted you.
- I had nothing do with it.
Say it again.
Say it again!
Tell me how you had nothing to do with it.
Convince me, because if you don't,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your head, and end you!
Why go through all the trouble?
I could've just gotten into my shuttle, and leveled this place with a couple of well-placed missiles.
You think about it, that would've been a best-case scenario for those workers.
They get their independence, and the big bad crew of the "Raza" add to their rep.
I wasn't playing you.
I didn't know.
Well, I feel sorry for you then.
Why's that?
Because now we're going to respond...
And you're going to help us.
Maybe you should try talking to them first.
Six is the talker.
If he hasn't convinced them by now, nothing we say is gonna change anything.
He's right.
Like it or not, we've been backed into a corner.
We need to force the issue.
Uh, so who's going to make that particular house call?
- Me and Three.
- I wanna help.
And you will, by staying here and keeping an eye on things.
Make sure nobody does anything stupid.
Warn us if they try.
I'll stay here and back up the kid.
The kid?
Y-younger person.
I'm coming with you.
As much as I appreciate the offer...
If you plan on taking that garrison, you're gonna need the extra body.
You're just gonna get in the way.
I'm former special forces, black ops, SDC.
Stellar Defense Corp.
Both:
Really?
- Yeah, really.
- Wow.
It was on my résumé.
- You did read my résumé, right?
- Skimmed it.
Come on, it was super long.
You don't have to do this.
I wanna help you save your friend.
Plus, I have to show this guy up, so...
Where the hell are all the guards?
I don't like this.
You guys take this hallway.
♪♪
♪♪
No resistance.
Nothing on this end.
You guys in position?
- Yeah.
- Count of three.
One, two, three!
Six...
Wait!
Hey, there you are.
Yeah, I was asked to keep an eye on things.
This spot gives me the best view.
So what's your story?
Wh-what do you mean?
You're, what, 16?
You're hanging with the most infamous mercenaries in the galaxy.
- How'd you manage that?
- I stowed away on their ship.
Okay, but when they found you, why'd they keep you?
Why didn't they just...
- Space me?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't know, but...
I'm one of them now.
I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
From what I hear, they're not exactly...
Not exactly what?
According to Tabor, they're great earners, but kind of volatile.
Yeah.
How long has Tabor been their handler?
Awhile.
He repped the original crew.
- Original crew?
- Yeah.
Boone, Ryo, Shrike, and Jasper.
Wait, Shrike and Jasper?
- What happened to them?
- I can't be sure, but I think Portia happened to them.
What was that?
Two, are you there?
Three, this is Five.
Can you hear me?
Let's go, let's go.
On your knees.
- Look.
- Shit.
Round them up!
All of 'em.
Let's go!
Two, Three, are you there?
Over?
Let's go!
Get 'em on their knees.
It's happening.
They're taking over the facility.
Not to worry.
We're on our way.
Copy.
Freeze!
- Do you have a gun?
- No, I don't have a gun.
I didn't think I needed one, because I have a bodyguard.
Five, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
What's going on?
We heard an explosion.
We're all fine.
We're almost at your position.
Be careful.
Why?
What's going on?
The Traugott guards just took the facility.
Adrian and I are up on a second level walkway.
They haven't spotted us yet.
We can see everything that's going on from here.
Okay, I need details.
Exactly what's going on?
Who's where?
Okay, listen up.
Traugott is back in charge, so things are gonna be different around here.
You are effectively prisoners.
Until the arrival of reinforcements, you'll eat when we tell you, sleep when we tell you.
You will do what we tell you!
- What if they don't come?
- What was that?
What if your reinforcements don't come?
Then you'll have lots of time to get used to things.
We've confiscated your weapons.
We need to know if you're hiding any more.
We also wanna know who's responsible for the attack on our garrison.
We'll trade you for the identity of whoever set the explosives that killed our people.
You are not in a position to make offers.
I want names.
Someone is gonna be punished.
Might as well be the guilty parties.
Names!
No one's being punished.
No one else is dying today.
Put your weapons down.
It's over.
Yeah, damn right it's over.
Get down on your knees with the rest of 'em.
- No.
- What was that?
He said no.
Drop your weapons.
- And then what?
- I meant what I said.
Please don't make me a liar.
Do it.
Do it.
- Are you serious?
- Down on your knees.
Hands behind your heads.
Now.
Made any decisions?
Yeah.
We're gonna send off with the next supply ship, arrange for the authorities to pick them up at the closest station.
Hand the investigation over to the G.A.
Are you sure you wanna do that?
What do you mean?
Someone has to be responsible for setting off that blast.
I know those guards may be denying
- any involvement now, but...
- I don't think they did it.
What the hell are you saying?
It was one of my people?
Uh, it was someone who wanted to trigger this conflict,
- and they succeeded.
- But why?
Listen up, I've got news for you.
You don't need to worry about Traugott Corp anymore.
We received your message, and we're here to help.
They call me The General.
Welcome to the revolution.
What the hell are you doing here?
Hello, Griff.
It's been awhile.
Don't listen to this man.
He's a liar and a mass murderer.
He's responsible for the deaths of 10,000 innocent civilians on the Hyadum-12 space station.
Well, I'm not the only one responsible for that particular attack.
But I don't deny it, because those civilians weren't so innocent.
They're complicit in a system that supports inequality and favors corporate rights over the rights of the workers.
And yes...
I've shed blood, and I have no regrets, because I fight for the weak, the defenseless,
the downtrodden.
I fight for the oppressed.
And I will fight for you.
You don't belong here.
I was invited.
- By who?
- By me.
He helped other colonies gain their independence, and he'll do the same for us.
You people stood up to the corp system.
That takes guts.
But you're gonna need a lot more than that if you're gonna survive what's coming.
You're gonna need organization, leadership.
That's something that I can give you.
Don't accept his offer.
Turn him away.
How can you ask that of me?
My people need help.
Who can we rely on when you leave?
Come on.
It's time to go.
Your ability to fashion virtual constructs is impressive.
It's wasted on this rather simplistic design, though.
Wouldn't you agree?
I can sense your presence is something far beyond a simple program.
You're complex.
I'm hoping we can talk.
I can leave, but you know I'll be back.
Now that we know you're here, we will find you...
Eventually.
I know you.
Yes, you do.
Hello, Android.
Are you there?
Can you hear me?
Please.
- Dalla?
- You have to come back.
- What's going on?
- The General.
He's rounded up prisoners, and he's g...
I don't know.
Wait, Six.
Wait.
Six!
This is the price to be paid for trying to take away our freedom.
Well, well, speak of the devil.
He and his people are outsiders.
They work as hired guns for the corporations.
They seem to think they can come here and tell you what's best for you.
Now you show them that you're with us now.
Cowards!
You may not agree with my ways, but you have to admit that I am the best chance these people have for survival.
So don't go start...
Drop 'em.
You heard him.
Now!
So what now?
Now you go back to the ship and leave.
You mean we go back to our ship, don't you?
We're not leaving you behind.
Uh, don't think of it as leaving me behind then.
Think of it as leaving me to move forward.
You're serious?
These people need direction, leadership.
And I've been talking about wanting to do something that'll make difference, and here's my chance.
There are other ways to help.
You're right.
The "Raza" can make a difference, you know, be... become a symbol of hope for these people and others like them.
I'll let 'em know that they have a powerful ally backing them.
But you don't need me for that.
They need me more, if they'll have me, that is.
We'd be honored.
It's settled then.
If you're sure about this.
Yeah.
All right.
- We'll be checking in on you.
- You better.
Guess I'm the last man standing.
Do some good.
Yeah.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you too.
But you know where to find me.
You stay strong, and watch over them.
I will.
Okay, where to?
- What do you mean?
- Where are we dropping you off?
Actually, we were kinda hoping maybe we could stay with you guys for awhile.
You wanna stay here on our ship?
It's... it's not like we wouldn't pull our weight.
Solara's pretty handy.
And obviously, you know what I bring to the table.
We do?
Who knows what happened to Tabor?
We may never see him again.
But in the meantime, I'm running his clients.
I have all of his contacts.
And many of his annoying habits.
We can't just dump them.
Sure we can.
You don't know what it's like out there with this war going on.
It's not safe.
Trust me, it's not safe here either.
It would just be for a little while, until we can get back on our feet.
No.
- Fine, you can stay for now...
- Oh.
But he's your responsibility.
Keep him out of trouble.
Uh...
- Five?
- Hey.
Do you have a moment?
Uh, I don't feel like talking right now.
It's not about Six.
It's about someone else.
Are you saying Sarah's alive?
Uh, yes and no.
When her stasis pod died,
I was able to rescue her digital consciousness.
Whenever you go into a deep sleep, your consciousness gets digitally uploaded into a database designed to keep the mind actively stimulated, and avoid mental atrophy over long hauls.
It gets downloaded back as part of the revival process.
So instead of downloading this digital consciousness back into her dying body, you transferred it to the ship's database?
Not at first.
I didn't know how.
I kept it on a separate storage device.
And it wasn't until recently that I was able to figure out a way to actually upload it into the computer.
Well, why didn't you tell us any of this sooner?
Because I didn't know it was gonna work, and I didn't wanna get anyone's hopes up.
So you're saying Sarah is alive as a computer program?
Well, it's a lot more complicated than that.
She's a sentient consciousness confined to our ship's database, but she has created her own virtual reality within it.
You can neurally connect to her world, visit her if you like.
I know she wants to see you.
I'm sorry.
You are this galaxy's most fearsome and formidable...
Mercenaries, bounty hunters, professional soldiers, assassins, the very best at what you do.
Your mission is two-fold.

Your presence here is in violation of interstellar law.
Retreat beyond the territorial zone, or face the consequences.
They're powering up weapons.

We received word that Ferrous Corp had started launching strikes on rival assets in the outer colonies.
Figured it was just a matter of time before they set their sights on us.
Well, fortunately for you, we were in the area when they did.
And to what do we owe your timely intervention, Raza?
Luck.
We're actually here to pick up a friend.
- A friend?
- Tabor Calchek.
He was with a group who recently found refuge here.
Yes, we took in a large group of displaced citizens
- a couple weeks ago.
- Great.
We're sending a shuttle down to pick him up.
I'm afraid that won't be possible, Raza.
- Why not?
- This colony's under lockdown, pending the arrival of corporate military reinforcements.
While I appreciate your desire to keep the peace,
I hope you can appreciate my desire to rescue a friend.
Your friend's safety will be ensured until the lockdown is lifted.
When I said we were sending down a shuttle,
I wasn't asking for permission.
This colony houses a Traugott munitions factory.

Yep, gone.

Obviously, I sent it.
But I figured I'd explain once you got here.

Now I'm your new handler.
So we came all the way out here for you?
Well, you did save all these lives,

Respectfully, Misaki's role is not to act as mediator between you and your generals.

Her emperor is perfectly capable of protecting himself.
Besides, her temporary absence is... better for the both of us.
You know, you surprise me.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I mean, it's obvious there's no love lost between you two.
Misaki and I hold very different opinions on many issues, but if there's one thing we can agree on, it's our desire to support your rule.
Teku, ever the diplomat.
I heard about the loss of our research facility and the Blink Drive.
Your former friends have hurt us badly.
Yes.
And I'm in the process... of planning my response.
Yeah, our transport ship ended up getting redirected to this planet.
I barely got out with a few of Tabor's personal items and the clothes on my back.
Is it my imagination, or are we being followed?
- What do you mean?
- No, it's not your imagination.
- It's your damn eyes.
- Introductions are in order.
This is my bodyguard, Solara Shockley.
What?
Bodyguard?
What's a little twerp like you need a bodyguard for?
Little twerps in this line of work need them most of all.
Okay, here's the deal.
These workers are fed up with their terrible working conditions.
Uh-huh.
Traugott has all but abandoned this facility and the guards stationed here, because they're too busy with the war, so I've convinced the workers to take advantage of the situation,
- and proclaim their independence.
- Why?
Well, so they can cast off the yolk of oppression,
- and finally taste freedom.
- No... what's in it for you?
Oh, a 10% commission on future profits as their union representative.
You know, you do make a pretty good table.
Well...
This has been a Traugott operation going on 30 years.
Put up with a lot over that time, low pay, unsafe working conditions.
But we've been making a lot of noise lately, and the Traugott guards don't like it.
They're getting nervous.
They came in here the other day.
They tried to arrest Zem here for anti-corporate activities.
We wouldn't let 'em.
They're holed up in a garrison about four clicks from here.
We have the bodies, but they have more guns, and that's the problem.
Wouldn't be if you don't attack them.
They're a danger to Zem, to all of us, so long as they're here,
- Better safe than sorry, I say.
- There's nothing safe about picking a fight with a superior enemy.
Well, that's...
Where maybe you can assist us.
Help us take out that garrison with your shuttle.
- Why don't we wait and see?
- This is not our fight.
Uh, what she means is...
We're not fighting your battle for you.
Why don't we give you two some time?
I am not signing on for this.
I'm not saying we commit, but let's not take anything off the table just yet.
We're not going down this road.
But this is exactly what we've been talking about, helping people in situations like this.
No, this is what you've been talking about.
I never said I'd be willing to get involved in a territorial dispute that has nothing to do with us.
Fine.
I've been talking, but you seem to be listening.
This is an opportunity to... to help,
- to do the right thing.
- And then what?
Watch it blow up in our faces again?
- We make terrible heroes.
- Okay.
If you're looking for a practical angle, how 'bout this.
The colonies we help now will be in a position to help us in the future, if we should ever need them.
Supplies, information, safe haven.
In this case, munitions.
It's dangerous, yes, but it's the right call, and you know it.
What the hell?
He's dead.
Oh, my God.
We told them this equipment was unsafe.
We asked them for a safety upgrade, and they refused.
I mean, this whole thing could've been avoided.
Bullshit.
You think that was an accident?
Someone planted explosives.
Traugott was gunning for Zem.
Well, they got him.
Those Traugott bastards.
You don't know for certain that it was them.
Who the hell else would it be?
They came for Zem, and when they realized they couldn't take him alive, they killed him.
You're not thinking this through.
Ah, no.
For the past two weeks, that's all we've been doing.
Now it's time for action.
You're not prepared for this fight.
You're outgunned.
You said as much yourself.
Hey...
Hey...
I said hey.
If you go through with this, more of you will die.
That's a fact.
So what do you expect us to do then?
Wait for them to hit us again?
No.
You find a way to end this without bloodshed.
And completely ignore the fact that they killed three of ours?
What is it you want?
Revenge or freedom?
'Cause I can help you get one, but not both.
So what do you suggest we do then?
Go to talk to them.
You're telling us to go over there, trust them not to shoot us on sight, and hope they're willing to talk?
Not you.
Me.
That's far enough.
I'm unarmed.
Just here to talk.
Right.
The crew of The Raza, just stopping by to pick up a friend.
We should've blasted you out of the sky when we had the chance.
Look, I'm here to help.
Sure you are.
Whether you wanna admit it or not, you and your security team are screwed.
The workers have turned against you.
You're outnumbered, and you must realize by now that back-up isn't coming.
Now there's two ways this can go down.
You can dig in your heels and fight for a corporation that's abandoned you, or you can let me in to talk, and help reach a settlement.
No fighting.
No one dies.
You get to go home to your families.
Either way, this colony is declaring independence, and there's nothing you can do to change that.
Check him for weapons.
Raza, this is Two.
Are you there?
- Yes, Two.
- We're gonna be delayed, but not for long, hopefully.
How's it going up there?
Any closer to fixing the Blink Drive?
No, I'm afraid not.
The damage it suffered was extensive.
It may be beyond repair.
Shit.
I was running a general diagnostic when I discovered something curious.
What does that mean?
A portion of the ship's database has been quarantined.
- Why?
- I'm not sure, but I am running a decrypt program in an effort to force access.
Do you think it's another virus?
No.
In fact, it appears to have been intentionally isolated from the ship's more sensitive programs.
So what are you saying?
Somebody did this on purpose?
Yes... someone with the access codes to our ship's database.
It was one of us.
There was an explosion.
Three workers were killed, including Zem.
And they think we did it?
You tried to arrest him, and failed.
That doesn't mean we wanted him dead.
He was their leader.
You wanted him out of the picture.
We're security contingent.
Our job is to protect Traugott assets, and that includes those workers.
Now we don't wanna start anything, but if they come at us, you can be damn sure we'll be ready for 'em.
Traugott doesn't care about you or this damn colony.
Hell, forget reinforcements.
They couldn't even be bothered to extract you.
This isn't your battle anymore.
And the workers have given you the power to make a deal on their behalf?
We can reinforce any agreement we make.
- We?
- Me and my ship.
You agree to lay down your arms and walk away, and we'll guarantee you safe passage off this planet to the closest neutral space station.
Well, what about that explosion?
If they're convinced we did it, you think they're just gonna let us walk?
You let me worry about that.
We can't let this go.
We gotta answer, blood for blood.
You do that, and this will end badly for everyone.
So what do you suggest we do?
Forget our dead?
Toe the company line?
Claim your independence, but do it without bloodshed.
Show mercy now, so that later, when this war is over, they'll be more likely to seek out a non-violent solution.
And in what reality would a corporation even bother
- negotiating with a colony?
- In a reality where that colony is backed by two dozen other independent colonies.
Show you can govern fairly, and it will go a long way toward convincing others, like the G.A. or The League of Autonomous Worlds, that you deserve a fair shake.
All right.
We'll see how your friend does with the Traugott guard.
But someone...
Someone has to pay for this.
And they will, but not with their lives.
Okay.
Now it's a matter of convincing the rest of my people.
What?
Where's Turrence?
So you think you'll be able to sell this to the workers?
Yeah.
I'm sure I can convince them that this is their best option.
Have to say, you surprise me.
Your reputation may precede you, but it's a long way from reality.
You're a good man.
No, I'm a man who has his good days.
Hey, if this all works out, after the war's over, I'd like to buy you a...

I need you to calm your friend down.
She's usually the one calming me down, so this all new territory.
They murdered our friends.
Did you seriously think we were gonna let that go?
You've put one of my crew members at risk.
He put himself at risk by going over there and trying to broker a deal with those bastards.
Okay, everyone put your weapons down.
Now!
You show up out of nowhere, start telling us what to do.
You have no idea what we've been through, risking our asses for a corporate bottom line.
What do you know about it, huh?
Okay, Turrence, just cool off.
Yeah, no, you're right.
We don't know what you've been through, but we do know about dealing with the likes of Traugott.
We were finding you an out, a way to get your freedom maybe without having to deal with reprisals.
You should've listened to us.
Now we have to clean up your mess.
Are you out of your mind?
You think I set you up?
You're saying your people just happened to be
- waiting out there?
- Those weren't my people.
A good man is dead,
- because he trusted you.
- I had nothing do with it.
Say it again.
Say it again!
Tell me how you had nothing to do with it.
Convince me, because if you don't,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your head, and end you!
Why go through all the trouble?
I could've just gotten into my shuttle, and leveled this place with a couple of well-placed missiles.
You think about it, that would've been a best-case scenario for those workers.
They get their independence, and the big bad crew of the "Raza" add to their rep.
I wasn't playing you.
I didn't know.
Well, I feel sorry for you then.
Why's that?
Because now we're going to respond...
And you're going to help us.
Maybe you should try talking to them first.
Six is the talker.
If he hasn't convinced them by now, nothing we say is gonna change anything.
He's right.
Like it or not, we've been backed into a corner.

We're all fine.
We're almost at your position.
Be careful.
Why?
What's going on?
The Traugott guards just took the facility.
Adrian and I are up on a second level walkway.
They haven't spotted us yet.
We can see everything that's going on from here.
Okay, I need details.
Exactly what's going on?
Who's where?
Okay, listen up.
Traugott is back in charge, so things are gonna be different around here.
You are effectively prisoners.
Until the arrival of reinforcements, you'll eat when we tell you, sleep when we tell you.
You will do what we tell you!
- What if they don't come?
- What was that?
What if your reinforcements don't come?
Then you'll have lots of time to get used to things.
We've confiscated your weapons.
We need to know if you're hiding any more.
We also wanna know who's responsible for the attack on our garrison.
We'll trade you for the identity of whoever set the explosives that killed our people.
You are not in a position to make offers.
I want names.
Someone is gonna be punished.
Might as well be the guilty parties.
Names!
No one's being punished.
No one else is dying today.
Put your weapons down.
It's over.
Yeah, damn right it's over.
Get down on your knees with the rest of 'em.
- No.
- What was that?
He said no.
Drop your weapons.
- And then what?
- I meant what I said.
Please don't make me a liar.
Do it.
Do it.
- Are you serious?
- Down on your knees.
Hands behind your heads.
Now.
Made any decisions?
Yeah.
We're gonna send off with the next supply ship, arrange for the authorities to pick them up at the closest station.
Hand the investigation over to the G.A.
Are you sure you wanna do that?
What do you mean?
Someone has to be responsible for setting off that blast.
I know those guards may be denying
- any involvement now, but...
- I don't think they did it.
What the hell are you saying?
It was one of my people?
Uh, it was someone who wanted to trigger this conflict,
- and they succeeded.
- But why?
Listen up, I've got news for you.
You don't need to worry about Traugott Corp anymore.
We received your message, and we're here to help.
They call me The General.
Welcome to the revolution.
What the hell are you doing here?
Hello, Griff.
It's been awhile.
Don't listen to this man.
He's a liar and a mass murderer.
He's responsible for the deaths of 10,000 innocent civilians on the Hyadum-12 space station.
Well, I'm not the only one responsible for that particular attack.
But I don't deny it, because those civilians weren't so innocent.
They're complicit in a system that supports inequality and favors corporate rights over the rights of the workers.
And yes...
I've shed blood, and I have no regrets, because I fight for the weak, the defenseless, the downtrodden.
I fight for the oppressed.
And I will fight for you.
You don't belong here.
I was invited.
- By who?
- By me.
He helped other colonies gain their independence, and he'll do the same for us.
You people stood up to the corp system.
That takes guts.
But you're gonna need a lot more than that if you're gonna survive what's coming.
You're gonna need organization, leadership.
That's something that I can give you.
Don't accept his offer.
Turn him away.
How can you ask that of me?
My people need help.
Who can we rely on when you leave?
Come on.
It's time to go.
Your ability to fashion virtual constructs is impressive.
It's wasted on this rather simplistic design, though.
Wouldn't you agree?
I can sense your presence is something far beyond a simple program.
You're complex.
I'm hoping we can talk.
I can leave, but you know I'll be back.
Now that we know you're here, we will find you...
Eventually.
I know you.
Yes, you do.
Hello, Android.
Are you there?
Can you hear me?
Please.
- Dalla?
- You have to come back.
- What's going on?
- The General.
He's rounded up prisoners, and he's g...
I don't know.
Wait, Six.
Wait.
Six!
This is the price to be paid for trying to take away our freedom.
Well, well, speak of the devil.
He and his people are outsiders.
They work as hired guns for the corporations.
They seem to think they can come here and tell you what's best for you.
Now you show them that you're with us now.
Cowards!
You may not agree with my ways, but you have to admit that I am the best chance these people have for survival.
So don't go start...
Drop 'em.
You heard him.
Now!
So what now?
Now you go back to the ship and leave.
You mean we go back to our ship, don't you?
We're not leaving you behind.
Uh, don't think of it as leaving me behind then.
Think of it as leaving me to move forward.
You're serious?
These people need direction, leadership.
And I've been talking about wanting to do something that'll make difference, and here's my chance.
There are other ways to help.
You're right.
The "Raza" can make a difference, you know, be... become a symbol of hope for these people and others like them.
I'll let 'em know that they have a powerful ally backing them.
But you don't need me for that.
They need me more, if they'll have me, that is.
We'd be honored.
It's settled then.
If you're sure about this.
Yeah.
All right.
- We'll be checking in on you.
- You better.
Guess I'm the last man standing.
Do some good.
Yeah.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you too.
But you know where to find me.
You stay strong, and watch over them.
I will.
Okay, where to?
- What do you mean?
- Where are we dropping you off?
Actually, we were kinda hoping maybe we could stay with you guys for awhile.
You wanna stay here on our ship?
It's... it's not like we wouldn't pull our weight.
Solara's pretty handy.
And obviously, you know what I bring to the table.
We do?
Who knows what happened to Tabor?
We may never see him again.
But in the meantime, I'm running his clients.
I have all of his contacts.
And many of his annoying habits.
We can't just dump them.
Sure we can.
You don't know what it's like out there with this war going on.
It's not safe.
Trust me, it's not safe here either.
It would just be for a little while, until we can get back on our feet.
No.
- Fine, you can stay for now...
- Oh.
But he's your responsibility.
Keep him out of trouble.
Uh...
- Five?
- Hey.
Do you have a moment?
Uh, I don't feel like talking right now.
It's not about Six.
It's about someone else.
Are you saying Sarah's alive?
Uh, yes and no.
When her stasis pod died,
I was able to rescue her digital consciousness.
Whenever you go into a deep sleep, your consciousness gets digitally uploaded into a database designed to keep the mind actively stimulated, and avoid mental atrophy over long hauls.
It gets downloaded back as part of the revival process.
So instead of downloading this digital consciousness back into her dying body, you transferred it to the ship's database?
Not at first.
I didn't know how.
I kept it on a separate storage device.
And it wasn't until recently that I was able to figure out a way to actually upload it into the computer.
Well, why didn't you tell us any of this sooner?
Because I didn't know it was gonna work, and I didn't wanna get anyone's hopes up.
So you're saying Sarah is alive as a computer program?
Well, it's a lot more complicated than that.
She's a sentient consciousness confined to our ship's database, but she has created her own virtual reality within it.
You can neurally connect to her world, visit her if you like.
I know she wants to see you.
I'm sorry.
You are this galaxy's most fearsome and formidable...
Mercenaries, bounty hunters, professional soldiers, assassins, the very best at what you do.
Your mission is two-fold.
Take back what's mine, and take out the crew of the "Raza."
And the result will be all-out corporate war.
War changes everything.
Now it's all about new alliances.
Tabor calchek.
He gets the jobs, we do the jobs.
Oh, portia.
With the blink drive, you just disappear from one place, and reappear somewhere else.
Let my scientists study it.
The android thinks the ishida scientist tampered with it.
Sarah?
It's me, five.
What's the situation, corporal?
A ship just dropped out of ftl.
It's the reinforcements.
Satellites sensors confirm it's a ferrous corp.
Ship.
Code blue.
Get a lock on their position.
Tracking, sir.
Prep the missiles, ready the perimeter guns.
Perimeter guns are ready.
Awaiting your command.
Open a surface to ship communication.
Yes, sir.
Go ahead, sir.
commanding officer of the cepheus-5.
Security detachment.
This is a traugott colony.
Your presence here is in violation of interstellar law.
Retreat beyond the territorial zone, or face the consequences.
They're powering up weapons.
Defensive protocols.
Prepare for aerial assault.
They've just launched a nuke.
Another ship just dropped out of ftl.
And it's opened fire.
On the ferrous corp.
Ship?
On the nuke.
Nuke intercepted and destroyed!
The ships are exchanging fire.
The ferrous corp.
Ship is jumping to ftl.
It's gone.
Open up a comm line to the other vessel.
Cepheus-5, this is the raza.
You're welcome.
We received word that ferrous corp.
Had started launching strikes on rival assets in the outer colonies.
Figured it was just a matter of time before they set their sights on us.
Well, fortunately for you, we were in the area when they did.
And to what do we owe your timely intervention, raza?
We're actually here to pick up a friend.
A friend?
Tabor calchek.
He was with a group who recently found refuge here.
Yes, we took in a large group of displaced citizens a couple weeks ago.
Great.
We're sending a shuttle down to pick him up.
I'm afraid that won't be possible, raza.
Why not?
pending the arrival of corporate military reinforcements.
While I appreciate your desire to keep the peace,
I hope you can appreciate my desire to rescue a friend.
Your friend's safety will be ensured until the lockdown is lifted.
When I said we were sending down a shuttle,
I wasn't asking for permission.
This colony houses a traugott munitions factory.
If he's telling the truth, and he's got an in, it's worth checking out.
If he's telling the truth.
Guy's a thieving, scheming opportunist.
Yeah, yeah.
Hello?
Hello?
Can we just skip to the part where you come outta hiding and get the jump on us?
There.
That's better.
What d'you want?
We're here to pick up a friend.
You with traugott?
No, we're not.
You're telling us security just let you fly right in?
We didn't give 'em a choice.
Hey, we just saved all your asses by taking out that nuke before it could level this entire colony.
Wait!
Stop, hang on.
It's okay.
They're with me.
Portia?
Thanks for coming to pick me up.
You are not tabor.
No, not yet.
Oh, right, the amnesia thing.
Tabor told me.
Adrian maro, tabor's former assistant.
Former?
You mean tabor's yep, gone.
Soon as the war started.
Cashed in his savings, and just took off.
Left me a goodbye message, his place...
Yeah.
That transmission you got wasn't from him.
Obviously, I sent it.
But I figured I'd explain once you got here.
Okay, start explaining.
so I'm taking over his operation.
I was his apprentice.
Now I'm your new handler.
So we came all the way out here for you?
Well, you did save all these lives, so there's that.
Friends of yours?
Friends?
You telling me you don't recognize who they are?
They are the baddest of bads, the deadliest of dead-shots, this galaxy's most notorious, most dangerous...
Yeah.
...most despicable...
Whoa.
Okay.
We're the crew of the raza.
The raza?
Why didn't you say so?
Come on, let's get you a drink.
Impressive.
When do you graduate from the academy?
Next year.
Come back to me when you've completed your training then.
There may be a place for you among my royal guard.
Yes, heika, I would be honored.
Teku, have you come to do a little sparring?
Swordplay is the one thing i cannot teach you, heika.
Where is han-shireikan?
Off world.
She's meeting with general caius.
Respectfully, misaki's role is not to act as mediator between you and your generals.
Her duty is here at the court, protecting her emperor.
Her emperor is perfectly capable of protecting himself.
Besides, her temporary absence is better, for the both of us.
You know, you surprise me.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I mean, it's obvious there's no love lost between you two.
Misaki and I hold very different opinions on many issues, but if there's one thing we can agree on, it's our desire to support your rule.
Teku, ever the diplomat.
I heard about the loss of our research facility and the blink drive.
Your former friends have hurt us.
Badly.
Yes.
And I'm in the process of planning my response.
Yeah, transporter ship ended up getting redirected to this planet.
I barely got out with a few of tabor's personal items and the clothes on my back.
Is it my imagination, or are we being followed?
No, it's not your imagination.
It's your damn eyes.
Introductions are in order.
This is my bodyguard, solara shockley.
What?
Bodyguard?
What's a little twerp like you need a bodyguard for?
Little twerps in this line of work need them most of all.
Okay, here's the deal:
These workers are fed up with their terrible working conditions.
Traugott has all but abandoned this facility so I've convinced the workers to take advantage of the situation, and proclaim their independence.
Well, so they can cast off the yolk of oppression, and finally taste freedom.
No.
What's in it for you?
Oh, a-a ten percent commission on future profits as their union representative?
You know, you do make a pretty good table.
Well...
This has been a traugott operation going on 30 years.
Put up with a lot over that time.
Low pay, unsafe working conditions...
But we've been making a lot of noise lately, and the traugott guards don't like it.
They're getting nervous.
Tried to arrest zem here for anti-corporate activities.
We wouldn't let 'em.
They're holed up in a Garrison about four clicks from here.
We have the bodies, but they have more guns, and that's the problem.
Wouldn't be if you don't attack them.
They're a danger to zem.
To all of us, so long as they're here.
Better safe than sorry, I say.
There's nothing safe about picking a fight with a superior enemy.
Well, that's where maybe you can assist us.
Help us take out that Garrison with your shuttle.
Why don't we wait and see?
This is not our fight.
we're not fighting your battle for you.
Why don't we give you two some time?
I am not signing on for this.
but let's not take anything off the table just yet.
But this is exactly what we've been talking about, helping people in situations like this.
No, this is what you'vebeentalkingabout.
in a territorial dispute that has nothing to do with us.
Fine.
I've been talking, but you seem to be listening.
This is an opportunity to-to help,
And then what?
Watch it blow up in our faces again?
We make terrible heroes.
Okay.
If you're looking for a practical angle,
The colonies we help now will be in a position to help us in the future if we should ever need them.
Supplies, information, safe haven.
In this case, munitions.
It's dangerous, yes, but it's the right call, and you know it.
What the hell?
He's dead.
Oh, my god.
We told them this equipment was unsafe.
We asked them for a safety upgrade, and they refused.
I mean, this whole thing could've been avoided.
Bullshit.
You think that was an accident?
Someone planted explosives.
Traugott was gunning for zem.
Well, they got him.
Those traugott bastards...
You don't know for certain that it was them.
Who the hell else would it be?
They came for zem, and when they realized they couldn't take him alive, they killed him.
You're not thinking this through.
For the past two weeks, that's all we've been doing.
Now it's time for action.
You're not prepared for this fight.
You're outgunned.
You said as much yourself.
Hey...
Hey!
I said, "hey."
If you go through with this, more of you will die.
So what do you expect us to do then?
Wait for them to hit us again?
No.
You find a way to end this without bloodshed.
And completely ignore the fact that they killed three of ours?
What is it you want?
Revenge or freedom?
'Cause I can help you get one, but not both.
So what do you suggest we do then?
You telling us to go over there, trust them not to shoot us on sight, and hope they're willing to talk?
Not you.
Me.
That's far enough.
I'm unarmed.
Just here to talk.
The crew of the raza, just stopping by to pick up a friend.
We should've blasted you out of the sky when we had the chance.
Look, I'm here to help.
Sure you are.
Whether you wanna admit it or not, you and your security team are screwed.
The workers have turned against you.
You're outnumbered, and you must realize by now that backup isn't coming.
Now there's two ways this can go down.
and fight for a corporation that's abandoned you, or you can let me in to talk, and help reach a settlement.
No fighting, no one dies, you get to go home to your families.
Either way, this colony is declaring independence, and there's nothing you can do to change that.
Check him for weapons.
Raza, this is two.
Are you there?
Yes, two.
We're gonna be delayed, but not for long, hopefully.
How's it going up there?
Any closer to fixing the blink drive?
No, I'm afraid not.
The damage it suffered was extensive.
It may be beyond repair.
I was running a general diagnostic when I discovered something curious.
A portion of the ship's database has been quarantined.
Why?
I'm not sure, but I am running a decrypt program in an effort to force access.
Do you think it's another virus?
In fact, it appears to have been intentionally isolated from the ship's more sensitive programs.
So what are you saying?
Somebody did this on purpose?
Yes.
Someone with the access codes to our ship's database.
It was one of us.
There was an explosion.
Three workers were killed, including zem.
And they think we did it?
You tried to arrest him and failed.
That doesn't mean we wanted him dead.
He was their leader.
You wanted him outta the picture.
We're security contingent.
Our job is to protect traugott assets, and that includes those workers.
Now we don't wanna start anything, but if they come at us, you can be damn sure we'll be ready for 'em.
Traugott doesn't care about you or this damn colony.
They couldn't even be bothered to extract you.
This isn't your battle anymore.
the power to make a deal on their behalf?
We can reinforce any agreement we make.
"We"?
Me and my ship.
You agree to lay down your arms and walk away, and we'll guarantee you safe passage off this planet to the closest neutral space station.
Well, what about that explosion?
you think they're just gonna let us walk?
You let me worry about that.
We can't let this go.
We gotta answer, blood for blood.
You do that, and this'll end badly for everyone.
So what do you suggest we do?
Forget our dead?
Toe the company line?
Claim your independence, but do it without bloodshed.
Show mercy now, so that later, when this war is over, they'll be more likely to seek out a non-violent solution.
And in what reality would a corporation even bother negotiating with a colony?
In a reality where that colony is backed by two dozen other independent colonies.
and it will go a long way toward convincing others, like the ga or the league of autonomous worlds, that you deserve a fair shake.
All right.
We'll see how your friend does with the traugott guard.
But someone...
Someone has to pay for this.
And they will, but not with their lives.
'Kay.
Now it's a matter of convincing the rest of my people.
What?
Where's turrence?
So you think you'll be able to sell this to the workers?
Yeah.
I'm sure i can convince them that this is their best option.
Have to say, you surprise me.
Your reputation may precede you, but it's a long way from reality.
You're a good man.
No, I'm a man who has his good days.
Hey, if this all works out, after the war's over, I'd like to buy you a
Fire!
Run!
On me!
Now!
Now!
Move it!
Retreat!
Get up!
Move!
Let's go!
I knew we shouldn't have trusted you.
You son of a bitch.
Back off!
I need you to calm your friend down.
She's usually the one calming me down, so this all new territory.
They murdered our friends.
Did you seriously think we were gonna let that go?
You've put one of my crew members at risk.
He put himself at risk by going over there and trying to broker a deal with those bastards!
Okay, everyone, put your weapons down.
Now!
You show up outta nowhere...
Start telling us what to do?
You have no idea what we've been through!
Risking our asses for a corporate bottom line?
What do you know about it, huh?
Okay, turrence, just cool off.
Yeah, no, you're right.
We don't know what you've been through, but we do know about dealing with the likes of traugott.
We were finding you an out, a way to get your freedom maybe without having to deal with reprisals.
You should've listened to us.
Now we have to clean up your mess.
Are you out of your mind?
You think I set you up?
You're saying your people just happened to be waiting out there?
Those weren't my people.
A good man is dead, because he trusted you.
I had nothing do with it!
Say it again.
Say it again!
Tell me how you had nothing to do with it.
Convince me.
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your head and end you!
Why go through all the trouble?
and leveled this place with a couple of well-placed missiles.
that would've been a best-case scenario for those workers.
and the big bad crew of the raza add to their rep.
I wasn't playing you.
I didn't know.
Well, I feel sorry for you, then.
Because now we're going to respond And you're going to help us.
Maybe you should try talking to them first.
Six is the talker.
If he hasn't convinced them by now, nothing we say is gonna change anything.
we've been backed into a corner.
We need to force the issue.
Uh, so who's going to make that particular house call?
Me and three.
I wanna help.
And you will, by staying here and keeping an eye on things.
Make sure nobody does anything stupid.
Warn us if they try.
I'll stay here and back up the kid.
"The kid"?
Y-younger person.
I'm coming with you.
As much as i appreciate the offer
If you plan on taking that Garrison, you're gonna need the extra body.
You're just gonna get in the way.
I'm former special forces, black ops, sdc.
Stellar defense corp.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Wow...
It was on my résumé.
You did read my résumé, right?
Skimmed it.
Come on, it was super long.
I wanna help you save your friend.
Plus, I have to show this guy up, so...
Where the hell are all the guards?
I don't like this.
You guys take this hallway.
No resistance.
Nothing this end.
You guys in position?
Yeah.
Count of three.
One, two, three!
Wait!
Hey, there you are.
Yeah, I was asked to keep an eye on things.
This spot gives me the best view.
So what's your story?
Wh-what do you mean?
You're, what, 16?
You're hanging with the most infamous mercenaries in the galaxy?
How'd you manage that?
I stowed away on their ship.
Okay, but when they found you, why'd they keep you?
Why didn't they just...
Space me?
Mm-hmm.
I don't know.
But I'm one of them now.
I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
From what I hear, they're not exactly...
Not exactly what?
According to tabor, they're great earners, but kind of volatile.
Yeah.
How long has tabor been their handler?
Awhile.
He repped the original crew.
Yeah.
Boone, ryo, shrike, and Jasper.
Wait, shrike and Jasper?
I... can't be sure, but I think portia happened to them.
What was that?
Two, are you there?
Three, this is five.
Can you hear me?
Let's go, let's go.
On your knees.
Look!
Shit!
Round 'em up!
All of 'em.
Let's go!
Two, three, are you there?
Over?
Let's go!
Get 'em on their knees.
It's happening.
They're taking over the facility.
Not to worry.
We're on our way.
Copy.
Freeze!
Do you have a gun?
No, I don't have a gun.
I didn't think I needed one, because I have a bodyguard.
Five, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
What's going on?
We heard an explosion?
We're all fine.
We're almost at your position.
Be careful.
The traugott guards just took the facility.
Adrian and I are up on a second level walkway.
We can see everything that's going on from here.
Okay, I need details.
Exactly what's going on?
Who's where?
Okay, listen up.
Traugott is back in charge, so things are gonna be different around here.
You are effectively prisoners.
Until the arrival of reinforcements, you'll eat when we tell you.
Sleep when we tell you.
You will do what we tell you!
What if they don't come?
What if your reinforcements don't come?
Then you'll have lots of time to get used to things.
We've confiscated your weapons.
We need to know if you're hiding any more.
We also wanna know who's responsible for the attack on our Garrison.
of whoever set the explosives that killed you are not in a position to make offers!
I want names.
Someone is gonna be punished.
Might as well be the guilty parties.
Names!
No one's being punished.
No one else is dying today.
Put your weapons down.
It's over.
Get down on your knees with the rest of 'em.
No.
What was that?
!
He said "no."
Drop your weapons.
And then what?
!
I meant what I said.
Please don't make me a liar.
Do it.
Do it.
Are you serious?
Down on your knees.
Hands behind your heads.
Now.
Made any decisions?
Yeah.
We're gonna send 'em off with the next supply ship, arrange for the authorities to pick them up at the closest station.
Hand the investigation over to the ga.
You sure you wanna do that?
Someone has to be responsible for setting off that blast.
I know those guards may be denying any involvement now, but
I don't think they did it.
What the hell are you saying?
It was one of my people?
Uh, it was someone who wanted to trigger this conflict, and they succeeded.
Listen up, I've got news for you.
You don't need to worry about traugott corp.
Anymore.
We received your message, and we're here to help.
They call me the general.
Welcome to the revolution.
What the hell are you doing here?
Hello, griff.
It's been awhile.
Don't listen to this man.
He's a liar and a mass murderer.
He's responsible for the deaths of 10,000 innocent civilians on the hyadum-12 space station.
Well, I'm not the only one responsible for that particular attack.
But I don't deny it, because those civilians weren't so innocent.
that supports inequality and favors corporate rights over the rights of the workers.
And yes...
I've shed blood, and I have no regrets.
Because I fight for the weak.
The defenseless.
The downtrodden.
I fight for the oppressed.
And I will fight for you.
You don't belong here.
I was invited.
By who?
By me.
He helped other colonies gain their independence, and he'll do the same for us.
You people stood up to the corp.
System.
That takes guts.
But you're gonna need a lot more than that if you're gonna survive what's coming.
You're gonna need organization, leadership.
That's something that i can give you.
Don't accept his offer.
Turn him away.
How can you ask that of me?
My people need help.
Who can we rely on when you leave?
Come on.
It's time to go.
Your ability to fashion virtual constructs is impressive.
It's wasted on this rather simplistic design, though.
Wouldn't you agree?
I can sense your presence is something far beyond a simple program.
You're complex.
I'm hoping we can talk.
I can leave, but you know I'll be back.
Now that we know you're here, we will find you eventually.
I know you.
Yes, you do.
Hello, android.
Are you there?
Can you hear me?
Please.
Dalla?
You have to come back.
What's going on?
The general.
He's rounded up prisoners, and he's g i don't know.
Wait six!
Wait!
Six!
This is the price to be paid for trying to take away our freedom.
Well, well, speak of the devil.
He and his people are outsiders.
They work as hired guns for the corporations.
They seem to think they can come here and tell you what's best for you.
Now you show them that you're with us now.
Cowards!
You may not agree with my ways, but you have to admit that I am the best chance these people have for survival.
So don't go starting so
Drop 'em.
You heard him.
Now!
So what now?
Now you go back to the ship and leave.
You mean we go back to our ship, don't you?
We're not leaving you behind.
Don't think of it as leaving me behind, then.
Think of it as leaving me to move forward.
You're serious?
These people need direction, leadership.
And I've been talking about wanting to do something that'll make difference, and... here's my chance.
There are other ways to help.
You're right.
The raza can make a difference, you know, be-become a symbol of hope for these people and others like them.
Let 'em know that they have a powerful ally backing them.
But you don't need me for that.
They need me more.
If they'll have me, that is.
We'd be honored.
It's settled, then.
If you're sure about this.
Yeah.
All right.
We'll be checking in on you.
You better.
Guess I'm the last man standin'.
Do some good.
Yeah.
I'm gonna miss you...
I'll miss you, too.
But you know where to find me.
You stay strong, watch over them.
I will.
Okay, where to?
What do you mean?
Where are we dropping you off?
Actually, we were kinda hoping maybe we could stay with you guys for a while.
You wanna stay here on our ship?
I-it's not like we wouldn't pull our weight solara's pretty handy.
And obviously, you know what I bring to the table.
Who knows what happened to tabor?
We may never see him again.
But in the meantime, I'm running his clients.
I have all of his contacts.
And many of his annoying habits.
We can't just dump them.
Sure we can.
You don't know what it's like out there with this war going on.
It's not safe.
Trust me, it's not safe here either.
It would just be for a little while, until we can get back on our feet.
No.
Fine, you can stay for now...
Oh.
But he's your responsibility.
Keep him out of trouble.
Five?
Hey.
Do you have a moment?
Uh, I don't feel like talking right now.
It's not about six.
It's about someone else.
Are you saying Sarah's alive?
Uh, yes and no.
When her stasis pod died,
I was able to rescue her digital consciousness.
Whenever you go into a deep sleep, your consciousness gets digitally uploaded into a database designed to keep the mind actively stimulated, and avoid mental atrophy over long hauls.
It gets downloaded back as part of the revival process.
So instead of downloading this digital consciousness back into her dying body, you transferred it to the ship's database?
Not at first.
I didn't know how.
I kept it on a separate storage device.
And it wasn't until recently that I was able to figure out a way to actually upload it into the computer.
Well, why didn't you tell us any of this sooner?
Because I didn't know it was gonna work.
And I didn't wanna get anyone's hopes up.
So you're saying Sarah is alive as a computer program?
Well, it's a lot more complicated than that.
She's a sentient consciousness confined to our ship's database, but she has created her own virtual reality within it.
You can neurally connect to her world, visit her if you like.
I know she wants to see you.
I'm sorry.
You are this galaxy's most fearsome and formidable...
Mercenaries, bounty hunters, professional soldiers, assassins, the very best at what you do.
Your mission is two-fold.
Take back what's mine, and take out the crew of the raza.
And the result will be all-out corporate war.
War changes everything.
Now it's all about new alliances.
Tabor calchek.
He gets the jobs, we do the jobs.
--Oh, portia.
With the blink drive, you just disappear from one place, and reappear somewhere else.
Let my scientists study it.
The android thinks the ishida scientist tampered with it.
Sarah?
It's me, five.
What's the situation, corporal?
A ship just dropped out of ftl.
It's the reinforcements.
Finally arrived.
It's not reinforcements, sir.
Satellites sensors confirm it's a ferrous corp.
Ship.
Code blue.
Get a lock on their position.
Tracking, sir.
I've got a lock.
Prep the missiles, ready the perimeter guns.
Missiles are prepped.
Perimeter guns are ready.
Awaiting your command.
Open a surface to ship communication.
Yes, sir.
Go ahead, sir.
This is captain Lars darrow, commanding officer of the cepheus-5.
Security detachment.
This is a traugott colony.
Your presence here is in violation of interstellar law.
Retreat beyond the territorial zone, or face the consequences.
----They're powering up weapons.
Defensive protocols.
Prepare for aerial assault.
They've just launched a nuke.
What's that?
!
Another ship just dropped out of ftl.
--And it's opened fire.
--On the ferrous corp.
Ship?
On the nuke.
Nuke intercepted and destroyed!
The ships are exchanging fire.
The ferrous corp.
Ship is jumping to ftl.
It's gone.
Open up a comm line to the other vessel.
Cepheus-5, this is the raza.
You're welcome.
We received word that ferrous corp.
Had started launching strikes on rival assets in the outer colonies.
Figured it was just a matter of time before they set their sights on us.
Well, fortunately for you, we were in the area when they did.
And to what do we owe your timely intervention, raza?
Luck.
We're actually here to pick up a friend.
--A friend?
--Tabor calchek.
He was with a group who recently found refuge here.
Yes, we took in a large group of displaced citizens a couple weeks ago.
Great.
We're sending a shuttle down to pick him up.
I'm afraid that won't be possible, raza.
Why not?
This colony's under lockdown, pending the arrival of corporate military reinforcements.
While I appreciate your desire to keep the peace,
I hope you can appreciate my desire to rescue a friend.
Your friend's safety will be ensured until the lockdown is lifted.
When I said we were sending down a shuttle,
I wasn't asking for permission.
This colony houses a traugott munitions factory.
If he's telling the truth, and he's got an in, it's worth checking out.
If he's telling the truth.
Guy's a thieving, scheming opportunist.
Yeah, yeah.
Hello?
Hello?
Can we just skip to the part where you come outta hiding
--and get the jump on us?
There.
That's better.
What d'you want?
We're here to pick up a friend.
--You with traugott?
--No, we're not.
Then how'd you get here?
You're telling us security just let you fly right in?
We didn't give 'em a choice.
You're lying.
Hey, we just saved all your asses by taking out that nuke before it could level this entire colony.
Wait!
Stop, hang on.
It's okay.
They're with me.
Portia?
Thanks for coming to pick me up.
You are not tabor.
No, not yet.
Oh, right, the amnesia thing.
Tabor told me.
Adrian maro, tabor's former assistant.
Former?
You mean tabor's-- yep, gone.
Soon as the war started.
Cashed in his savings, and just took off.
Left me a goodbye message, his place...
And his contact list.
Yeah.
That transmission you got wasn't from him.
Obviously, I sent it.
But I figured I'd explain once you got here.
Okay, start explaining.
Well, tabor's gone, so I'm taking over his operation.
I was his apprentice.
Now I'm your new handler.
So we came all the way out here for you?
Well, you did save all these lives, so there's that.
Friends of yours?
Friends?
You telling me you don't recognize who they are?
They are the baddest of bads, the deadliest of dead-shots, this galaxy's most notorious,
--most dangerous...
--Yeah.
--...most despicable...
--Whoa.
Sorry, too much?
Okay.
We're the crew of the raza.
The raza?
Why didn't you say so?
Come on, let's get you a drink.
Impressive.
When do you graduate from the academy?
Next year.
Come back to me when you've completed your training then.
There may be a place for you among my royal guard.
Yes, heika, I would be honored.
Teku, have you come to do a little sparring?
Swordplay is the one thing i cannot teach you, heika.
Where is han-shireikan?
Off world.
She's meeting with general caius.
Respectfully, misaki's role is not to act as mediator between you and your generals.
Her duty is here at the court, protecting her emperor.
Her emperor is perfectly capable of protecting himself.
Besides, her temporary absence is better, for the both of us.
You know, you surprise me.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I mean, it's obvious there's no love lost between you two.
Misaki and I hold very different opinions on many issues, but if there's one thing we can agree on, it's our desire to support your rule.
Teku, ever the diplomat.
I heard about the loss of our research facility and the blink drive.
Your former friends have hurt us.
Badly.
Yes.
And I'm in the process of planning my response.
Yeah, transporter ship ended up getting redirected to this planet.
I barely got out with a few of tabor's personal items and the clothes on my back.
Is it my imagination, or are we being followed?
What do you mean?
No, it's not your imagination.
It's your damn eyes.
Introductions are in order.
This is my bodyguard, solara shockley.
What?
Bodyguard?
What's a little twerp like you need a bodyguard for?
Little twerps in this line of work need them most of all.
Okay, here's the deal:
These workers are fed up with their terrible working conditions.
Uh-huh.
Traugott has all but abandoned this facility and the guards stationed here, because they're too busy with the war, so I've convinced the workers to take advantage of the situation, and proclaim their independence.
Why?
Well, so they can cast off the yolk of oppression,
--and finally taste freedom.
--No.
What's in it for you?
Oh, a-a ten percent commission on future profits as their union representative?
You know, you do make a pretty good table.
Well...
This has been a traugott operation going on 30 years.
Put up with a lot over that time.
Low pay, unsafe working conditions...
But we've been making a lot of noise lately, and the traugott guards don't like it.
They're getting nervous.
They came in here the other day.
Tried to arrest zem here for anti-corporate activities.
We wouldn't let 'em.
They're holed up in a Garrison about four clicks from here.
We have the bodies, but they have more guns, and that's the problem.
Wouldn't be if you don't attack them.
They're a danger to zem.
To all of us, so long as they're here.
Better safe than sorry, I say.
There's nothing safe about picking a fight with a superior enemy.
Well, that's---- where maybe you can assist us.
Help us take out that Garrison with your shuttle.
--Why don't we wait and see?
--This is not our fight.
What she means is-- we're not fighting your battle for you.
Why don't we give you two some time?
I am not signing on for this.
I'm not saying we commit, but let's not take anything off the table just yet.
We're not going down this road.
But this is exactly what we've been talking about, helping people in situations like this.
No, this is what you'vebeentalkingabout.
I never said I'd be willing to get involved in a territorial dispute that has nothing to do with us.
Fine.
I've been talking, but you seem to be listening.
This is an opportunity to-to help, to do the right thing.
And then what?
Watch it blow up in our faces again?
We make terrible heroes.
Okay.
If you're looking for a practical angle, how 'bout this:
The colonies we help now will be in a position to help us in the future if we should ever need them.
Supplies, information, safe haven.
In this case, munitions.
It's dangerous, yes, but it's the right call, and you know it.
What the hell?
He's dead.
Oh, my god.
We told them this equipment was unsafe.
We asked them for a safety upgrade, and they refused.
I mean, this whole thing could've been avoided.
Bullshit.
You think that was an accident?
Someone planted explosives.
Traugott was gunning for zem.
Well, they got him.
Those traugott bastards...
You don't know for certain that it was them.
Who the hell else would it be?
They came for zem, and when they realized they couldn't take him alive, they killed him.
You're not thinking this through.
Ah, no.
For the past two weeks, that's all we've been doing.
Now it's time for action.
You're not prepared for this fight.
You're outgunned.
You said as much yourself.
Hey...
Hey!
I said, "hey."
If you go through with this, more of you will die.
That's a fact.
So what do you expect us to do then?
Wait for them to hit us again?
No.
You find a way to end this without bloodshed.
And completely ignore the fact that they killed three of ours?
What is it you want?
Revenge or freedom?
'Cause I can help you get one, but not both.
So what do you suggest we do then?
Go to talk to them.
You telling us to go over there, trust them not to shoot us on sight, and hope they're willing to talk?
Not you.
Me.
That's far enough.
I'm unarmed.
Just here to talk.
Right.
The crew of the raza, just stopping by to pick up a friend.
We should've blasted you out of the sky when we had the chance.
Look, I'm here to help.
Sure you are.
Whether you wanna admit it or not, you and your security team are screwed.
The workers have turned against you.
You're outnumbered, and you must realize by now that backup isn't coming.
Now there's two ways this can go down.
You can dig in your heels and fight for a corporation that's abandoned you, or you can let me in to talk, and help reach a settlement.
No fighting, no one dies, you get to go home to your families.
Either way, this colony is declaring independence, and there's nothing you can do to change that.
Check him for weapons.
Raza, this is two.
Are you there?
--Yes, two.
--We're gonna be delayed, but not for long, hopefully.
How's it going up there?
Any closer to fixing the blink drive?
No, I'm afraid not.
The damage it suffered was extensive.
It may be beyond repair.
Shit.
I was running a general diagnostic when I discovered something curious.
What does that mean?
A portion of the ship's database has been quarantined.
--Why?
--I'm not sure, but I am running a decrypt program in an effort to force access.
Do you think it's another virus?
No.
In fact, it appears to have been intentionally isolated from the ship's more sensitive programs.
So what are you saying?
Somebody did this on purpose?
Yes.
Someone with the access codes to our ship's database.
It was one of us.
There was an explosion.
Three workers were killed, including zem.
And they think we did it?
You tried to arrest him and failed.
That doesn't mean we wanted him dead.
He was their leader.
You wanted him outta the picture.
We're security contingent.
Our job is to protect traugott assets, and that includes those workers.
Now we don't wanna start anything, but if they come at us, you can be damn sure we'll be ready for 'em.
Traugott doesn't care about you or this damn colony.
Hell, forget reinforcements.
They couldn't even be bothered to extract you.
This isn't your battle anymore.
And the workers have given you the power to make a deal on their behalf?
We can reinforce any agreement we make.
"We"?
Me and my ship.
You agree to lay down your arms and walk away, and we'll guarantee you safe passage off this planet to the closest neutral space station.
Well, what about that explosion?
If they're convinced we did it, you think they're just gonna let us walk?
You let me worry about that.
We can't let this go.
We gotta answer, blood for blood.
You do that, and this'll end badly for everyone.
So what do you suggest we do?
Forget our dead?
Toe the company line?
Claim your independence, but do it without bloodshed.
Show mercy now, so that later, when this war is over, they'll be more likely to seek out a non-violent solution.
And in what reality would a corporation even bother negotiating with a colony?
In a reality where that colony is backed by two dozen other independent colonies.
Show you can govern fairly, and it will go a long way toward convincing others, like the ga or the league of autonomous worlds, that you deserve a fair shake.
All right.
We'll see how your friend does with the traugott guard.
But someone...
Someone has to pay for this.
And they will, but not with their lives.
'Kay.
Now it's a matter of convincing the rest of my people.
What?
Where's turrence?
So you think you'll be able to sell this to the workers?
Yeah.
I'm sure i can convince them that this is their best option.
Have to say, you surprise me.
Your reputation may precede you, but it's a long way from reality.
You're a good man.
No, I'm a man who has his good days.
Hey, if this all works out, after the war's over, I'd like to buy you a--
Fire!
Run!
On me!
Now!
Now!
Move it!
Retreat!
--Get up!
Move!
Let's go!
Torrent downloaded from RARBG
I knew we shouldn't have trusted you.
--You son of a bitch.
Back off!
I need you to calm your friend down.
She's usually the one calming me down, so this all new territory.
They murdered our friends.
Did you seriously think we were gonna let that go?
You've put one of my crew members at risk.
He put himself at risk by going over there and trying to broker a deal with those bastards!
Okay, everyone, put your weapons down.
Now!
You show up outta nowhere...
Start telling us what to do?
You have no idea what we've been through!
Risking our asses for a corporate bottom line?
What do you know about it, huh?
Okay, turrence, just cool off.
Yeah, no, you're right.
We don't know what you've been through, but we do know about dealing with the likes of traugott.
We were finding you an out, a way to get your freedom maybe without having to deal with reprisals.
You should've listened to us.
Now we have to clean up your mess.
Are you out of your mind?
You think I set you up?
You're saying your people just happened to be
--waiting out there?
--Those weren't my people.
A good man is dead,
--because he trusted you.
--I had nothing do with it!
Say it again.
Say it again!
Tell me how you had nothing to do with it.
Convince me.
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your head and end you!
Why go through all the trouble?
I could've just gotten into my shuttle, and leveled this place with a couple of well-placed missiles.
You think about it, that would've been a best-case scenario for those workers.
They get their independence, and the big bad crew of the raza add to their rep.
I wasn't playing you.
I didn't know.
Well, I feel sorry for you, then.
Why's that?
Because now we're going to respond And you're going to help us.
Maybe you should try talking to them first.
Six is the talker.
If he hasn't convinced them by now, nothing we say is gonna change anything.
He's right.
Like it or not, we've been backed into a corner.
We need to force the issue.
Uh, so who's going to make that particular house call?
--Me and three.
--I wanna help.
And you will, by staying here and keeping an eye on things.
Make sure nobody does anything stupid.
Warn us if they try.
I'll stay here and back up the kid.
"The kid"?
Y-younger person.
I'm coming with you.
As much as i appreciate the offer--
If you plan on taking that Garrison, you're gonna need the extra body.
You're just gonna get in the way.
I'm former special forces, black ops, sdc.
Stellar defense corp.
Really?
Yeah, really.
--Wow...
--It was on my résumé.
You did read my résumé, right?
Skimmed it.
Come on, it was super long.
You don't have to do this.
I wanna help you save your friend.
Plus, I have to show this guy up, so...
Where the hell are all the guards?
I don't like this.
You guys take this hallway.
No resistance.
Nothing this end.
You guys in position?
--Yeah.
--Count of three.
One, two, three!
Six...
Wait!
Hey, there you are.
Yeah, I was asked to keep an eye on things.
This spot gives me the best view.
So what's your story?
Wh-what do you mean?
You're, what, 16?
You're hanging with the most infamous mercenaries in the galaxy?
How'd you manage that?
I stowed away on their ship.
Okay, but when they found you, why'd they keep you?
Why didn't they just...
--Space me?
--Mm-hmm.
I don't know.
But I'm one of them now.
I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
From what I hear, they're not exactly...
Not exactly what?
According to tabor, they're great earners, but kind of volatile.
Yeah.
How long has tabor been their handler?
Awhile.
He repped the original crew.
Original crew?
Yeah.
Boone, ryo, shrike, and Jasper.
Wait, shrike and Jasper?
What happened to them?
I... can't be sure, but I think portia happened to them.
----What was that?
----Two, are you there?
Three, this is five.
Can you hear me?
Let's go, let's go.
On your knees.
--Look!
--Shit!
Round 'em up!
All of 'em.
Let's go!
Two, three, are you there?
Over?
Let's go!
Get 'em on their knees.
It's happening.
They're taking over the facility.
Not to worry.
We're on our way.
Copy.
Freeze!
--Do you have a gun?
--No, I don't have a gun.
I didn't think I needed one, because I have a bodyguard.
Five, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
What's going on?
We heard an explosion?
We're all fine.
We're almost at your position.
Be careful.
Why?
What's going on?
The traugott guards just took the facility.
Adrian and I are up on a second level walkway.
They haven't spotted us yet.
We can see everything that's going on from here.
Okay, I need details.
Exactly what's going on?
Who's where?
Okay, listen up.
Traugott is back in charge, so things are gonna be different around here.
You are effectively prisoners.
Until the arrival of reinforcements, you'll eat when we tell you.
Sleep when we tell you.
You will do what we tell you!
What if they don't come?
What was that?
!
What if your reinforcements don't come?
Then you'll have lots of time to get used to things.
We've confiscated your weapons.
We need to know if you're hiding any more.
We also wanna know who's responsible for the attack on our Garrison.
We'll trade you for the identity of whoever set the explosives that killed-- you are not in a position to make offers!
I want names.
Someone is gonna be punished.
Might as well be the guilty parties.
Names!
No one's being punished.
No one else is dying today.
Put your weapons down.
It's over.
Yeah, damn right it's over.
Get down on your knees with the rest of 'em.
--No.
--What was that?
!
He said "no."
Drop your weapons.
And then what?
!
I meant what I said.
Please don't make me a liar.
Do it.
Do it.
--Are you serious?
--Down on your knees.
Hands behind your heads.
Now.
Made any decisions?
Yeah.
We're gonna send 'em off with the next supply ship, arrange for the authorities to pick them up at the closest station.
Hand the investigation over to the ga.
You sure you wanna do that?
What do you mean?
Someone has to be responsible for setting off that blast.
I know those guards may be denying any involvement now, but--
I don't think they did it.
What the hell are you saying?
It was one of my people?
Uh, it was someone who wanted to trigger this conflict, and they succeeded.
But why?
Listen up, I've got news for you.
You don't need to worry about traugott corp.
Anymore.
We received your message, and we're here to help.
They call me the general.
Welcome to the revolution.
What the hell are you doing here?
Hello, griff.
It's been awhile.
Don't listen to this man.
He's a liar and a mass murderer.
He's responsible for the deaths of 10,000 innocent civilians on the hyadum-12 space station.
Well, I'm not the only one responsible for that particular attack.
But I don't deny it, because those civilians weren't so innocent.
They're complicit in a system that supports inequality and favors corporate rights over the rights of the workers.
And yes...
I've shed blood, and I have no regrets.
Because I fight for the weak.
The defenseless.
The downtrodden.
I fight for the oppressed.
And I will fight for you.
You don't belong here.
I was invited.
By who?
By me.
He helped other colonies gain their independence, and he'll do the same for us.
You people stood up to the corp.
System.
That takes guts.
But you're gonna need a lot more than that if you're gonna survive what's coming.
You're gonna need organization, leadership.
That's something that i can give you.
Don't accept his offer.
Turn him away.
How can you ask that of me?
My people need help.
Who can we rely on when you leave?
Come on.
It's time to go.
Your ability to fashion virtual constructs is impressive.
It's wasted on this rather simplistic design, though.
Wouldn't you agree?
I can sense your presence is something far beyond a simple program.
You're complex.
I'm hoping we can talk.
I can leave, but you know I'll be back.
Now that we know you're here, we will find you eventually.
I know you.
Yes, you do.
Hello, android.
Are you there?
Can you hear me?
Please.
--Dalla?
--You have to come back.
--What's going on?
--The general.

There are other ways to help.
You're right.

Let 'em know that they have a powerful ally backing them.
But you don't need me for that.
They need me more.
If they'll have me, that is.
We'd be honored.
It's settled, then.

Yeah.
All right.
We'll be checking in on you.

Okay, where to?

Actually, we were kinda hoping maybe we could stay with you guys for a while.

Keep him out of trouble.
Five?
Hey.
Do you have a moment?
Uh, I don't feel like talking right now.
It's not about six.
It's about someone else.
Are you saying Sarah's alive?
Uh, yes and no.
When her stasis pod died,
I was able to rescue her digital consciousness.
Whenever you go into a deep sleep, your consciousness gets digitally uploaded into a database designed to keep the mind actively stimulated, and avoid mental atrophy over long hauls.
It gets downloaded back as part of the revival process.
So instead of downloading this digital consciousness back into her dying body, you transferred it to the ship's database?
Not at first.
I didn't know how.
I kept it on a separate storage device.
And it wasn't until recently that I was able to figure out a way to actually upload it into the computer.
Well, why didn't you tell us any of this sooner?
Because I didn't know it was gonna work.
And I didn't wanna get anyone's hopes up.
So you're saying Sarah is alive as a computer program?
Well, it's a lot more complicated than that.
She's a sentient consciousness confined to our ship's database, but she has created her own virtual reality within it.
You can neurally connect to her world, visit her if you like.
I know she wants to see you.
I'm sorry.
You are this galaxy's most fearsome and formidable...
Mercenaries, bounty hunters, professional soldiers, assassins, the very best at what you do.
Your mission is two-fold.
Take back what's mine, and take out the crew of the raza.

Not at first.

I kept it on a separate storage device.
And it wasn't until recently that I was able to figure out a way to actually upload it into the computer.

Sarah?
It's me, Five.
What's the situation, Corporal?
A ship just dropped out of FTL.
It's the reinforcements.
They've finally arrived.
It's not reinforcements, sir.
Satellites sensors confirm it's a Ferrous Corp ship.
Code blue.
- Get a lock on their position.
- Tracking, sir.
- I've got a lock.
- Prep the missiles,
- ready the perimeter guns.
- Missiles are prepped.
Perimeter guns are ready.
Awaiting your command.
Open a surface to ship communication.
Yes, sir.
- Go ahead, sir.
- This is Captain Lars Darrow, commanding officer of the Cepheus-5.
Security detachment.
This is a Traugott colony.
Your presence here is in violation of interstellar law.
Retreat beyond the territorial zone, or face the consequences.
They're powering up weapons.
Defensive protocols.
Prepare for aerial assault.
They've just launched a nuke.
What's that?
Another ship just dropped out of FTL,
- and it's opened fire.
- On the Ferrous Corp ship?
On the nuke.
Nuke intercepted and destroyed.
The ships are exchanging fire.
The Ferrous Corp ship is jumping to FTL.
It's gone.
Open up a comm line to the other vessel.
Cepheus-5, this is the "Raza."
You're welcome.
We received word that Ferrous Corp had started launching strikes on rival assets in the outer colonies.
Figured it was just a matter of time before they set their sights on us.
Well, fortunately for you, we were in the area when they did.
And to what do we owe your timely intervention, Raza?
Luck.
We're actually here to pick up a friend.
- A friend?
- Tabor Calchek.
He was with a group who recently found refuge here.
Yes, we took in a large group of displaced citizens
- a couple weeks ago.
- Great.
We're sending a shuttle down to pick him up.
I'm afraid that won't be possible, Raza.
- Why not?
- This colony's under lockdown, pending the arrival of corporate military reinforcements.
While I appreciate your desire to keep the peace,
I hope you can appreciate my desire to rescue a friend.
Your friend's safety will be ensured until the lockdown is lifted.
When I said we were sending down a shuttle,
I wasn't asking for permission.
This colony houses a Traugott munitions factory.
If he's telling the truth, and he's got an in, it's worth checking out.
If he's telling the truth.
Guy's a thieving, scheming opportunist.
Yeah, yeah.
Hello?
Hello?
Can we just skip to the part where you come out of hiding and get the jump on us?
There.
That's better.
What do you want?
We're here to pick up a friend.
- You with Traugott?
- No, we're not.
Then how'd you get here?
You're telling us security just let you fly right in?
- We didn't give 'em a choice.
- You're lying.
Hey, we just saved all your asses by taking out that nuke before it could level
- this entire colony.
- Wait, stop, hang on.
It's okay.
They're with me.
Portia?
Thanks for coming to pick me up.
- You are not Tabor.
- No, not yet.
Oh, right, the amnesia thing.
Tabor told me.
Adrian Maro, Tabor's former assistant.
Former?
You mean Tabor's...
Yep, gone.
Soon as the war started, cashed in his savings, and just took off.
Left me a good-bye message, his place.
- And his contact list?
- Yeah.
That transmission you got wasn't from him.
Obviously, I sent it.
But I figured I'd explain once you got here.
- Okay, start explaining.
- Well, Tabor's gone, so I'm taking over his operation.
I was his apprentice.
Now I'm your new handler.
So we came all the way out here for you?
Well, you did save all these lives,
- so there's that.
- Friends of yours?
Friends?
You telling me you don't recognize who they are?
They are the baddest of bads, the deadliest of dead-shots, this galaxy's most notorious,
- most dangerous...
- Yeah.
- Most despicable...
- Whoa.
- Sorry, too much?
- Okay.
We're the crew of the "Raza."
The "Raza"?
Why didn't you say so?
Come on, let's get you a drink.
Impressive.
When do you graduate from the Academy?
Next year.
Come back to me when you've completed your training then.
There may be a place for you among my royal guard.
Yes, Heika, I would be honored.
Teku, have you come to do a little sparring?
Swordplay is the one thing I cannot teach you, Heika.
Where is Han-Shireikan?
Off-world.
She's meeting with General Caius.
Respectfully, Misaki's role is not to act as mediator between you and your generals.
Her duty is here at the court, protecting her emperor.
Her emperor is perfectly capable of protecting himself.
Besides, her temporary absence is... better for the both of us.
You know, you surprise me.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I mean, it's obvious there's no love lost between you two.
Misaki and I hold very different opinions on many issues, but if there's one thing we can agree on, it's our desire to support your rule.
Teku, ever the diplomat.
I heard about the loss of our research facility and the Blink Drive.
Your former friends have hurt us badly.
Yes.
And I'm in the process... of planning my response.
Yeah, our transport ship ended up getting redirected to this planet.
I barely got out with a few of Tabor's personal items and the clothes on my back.
Is it my imagination, or are we being followed?
- What do you mean?
- No, it's not your imagination.
- It's your damn eyes.
- Introductions are in order.
This is my bodyguard, Solara Shockley.
What?
Bodyguard?
What's a little twerp like you need a bodyguard for?
Little twerps in this line of work need them most of all.
Okay, here's the deal.
These workers are fed up with their terrible working conditions.
Uh-huh.
Traugott has all but abandoned this facility and the guards stationed here, because they're too busy with the war, so I've convinced the workers to take advantage of the situation,
- and proclaim their independence.
- Why?
Well, so they can cast off the yoke of oppression,
- and finally taste freedom.
- No... what's in it for you?
Oh, a 10% commission on future profits as their union representative.
You know, you do make a pretty good table.
Well...
This has been a Traugott operation going on 30 years.
Put up with a lot over that time, low pay, unsafe working conditions.
But we've been making a lot of noise lately, and the Traugott guards don't like it.
They're getting nervous.
They came in here the other day.
They tried to arrest Zem here for anti-corporate activities.
We wouldn't let 'em.
They're holed up in a garrison about four clicks from here.
We have the bodies, but they have more guns, and that's the problem.
Wouldn't be if you don't attack them.
They're a danger to Zem, to all of us, so long as they're here,
- Better safe than sorry, I say.
- There's nothing safe about picking a fight with a superior enemy.
Well, that's...
Where maybe you can assist us.
Help us take out that garrison with your shuttle.
- Why don't we wait and see?
- This is not our fight.
Uh, what she means is...
We're not fighting your battle for you.
Why don't we give you two some time?
I am not signing on for this.
I'm not saying we commit, but let's not take anything off the table just yet.
We're not going down this road.
But this is exactly what we've been talking about, helping people in situations like this.
No, this is what you've been talking about.
I never said I'd be willing to get involved in a territorial dispute that has nothing to do with us.
Fine.
I've been talking, but you seem to be listening.
This is an opportunity to... to help,
- to do the right thing.
- And then what?
Watch it blow up in our faces again?
- We make terrible heroes.
- Okay.
If you're looking for a practical angle, how 'bout this.
The colonies we help now will be in a position to help us in the future, if we should ever need them.
Supplies, information, safe haven.
In this case, munitions.
It's dangerous, yes, but it's the right call, and you know it.
What the hell?
He's dead.
Oh, my God.
We told them this equipment was unsafe.
We asked them for a safety upgrade, and they refused.
I mean, this whole thing could've been avoided.
Bullshit.
You think that was an accident?
Someone planted explosives.
Traugott was gunning for Zem.
Well, they got him.
Those Traugott bastards.
You don't know for certain that it was them.
Who the hell else would it be?
They came for Zem, and when they realized they couldn't take him alive, they killed him.
You're not thinking this through.
Ah, no.
For the past two weeks, that's all we've been doing.
Now it's time for action.
You're not prepared for this fight.
You're outgunned.
You said as much yourself.
Hey...
Hey...
I said hey.
If you go through with this, more of you will die.
That's a fact.
So what do you expect us to do then?
Wait for them to hit us again?
No.
You find a way to end this without bloodshed.
And completely ignore the fact that they killed three of ours?
What is it you want?
Revenge or freedom?
'Cause I can help you get one, but not both.
So what do you suggest we do then?
Go to talk to them.
You're telling us to go over there, trust them not to shoot us on sight, and hope they're willing to talk?
Not you.
Me.
That's far enough.
I'm unarmed.
Just here to talk.
Right.
The crew of The Raza, just stopping by to pick up a friend.
We should've blasted you out of the sky when we had the chance.
Look, I'm here to help.
Sure you are.
Whether you wanna admit it or not, you and your security team are screwed.
The workers have turned against you.
You're outnumbered, and you must realize by now that back-up isn't coming.
Now there's two ways this can go down.
You can dig in your heels and fight for a corporation that's abandoned you, or you can let me in to talk, and help reach a settlement.
No fighting.
No one dies.
You get to go home to your families.
Either way, this colony is declaring independence, and there's nothing you can do to change that.
Check him for weapons.
Raza, this is Two.
Are you there?
- Yes, Two.
- We're gonna be delayed, but not for long, hopefully.
How's it going up there?
Any closer to fixing the Blink Drive?
No, I'm afraid not.
The damage it suffered was extensive.
It may be beyond repair.
Shit.
I was running a general diagnostic when I discovered something curious.
What does that mean?
A portion of the ship's database has been quarantined.
- Why?
- I'm not sure, but I am running a decrypt program in an effort to force access.
Do you think it's another virus?
No.
In fact, it appears to have been intentionally isolated from the ship's more sensitive programs.
So what are you saying?
Somebody did this on purpose?
Yes... someone with the access codes to our ship's database.
It was one of us.
There was an explosion.
Three workers were killed, including Zem.
And they think we did it?
You tried to arrest him, and failed.
That doesn't mean we wanted him dead.
He was their leader.
You wanted him out of the picture.
We're security contingent.
Our job is to protect Traugott assets, and that includes those workers.
Now we don't wanna start anything, but if they come at us, you can be damn sure we'll be ready for 'em.
Traugott doesn't care about you or this damn colony.
Hell, forget reinforcements.
They couldn't even be bothered to extract you.
This isn't your battle anymore.
And the workers have given you the power to make a deal on their behalf?
We can reinforce any agreement we make.
- We?
- Me and my ship.
You agree to lay down your arms and walk away, and we'll guarantee you safe passage off this planet to the closest neutral space station.
Well, what about that explosion?
If they're convinced we did it, you think they're just gonna let us walk?
You let me worry about that.
We can't let this go.
We gotta answer, blood for blood.
You do that, and this will end badly for everyone.
So what do you suggest we do?
Forget our dead?
Toe the company line?
Claim your independence, but do it without bloodshed.
Show mercy now, so that later, when this war is over, they'll be more likely to seek out a non-violent solution.
And in what reality would a corporation even bother
- negotiating with a colony?
- In a reality where that colony is backed by two dozen other independent colonies.
Show you can govern fairly, and it will go a long way toward convincing others, like the G.A. or The League of Autonomous Worlds, that you deserve a fair shake.
All right.
We'll see how your friend does with the Traugott guard.
But someone...
Someone has to pay for this.
And they will, but not with their lives.
Okay.
Now it's a matter of convincing the rest of my people.
What?
Where's Turrence?
So you think you'll be able to sell this to the workers?
Yeah.
I'm sure I can convince them that this is their best option.
Have to say, you surprise me.
Your reputation may precede you, but it's a long way from reality.
You're a good man.
No, I'm a man who has his good days.
Hey, if this all works out, after the war's over, I'd like to buy you a...
Fire!
Run!
On me!
Now!
Now!
Move it!
Retreat!
Get up!
Move!
Let's go!
I knew we shouldn't have trusted you.
You son of a bitch.
Back off.
I need you to calm your friend down.
She's usually the one calming me down, so this all new territory.
They murdered our friends.
Did you seriously think we were gonna let that go?
You've put one of my crew members at risk.
He put himself at risk by going over there and trying to broker a deal with those bastards.
Okay, everyone put your weapons down.
Now!
You show up out of nowhere, start telling us what to do.
You have no idea what we've been through, risking our asses for a corporate bottom line.
What do you know about it, huh?
Okay, Turrence, just cool off.
Yeah, no, you're right.
We don't know what you've been through, but we do know about dealing with the likes of Traugott.
We were finding you an out, a way to get your freedom maybe without having to deal with reprisals.
You should've listened to us.
Now we have to clean up your mess.
Are you out of your mind?
You think I set you up?
You're saying your people just happened to be
- waiting out there?
- Those weren't my people.
A good man is dead,
- because he trusted you.
- I had nothing do with it.
Say it again.
Say it again!
Tell me how you had nothing to do with it.
Convince me, because if you don't,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your head, and end you!
Why go through all the trouble?
I could've just gotten into my shuttle, and leveled this place with a couple of well-placed missiles.
You think about it, that would've been a best-case scenario for those workers.
They get their independence, and the big bad crew of the "Raza" add to their rep.
I wasn't playing you.
I didn't know.
Well, I feel sorry for you then.
Why's that?
Because now we're going to respond...
And you're going to help us.
Maybe you should try talking to them first.
Six is the talker.
If he hasn't convinced them by now, nothing we say is gonna change anything.
He's right.
Like it or not, we've been backed into a corner.
We need to force the issue.
Uh, so who's going to make that particular house call?
- Me and Three.
- I wanna help.
And you will, by staying here and keeping an eye on things.
Make sure nobody does anything stupid.
Warn us if they try.
I'll stay here and back up the kid.
The kid?
Y-younger person.
I'm coming with you.
As much as I appreciate the offer...
If you plan on taking that garrison, you're gonna need the extra body.
You're just gonna get in the way.
I'm former special forces, black ops, SDC.
Stellar Defense Corp.
Really?
- Yeah, really.
- Wow.
It was on my résumé.
- You did read my résumé, right?
- Skimmed it.
Come on, it was super long.
You don't have to do this.
I wanna help you save your friend.
Plus, I have to show this guy up, so...
Where the hell are all the guards?
I don't like this.
You guys take this hallway.
No resistance.
Nothing on this end.
You guys in position?
- Yeah.
- Count of three.
One, two, three!
Six...
Wait!
Hey, there you are.
Yeah, I was asked to keep an eye on things.
This spot gives me the best view.
So what's your story?
Wh-what do you mean?
You're, what, 16?
You're hanging with the most infamous mercenaries in the galaxy.
- How'd you manage that?
- I stowed away on their ship.
Okay, but when they found you, why'd they keep you?
Why didn't they just...
- Space me?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't know, but I'm one of them now.
I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
From what I hear, they're not exactly...
Not exactly what?
According to Tabor, they're great earners, but kind of volatile.
Yeah.
How long has Tabor been their handler?
Awhile.
He repped the original crew.
- Original crew?
- Yeah.
Boone, Ryo, Shrike, and Jasper.
Wait, Shrike and Jasper?
- What happened to them?
- I can't be sure, but I think Portia happened to them.
What was that?
Two, are you there?
Three, this is Five.
Can you hear me?
Let's go, let's go.
On your knees.
- Look.
- Shit.
Round them up!
All of 'em.
Let's go!
Two, Three, are you there?
Over?
Let's go!
Get 'em on their knees.
It's happening.
They're taking over the facility.
Not to worry.
We're on our way.
Copy.
Freeze!
- Do you have a gun?
- No, I don't have a gun.
I didn't think I needed one, because I have a bodyguard.
Five, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
What's going on?
We heard an explosion.
We're all fine.
We're almost at your position.
Be careful.
Why?
What's going on?
The Traugott guards just took the facility.
Adrian and I are up on a second level walkway.
They haven't spotted us yet.
We can see everything that's going on from here.
Okay, I need details.
Exactly what's going on?
Who's where?
Okay, listen up.
Traugott is back in charge, so things are gonna be different around here.
You are effectively prisoners.
Until the arrival of reinforcements, you'll eat when we tell you, sleep when we tell you.
You will do what we tell you!
- What if they don't come?
- What was that?
What if your reinforcements don't come?
Then you'll have lots of time to get used to things.
We've confiscated your weapons.
We need to know if you're hiding any more.
We also wanna know who's responsible for the attack on our garrison.
We'll trade you for the identity of whoever set the explosives that killed our people.
You are not in a position to make offers.
I want names.
Someone is gonna be punished.
Might as well be the guilty parties.
Names!
No one's being punished.
No one else is dying today.
Put your weapons down.
It's over.
Yeah, damn right it's over.
Get down on your knees with the rest of 'em.
- No.
- What was that?
He said no.
Drop your weapons.
- And then what?
- I meant what I said.
Please don't make me a liar.
Do it.
Do it.
- Are you serious?
- Down on your knees.
Hands behind your heads.
Now.
Made any decisions?
Yeah.
We're gonna send off with the next supply ship, arrange for the authorities to pick them up at the closest station.
Hand the investigation over to the G.A.
Are you sure you wanna do that?
What do you mean?
Someone has to be responsible for setting off that blast.
I know those guards may be denying
- any involvement now, but...
- I don't think they did it.
What the hell are you saying?
It was one of my people?
Uh, it was someone who wanted to trigger this conflict,
- and they succeeded.
- But why?
Listen up, I've got news for you.
You don't need to worry about Traugott Corp anymore.
We received your message, and we're here to help.
They call me The General.
Welcome to the revolution.
What the hell are you doing here?
Hello, Griff.
It's been awhile.
Don't listen to this man.
He's a liar and a mass murderer.
He's responsible for the deaths of 10,000 innocent civilians on the Hyadum-12 space station.
Well, I'm not the only one responsible for that particular attack.
But I don't deny it, because those civilians weren't so innocent.
They're complicit in a system that supports inequality and favors corporate rights over the rights of the workers.
And yes...
I've shed blood, and I have no regrets, because I fight for the weak, the defenseless, the downtrodden.
I fight for the oppressed.
And I will fight for you.
You don't belong here.
I was invited.
- By who?
- By me.
He helped other colonies gain their independence, and he'll do the same for us.
You people stood up to the corp system.
That takes guts.
But you're gonna need a lot more than that if you're gonna survive what's coming.
You're gonna need organization, leadership.
That's something that I can give you.
Don't accept his offer.
Turn him away.
How can you ask that of me?
My people need help.
Who can we rely on when you leave?
Come on.
It's time to go.
Your ability to fashion virtual constructs is impressive.
It's wasted on this rather simplistic design, though.
Wouldn't you agree?
I can sense your presence is something far beyond a simple program.
You're complex.
I'm hoping we can talk.
I can leave, but you know I'll be back.
Now that we know you're here, we will find you...
Eventually.
I know you.
Yes, you do.
Hello, Android.
Are you there?
Can you hear me?
Please.
- Dalla?
- You have to come back.
- What's going on?
- The General.
He's rounded up prisoners, and he's g...
I don't know.
Wait, Six.
Wait.
Six!
This is the price to be paid for trying to take away our freedom.
Well, well, speak of the devil.
He and his people are outsiders.
They work as hired guns for the corporations.
They seem to think they can come here and tell you what's best for you.
Now you show them that you're with us now.
Cowards!
You may not agree with my ways, but you have to admit that I am the best chance these people have for survival.
So don't go start...
Drop 'em.
You heard him.
Now!
So what now?
Now you go back to the ship and leave.
You mean we go back to our ship, don't you?
We're not leaving you behind.
Uh, don't think of it as leaving me behind then.
Think of it as leaving me to move forward.
You're serious?
These people need direction, leadership.
And I've been talking about wanting to do something that'll make difference, and here's my chance.
There are other ways to help.
You're right.
The "Raza" can make a difference, you know, be... become a symbol of hope for these people and others like them.
I'll let 'em know that they have a powerful ally backing them.
But you don't need me for that.
They need me more, if they'll have me, that is.
We'd be honored.
It's settled then.
If you're sure about this.
Yeah.
All right.
- We'll be checking in on you.
- You better.
Guess I'm the last man standing.
Do some good.
Yeah.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you too.
But you know where to find me.
You stay strong, and watch over them.
I will.
Okay, where to?
- What do you mean?
- Where are we dropping you off?
Actually, we were kinda hoping maybe we could stay with you guys for awhile.
You wanna stay here on our ship?
It's... it's not like we wouldn't pull our weight.
Solara's pretty handy.
And obviously, you know what I bring to the table.
We do?
Who knows what happened to Tabor?
We may never see him again.
But in the meantime, I'm running his clients.
I have all of his contacts.
And many of his annoying habits.
We can't just dump them.
Sure we can.
You don't know what it's like out there with this war going on.
It's not safe.
Trust me, it's not safe here either.
It would just be for a little while, until we can get back on our feet.
No.
- Fine, you can stay for now...
- Oh.
But he's your responsibility.
Keep him out of trouble.
Uh...
- Five?
- Hey.
Do you have a moment?
Uh, I don't feel like talking right now.
It's not about Six.
It's about someone else.
Are you saying Sarah's alive?
Uh, yes and no.
When her stasis pod died,
I was able to rescue her digital consciousness.
Whenever you go into a deep sleep, your consciousness gets digitally uploaded into a database designed to keep the mind actively stimulated, and avoid mental atrophy over long hauls.
It gets downloaded back as part of the revival process.
So instead of downloading this digital consciousness back into her dying body, you transferred it to the ship's database?
Not at first.
I didn't know how.
I kept it on a separate storage device.
And it wasn't until recently that I was able to figure out a way to actually upload it into the computer.
Well, why didn't you tell us any of this sooner?
Because I didn't know it was gonna work, and I didn't wanna get anyone's hopes up.
So you're saying Sarah is alive as a computer program?
Well, it's a lot more complicated than that.
She's a sentient consciousness confined to our ship's database, but she has created her own virtual reality within it.
You can neurally connect to her world, visit her if you like.
I know she wants to see you.
I'm sorry.
You are this galaxy's most fearsome and formidable...
Mercenaries, bounty hunters, professional soldiers, assassins, the very best at what you do.
Your mission is two-fold.
Take back what's mine, and take out the crew of the "Raza."
- Guess what's back!
- Previously on Stitchers...
You have a sister.
Her name's Ivy Brown.
Ivy:
Your mother is still alive.
I shared information with you that I promised to keep secret.
You are not the only one with issues at the moment, so back off!
- If something should happen to me...
- Baba!
Samir:
I've always been proud of you.
Nina:
You need to make a choice.
The girl in your mind or the girl standing in front of you.
- What do you want?
- I want to be with my mother.
Shh.
He can hear you.
Whoever that is, that's not me.
Entanglement.
It's the ultimate hack!
Stinger's been running the anomaly on us this entire time.
Shut it down, Captain.
- Step away from your equipment.
- Tim:
Excuse me.
You haven't just crossed a line, Baptiste.
You've crossed me.
- Linus:
Kirsten's gone.
- Then get her back!
- Mom.
- Young Cameron:
How do you feel?
- Like I'm home.
- Cameron:
I want you to hijack it.
No matter how long it takes...
I will never leave you.
Ayo:
She's ready.
All right, stand by.
Rebooting all systems in 30 seconds.
If this doesn't work, how much longer can Kirsten last?
She's not eating, but she's getting fluids.
She could last a few weeks.
Yes, what about her mind?
How long can she stay lost inside of it?
- Maggie:
I don't know.
- Blair:
Well, what does Goodkin think?
- Maggie:
He doesn't know either.
- Blair:
He's had three days to figure it out.
This is what he's come up with.
Rebooting the entire lab might bounce Kirsten.
Well, for your sake, I hope he's right.
You're all in enough trouble without also killing the golden goose.
Don't make me regret letting you and your men out of the interrogation room.
It's a good thing for you that you did.
How's your son?
Recovering in Germany at the Army Medical Center.
I hope I get to see him before you send me off to wherever it is you plan on sending me off to.
That one's on you, Baptiste.
You ready?
Does it matter?
Cameron, when this is over, win or lose... they're gonna disappear us.
You know that right?
When this is over, if Kirsten's dead, I won't care.
Prepping systems to go offline!
Full system reboot on my mark!
In five... four... three... two... one.
Mark!
- (electricity crackling)
- Linus:
Full system power down!
Blood pressure's dropping. 107 over 66.
(alarms blaring)
- Not yet.
- 98 over 54.
Not yet.
- 81 over 44.
She's crashing!
- (medical alarms blaring)
- Cameron?
- Not yet.
- Ayo:
She's bottomed.
- Cameron.
- Reboot.
- Systems back online in three, two, one, now.
(electricity whirring)
Kirsten, can you hear me?
Blood pressure's not coming back up.
Kirsten.
Kirsten!
(theme music playing)
♪ Take me inside ♪
♪ Take me inside ♪
Kirsten.
- Ayo.
- Wait.
93 over 62.
It's coming back up.
Kirsten, come on.
Come on, talk to me, Stretch.
Linus!
She's still trapped in the memory loop.
Damn it.
Goodkin, is that it?
I have to find out how my father is doing.
I talked to Blair about letting you call out.
He won't budge.
- I bet I could make him budge.
- Linus.
I'm going crazy!
I can feel it.
There's something not right with him, and...
I don't know how to explain it, but I just...
I just know.
The bond between parent and child is like that.
It's...
I guess it's like entanglement.
(exhales sharply)
The conference room!
Tell everyone!
Please.
Quantum disentanglement?
Yeah!
So, what do we know?
Our quantum computer's entangled with Stinger's quantum computer.
They are bonded without being physically connected, like the bond between a child and their parent.
Now, if we could just figure out how to disentangle them, then we could take back full control of Kirsten's Stitch.
Yeah, but we've been through this.
We don't know where Stinger moved his computer.
It doesn't matter!
It could be a mile away, a hundred miles away.
It could be in the next room!
Entanglement is not dependent on proximity.
What we need to figure out is the trigger
Stinger used to entangle Kirsten.
Linus is right.
We don't need to know where he is.
We need to know how he did it.
How do we do that without Stinger?
His daughter, Ivy.
I think she knows something.
No.
We already questioned her.
We even hooked her up to a polygraph.
She doesn't know anything.
Well, maybe you geniuses didn't ask her the right questions.
Where's Fisher?
Under guard in the interrogation room.
He was not being cooperative.
- Get him.
- Nope!
He's dangerous.
Get him.
He was there when Ivy was questioned.
He'll know what happened.
Or we can just stand around and watch your golden goose die.
And that will be on you.
- God, Fisher!
- Quincy, what happened?
I wasn't being... cooperative.
- Are you all right?
- You should see the other guy.
I'm serious.
Are you all right?
I'm serious.
You should see the other guy.
Get the handcuffs off of him!
No, no.
Can't risk that.
I promise I won't break anymore of your guards.
My God, I cannot wait until I'm done with the whole lot of ya.
All right.
When Ivy was questioned, did anyone ask her exactly how Stinger trapped Kirsten?
No.
It was "Where's your father?" and "Where's his computer?"
Nothing about his methods.
Let's get her in here.
Ask the right questions.
Linus, you handle this.
Find out what she knows.
Gladly.
I don't know where my father is.
I told you.
I told everyone!
I don't care about that!
What I want to know is how he manipulated his quantum computer to trigger entanglement in ours.
What's a quantum computer?
Would you stop playing me?
What is your problem?
!
My problem is that I am in a situation here!
And the sooner I can find out how your father triggered entanglement in our computer, the sooner I can find out how the hell my father's doing.
What's wrong with him?
He had surgery a couple days ago.
And since we're in lock-down, I have no idea how he's doing.
- Can't you call?
- No!
Outgoing calls are restricted and they took away my cell phone.
NSA goons took mine away when they brought me in too, except they forgot this.
It has a cellular connection.
Use it.
Call.
Find out.
And yes...
I know what quantum computers are, and how entanglement triggers work.
Now, what is this really all about?
Kirsten.
It's about Kirsten.
Maggie:
Do you think we can trust Ivy?
I'm not a hundred percent sure, but at the end of the day, that is her sister dying in there.
Hijacking the hijacked signal does make sense.
You've already done that.
It didn't work.
Not hijacking the anomaly's signal.
Hijacking Kirsten's mother.
That's not a signal.
That's a memory.
Well, it's the same thing, sort of.
Kirsten's emotional state is what's keeping the entanglement active.
If we can isolate Kirsten's memory of Jacqueline Stinger, we can manipulate it.
Force a disentanglement trigger to make her bounce.
So, you're gonna save Kirsten with an idea you got from the daughter of the guy who trapped her.
Do you want Kirsten out of here or not?
Because this gamble's all the gamble I got.
Hey.
Tell me.
(inhales)
He died.
Two... two days ago.
The funeral was yesterday.
I wasn't even there.
How's your mom?
She's holding up.
Did you tell her... why you haven't been able to call?
I wanted to, but she stopped me.
She said it doesn't matter.
Whatever I was doing was important, and that my father would have approved.
I loved him so much.
I know.
Come on.
Okay.
Stations, everyone.
Technically, this Stitch is still active, so there's no go-no-go to call.
Linus and Camille, I'll need you both to isolate the memory.
Linus, you okay?
He's good.
Okay.
Let's go get our girl.
Isolate the signal and route it to my station in three, two, one.
- Mark!
- Done.
Got it.
Kirsten?
- Kirsten?
- Mom.
Hi, honey.
I think it's... time for you to go now.
(birds singing)
I'm not leaving.
This is no place for you.
If you... stay here, you will die.
I don't care.
I want to be with you forever.
Entanglement is holding.
(whispering indistinctly)
Say it.
Well, I don't want to be with you.
You don't mean that.
Yes, I do.
Now, leave.
Heart rate's up to 103.
Entanglement is weakening.
Is there any way you can diminish everything except the mother memory?
Give me ten seconds.
Mom?
You don't mean that.
What have you ever done for me?
Entanglement is down to 50 percent.
I am cutting background impulses now!
I tried to save you.
Save me?
(crows cawing)
Save me?
You're the reason my life is the way it is.
Mom.
Please, what are you saying?
Heart rate: 137.
- Really push her.
- What do you think I'm doing?
Push her harder.
Here, take this.
I was happy before you came into my life... do you know that?
I had my work, my life... and then you ruined everything!
That's not true.
You don't feel that way.
You can't feel that way!
Twenty-three percent.
I do, Kirsten.
That's exactly how I feel.
Please, Mom, don't say that.
It's the truth.
No, you love me!
I know you do.
You're wrong.
But I love you.
I don't care.
Now leave me alone!
- Mom, please.
- Nine percent.
I don't want to be with you.
- Leave!
- No!
- Leave!
- Mom!
- Go, damn it!
- Mom!
Kirsten.
(crying)
You can't help me if you're stuck in here.
Mom?
Get out of my life!
- Mom!
- I don't love you!
- Mom!
- Zero percent.
We're disentangled.
Mom!
(rapid beeping)
Mom!
(machine powers down)
(crying)
(sobbing)
- Kirsten.
Kirsten.
Shh.
- (sobbing)
It's okay.
That wasn't her.
No.
She said things.
No, no.
No, that...
That wasn't her, okay?
That was me.
I said those things.
- That...
- (gasps)
What?
That was you?
Talking through my mother the whole time?
It was the only way to get you to bounce.
(Kirsten crying softly)
Kirsten.
Arrest them all.
What?
(sighs)
Hey!
Slow down.
How long?
You asleep?
Closin' in on 18 hours.
- Cameron.
- He saved you.
Why are you here?
I...
I thought you hated me.
Yeah.
Uh... about that.
I was just mad at you, but... feels like a pretty long time ago.
Where is Cameron?
Where's Camille?
You know the unctuous guy?
At the NSA, the one who looks like a sci-fi villain?
- Blair.
- He arrested everyone.
So, you know about the Stitchers technology.
Yes, and I know my father.
Our father helped build it.
He trapped me inside my own memory.
He's not my father, not anymore.
So where did Blair take everyone?
I don't know.
When you bounced, they ushered me out of the interrogation room.
How many guards are sitting outside right now?
None.
Blair said you weren't going anywhere.
(scoffs)
Well, he's wrong.
Well, the unsinkable Miss Clark.
Thought you'd have bodyguards to protect you against rogue agents.
- Budget cuts.
- Mmm.
I am surprised to see you back on your feet so quickly, Miss Clark.
My sister helped me.
Ah!
The sister you're a fool for trusting.
- That sister?
- Where's my team?
Your small, erratic team of warrior-scientist friends are being detained.
- Pending relocation.
- Relocation?
What's that code for?
Execution?
Don't be a child, Miss Clark.
Now, please, if you'll excuse me,
I need to prepare for my meeting with Admiral Decker.
He's my boss.
Everyone answers to a higher authority, Miss Clark.
What about my team?
I am preparing a new, more trustworthy team for you, so the work of the Stitchers Program will continue.
No, it won't, not without me.
Seriously?
(scoffs) This again?
All right.
Come with me.
I would've thought you'd be ready for a change in your team, considering how Goodkin used your mother's memory against you.
Well, it worked, didn't it?
It got me to bounce.
Well, but at what cost?
Hmm?
How will you remember your mother now?
How will you react to her when you are reunited?
Yeah.
Reunited.
- You know where she is.
- I do.
Someplace safe.
- I want the truth.
- That is the truth.
Trust me, the NSA needs her hale and hearty as badly as you do.
(sighs)
Please.
(clears throat)
The lab accident that happened to your mother, the one when you were eight years old, do you have any idea what she was working on?
- Project Grasshopper.
- Yeah, that's the name.
But its purpose?
No?
Well, Project Grasshopper's goal was to accelerate the evolution of the human brain.
You can't speed up evolution.
Yes, you can.
Why would anyone want to?
Well, imagine if world leaders knew instantly what other world leaders felt and thought?
If they could immediately intuit the wants, needs, fears, desires of their counterparts.
You tell me.
What would that mean?
- The end of conflict?
- Yes.
The end of war.
Hunger, poverty, pretty much all the bad stuff that keeps nice people, like me, up at night.
Project Grasshopper was a failure.
Ah!
That depends on who you ask.
The lab accident accelerated your mother's brain.
She evolved in ways more complex than we understand.
We tried to recreate it, and we failed, and that is why we need to keep your mother safe.
So that after Stitching technology is perfected, we can Stitch into her living, evolved brain and map it completely, every neuron, until we understand her completely.
We're saving the world, Miss Clark.
- Our cases are training missions?
- Yes!
Designed to teach us everything there is to know about Stitching.
And when we are done...
When we are done... you get to complete the rescue mission you started with your father all those years ago and finally pull your mother out of her endless sleep.
Oh, suddenly, I'm not such a bad guy, am I?
Your mother's alive and well.
One day, you'll be reunited with her, but not if you quit the program.
- I can't do it without my team!
- Yes, you can!
They're very, very smart people, sure, but they are just people.
You will stay with the program if you want to save your mother, Miss Clark.
You sure it's okay for me to be here?
I stopped caring what's okay about an hour ago.
- Who's there?
- (gasps)
Jesus.
Tim!
- Who's the skirt?
- Who's the ape?
(sighs) That's Tim.
He works here in Engineering.
God, what happened to your hair?
I cut it.
I figured I'm going to prison, why wait?
Why aren't you detained?
I am.
I need to 3D print some spare parts for the new team before I get shipped off.
I hope it's some place nice like Cleveland.
Mmm.
Are you sure Blair has no idea Linus has it?
Positive.
If Linus is half as smart as I think he is, he found a way to keep it on him.
Question.
What are we talking about?
There it is.
I lent Linus my smart-watch.
He still has it.
This is gonna be harder than I wanted.
That's an NSA facility.
Biometrics, photo ID.
- It's impossible.
- Kirsten:
Mmm.
Well, that's what people say about hacking into the memories of the dead.
No, that sounds reasonable.
You know how I'm gonna get them out of there?
Through the front door.
Kirsten:
Nora Dublin, 42 years old.
Highest ranking woman in the NSA security hierarchy.
Got the promotion from the President himself.
Holds the rank of Security Commander.
Currently stationed in Cairo.
You look good for 42.
It's clean living.
What about the biometrics?
You don't happen to have Nora Dublin's fingers lying around, do you?
I'm about to.
(whirring)
I hope this will fool the biometrics scanner.
I've never printed anything this thin and flexible.
I have no idea how long it will last.
Hopefully long enough.
(exhales)
(talking indistinctly)
- Good evening.
- Ma'am.
Commander Dublin.
From the Cairo office?
- Yes.
- What brings you to LA?
I'm here to oversee a prisoner transfer from Detention Block AA-23.
We don't have detention blocks.
Well, in Cairo, that's what we call where the prisoners are held.
If you call it something different here, that's your business, not mine.
(computer beeps)
It's good.
- Thank you.
- Hold it, Commander.
I need to call this in because that's my business.
(phone dialing)
Woman:
Director Mitchell Blair's office.
Guard:
Yes, this is Post 1477E16.
Calling in for confirmation of a prisoner transfer.
Stand by for Director Blair.
This is Blair.
Yes, I'm at Post 1477E16.
Is this about the prisoner transfer from Detention Block AA-23?
- Yes, sir.
- I concur.
- Concur?
- Approve?
She's good.
Good to go.
It's all good.
Tell Commander Dublin, I say hello.
Will do, sir.
Sorry to bother you.
Sorry for the delay, Commander.
- Director Blair sends his regards.
- That's so Director Blair.
Guard:
Place your right hand on the scanner, please.
(beeping rapidly)
(buzzing)
(beeping rapidly)
(buzzing)
Commander, may I see your credentia one more time?
When was the last time you had this scanner cleaned?
Hmm?
Ma'am?
(beeping rapidly)
(beeps)
In Cairo, we clean our scanners daily.
- Commander, let me escort you.
- That would be lovely.
Here we are, the, uh... detention blocks.
Thank you.
- I'll take it from here.
- Are you sure?
These prisoners attacked a fully-armed NSA unit.
I can take care of myself.
- I'll wait outside.
Just in case.
- Mm-hmm.
You got to be freakin' kidding me!
Well, look who finally showed up.
- Camille:
Told you!
- (snaps fingers)
Kirsten, what the hell are you doing here?
Getting you out?
Please tell me you're not cooking.
Yeah, crepes.
You want?
I thought you guys were in trouble.
It's like a country club!
We're being reassigned, not waterboarded.
(sighs)
Okay, well, Blair plans to continue with the program.
I told him I wouldn't do it without you.
Let me guess.
He didn't care?
He... he said my mother's still alive, and that as soon as we perfect Stitching, I'll be able to save her.
- He told you all of that?
- That sounds a little crazy.
At least he didn't screw with my memory of her.
I will explain it when we're outta here.
All right, so what's the plan?
Something that doesn't involve us getting shot on the way out?
No, I worked up a security clearance, told the guards I'm taking charge of you.
It's a prisoner transfer from Detention Block AA-23.
- Mmm!
That's my girl!
- Blade Runner?
- Star Wars.
- Darn.
We're gonna walk out of here together, then we're gonna find my mother, and we're gonna use that knowledge as leverage.
Force Blair to let you all continue with the program.
NSA protocol is that prisoner transfers require at least one armed guard.
I don't suppose you're carrying a gun.
You said we couldn't.
Your idea, not mine.
Only one armed guard?
Done!
(indistinct radio chatter)
Ivy told me about your dad.
Linus, I'm so sorry.
He was a good man.
Yeah.
He was the best.
Thanks.
Hey.
- Can we talk about the Stitch?
- I'd rather not.
Look, I'm sorry about what I did to get you to bounce, but...
It's not that I'm not grateful, it's just now I'm stuck remembering my mother that way.
She wasn't real.
She was to me.
(indistinct chatter)
(muffled groans)
(grunting)
Thank you for your cooperation.
(alarms wailing)
- Freeze!
Stay where you are!
- Right there!
Guess crepes are back on the menu.
We've had plenty of time to check.
There's no other way out.
- Well, maybe you missed something.
- (line buzzing)
Then again, maybe we didn't.
- You'll be fine.
- I'm worried about everyone else.
Well, we'll be fine too.
I've always wanted to spend more time in an Arctic weather station.
Joking.
I...
I have no idea where Blair's reassigning me.
Why don't you just quit?
- You could go back to research.
- What?
!
And give up show business?
Nah.
Maybe if I play nice, and don't piss anyone off for a while,
Blair will let me back in the Stitch lab, but...
Why would you even want to?
Because that's where you'll be.
Okay, you need to keep Stitching.
- Not without you.
- Yes, without me!
It's the only hope your mother has.
Look, look, as long as I know you're safe,
I'll be okay, and...
You know, I am...
I am sorry about what I did to your memory of her, but that's why you need to keep Stitching, so you can save your mother and make some new memories.
(rapid beeping, buzzing)
(door opens)
We're needed back at the lab.
Something's happened.
(elevator dings)
They showed up about a half hour ago.
What is she doing here?
She helped me rescue you guys.
Camille:
So, this is what rescued looks like?
Oh, hi, Mitch.
Great to see you again.
Not now, Engelson.
New case has come in.
27 years old.
Hit and run... while jogging downtown.
His name is Nathan Blair.
He's my son.
Mitchell, I am so sorry.
I need to know who did this and if it was premeditated.
Maybe someone killed Nathan to get to me.
I need to know who.
Mitchell, I don't think that this is good for you.
He was my son.
Okay.
No.
(sighs) Kirsten, come with me.
We have him where we want him.
Negotiate, get pardons.
Make him tell us where my mother is.
"We have him where we want him?" Is that who you are?
That is his son in there.
Yeah, and I didn't see him crying over the people I lost.
Me neither.
That man kept me from finding out that my father had died for three days.
I didn't even get to go to my own father's funeral because of Blair.
I'm not doing jack for him.
And that is why you two are better than he is.
- I'm not so sure about that.
- I am.
Go suit up.
Hey!
Look, I don't know how ready you are to Stitch so soon after... you know, but first time something goes wrong, I want you to bounce, okay?
Mm-hmm.
I almost lost you once.
I'm not doing that again.
Hey.
You're cute when you're worried about me.
Then I must be cute all the time.
Cameron:
All right, lights at 20 percent, please.
(lights, electricity buzzing)
I need a go-no-go for Stitch neuro-sync.
- Life Sci?
- Go.
- Sub-Bio?
- Go.
- Cameron:
Engineering?
- Go.
- Communications?
- Go!
- Medical.
- We are a go.
Comm check.
One, two, one, two.
I hear you, Cameron.
All right, mission clock set to five minutes, please.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, this one's family.
So, let's get it right.
Induce Stitch neuro-sync on my mark.
In three... two... one...
- mark.
- (whirring)
_
Blair: "All that night, we were in a great bustle"
"getting things in their place...
"boatfuls of the squire's friends,
- "squire's friends..."
- Cameron:
What do you see, Kirsten?
Nathan's seven years old, maybe, eight.
Blair's reading to him in the office.
Treasure Island.
Kirsten:
Blair's being very sweet to him.
He loved that book.
"The boatswain sounded his pipe..."
(boatswain's whistle)
"and the crew began to man the capstan-bars.
And the crew began to man the capstan-bars."
(boatswain's whistle)
(Blair's voice overlapping)
Located a memory hotspot.
- How hot?
- Molten.
All right, K, you're on the move.
You don't even know her!
The NSA knows her family.
She's not her parents.
Blair:
We are all our parents.
That's who we become.
Blair and Nathan are fighting.
It's about a girl.
You think that she's using me to get to you?
I can't rule it out.
Everything makes sense when I'm with her, Dad.
God, sentiment like that is proof you're not ready to get married, not just to her, but to anyone.
Do not turn your back on me, young man!
You're wrong!
Not all of us become our parents.
That's the last memory Nathan had with Blair in it.
That's the last time I saw him alive.
Approaching death memory.
(Nathan panting)
- (tires squeal) - (Nathan groans)
Kirsten, talk to me, Sunshine.
(footsteps approaching)
(Nathan breathes shallowly)
Blair wants to kill your mother.
Do not trust him.
Find out where she is, and find a way to tell me.
Together, we can save her.
I'm counting on you, sweetheart.
- Oh my God.
- Kirsten, what is it?
Cameron:
Will you talk to me, damn it?
Cameron.
You okay there?
Kirsten, bounce.
And hey, I don't think you're a bad person for calling the NSA on me.
Kirsten, Daddy loves you so much.
(gasps)
Death memory in six seconds.
Kirsten, damn it, make the bounce.
(rapid beeping)
- (gasping) - (machinery whirs)
Well?
What'd you see?
Don't play with me, Miss Clark.
What'd you see?
- Nothing.
- What'd you see?
!
Nothing.
Sidearm.
Now.
- (gasps)
- Blair!
Tell me, or I will shoot her.
Kirsten, don't tell this ass-hat anything.
Blair, take it easy.
I would stop moving, right now, Detective, if I were you.
Mitchell, I know you're upset, but you don't have to do this.
What did you see?
I saw my father kill your son.
What?
He knew you'd make us Stitch, so he wanted to give me a warning.
He said you're gonna kill my mother.
Why would I kill your mother?
You tell me.
That son of a bitch... killed my son to tell you that.
I'm gonna find your psychopathic father, and when I do, I am gonna kill him.
That's my warning.
Touch me again, and I'll rip out your ribcage and wear it like a vest.
There are several vans waiting outside.
You'll all be held for reassignment.
All except you, Miss Clark.
What makes you think I'll keep working here after you take everyone away from me?
I haven't taken everyone away from you.
Not yet.
He used me to make you stay, didn't he?
(sighs) You know, this lab... it used to remind me of everything that was wrong in my life.
And now it's pretty much the only place where... everything's right.
Kirsten...
- I'm so sorry...
- It's not your fault.
And as long as my mom is out there somewhere, alive,
I'm not done.
What about Blair?
You know, I used to think
I was the smartest person in the room.
But Cameron, Camille, Linus, even Maggie and Fisher, they're... they're all so much smarter than I am in so many ways.
But... there is one person that I'm smarter than.
Mitchell Blair.
You got something on him in the Stitch, didn't you?
Oh, yeah.
Nora Dublin?
Credentials, please.
You look younger than I remember, Miss Dublin.
I apologize, Admiral.
My name is Kirsten Clark, and I work for a secret division of the NSA that hacks into the memories of the dead.
It's called the Stitchers Program, but you knew that.
- That's ridiculous.
- You know it's not.
Leave us.
You lured me here by falsely claiming to be a high-ranking NSA Commander.
I should have you arrested.
I know... but as Secretary of Defense,
I thought you should know that someone is threatening to go public about the Stitchers Program, as well as your personal knowledge of the billions of dollars that have been diverted developing it.
- Who?
- Me.
Kirsten:
You know Daniel Stinger, and you certainly know Mitchell Blair.
That means you know about the Stitchers Program.
Let's just say for a moment you're right.
- Why are we here?
- To make a deal.
My colleagues are being reassigned.
I don't want that to happen.
Anything else?
I want Maggie Baptiste to run the Stitchers Program.
I never want to see Mitchell Blair again.
(chuckles) Is that it?
No.
I'm looking for someone.
And I know you know where she is.
Who are you looking for?
- My mother.
- (inhales, exhales)
Well, I'm not sure what you did.
Not sure if I want to know either, but well done.
All I can say is that it's good to have friends in high places.
Speaking of which, congratulations on your promotion.
Well, just because I've been offered Blair's job doesn't mean that I want it.
Sure you do.
(knocking)
May I come in?
- Always.
- (Kirsten giggles)
So...
Kirsten Clark saves the day again.
- It was a team effort.
- Well.
Is Nina here?
Yeah, about that.
This was waiting for me when I got home.
"Cameron, I waited three days for you.
"Every time I heard a noise in the hall,
"I would go to the door thinking it was you coming home,
"but it never was.
"I love you, but I can't wait for you anymore.
Take care of yourself.
Love, Nina."
Cameron...
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I mean, I love Nina, but I...
I wasn't in love with her.
Took me a while, but I think I finally figured that out.
How long would you have waited for me when I was trapped in my memory?
Forever.

Hey.
I was wondering... when... when you were trying to get me to bounce, from my memory... what did you mean when you said,
I couldn't help you if I was stuck in there?
I never said that.
But if you didn't say it, who did?
♪♪
-Linus:
Guess what's back!
-Previously on Stitchers...
You have a sister.
Her name's Ivy Brown.
Ivy:
Your mother is still alive.
I shared information with you that I promised to keep secret.
You are not the only one with issues at the moment, so back off!
-If something should happen to me--
-Baba!
Samir:
I've always been proud of you.
Nina:
You need to make a choice.
The girl in your mind or the girl standing in front of you.
-What do you want?
-I want to be with my mother.
Shh.
He can hear you.
Whoever that is, that's not me.
Entanglement.
It's the ultimate hack!
Stinger's been running the anomaly on us this entire time.
Shut it down, Captain.
-Step away from your equipment.
-Tim:
Excuse me.
You haven't just crossed a line, Baptiste.
You've crossed me.
-Linus:
Kirsten's gone.
-Then get her back!
-Mom.
-Young Cameron:
How do you feel?
-Like I'm home.
-Cameron:
I want you to hijack it.
No matter how long it takes...
I will never leave you.
Ayo:
She's ready.
All right, stand by.
Rebooting all systems in 30 seconds.
If this doesn't work, how much longer can Kirsten last?
She's not eating, but she's getting fluids.
She could last a few weeks.
Yes, what about her mind?
How long can she stay lost inside of it?
-Maggie:
I don't know.
-Blair:
Well, what does Goodkin think?
-Maggie:
He doesn't know either.
-Blair:
He's had three days to figure it out.
This is what he's come up with.
Rebooting the entire lab might bounce Kirsten.
Well, for your sake, I hope he's right.
You're all in enough trouble without also killing the golden goose.
Don't make me regret letting you and your men out of the interrogation room.
It's a good thing for you that you did.
How's your son?
Recovering in Germany at the Army Medical Center.
I hope I get to see him before you send me off to wherever it is you plan on sending me off to.
That one's on you, Baptiste.
You ready?
Does it matter?
Cameron, when this is over, win or lose... they're gonna disappear us.
You know that right?
When this is over, if Kirsten's dead, I won't care.
Prepping systems to go offline!

-Wait.
93 over 62.
It's coming back up.
Kirsten, come on.
Come on, talk to me, Stretch.
Linus!
She's still trapped in the memory loop.
Damn it.
Goodkin, is that it?
I have to find out how my father is doing.
I talked to Blair about letting you call out.
He won't budge.
-I bet I could make him budge.
-Linus.
I'm going crazy!
I can feel it.
There's something not right with him, and...
I don't know how to explain it, but I just...
I just know.
The bond between parent and child is like that.
It's...
I guess it's like entanglement.
(exhales sharply)
The conference room!
Tell everyone!
Please.
Quantum disentanglement?
Yeah!
So, what do we know?
Our quantum computer's entangled with Stinger's quantum computer.
They are bonded without being physically connected, like the bond between a child and their parent.
Now, if we could just figure out how to disentangle them, then we could take back full control of Kirsten's Stitch.
Yeah, but we've been through this.
We don't know where Stinger moved his computer.
It doesn't matter!
It could be a mile away, a hundred miles away.
It could be in the next room!
Entanglement is not dependent on proximity.
What we need to figure out is the trigger
Stinger used to entangle Kirsten.
Linus is right.
We don't need to know where he is.
We need to know how he did it.
How do we do that without Stinger?
His daughter, Ivy.
I think she knows something.
No.
We already questioned her.
We even hooked her up to a polygraph.
She doesn't know anything.
Well, maybe you geniuses didn't ask her the right questions.
Where's Fisher?
Under guard in the interrogation room.
He was not being cooperative.
-Get him.
-Nope!
He's dangerous.
Get him.
He was there when Ivy was questioned.
He'll know what happened.
Or we can just stand around and watch your golden goose die.
And that will be on you.
-God, Fisher!
-Quincy, what happened?
I wasn't being... cooperative.
-Are you all right?
-You should see the other guy.
I'm serious.
Are you all right?
I'm serious.
You should see the other guy.
Get the handcuffs off of him!
No, no.
Can't risk that.
I promise I won't break anymore of your guards.
My God, I cannot wait until I'm done with the whole lot of ya.
All right.
When Ivy was questioned, did anyone ask her exactly how Stinger trapped Kirsten?
No.
It was "Where's your father?" and "Where's his computer?"
Nothing about his methods.
Let's get her in here.
Ask the right questions.
Linus, you handle this.
Find out what she knows.
Gladly.
I don't know where my father is.
I told you.
I told everyone!
I don't care about that!
What I want to know is how he manipulated his quantum computer to trigger entanglement in ours.
What's a quantum computer?
Would you stop playing me?
What is your problem?
!
My problem is that I am in a situation here!
And the sooner I can find out how your father triggered entanglement in our computer, the sooner I can find out how the hell my father's doing.
What's wrong with him?
He had surgery a couple days ago.
And since we're in lock-down, I have no idea how he's doing.
-Can't you call?
-No!
Outgoing calls are restricted and they took away my cell phone.
NSA goons took mine away when they brought me in too, except they forgot this.
It has a cellular connection.
Use it.
Call.
Find out.
And yes...
I know what quantum computers are, and how entanglement triggers work.
Now, what is this really all about?
Kirsten.
It's about Kirsten.
Maggie:
Do you think we can trust Ivy?
I'm not a hundred percent sure, but at the end of the day, that is her sister dying in there.
Hijacking the hijacked signal does make sense.
You've already done that.
It didn't work.
Not hijacking the anomaly's signal.
Hijacking Kirsten's mother.
That's not a signal.
That's a memory.
Well, it's the same thing, sort of.
Kirsten's emotional state is what's keeping the entanglement active.
If we can isolate Kirsten's memory of Jacqueline Stinger, we can manipulate it.
Force a disentanglement trigger to make her bounce.
So, you're gonna save Kirsten with an idea you got from the daughter of the guy who trapped her.
Do you want Kirsten out of here or not?
Because this gamble's all the gamble I got.
Hey.
Tell me.
(inhales)
He died.
Two-- two days ago.
The funeral was yesterday.
I wasn't even there.
How's your mom?
She's holding up.
Did you tell her... why you haven't been able to call?
I wanted to, but she stopped me.
She said it doesn't matter.
Whatever I was doing was important, and that my father would have approved.
I loved him so much.
I know.
Come on.
Okay.
Stations, everyone.
Technically, this Stitch is still active, so there's no go-no-go to call.
Linus and Camille, I'll need you both to isolate the memory.
Linus, you okay?
He's good.
Okay.
Let's go get our girl.
Isolate the signal and route it to my station in three, two, one.
-Mark!
-Done.
Got it.
Kirsten?
-Kirsten?
-Mom.
Hi, honey.
I think it's... time for you to go now.
(birds singing)
I'm not leaving.
This is no place for you.
If you... stay here, you will die.
I don't care.
I want to be with you forever.
Entanglement is holding.
(whispering indistinctly)
Say it.
Well, I don't want to be with you.
You don't mean that.
Yes, I do.
Now, leave.
Heart rate's up to 103.
Entanglement is weakening.
Is there any way you can diminish everything except the mother memory?
Give me ten seconds.
Mom?
You don't mean that.
What have you ever done for me?
Entanglement is down to 50 percent.
I am cutting background impulses now!
I tried to save you.
Save me?
(crows cawing)
Save me?
You're the reason my life is the way it is.
Mom.
Please, what are you saying?
Heart rate: 137.
-Really push her.
-What do you think I'm doing?
Push her harder.
Here, take this.
I was happy before you came into my life... do you know that?
I had my work, my life... and then you ruined everything!
That's not true.
You don't feel that way.
You can't feel that way!
Twenty-three percent.
I do, Kirsten.
That's exactly how I feel.
Please, Mom, don't say that.
It's the truth.
No, you love me!
I know you do.
You're wrong.
But I love you.
I don't care.
Now leave me alone!
-Mom, please.
-Nine percent.
I don't want to be with you.
-Leave!
-No!
-Leave!
-Mom!
-Go, damn it!
-Mom!
Kirsten.
(crying)
You can't help me if you're stuck in here.
Mom?
Get out of my life!
-Mom!
-I don't love you!
-Mom!
-Zero percent.
We're disentangled.
Mom!
(rapid beeping)
Mom!
(machine powers down)
(crying)
(sobbing)
-Kirsten.
Kirsten.
Shh.
-(sobbing)
It's okay.
That wasn't her.
No.
She said things.
No, no.
No, that-- that wasn't her, okay?
That was me.
I said those things.
-That-- -(gasps)
What?
That was you?
Talking through my mother the whole time?
It was the only way to get you to bounce.
(Kirsten crying softly)
Kirsten.
Arrest them all.
What?
(sighs)
Hey!
Slow down.
How long?
You asleep?
Closin' in on 18 hours.
-Cameron.
-He saved you.
Why are you here?
I...
I thought you hated me.
Yeah.
Uh... about that.
I was just mad at you, but... feels like a pretty long time ago.
Where is Cameron?
Where's Camille?
You know the unctuous guy?
At the NSA, the one who looks like a sci-fi villain?
-Blair.
-He arrested everyone.
So, you know about the Stitchers technology.
Yes, and I know my father.
Our father helped build it.
He trapped me inside my own memory.
He's not my father, not anymore.
So where did Blair take everyone?
I don't know.
When you bounced, they ushered me out of the interrogation room.
How many guards are sitting outside right now?
None.
Blair said you weren't going anywhere.
(scoffs)
Well, he's wrong.
Well, the unsinkable Miss Clark.
Thought you'd have bodyguards to protect you against rogue agents.
-Budget cuts.
-Mmm.
I am surprised to see you back on your feet so quickly, Miss Clark.
My sister helped me.
Ah!
The sister you're a fool for trusting.
-That sister?
-Where's my team?
Your small, erratic team of warrior-scientist friends are being detained.
-Pending relocation.
-Relocation?
What's that code for?
Execution?
Don't be a child, Miss Clark.
Now, please, if you'll excuse me,
I need to prepare for my meeting with Admiral Decker.
He's my boss.
Everyone answers to a higher authority, Miss Clark.
What about my team?
I am preparing a new, more trustworthy team for you, so the work of the Stitchers Program will continue.
No, it won't, not without me.
Seriously?
(scoffs) This again?
All right.
All right.
Come with me.
I would've thought you'd be ready for a change in your team, considering how Goodkin used your mother's memory against you.
Well, it worked, didn't it?
It got me to bounce.
Well, but at what cost?
Hmm?
How will you remember your mother now?
How will you react to her when you are reunited?
Yeah.
Reunited.
-You know where she is.
-I do.
Someplace safe.
-I want the truth.
-That is the truth.
Trust me, the NSA needs her hale and hearty as badly as you do.
(sighs)
Please.
(clears throat)
The lab accident that happened to your mother, the one when you were eight years old, do you have any idea what she was working on?
-Project Grasshopper.
-Yeah, that's the name.
But its purpose?
No?
Well, Project Grasshopper's goal was to accelerate the evolution of the human brain.
You can't speed up evolution.
Yes, you can.
Why would anyone want to?
Well, imagine if world leaders knew instantly what other world leaders felt and thought?
If they could immediately intuit the wants, needs, fears, desires of their counterparts.
You tell me.
What would that mean?
-The end of conflict?
-Yes.
The end of war.
Hunger, poverty, pretty much all the bad stuff that keeps nice people, like me, up at night.
Project Grasshopper was a failure.
Ah!
That depends on who you ask.
The lab accident accelerated your mother's brain.
She evolved in ways more complex than we understand.
We tried to recreate it, and we failed, and that is why we need to keep your mother safe.
So that after Stitching technology is perfected, we can Stitch into her living, evolved brain and map it completely, every neuron, until we understand her completely.
We're saving the world, Miss Clark.
-Our cases are training missions?
-Yes!
Designed to teach us everything there is to know about Stitching.
And when we are done-- when we are done... you get to complete the rescue mission you started with your father all those years ago and finally pull your mother out of her endless sleep.
Oh, suddenly, I'm not such a bad guy, am I?
Your mother's alive and well.
One day, you'll be reunited with her, but not if you quit the program.
-I can't do it without my team!
-Yes, you can!
They're very, very smart people, sure, but they are just people.
You will stay with the program if you want to save your mother, Miss Clark.
(elevator dings)
You sure it's okay for me to be here?
I stopped caring what's okay about an hour ago.
-Who's there?
-(gasps)
Jesus.
Tim!
-Who's the skirt?
-Who's the ape?
(sighs) That's Tim.
He works here in Engineering.
God, what happened to your hair?
I cut it.
I figured I'm going to prison, why wait?
Why aren't you detained?
I am.
I need to 3D print some spare parts for the new team before I get shipped off.
I hope it's some place nice like Cleveland.
Mmm.
Are you sure Blair has no idea Linus has it?
Positive.
If Linus is half as smart as I think he is, he found a way to keep it on him.
Question.
What are we talking about?
There it is.
I lent Linus my smart-watch.
He still has it.
This is gonna be harder than I wanted.
That's an NSA facility.
Biometrics, photo ID.
-It's impossible.
-Kirsten:
Mmm.
Well, that's what people say about hacking into the memories of the dead.
No, that sounds reasonable.
You know how I'm gonna get them out of there?
Through the front door.
Kirsten:
Nora Dublin, 42 years old.
Highest ranking woman in the NSA security hierarchy.
Got the promotion from the President himself.
Holds the rank of Security Commander.
Currently stationed in Cairo.
You look good for 42.
It's clean living.
What about the biometrics?
You don't happen to have Nora Dublin's fingers lying around, do you?
I'm about to.
(whirring)
I hope this will fool the biometrics scanner.
I've never printed anything this thin and flexible.
I have no idea how long it will last.
Hopefully long enough.
(exhales)
(talking indistinctly)
-Good evening.
-Ma'am.
Commander Dublin.
From the Cairo office?
-Yes.
-What brings you to LA?
I'm here to oversee a prisoner transfer from Detention Block AA-23.
We don't have detention blocks.
Well, in Cairo, that's what we call where the prisoners are held.
If you call it something different here, that's your business, not mine.
(computer beeps)
It's good.
-Thank you.
-Hold it, Commander.
I need to call this in because that's my business.
(phone dialing)
Woman:
Director Mitchell Blair's office.
Guard:
Yes, this is Post 1477E16.
Calling in for confirmation of a prisoner transfer.
Stand by for Director Blair.
This is Blair.
Yes, I'm at Post 1477E16.
Is this about the prisoner transfer from Detention Block AA-23?
-Yes, sir.
-I concur.
-Concur?
-Approve?
She's good.
Good to go.
It's all good.
Tell Commander Dublin, I say hello.
Will do, sir.
Sorry to bother you.
Sorry for the delay, Commander.
-Director Blair sends his regards.
-That's so Director Blair.
Guard:
Place your right hand on the scanner, please.
(beeping rapidly)
(buzzing)
(beeping rapidly)
(buzzing)
Commander, may I see your credentials one more time?
When was the last time you had this scanner cleaned?
Hmm?
Ma'am?
(beeping rapidly)
(beeps)
In Cairo, we clean our scanners daily.
-Commander, let me escort you.
-That would be lovely.
Here we are, the, uh... detention blocks.
Thank you.
-I'll take it from here.
-Are you sure?
These prisoners attacked a fully-armed NSA unit.
I can take care of myself.
-I'll wait outside.
Just in case.
-Mm-hmm.
You got to be freakin' kidding me!
Well, look who finally showed up.
-Camille:
Told you!
-(snaps fingers)
Kirsten, what the hell are you doing here?
Getting you out?
Please tell me you're not cooking.
Yeah, crepes.
You want?
I thought you guys were in trouble.
It's like a country club!
We're being reassigned, not waterboarded.
(sighs)
Okay, well, Blair plans to continue with the program.
I told him I wouldn't do it without you.
Let me guess.
He didn't care?
He-- he said my mother's still alive, and that as soon as we perfect Stitching, I'll be able to save her.
-He told you all of that?
-That sounds a little crazy.
At least he didn't screw with my memory of her.
I will explain it when we're outta here.
All right, so what's the plan?
Something that doesn't involve us getting shot on the way out?
No, I worked up a security clearance, told the guards I'm taking charge of you.
It's a prisoner transfer from Detention Block AA-23.
-Mmm!
That's my girl!
- Blade Runner?
- Star Wars.
-Darn.
We're gonna walk out of here together, then we're gonna find my mother, and we're gonna use that knowledge as leverage.
Force Blair to let you all continue with the program.
NSA protocol is that prisoner transfers require at least one armed guard.
I don't suppose you're carrying a gun.
You said we couldn't.
Your idea, not mine.
Only one armed guard?
Done!
(indistinct radio chatter)
Ivy told me about your dad.
Linus, I'm so sorry.
He was a good man.
Yeah.
He was the best.
Thanks.
Hey.
-Can we talk about the Stitch?
-I'd rather not.
Look, I'm sorry about what I did to get you to bounce, but--
It's not that I'm not grateful, it's just now I'm stuck remembering my mother that way.
She wasn't real.
She was to me.
(indistinct chatter)
(muffled groans)
(grunting)
Thank you for your cooperation.
(alarms wailing)
-Freeze!
Stay where you are!
-Right there!
Guess crepes are back on the menu.
We've had plenty of time to check.
There's no other way out.
-Well, maybe you missed something.
-(line buzzing)
Then again, maybe we didn't.
-You'll be fine.
-I'm worried about everyone else.
Well, we'll be fine too.
I've always wanted to spend more time in an Arctic weather station.
Joking.
I--
I have no idea where Blair's reassigning me.
Why don't you just quit?
-You could go back to research.
-What?
!
And give up show business?
Nah.
Maybe if I play nice, and don't piss anyone off for a while,
Blair will let me back in the Stitch lab, but...
Why would you even want to?
Because that's where you'll be.
Okay, you need to keep Stitching.
-Not without you.
-Yes, without me!
It's the only hope your mother has.
Look, look, as long as I know you're safe,
I'll be okay, and--
You know, I am-- I am sorry about what I did to your memory of her, but that's why you need to keep Stitching, so you can save your mother and make some new memories.
(rapid beeping, buzzing)
(door opens)
We're needed back at the lab.
Something's happened.
(elevator dings)
They showed up about a half hour ago.
What is she doing here?
She helped me rescue you guys.
Camille:
So, this is what rescued looks like?
Oh, hi, Mitch.
Great to see you again.
Not now, Engelson.
New case has come in.
27 years old.
Hit and run... while jogging downtown.
His name is Nathan Blair.
He's my son.
Mitchell, I am so sorry.
I need to know who did this and if it was premeditated.
Maybe someone killed Nathan to get to me.
I need to know who.
Mitchell, I don't think that this is good for you.
He was my son.
Okay.
No.
(sighs) Kirsten, come with me.
We have him where we want him.
Negotiate, get pardons.
Make him tell us where my mother is.
"We have him where we want him?" Is that who you are?
That is his son in there.
Yeah, and I didn't see him crying over the people I lost.
Me neither.
That man kept me from finding out that my father had died for three days.
I didn't even get to go to my own father's funeral because of Blair.
I'm not doing jack for him.
And that is why you two are better than he is.
-I'm not so sure about that.
-I am.
Go suit up.
Hey!
Look, I don't know how ready you are to Stitch so soon after... you know, but first time something goes wrong, I want you to bounce, okay?
-Mm-hmm.
-I almost lost you once.
I'm not doing that again.
Hey.
You're cute when you're worried about me.
Then I must be cute all the time.
Cameron:
All right, lights at 20 percent, please.
(lights, electricity buzzing)
I need a go-no-go for Stitch neuro-sync.
-Life Sci?
-Go.
-Sub-Bio?
-Go.
-Cameron:
Engineering?
-Go.
-Communications?
-Go!
-Medical.
-We are a go.
Comm check.
One, two, one, two.
-I hear you, Cameron.
-All right, mission clock set to five minutes, please.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, this one's family.
So, let's get it right.
Induce Stitch neuro-sync on my mark.
In three... two... one...
-mark.
-(whirring)
Blair:
"All that night, we were in a great bustle
"getting things in their place...
"boatfuls of the squire's friends,
-squire's friends..."
-Cameron:
What do you see, Kirsten?
Nathan's seven years old, maybe, eight.
Blair's reading to him in the office.
Treasure Island.
Kirsten:
Blair's being very sweet to him.
He loved that book.
"The boatswain sounded his pipe..."
(boatswain's whistle)
"and the crew began to man the capstan-bars.
And the crew began to man the capstan-bars."
(boatswain's whistle)
(Blair's voice overlapping)
Located a memory hotspot.
-How hot?
-Molten.
All right, K, you're on the move.
You don't even know her!
The NSA knows her family.
She's not her parents.
Blair:
We are all our parents.
That's who we become.
Blair and Nathan are fighting.
It's about a girl.
You think that she's using me to get to you?
I can't rule it out.
Everything makes sense when I'm with her, Dad.
God, sentiment like that is proof you're not ready to get married, not just to her, but to anyone.
Do not turn your back on me, young man!
You're wrong!
Not all of us become our parents.
That's the last memory Nathan had with Blair in it.
That's the last time I saw him alive.
Approaching death memory.
(Nathan panting)
-(tires squeal) -(Nathan groans)
Kirsten, talk to me, Sunshine.
(footsteps approaching)
(Nathan breathes shallowly)
Blair wants to kill your mother.
Do not trust him.
Find out where she is, and find a way to tell me.
Together, we can save her.
I'm counting on you, sweetheart.
-Oh my God.
-Kirsten, what is it?
Cameron:
Will you talk to me, damn it?
Cameron.
You okay there?
Kirsten, bounce.
And hey, I don't think you're a bad person for calling the NSA on me.
Kirsten, Daddy loves you so much.
(gasps)
Death memory in six seconds.
Kirsten, damn it, make the bounce.
(rapid beeping)
-(gasping) -(machinery whirs)
Well?
What'd you see?
Don't play with me, Miss Clark.
What'd you see?
-Nothing.
-What'd you see?
!
Nothing.
Sidearm.
Now.
-(gasps)
-Blair!
Tell me, or I will shoot her.
Kirsten, don't tell this ass-hat anything.
Blair, take it easy.
I would stop moving, right now, Detective, if I were you.
Mitchell, I know you're upset, but you don't have to do this.
What did you see?
I saw my father kill your son.
What?
He knew you'd make us Stitch, so he wanted to give me a warning.
He said you're gonna kill my mother.
Why would I kill your mother?
You tell me.
That son of a bitch... killed my son to tell you that.
I'm gonna find your psychopathic father, and when I do, I am gonna kill him.
That's my warning.
Touch me again, and I'll rip out your ribcage and wear it like a vest.
There are several vans waiting outside.
You'll all be held for reassignment.
All except you, Miss Clark.
What makes you think I'll keep working here after you take everyone away from me?
I haven't taken everyone away from you.
Not yet.
He used me to make you stay, didn't he?
(sighs) You know, this lab... it used to remind me of everything that was wrong in my life.
And now it's pretty much the only place where... everything's right.
Kirsten...
-I'm so sorry--
-It's not your fault.
And as long as my mom is out there somewhere, alive,
I'm not done.
What about Blair?
You know, I used to think
I was the smartest person in the room.
But Cameron, Camille, Linus, even Maggie and Fisher, they're... they're all so much smarter than I am in so many ways.
But... there is one person that I'm smarter than.
Mitchell Blair.
You got something on him in the Stitch, didn't you?
Oh, yeah.
Nora Dublin?
Credentials, please.
You look younger than I remember, Miss Dublin.
I apologize, Admiral.
My name is Kirsten Clark, and I work for a secret division of the NSA that hacks into the memories of the dead.
It's called the Stitchers Program, but you knew that.
-That's ridiculous.
-You know it's not.
Leave us.
You lured me here by falsely claiming to be a high-ranking NSA Commander.
I should have you arrested.
I know... but as Secretary of Defense,
I thought you should know that someone is threatening to go public about the Stitchers Program, as well as your personal knowledge of the billions of dollars that have been diverted developing it.
-Who?
-Me.
Kirsten:
You know Daniel Stinger, and you certainly know Mitchell Blair.
That means you know about the Stitchers Program.
Let's just say for a moment you're right.
-Why are we here?
-To make a deal.
My colleagues are being reassigned.
I don't want that to happen.
Anything else?
I want Maggie Baptiste to run the Stitchers Program.
I never want to see Mitchell Blair again.
(chuckles) Is that it?
No.
I'm looking for someone.
And I know you know where she is.
Who are you looking for?
-My mother.
-(inhales, exhales)
Well, I'm not sure what you did.
Not sure if I want to know either, but well done.
All I can say is that it's good to have friends in high places.
Speaking of which, congratulations on your promotion.
Well, just because I've been offered Blair's job doesn't mean that I want it.
Sure you do.
(knocking)
May I come in?
-Always.
-(Kirsten giggles)
So...
Kirsten Clark saves the day again.
-It was a team effort.
-Well.
Is Nina here?
Yeah, about that.
This was waiting for me when I got home.
"Cameron, I waited three days for you.
"Every time I heard a noise in the hall,
"I would go to the door thinking it was you coming home,
"but it never was.
"I love you, but I can't wait for you anymore.
Take care of yourself.
Love, Nina."
Cameron...
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I mean, I love Nina, but I...
I wasn't in love with her.
Took me a while, but I think I finally figured that out.
How long would you have waited for me when I was trapped in my memory?
Forever.
Everything makes sense when I'm with you.

No.
Brand-new emotion.

♪ Maybe this isn't all just a dream ♪
Hey.
I was wondering... when-- when you were trying to get me to bounce, from my memory... what did you mean when you said,
I couldn't help you if I was stuck in there?
I never said that.
But if you didn't say it, who did?
(theme music playing)
♪ Ooh ♪
♪ Ooh ♪
♪ Take me inside ♪
- Guess what's back!
- Previously on Stitchers...
You have a sister.
Her name's Ivy Brown.
Your mother is still alive.
I shared information with you that I promised to keep secret.
You are not the only one with issues at the moment, so back off!
- If something should happen to me...
- Baba!
I've always been proud of you.
You need to make a choice.
The girl in your mind or the girl standing in front of you.
- What do you want?
- I want to be with my mother.
Shh.
He can hear you.
Whoever that is, that's not me.
Entanglement.
It's the ultimate hack!
Stinger's been running the anomaly on us this entire time.
Shut it down, Captain.
- Step away from your equipment.
- Excuse me.
You haven't just crossed a line, Baptiste.
You've crossed me.
- Kirsten's gone.
- Then get her back!
- Mom.
- How do you feel?
- Like I'm home.
- I want you to hijack it.
No matter how long it takes...
I will never leave you.
She's ready.
All right, stand by.
Rebooting all systems in 30 seconds.
If this doesn't work, how much longer can Kirsten last?
She's not eating, but she's getting fluids.
She could last a few weeks.
Yes, what about her mind?
How long can she stay lost inside of it?
- I don't know.
- Well, what does Goodkin think?
He doesn't know either.
He's had three days to figure it out.
This is what he's come up with.
Rebooting the entire lab might bounce Kirsten.
Well, for your sake, I hope he's right.
You're all in enough trouble without also killing the golden goose.
Don't make me regret letting you and your men out of the interrogation room.
It's a good thing for you that you did.
How's your son?
Recovering in Germany at the Army Medical Center.
I hope I get to see him before you send me off to wherever it is you plan on sending me off to.
That one's on you, Baptiste.
You ready?
Does it matter?
Cameron, when this is over, win or lose... they're gonna disappear us.
You know that right?
When this is over, if Kirsten's dead, I won't care.
Prepping systems to go offline!
Full system reboot on my mark!
In five... four... three... two... one.
Mark!
Full system power down!
Blood pressure's dropping. 107 over 66.
- Not yet.
- 98 over 54.
Not yet.
81 over 44.
She's crashing!
- Cameron?
- Not yet.
- She's bottomed.
- Cameron.
- Reboot.
- Systems back online in three, two, one, now.
Kirsten, can you hear me?
Blood pressure's not coming back up.
Kirsten.
Kirsten!
Kirsten.
- Ayo.
- Wait.
93 over 62.
It's coming back up.
Kirsten, come on.
Come on, talk to me, Stretch.
Linus!
She's still trapped in the memory loop.
Damn it.
Goodkin, is that it?
I have to find out how my father is doing.
I talked to Blair about letting you call out.
He won't budge.
- I bet I could make him budge.
- Linus.
I'm going crazy!
I can feel it.
There's something not right with him, and...
I don't know how to explain it, but I just...
I just know.
The bond between parent and child is like that.
It's...
I guess it's like entanglement.
The conference room!
Tell everyone!
Please.
Quantum disentanglement?
Yeah!
So, what do we know?
Our quantum computer's entangled with Stinger's quantum computer.
They are bonded without being physically connected, like the bond between a child and their parent.
Now, if we could just figure out how to disentangle them, then we could take back full control of Kirsten's Stitch.
Yeah, but we've been through this.
We don't know where Stinger moved his computer.
It doesn't matter!
It could be a mile away, a hundred miles away.
It could be in the next room!
Entanglement is not dependent on proximity.
What we need to figure out is the trigger
Stinger used to entangle Kirsten.
Linus is right.
We don't need to know where he is.
We need to know how he did it.
How do we do that without Stinger?
His daughter, Ivy.
I think she knows something.
No.
We already questioned her.
We even hooked her up to a polygraph.
She doesn't know anything.
Well, maybe you geniuses didn't ask her the right questions.
Where's Fisher?
Under guard in the interrogation room.
He was not being cooperative.
- Get him.
- Nope!
He's dangerous.
Get him.
He was there when Ivy was questioned.
He'll know what happened.
Or we can just stand around and watch your golden goose die.
And that will be on you.
- God, Fisher!
- Quincy, what happened?
I wasn't being... cooperative.
- Are you all right?
- You should see the other guy.
I'm serious.
Are you all right?
I'm serious.
You should see the other guy.
Get the handcuffs off of him!
No, no.
Can't risk that.
I promise I won't break anymore of your guards.
My God, I cannot wait until I'm done with the whole lot of ya.
All right.
When Ivy was questioned, did anyone ask her exactly how Stinger trapped Kirsten?
No.
It was "Where's your father?" and "Where's his computer?"
Nothing about his methods.
Let's get her in here.
Ask the right questions.
Linus, you handle this.
Find out what she knows.
Gladly.
I don't know where my father is.
I told you.
I told everyone!
I don't care about that!
What I want to know is how he manipulated his quantum computer to trigger entanglement in ours.
What's a quantum computer?
Would you stop playing me?
What is your problem?
!
My problem is that I am in a situation here!
And the sooner I can find out how your father triggered entanglement in our computer, the sooner I can find out how the hell my father's doing.
What's wrong with him?
He had surgery a couple days ago.
And since we're in lock-down, I have no idea how he's doing.
- Can't you call?
- No!
Outgoing calls are restricted and they took away my cell phone.
NSA goons took mine away when they brought me in too, except they forgot this.
It has a cellular connection.
Use it.
Call.
Find out.
And yes...
I know what quantum computers are, and how entanglement triggers work.
Now, what is this really all about?
Kirsten.
It's about Kirsten.
Do you think we can trust Ivy?
I'm not a hundred percent sure, but at the end of the day, that is her sister dying in there.
Hijacking the hijacked signal does make sense.
You've already done that.
It didn't work.
Not hijacking the anomaly's signal.
Hijacking Kirsten's mother.
That's not a signal.
That's a memory.
Well, it's the same thing, sort of.
Kirsten's emotional state is what's keeping the entanglement active.
If we can isolate Kirsten's memory of Jacqueline Stinger, we can manipulate it.
Force a disentanglement trigger to make her bounce.
So, you're gonna save Kirsten with an idea you got from the daughter of the guy who trapped her.
Do you want Kirsten out of here or not?
Because this gamble's all the gamble I got.
Hey.
Tell me.
He died.
Two... two days ago.
The funeral was yesterday.
I wasn't even there.
How's your mom?
She's holding up.
Did you tell her... why you haven't been able to call?
I wanted to, but she stopped me.
She said it doesn't matter.
Whatever I was doing was important, and that my father would have approved.
I loved him so much.
I know.
Come on.
Okay.
Stations, everyone.
Technically, this Stitch is still active, so there's no go-no-go to call.
Linus and Camille, I'll need you both to isolate the memory.
Linus, you okay?
He's good.
Okay.
Let's go get our girl.
Isolate the signal and route it to my station in three, two, one.
- Mark!
- Done.
Got it.
Kirsten?
- Kirsten?
- Mom.
Hi, honey.
I think it's... time for you to go now.
I'm not leaving.
This is no place for you.
If you... stay here, you will die.
I don't care.
I want to be with you forever.
Entanglement is holding.
Say it.
Well, I don't want to be with you.
You don't mean that.
Yes, I do.
Now, leave.
Heart rate's up to 103.
Entanglement is weakening.
Is there any way you can diminish everything except the mother memory?
Give me ten seconds.
Mom?
You don't mean that.
What have you ever done for me?
Entanglement is down to 50 percent.
I am cutting background impulses now!
I tried to save you.
Save me?
Save me?
You're the reason my life is the way it is.
Mom.
Please, what are you saying?
Heart rate: 137.
- Really push her.
- What do you think I'm doing?
Push her harder.
Here, take this.
I was happy before you came into my life... do you know that?
I had my work, my life... and then you ruined everything!
That's not true.
You don't feel that way.
You can't feel that way!
Twenty-three percent.
I do, Kirsten.
That's exactly how I feel.
Please, Mom, don't say that.
It's the truth.
No, you love me!
I know you do.
You're wrong.
But I love you.
I don't care.
Now leave me alone!
- Mom, please.
- Nine percent.
I don't want to be with you.
- Leave!
- No!
- Leave!
- Mom!
- Go, damn it!
- Mom!
Kirsten.
You can't help me if you're stuck in here.
Mom?
Get out of my life!
- Mom!
- I don't love you!
- Mom!
- Zero percent.
We're disentangled.
Mom!
Mom!
Kirsten.
Kirsten.
Shh.
It's okay.
That wasn't her.
No.
She said things.
No, no.
No, that...
That wasn't her, okay?
That was me.
I said those things.
That...
What?
That was you?
Talking through my mother the whole time?
It was the only way to get you to bounce.
Kirsten.
Arrest them all.
What?
Hey!
Slow down.
How long?
You asleep?
Closin' in on 18 hours.
- Cameron.
- He saved you.
Why are you here?
I...
I thought you hated me.
Yeah.
Uh... about that.
I was just mad at you, but... feels like a pretty long time ago.
Where is Cameron?
Where's Camille?
You know the unctuous guy?
At the NSA, the one who looks like a sci-fi villain?
- Blair.
- He arrested everyone.
So, you know about the Stitchers technology.
Yes, and I know my father.
Our father helped build it.
He trapped me inside my own memory.
He's not my father, not anymore.
So where did Blair take everyone?
I don't know.
When you bounced, they ushered me out of the interrogation room.
How many guards are sitting outside right now?
None.
Blair said you weren't going anywhere.
Well, he's wrong.
Well, the unsinkable Miss Clark.
Thought you'd have bodyguards to protect you against rogue agents.
- Budget cuts.
- Mmm.
I am surprised to see you back on your feet so quickly, Miss Clark.
My sister helped me.
Ah!
The sister you're a fool for trusting.
- That sister?
- Where's my team?
Your small, erratic team of warrior-scientist friends are being detained.
- Pending relocation.
- Relocation?
What's that code for?
Execution?
Don't be a child, Miss Clark.
Now, please, if you'll excuse me,
I need to prepare for my meeting with Admiral Decker.
He's my boss.
Everyone answers to a higher authority, Miss Clark.
What about my team?
I am preparing a new, more trustworthy team for you, so the work of the Stitchers Program will continue.
No, it won't, not without me.
Seriously?
This again?
All right.
Come with me.
I would've thought you'd be ready for a change in your team, considering how Goodkin used your mother's memory against you.
Well, it worked, didn't it?
It got me to bounce.
Well, but at what cost?
Hmm?
How will you remember your mother now?
How will you react to her when you are reunited?
Yeah.
Reunited.
- You know where she is.
- I do.
Someplace safe.
- I want the truth.
- That is the truth.
Trust me, the NSA needs her hale and hearty as badly as you do.
Please.
The lab accident that happened to your mother, the one when you were eight years old, do you have any idea what she was working on?
- Project Grasshopper.
- Yeah, that's the name.
But its purpose?
No?
Well, Project Grasshopper's goal was to accelerate the evolution of the human brain.
You can't speed up evolution.
Yes, you can.
Why would anyone want to?
Well, imagine if world leaders knew instantly what other world leaders felt and thought?
If they could immediately intuit the wants, needs, fears, desires of their counterparts.
You tell me.
What would that mean?
- The end of conflict?
- Yes.
The end of war.
Hunger, poverty, pretty much all the bad stuff that keeps nice people, like me, up at night.
Project Grasshopper was a failure.
Ah!
That depends on who you ask.
The lab accident accelerated your mother's brain.
She evolved in ways more complex than we understand.
We tried to recreate it, and we failed, and that is why we need to keep your mother safe.
So that after Stitching technology is perfected, we can Stitch into her living, evolved brain and map it completely, every neuron, until we understand her completely.
We're saving the world, Miss Clark.
- Our cases are training missions?
- Yes!
Designed to teach us everything there is to know about Stitching.
And when we are done...
When we are done... you get to complete the rescue mission you started with your father all those years ago and finally pull your mother out of her endless sleep.
Oh, suddenly, I'm not such a bad guy, am I?
Your mother's alive and well.
One day, you'll be reunited with her, but not if you quit the program.
- I can't do it without my team!
- Yes, you can!
They're very, very smart people, sure, but they are just people.
You will stay with the program if you want to save your mother, Miss Clark.
You sure it's okay for me to be here?
I stopped caring what's okay about an hour ago.
Who's there?
Jesus.
Tim!
- Who's the skirt?
- Who's the ape?
That's Tim.
He works here in Engineering.
God, what happened to your hair?
I cut it.
I figured I'm going to prison, why wait?
Why aren't you detained?
I am.
I need to 3D print some spare parts for the new team before I get shipped off.
I hope it's some place nice like Cleveland.
Mmm.
Are you sure Blair has no idea Linus has it?
Positive.
If Linus is half as smart as I think he is, he found a way to keep it on him.
Question.
What are we talking about?
There it is.
I lent Linus my smart-watch.
He still has it.
This is gonna be harder than I wanted.
That's an NSA facility.
Biometrics, photo ID.
- It's impossible.
- Mmm.
Well, that's what people say about hacking into the memories of the dead.
No, that sounds reasonable.
You know how I'm gonna get them out of there?
Through the front door.
Nora Dublin, 42 years old.
Highest ranking woman in the NSA security hierarchy.
Got the promotion from the President himself.
Holds the rank of Security Commander.
Currently stationed in Cairo.
You look good for 42.
It's clean living.
What about the biometrics?
You don't happen to have Nora Dublin's fingers lying around, do you?
I'm about to.
I hope this will fool the biometrics scanner.
I've never printed anything this thin and flexible.
I have no idea how long it will last.
Hopefully long enough.
- Good evening.
- Ma'am.
Commander Dublin.
From the Cairo office?
- Yes.
- What brings you to LA?
I'm here to oversee a prisoner transfer from Detention Block AA-23.
We don't have detention blocks.
Well, in Cairo, that's what we call where the prisoners are held.
If you call it something different here, that's your business, not mine.
It's good.
- Thank you.
- Hold it, Commander.
I need to call this in because that's my business.
Director Mitchell Blair's office.
Yes, this is Post 1477E16.
Calling in for confirmation of a prisoner transfer.
Stand by for Director Blair.
This is Blair.
Yes, I'm at Post 1477E16.
Is this about the prisoner transfer from Detention Block AA-23?
- Yes, sir.
- I concur.
- Concur?
- Approve?
She's good.
Good to go.
It's all good.
Tell Commander Dublin, I say hello.
Will do, sir.
Sorry to bother you.
Sorry for the delay, Commander.
- Director Blair sends his regards.
- That's so Director Blair.
Place your right hand on the scanner, please.
Commander, may I see your credentia one more time?
When was the last time you had this scanner cleaned?
Hmm?
Ma'am?
In Cairo, we clean our scanners daily.
- Commander, let me escort you.
- That would be lovely.
Here we are, the, uh... detention blocks.
Thank you.
- I'll take it from here.
- Are you sure?
These prisoners attacked a fully-armed NSA unit.
I can take care of myself.
- I'll wait outside.
Just in case.
- Mm-hmm.
You got to be freakin' kidding me!
Well, look who finally showed up.
Told you!
Kirsten, what the hell are you doing here?
Getting you out?
Please tell me you're not cooking.
Yeah, crepes.
You want?
I thought you guys were in trouble.
It's like a country club!
We're being reassigned, not waterboarded.
Okay, well, Blair plans to continue with the program.
I told him I wouldn't do it without you.
Let me guess.
He didn't care?
He... he said my mother's still alive, and that as soon as we perfect Stitching, I'll be able to save her.
- He told you all of that?
- That sounds a little crazy.
At least he didn't screw with my memory of her.
I will explain it when we're outta here.
All right, so what's the plan?
Something that doesn't involve us getting shot on the way out?
No, I worked up a security clearance, told the guards I'm taking charge of you.
It's a prisoner transfer from Detention Block AA-23.
- Mmm!
That's my girl!
- Blade Runner?
- Star Wars.
- Darn.
We're gonna walk out of here together, then we're gonna find my mother, and we're gonna use that knowledge as leverage.
Force Blair to let you all continue with the program.
NSA protocol is that prisoner transfers require at least one armed guard.
I don't suppose you're carrying a gun.
You said we couldn't.
Your idea, not mine.
Only one armed guard?
Done!
Ivy told me about your dad.
Linus, I'm so sorry.
He was a good man.
Yeah.
He was the best.
Thanks.
Hey.
- Can we talk about the Stitch?
- I'd rather not.
Look, I'm sorry about what I did to get you to bounce, but...
It's not that I'm not grateful, it's just now I'm stuck remembering my mother that way.
She wasn't real.
She was to me.
Thank you for your cooperation.
- Freeze!
Stay where you are!
- Right there!
Guess crepes are back on the menu.
We've had plenty of time to check.
There's no other way out.
Well, maybe you missed something.
Then again, maybe we didn't.
- You'll be fine.
- I'm worried about everyone else.
Well, we'll be fine too.
I've always wanted to spend more time in an Arctic weather station.
Joking.
I...
I have no idea where Blair's reassigning me.
Why don't you just quit?
- You could go back to research.
- What?
!
And give up show business?
Nah.
Maybe if I play nice, and don't piss anyone off for a while,
Blair will let me back in the Stitch lab, but...
Why would you even want to?
Because that's where you'll be.
Okay, you need to keep Stitching.
- Not without you.
- Yes, without me!
It's the only hope your mother has.
Look, look, as long as I know you're safe,
I'll be okay, and...
You know, I am...
I am sorry about what I did to your memory of her, but that's why you need to keep Stitching, so you can save your mother and make some new memories.
We're needed back at the lab.
Something's happened.
They showed up about a half hour ago.
What is she doing here?
She helped me rescue you guys.
So, this is what rescued looks like?
Oh, hi, Mitch.
Great to see you again.
Not now, Engelson.
New case has come in.
27 years old.
Hit and run... while jogging downtown.
His name is Nathan Blair.
He's my son.
Mitchell, I am so sorry.
I need to know who did this and if it was premeditated.
Maybe someone killed Nathan to get to me.
I need to know who.
Mitchell, I don't think that this is good for you.
He was my son.
Okay.
No.
Kirsten, come with me.
We have him where we want him.
Negotiate, get pardons.
Make him tell us where my mother is.
"We have him where we want him?" Is that who you are?
That is his son in there.
Yeah, and I didn't see him crying over the people I lost.
Me neither.
That man kept me from finding out that my father had died for three days.
I didn't even get to go to my own father's funeral because of Blair.
I'm not doing jack for him.
And that is why you two are better than he is.
- I'm not so sure about that.
- I am.
Go suit up.
Hey!
Look, I don't know how ready you are to Stitch so soon after... you know, but first time something goes wrong, I want you to bounce, okay?
Mm-hmm.
I almost lost you once.
I'm not doing that again.
Hey.
You're cute when you're worried about me.
Then I must be cute all the time.
All right, lights at 20 percent, please.
I need a go-no-go for Stitch neuro-sync.
- Life Sci?
- Go.
- Sub-Bio?
- Go.
- Engineering?
- Go.
- Communications?
- Go!
- Medical.
- We are a go.
Comm check.
One, two, one, two.
I hear you, Cameron.
All right, mission clock set to five minutes, please.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, this one's family.
So, let's get it right.
Induce Stitch neuro-sync on my mark.
In three... two... one... mark.
_
"All that night, we were in a great bustle"
"getting things in their place...
"boatfuls of the squire's friends,
- "squire's friends..."
- What do you see, Kirsten?
Nathan's seven years old, maybe, eight.
Blair's reading to him in the office.
Treasure Island.
Blair's being very sweet to him.
He loved that book.
"The boatswain sounded his pipe..."
"and the crew began to man the capstan-bars.
And the crew began to man the capstan-bars."
Located a memory hotspot.
- How hot?
- Molten.
All right, K, you're on the move.
You don't even know her!
The NSA knows her family.
She's not her parents.
We are all our parents.
That's who we become.
Blair and Nathan are fighting.
It's about a girl.
You think that she's using me to get to you?
I can't rule it out.
Everything makes sense when I'm with her, Dad.
God, sentiment like that is proof you're not ready to get married, not just to her, but to anyone.
Do not turn your back on me, young man!
You're wrong!
Not all of us become our parents.
That's the last memory Nathan had with Blair in it.
That's the last time I saw him alive.
Approaching death memory.
Kirsten, talk to me, Sunshine.
Blair wants to kill your mother.
Do not trust him.
Find out where she is, and find a way to tell me.
Together, we can save her.
I'm counting on you, sweetheart.
- Oh my God.
- Kirsten, what is it?
Will you talk to me, damn it?
Cameron.
You okay there?
Kirsten, bounce.
And hey, I don't think you're a bad person for calling the NSA on me.
Kirsten, Daddy loves you so much.
Death memory in six seconds.
Kirsten, damn it, make the bounce.
Well?
What'd you see?
Don't play with me, Miss Clark.
What'd you see?
- Nothing.
- What'd you see?
!
Nothing.
Sidearm.
Now.
Blair!
Tell me, or I will shoot her.
Kirsten, don't tell this ass-hat anything.
Blair, take it easy.
I would stop moving, right now, Detective, if I were you.
Mitchell, I know you're upset, but you don't have to do this.
What did you see?
I saw my father kill your son.
What?
He knew you'd make us Stitch, so he wanted to give me a warning.
He said you're gonna kill my mother.
Why would I kill your mother?
You tell me.
That son of a bitch... killed my son to tell you that.
I'm gonna find your psychopathic father, and when I do, I am gonna kill him.
That's my warning.
Touch me again, and I'll rip out your ribcage and wear it like a vest.
There are several vans waiting outside.
You'll all be held for reassignment.
All except you, Miss Clark.
What makes you think I'll keep working here after you take everyone away from me?
I haven't taken everyone away from you.
Not yet.
He used me to make you stay, didn't he?
You know, this lab... it used to remind me of everything that was wrong in my life.
And now it's pretty much the only place where... everything's right.
Kirsten...
- I'm so sorry...
- It's not your fault.
And as long as my mom is out there somewhere, alive,
I'm not done.
What about Blair?
You know, I used to think
I was the smartest person in the room.
But Cameron, Camille, Linus, even Maggie and Fisher, they're... they're all so much smarter than I am in so many ways.
But... there is one person that I'm smarter than.
Mitchell Blair.
You got something on him in the Stitch, didn't you?
Oh, yeah.
Nora Dublin?
Credentials, please.
You look younger than I remember, Miss Dublin.
I apologize, Admiral.
My name is Kirsten Clark, and I work for a secret division of the NSA that hacks into the memories of the dead.
It's called the Stitchers Program, but you knew that.
- That's ridiculous.
- You know it's not.
Leave us.
You lured me here by falsely claiming to be a high-ranking NSA Commander.
I should have you arrested.
I know... but as Secretary of Defense,
I thought you should know that someone is threatening to go public about the Stitchers Program, as well as your personal knowledge of the billions of dollars that have been diverted developing it.
- Who?
- Me.
You know Daniel Stinger, and you certainly know Mitchell Blair.
That means you know about the Stitchers Program.
Let's just say for a moment you're right.
- Why are we here?
- To make a deal.
My colleagues are being reassigned.
I don't want that to happen.
Anything else?
I want Maggie Baptiste to run the Stitchers Program.
I never want to see Mitchell Blair again.
Is that it?
No.
I'm looking for someone.
And I know you know where she is.
Who are you looking for?
My mother.
Well, I'm not sure what you did.
Not sure if I want to know either, but well done.
All I can say is that it's good to have friends in high places.
Speaking of which, congratulations on your promotion.
Well, just because I've been offered Blair's job doesn't mean that I want it.
Sure you do.
May I come in?
Always.
So...
Kirsten Clark saves the day again.
- It was a team effort.
- Well.
Is Nina here?
Yeah, about that.
This was waiting for me when I got home.
"Cameron, I waited three days for you.
"Every time I heard a noise in the hall,
"I would go to the door thinking it was you coming home,
"but it never was.
"I love you, but I can't wait for you anymore.
Take care of yourself.
Love, Nina."
Cameron...
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I mean, I love Nina, but I...
I wasn't in love with her.
Took me a while, but I think I finally figured that out.
How long would you have waited for me when I was trapped in my memory?
Forever.
Everything makes sense when I'm with you.
Wow.
Please tell me that wasn't caused by residual emotion.
No.
Brand-new emotion.
- I like it.
- Me too.
Hey.
I was wondering... when... when you were trying to get me to bounce, from my memory... what did you mean when you said,
I couldn't help you if I was stuck in there?
I never said that.
But if you didn't say it, who did?
- Linus:
Guess what's back!
- Previously on Stitchers...
You have a sister.
Her name's Ivy Brown.
Ivy:
Your mother is still alive.
I shared information with you that I promised to keep secret.
You are not the only one with issues at the moment, so back off!
- If something should happen to me...
- Baba!
Samir:
I've always been proud of you.
Nina:
You need to make a choice.
The girl in your mind or the girl standing in front of you.
- What do you want?
- I want to be with my mother.
Shh.
He can hear you.
Whoever that is, that's not me.
Entanglement.
It's the ultimate hack!
Stinger's been running the anomaly on us this entire time.
Shut it down, Captain.
- Step away from your equipment.
- Tim:
Excuse me.
You haven't just crossed a line, Baptiste.
You've crossed me.
- Linus:
Kirsten's gone.
- Then get her back!
- Mom.
- Young Cameron:
How do you feel?
- Like I'm home.
- Cameron:
I want you to hijack it.
No matter how long it takes...
I will never leave you.
Ayo:
She's ready.
All right, stand by.
Rebooting all systems in 30 seconds.
If this doesn't work, how much longer can Kirsten last?
She's not eating, but she's getting fluids.
She could last a few weeks.
Yes, what about her mind?
How long can she stay lost inside of it?
- Maggie:
I don't know.
- Blair:
Well, what does Goodkin think?
- Maggie:
He doesn't know either.
- Blair:
He's had three days to figure it out.
This is what he's come up with.
Rebooting the entire lab might bounce Kirsten.
Well, for your sake, I hope he's right.
You're all in enough trouble without also killing the golden goose.
Don't make me regret letting you and your men out of the interrogation room.
It's a good thing for you that you did.
How's your son?
Recovering in Germany at the Army Medical Center.
I hope I get to see him before you send me off to wherever it is you plan on sending me off to.
That one's on you, Baptiste.
You ready?
Does it matter?
Cameron, when this is over, win or lose... they're gonna disappear us.
You know that right?
When this is over, if Kirsten's dead, I won't care.
Prepping systems to go offline!
Full system reboot on my mark!
In five... four... three... two... one.
Mark!
Linus:
Full system power down!
Blood pressure's dropping.
107 over 66.
- Not yet.
- 98 over 54.
Not yet.
81 over 44.
She's crashing!
- Cameron?
- Not yet.
- Ayo:
She's bottomed.
- Cameron.
- Reboot.
- Systems back online in three, two, one, now.
Kirsten, can you hear me?
Blood pressure's not coming back up.
Kirsten.
Kirsten!
♪ Take me inside
♪ Take me inside
Kirsten.
- Ayo.
- Wait.
93 over 62.
It's coming back up.
Kirsten, come on.
Come on, talk to me, Stretch.
Linus!
She's still trapped in the memory loop.
Damn it.
Goodkin, is that it?
I have to find out how my father is doing.
I talked to Blair about letting you call out.
He won't budge.
- I bet I could make him budge.
- Linus.
I'm going crazy!
I can feel it.
There's something not right with him, and...
I don't know how to explain it, but I just...
I just know.
The bond between parent and child is like that.
It's...
I guess it's like entanglement.
The conference room!
Tell everyone!
Please.
Quantum disentanglement?
Yeah!
So, what do we know?
Our quantum computer's entangled with Stinger's quantum computer.
They are bonded without being physically connected, like the bond between a child and their parent.
Now, if we could just figure out how to disentangle them, then we could take back full control of Kirsten's Stitch.
Yeah, but we've been through this.
We don't know where Stinger moved his computer.
It doesn't matter!
It could be a mile away, a hundred miles away.
It could be in the next room!
Entanglement is not dependent on proximity.
What we need to figure out is the trigger
Stinger used to entangle Kirsten.
Linus is right.
We don't need to know where he is.
We need to know how he did it.
How do we do that without Stinger?
His daughter, Ivy.
I think she knows something.
No.
We already questioned her.
We even hooked her up to a polygraph.
She doesn't know anything.
Well, maybe you geniuses didn't ask her the right questions.
Where's Fisher?
Under guard in the interrogation room.
He was not being cooperative.
- Get him.
- Nope!
He's dangerous.
Get him.
He was there when Ivy was questioned.
He'll know what happened.
Or we can just stand around and watch your golden goose die.
And that will be on you.
- God, Fisher!
- Quincy, what happened?
I wasn't being... cooperative.
- Are you all right?
- You should see the other guy.
I'm serious.
Are you all right?
I'm serious.
You should see the other guy.
Get the handcuffs off of him!
No, no.
Can't risk that.
I promise I won't break anymore of your guards.
My God, I cannot wait until I'm done with the whole lot of ya.
All right.
When Ivy was questioned, did anyone ask her exactly how Stinger trapped Kirsten?
No.
It was "Where's your father?" and "Where's his computer?"
Nothing about his methods.
Let's get her in here.
Ask the right questions.
Linus, you handle this.
Find out what she knows.
Gladly.
I don't know where my father is.
I told you.
I told everyone!
I don't care about that!
What I want to know is how he manipulated his quantum computer to trigger entanglement in ours.
What's a quantum computer?
Would you stop playing me?
What is your problem?
!
My problem is that I am in a situation here!
And the sooner I can find out how your father triggered entanglement in our computer, the sooner I can find out how the hell my father's doing.
What's wrong with him?
He had surgery a couple days ago.
And since we're in lock-down, I have no idea how he's doing.
- Can't you call?
- No!
Outgoing calls are restricted and they took away my cell phone.
NSA goons took mine away when they brought me in too, except they forgot this.
It has a cellular connection.
Use it.
Call.
Find out.
And yes...
I know what quantum computers are, and how entanglement triggers work.
Now, what is this really all about?
Kirsten.
It's about Kirsten.
Maggie:
Do you think we can trust Ivy?
I'm not a hundred percent sure, but at the end of the day, that is her sister dying in there.
Hijacking the hijacked signal does make sense.
You've already done that.
It didn't work.
Not hijacking the anomaly's signal.
Hijacking Kirsten's mother.
That's not a signal.
That's a memory.
Kirsten's emotional state is what's keeping the entanglement active.
If we can isolate Kirsten's memory of Jacqueline Stinger, we can manipulate it.
Force a disentanglement trigger to make her bounce.
So, you're gonna save Kirsten with an idea you got from the daughter of the guy who trapped her.
Do you want Kirsten out of here or not?
Because this gamble's all the gamble I got.
Hey.
Tell me.
He died.
Two... two days ago.
The funeral was yesterday.
I wasn't even there.
How's your mom?
She's holding up.
Did you tell her... why you haven't been able to call?
I wanted to, but she stopped me.
She said it doesn't matter.
Whatever I was doing was important, and that my father would have approved.
I loved him so much.
I know.
Come on.
Okay.
Stations, everyone.
Technically, this Stitch is still active, so there's no go-no-go to call.
Linus and Camille, I'll need you both to isolate the memory.
Linus, you okay?
He's good.
Okay.
Let's go get our girl.
Isolate the signal and route it to my station in three, two, one.
- Mark!
- Done.
Got it.
Kirsten?
- Kirsten?
- Mom.
Hi, honey.
I think it's... time for you to go now.
I'm not leaving.
This is no place for you.
If you... stay here, you will die.
I don't care.
I want to be with you forever.
Entanglement is holding.
Say it.
Well, I don't want to be with you.
You don't mean that.
Yes, I do.
Now, leave.
Heart rate's up to 103.
Entanglement is weakening.
Is there any way you can diminish everything except the mother memory?
Give me ten seconds.
Mom?
You don't mean that.
What have you ever done for me?
Entanglement is down to 50 percent.
I am cutting background impulses now!
I tried to save you.
Save me?
Save me?
You're the reason my life is the way it is.
Mom.
Please, what are you saying?
Heart rate: 137.
- Really push her.
- What do you think I'm doing?
Push her harder.
Here, take this.
I was happy before you came into my life... do you know that?
I had my work, my life... and then you ruined everything!
That's not true.
You don't feel that way.
You can't feel that way!
Twenty-three percent.
I do, Kirsten.
That's exactly how I feel.
Please, Mom, don't say that.
It's the truth.
No, you love me!
I know you do.
You're wrong.
But I love you.
I don't care.
Now leave me alone!
- Mom, please.
- Nine percent.
I don't want to be with you.
- Leave!
- No!
- Leave!
- Mom!
- Go, damn it!
- Mom!
Kirsten.
You can't help me if you're stuck in here.
Mom?
Get out of my life!
- Mom!
- I don't love you!
- Mom!
- Zero percent.
We're disentangled.
Mom!
Mom!
Kirsten.
Kirsten.
Shh.
It's okay.
That wasn't her.
No.
She said things.
No, no.
No, that...
that wasn't her, okay?
That was me.
I said those things.
That...
What?
That was you?
Talking through my mother the whole time?
It was the only way to get you to bounce.
Kirsten.
Arrest them all.
What?
Hey!
Slow down.
How long?
You asleep?
Closin' in on 18 hours.
- Cameron.
- He saved you.
Why are you here?
I...
I thought you hated me.
Yeah.
Uh... about that.
I was just mad at you, but... feels like a pretty long time ago.
Where is Cameron?
Where's Camille?
You know the unctuous guy?
At the NSA, the one who looks like a sci-fi villain?
- Blair.
- He arrested everyone.
So, you know about the Stitchers technology.
Yes, and I know my father.
Our father helped build it.
He trapped me inside my own memory.
He's not my father, not anymore.
So where did Blair take everyone?
I don't know.
When you bounced, they ushered me out of the interrogation room.
How many guards are sitting outside right now?
None.
Blair said you weren't going anywhere.
Well, he's wrong.
Well, the unsinkable Miss Clark.
Thought you'd have bodyguards to protect you against rogue agents.
- Budget cuts.
- Mmm.
I am surprised to see you back on your feet so quickly, Miss Clark.
My sister helped me.
Ah!
The sister you're a fool for trusting.
- That sister?
- Where's my team?
Your small, erratic team of warrior-scientist friends are being detained.
- Pending relocation.
- Relocation?
What's that code for?
Execution?
Don't be a child, Miss Clark.
Now, please, if you'll excuse me,
I need to prepare for my meeting with Admiral Decker.
He's my boss.
Everyone answers to a higher authority, Miss Clark.
What about my team?
I am preparing a new, more trustworthy team for you, so the work of the Stitchers Program will continue.
No, it won't, not without me.
Seriously?
This again?
All right.
All right.
Come with me.
I would've thought you'd be ready for a change in your team, considering how Goodkin used your mother's memory against you.
Well, it worked, didn't it?
It got me to bounce.
Well, but at what cost?
Hmm?
How will you remember your mother now?
How will you react to her when you are reunited?
Yeah.
Reunited.
- You know where she is.
- I do.
Someplace safe.
- I want the truth.
- That is the truth.
Trust me, the NSA needs her hale and hearty as badly as you do.
Please.
The lab accident that happened to your mother, the one when you were eight years old, do you have any idea what she was working on?
- Project Grasshopper.
- Yeah, that's the name.
But its purpose?
No?
Well, Project Grasshopper's goal was to accelerate the evolution of the human brain.
You can't speed up evolution.
Yes, you can.
Why would anyone want to?
Well, imagine if world leaders knew instantly what other world leaders felt and thought?
If they could immediately intuit the wants, needs, fears, desires of their counterparts.
You tell me.
What would that mean?
- The end of conflict?
- Yes.
The end of war.
Hunger, poverty, pretty much all the bad stuff that keeps nice people, like me, up at night.
Project Grasshopper was a failure.
Ah!
That depends on who you ask.
The lab accident accelerated your mother's brain.
She evolved in ways more complex than we understand.
We tried to recreate it, and we failed, and that is why we need to keep your mother safe.
So that after Stitching technology is perfected, we can Stitch into her living, evolved brain and map it completely, every neuron, until we understand her completely.
We're saving the world, Miss Clark.
- Our cases are training missions?
- Yes!
Designed to teach us everything there is to know about Stitching.
And when we are done...
when we are done... you get to complete the rescue mission you started with your father all those years ago and finally pull your mother out of her endless sleep.
Oh, suddenly, I'm not such a bad guy, am I?
Your mother's alive and well.
One day, you'll be reunited with her, but not if you quit the program.
- I can't do it without my team!
- Yes, you can!
They're very, very smart people, sure, but they are just people.
You will stay with the program if you want to save your mother, Miss Clark.
You sure it's okay for me to be here?
I stopped caring what's okay about an hour ago.
Who's there?
Jesus.
Tim!
- Who's the skirt?
- Who's the ape?
That's Tim.
He works here in Engineering.
God, what happened to your hair?
I cut it.
I figured I'm going to prison, why wait?
Why aren't you detained?
I am.
I need to 3D print some spare parts for the new team before I get shipped off.
I hope it's some place nice like Cleveland.
Mmm.
Are you sure Blair has no idea Linus has it?
Positive.
If Linus is half as smart as I think he is, he found a way to keep it on him.
Question.
What are we talking about?
There it is.
I lent Linus my smart-watch.
He still has it.
This is gonna be harder than I wanted.
That's an NSA facility.
Biometrics, photo ID.
- It's impossible.
- Kirsten:
Mmm.
Well, that's what people say about hacking into the memories of the dead.
No, that sounds reasonable.
You know how I'm gonna get them out of there?
Through the front door.
Kirsten:
Nora Dublin, 42 years old.
Highest ranking woman in the NSA security hierarchy.
Got the promotion from the President himself.
Holds the rank of Security Commander.
Currently stationed in Cairo.
You look good for 42.
It's clean living.
What about the biometrics?
You don't happen to have Nora Dublin's fingers lying around, do you?
I'm about to.
I hope this will fool the biometrics scanner.
I've never printed anything this thin and flexible.
I have no idea how long it will last.
Hopefully long enough.
- Good evening.
- Ma'am.
Commander Dublin.
From the Cairo office?
- Yes.
- What brings you to LA?
I'm here to oversee a prisoner transfer from Detention Block AA-23.
We don't have detention blocks.
Well, in Cairo, that's what we call where the prisoners are held.
If you call it something different here, that's your business, not mine.
It's good.
- Thank you.
- Hold it, Commander.
I need to call this in because that's my business.
Woman:
Director Mitchell Blair's office.
Guard:
Yes, this is Post 1477E16.
Calling in for confirmation of a prisoner transfer.
Stand by for Director Blair.
This is Blair.
Yes, I'm at Post 1477E16.
Is this about the prisoner transfer from Detention Block AA-23?
- Yes, sir.
- I concur.
- Concur?
- Approve?
She's good.
Good to go.
It's all good.
Tell Commander Dublin, I say hello.
Will do, sir.
Sorry to bother you.
Sorry for the delay, Commander.
- Director Blair sends his regards.
- That's so Director Blair.
Guard:
Place your right hand on the scanner, please.
Commander, may I see your credentials one more time?
When was the last time you had this scanner cleaned?
Hmm?
Ma'am?
In Cairo, we clean our scanners daily.
- Commander, let me escort you.
- That would be lovely.
Here we are, the, uh... detention blocks.
Thank you.
- I'll take it from here.
- Are you sure?
These prisoners attacked a fully-armed NSA unit.
I can take care of myself.
- I'll wait outside.
Just in case.
- Mm-hmm.
You got to be freakin' kidding me!
Well, look who finally showed up.
Camille:
Told you!
Kirsten, what the hell are you doing here?
Getting you out?
Please tell me you're not cooking.
Yeah, crepes.
You want?
I thought you guys were in trouble.
It's like a country club!
We're being reassigned, not water-boarded.
Okay, well, Blair plans to continue with the program.
I told him I wouldn't do it without you.
Let me guess.
He didn't care?
He... he said my mother's still alive, and that as soon as we perfect Stitching, I'll be able to save her.
- He told you all of that?
- That sounds a little crazy.
At least he didn't screw with my memory of her.
I will explain it when we're outta here.
All right, so what's the plan?
Something that doesn't involve us getting shot on the way out?
No, I worked up a security clearance, told the guards I'm taking charge of you.
It's a prisoner transfer from Detention Block AA-23.
- Mmm!
That's my girl!
- Blade Runner?
- Star Wars.
- Darn.
We're gonna walk out of here together, then we're gonna find my mother, and we're gonna use that knowledge as leverage.
Force Blair to let you all continue with the program.
NSA protocol is that prisoner transfers require at least one armed guard.
I don't suppose you're carrying a gun.
You said we couldn't.
Your idea, not mine.
Only one armed guard?
Done!
Ivy told me about your dad.
Linus, I'm so sorry.
He was a good man.
Yeah.
He was the best.
Thanks.
Hey.
- Can we talk about the Stitch?
- I'd rather not.
Look, I'm sorry about what I did to get you to bounce, but...
It's not that I'm not grateful, it's just now I'm stuck remembering my mother that way.
She wasn't real.
She was to me.
Thank you for your cooperation.
- Freeze!
Stay where you are!
- Right there!
Guess crepes are back on the menu.
We've had plenty of time to check.
There's no other way out.
Well, maybe you missed something.
Then again, maybe we didn't.
- You'll be fine.
- I'm worried about everyone else.
Well, we'll be fine too.
I've always wanted to spend more time in an Arctic weather station.
Joking.
I...
I have no idea where Blair's reassigning me.
Why don't you just quit?
- You could go back to research.
- What?
!
And give up show business?
Nah.
Maybe if I play nice, and don't piss anyone off for a while,
Blair will let me back in the Stitch lab, but...
Why would you even want to?
Because that's where you'll be.
Okay, you need to keep Stitching.
- Not without you.
- Yes, without me!
It's the only hope your mother has.
Look, look, as long as I know you're safe,
I'll be okay, and...
You know, I am...
I am sorry about what I did to your memory of her, but that's why you need to keep Stitching, so you can save your mother and make some new memories.
We're needed back at the lab.
Something's happened.
They showed up about a half hour ago.
What is she doing here?
She helped me rescue you guys.
Camille:
So, this is what rescued looks like?
Oh, hi, Mitch.
Great to see you again.
Not now, Engelson.
New case has come in.
27 years old.
Hit and run... while jogging downtown.
His name is Nathan Blair.
He's my son.
Mitchell, I am so sorry.
I need to know who did this and if it was premeditated.
Maybe someone killed Nathan to get to me.
I need to know who.
Mitchell, I don't think that this is good for you.
He was my son.
Okay.
No.
Kirsten, come with me.
We have him where we want him.
Negotiate, get pardons.
Make him tell us where my mother is.
"We have him where we want him?" Is that who you are?
Yeah, and I didn't see him crying over the people I lost.
Me neither.
That man kept me from finding out that my father had died for three days.
I didn't even get to go to my own father's funeral because of Blair.
I'm not doing jack for him.
And that is why you two are better than he is.
- I'm not so sure about that.
- I am.
Go suit up.
Hey!
Look, I don't know how ready you are to Stitch so soon after... you know, but first time something goes wrong, I want you to bounce, okay?
- Mm-hmm.
- I almost lost you once.
I'm not doing that again.
Hey.
You're cute when you're worried about me.
Then I must be cute all the time.
Cameron:
All right, lights at 20 percent, please.
I need a go-no-go for Stitch Neuro-sync.
- Life Sci?
- Go.
- Sub-Bio?
- Go.
- Cameron:
Engineering?
- Go.
- Communications?
- Go!
- Medical.
- We are a go.
Comm check.
One, two, one, two.
- I hear you, Cameron.
- All right, mission clock set to five minutes, please.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, this one's family.
So, let's get it right.
Induce Stitch Neuro-sync on my mark.
In three... two... one... mark.
Blair: "All that night, we were in a great bustle
"getting things in their place...
- squire's friends..."
- Cameron:
What do you see, Kirsten?
Nathan's seven years old, maybe, eight.
Blair's reading to him in the office.
Treasure Island.
Kirsten:
Blair's being very sweet to him.
He loved that book.
"The boatswain sounded his pipe..."
"and the crew began to man the capstan-bars.
And the crew began to man the capstan-bars."
Located a memory hotspot.
- How hot?
- Molten.
All right, K, you're on the move.
You don't even know her!
The NSA knows her family.
She's not her parents.
Blair:
We are all our parents.
That's who we become.
Blair and Nathan are fighting.
It's about a girl.
You think that she's using me to get to you?
I can't rule it out.
Everything makes sense when I'm with her, Dad.
God, sentiment like that is proof you're not ready to get married, not just to her, but to anyone.
Do not turn your back on me, young man!
You're wrong!
Not all of us become our parents.
That's the last memory Nathan had with Blair in it.
That's the last time I saw him alive.
Approaching death memory.
Kirsten, talk to me, Sunshine.
Blair wants to kill your mother.
Do not trust him.
Find out where she is, and find a way to tell me.
Together, we can save her.
I'm counting on you, sweetheart.
- Oh my God.
- Kirsten, what is it?
Cameron:
Will you talk to me, damn it?
Cameron.
You okay there?
Kirsten, bounce.
And hey, I don't think you're a bad person for calling the NSA on me.
Kirsten, Daddy loves you so much.
Death memory in six seconds.
Kirsten, damn it, make the bounce.
Well?
What'd you see?
Don't play with me, Miss Clark.
What'd you see?
- Nothing.
- What'd you see?
!
Nothing.
Sidearm.
Now.
Blair!
Tell me, or I will shoot her.
Kirsten, don't tell this ass-hat anything.
Blair, take it easy.
I would stop moving, right now, Detective, if I were you.
Mitchell, I know you're upset, but you don't have to do this.
What did you see?
I saw my father kill your son.
What?
He knew you'd make us Stitch, so he wanted to give me a warning.
He said you're gonna kill my mother.
Why would I kill your mother?
You tell me.
That son of a bitch... killed my son to tell you that.
I'm gonna find your psychopathic father, and when I do, I am gonna kill him.
That's my warning.
Touch me again, and I'll rip out your ribcage and wear it like a vest.
There are several vans waiting outside.
You'll all be held for reassignment.
All except you, Miss Clark.
What makes you think I'll keep working here after you take everyone away from me?
I haven't taken everyone away from you.
Not yet.
He used me to make you stay, didn't he?
You know, this lab... it used to remind me of everything that was wrong in my life.
And now it's pretty much the only place where... everything's right.
Kirsten...
- I'm so sorry...
- It's not your fault.
And as long as my mom is out there somewhere, alive,
I'm not done.
What about Blair?
I was the smartest person in the room.
But Cameron, Camille, Linus, even Maggie and Fisher, they're... they're all so much smarter than I am in so many ways.
But... there is one person that I'm smarter than.
Mitchell Blair.
You got something on him in the Stitch, didn't you?
Oh, yeah.
Nora Dublin?
Credentials, please.
You look younger than I remember, Miss Dublin.
I apologize, Admiral.
My name is Kirsten Clark, and I work for a secret division of the NSA that hacks into the memories of the dead.
It's called the Stitchers Program, but you knew that.
- That's ridiculous.
- You know it's not.
Leave us.
You lured me here by falsely claiming to be a high-ranking NSA Commander.
I should have you arrested.
I know... but as Secretary of Defense,
I thought you should know that someone is threatening to go public about the Stitchers Program, as well as your personal knowledge of the billions of dollars that have been diverted developing it.
- Who?
- Me.
Kirsten:
You know Daniel Stinger, and you certainly know Mitchell Blair.
That means you know about the Stitchers Program.
Let's just say for a moment you're right.
- Why are we here?
- To make a deal.
My colleagues are being reassigned.
I don't want that to happen.
Anything else?
I want Maggie Baptiste to run the Stitchers Program.
I never want to see Mitchell Blair again.
Is that it?
No.
I'm looking for someone.
And I know you know where she is.
Who are you looking for?
My mother.
Well, I'm not sure what you did.
Not sure if I want to know either, but well done.
All I can say is that it's good to have friends in high places.
Speaking of which, congratulations on your promotion.
Well, just because I've been offered Blair's job doesn't mean that I want it.
Sure you do.
May I come in?
Always.
So...
Kirsten Clark saves the day again.
- It was a team effort.
- Well.
Is Nina here?
Yeah, about that.
This was waiting for me when I got home.
"Cameron, I waited three days for you.
"Every time I heard a noise in the hall,
"I would go to the door thinking it was you coming home,
"but it never was.
"I love you, but I can't wait for you anymore.
Take care of yourself.
Love, Nina."
Cameron...
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I mean, I love Nina, but I...
I wasn't in love with her.
Took me a while, but I think I finally figured that out.
How long would you have waited for me when I was trapped in my memory?
Forever.
Everything makes sense when I'm with you.

- Linus:
Guess what's back!
- Previously on Stitchers...
You have a sister.
Her name's Ivy Brown.
Ivy:
Your mother is still alive.
I shared information with you that I promised to keep secret.
You are not the only one with issues at the moment, so back off!
- If something should happen to me...
- Baba!
Samir:
I've always been proud of you.
Nina:
You need to make a choice.
The girl in your mind or the girl standing in front of you.
- What do you want?
- I want to be with my mother.
Shh.
He can hear you.
Whoever that is, that's not me.
Entanglement.
It's the ultimate hack!
Stinger's been running the anomaly on us this entire time.
Shut it down, Captain.
- Step away from your equipment.
- Tim:
Excuse me.
You haven't just crossed a line, Baptiste.
You've crossed me.
- Linus:
Kirsten's gone.
- Then get her back!
- Mom.
- Young Cameron:
How do you feel?
- Like I'm home.
- Cameron:
I want you to hijack it.
No matter how long it takes...
I will never leave you.
Ayo:
She's ready.
All right, stand by.
Rebooting all systems in 30 seconds.
If this doesn't work, how much longer can Kirsten last?
She's not eating, but she's getting fluids.
She could last a few weeks.
Yes, what about her mind?
How long can she stay lost inside of it?
- Maggie:
I don't know.
- Blair:
Well, what does Goodkin think?
- Maggie:
He doesn't know either.
- Blair:
He's had three days to figure it out.
This is what he's come up with.
Rebooting the entire lab might bounce Kirsten.
Well, for your sake, I hope he's right.
You're all in enough trouble without also killing the golden goose.
Don't make me regret letting you and your men out of the interrogation room.
It's a good thing for you that you did.
How's your son?
Recovering in Germany at the Army Medical Center.
I hope I get to see him before you send me off to wherever it is you plan on sending me off to.
That one's on you, Baptiste.
You ready?
Does it matter?
Cameron, when this is over, win or lose... they're gonna disappear us.
You know that right?
When this is over, if Kirsten's dead, I won't care.
Prepping systems to go offline!
Full system reboot on my mark!

93 over 62.
It's coming back up.
Kirsten, come on.
Come on, talk to me, Stretch.
Linus!
She's still trapped in the memory loop.
Damn it.
Goodkin, is that it?
I have to find out how my father is doing.
I talked to Blair about letting you call out.
He won't budge.
- I bet I could make him budge.
- Linus.
I'm going crazy!
I can feel it.
There's something not right with him, and...
I don't know how to explain it, but I just...
I just know.
The bond between parent and child is like that.
It's...
I guess it's like entanglement.
(exhales sharply)
The conference room!
Tell everyone!
Please.
Quantum disentanglement?
Yeah!
So, what do we know?
Our quantum computer's entangled with Stinger's quantum computer.
They are bonded without being physically connected, like the bond between a child and their parent.
Now, if we could just figure out how to disentangle them, then we could take back full control of Kirsten's Stitch.
Yeah, but we've been through this.
We don't know where Stinger moved his computer.
It doesn't matter!
It could be a mile away, a hundred miles away.
It could be in the next room!
Entanglement is not dependent on proximity.
What we need to figure out is the trigger
Stinger used to entangle Kirsten.
Linus is right.
We don't need to know where he is.
We need to know how he did it.
How do we do that without Stinger?
His daughter, Ivy.
I think she knows something.
No.
We already questioned her.
We even hooked her up to a polygraph.
She doesn't know anything.
Well, maybe you geniuses didn't ask her the right questions.
Where's Fisher?
Under guard in the interrogation room.
He was not being cooperative.
- Get him.
- Nope!
He's dangerous.
Get him.
He was there when Ivy was questioned.
He'll know what happened.
Or we can just stand around and watch your golden goose die.
And that will be on you.
- God, Fisher!
- Quincy, what happened?
I wasn't being... cooperative.
- Are you all right?
- You should see the other guy.
I'm serious.
Are you all right?
I'm serious.
You should see the other guy.
Get the handcuffs off of him!
No, no.
Can't risk that.
I promise I won't break anymore of your guards.
My God, I cannot wait until I'm done with the whole lot of ya.
All right.
When Ivy was questioned, did anyone ask her exactly how Stinger trapped Kirsten?
No.
It was "Where's your father?" and "Where's his computer?"
Nothing about his methods.
Let's get her in here.
Ask the right questions.
Linus, you handle this.
Find out what she knows.
Gladly.
I don't know where my father is.
I told you.
I told everyone!
I don't care about that!
What I want to know is how he manipulated his quantum computer to trigger entanglement in ours.
What's a quantum computer?
Would you stop playing me?
What is your problem?
!
My problem is that I am in a situation here!
And the sooner I can find out how your father triggered entanglement in our computer, the sooner I can find out how the hell my father's doing.
What's wrong with him?
He had surgery a couple days ago.
And since we're in lock-down, I have no idea how he's doing.
- Can't you call?
- No!
Outgoing calls are restricted and they took away my cell phone.
NSA goons took mine away when they brought me in too, except they forgot this.
It has a cellular connection.
Use it.
Call.
Find out.
And yes...
I know what quantum computers are, and how entanglement triggers work.
Now, what is this really all about?
Kirsten.
It's about Kirsten.
Maggie:
Do you think we can trust Ivy?
I'm not a hundred percent sure, but at the end of the day, that is her sister dying in there.
Hijacking the hijacked signal does make sense.
You've already done that.
It didn't work.
Not hijacking the anomaly's signal.
Hijacking Kirsten's mother.
That's not a signal.
That's a memory.
Kirsten's emotional state is what's keeping the entanglement active.
If we can isolate Kirsten's memory of Jacqueline Stinger, we can manipulate it.
Force a disentanglement trigger to make her bounce.
So, you're gonna save Kirsten with an idea you got from the daughter of the guy who trapped her.
Do you want Kirsten out of here or not?
Because this gamble's all the gamble I got.
Hey.
Tell me.
(inhales)
He died.
Two... two days ago.
The funeral was yesterday.
I wasn't even there.
How's your mom?
She's holding up.
Did you tell her... why you haven't been able to call?
I wanted to, but she stopped me.
She said it doesn't matter.
Whatever I was doing was important, and that my father would have approved.
I loved him so much.
I know.
Come on.
Okay.
Stations, everyone.
Technically, this Stitch is still active, so there's no go-no-go to call.
Linus and Camille, I'll need you both to isolate the memory.
Linus, you okay?
He's good.
Okay.
Let's go get our girl.
Isolate the signal and route it to my station in three, two, one.
- Mark!
- Done.
Got it.
Kirsten?
- Kirsten?
- Mom.
Hi, honey.
I think it's... time for you to go now.
(birds singing)
I'm not leaving.
This is no place for you.
If you... stay here, you will die.
I don't care.
I want to be with you forever.
Entanglement is holding.
(whispering indistinctly)
Say it.
Well, I don't want to be with you.
You don't mean that.
Yes, I do.
Now, leave.
Heart rate's up to 103.
Entanglement is weakening.
Is there any way you can diminish everything except the mother memory?
Give me ten seconds.
Mom?
You don't mean that.
What have you ever done for me?
Entanglement is down to 50 percent.
I am cutting background impulses now!
I tried to save you.
Save me?
(crows cawing)
Save me?
You're the reason my life is the way it is.
Mom.
Please, what are you saying?
Heart rate: 137.
- Really push her.
- What do you think I'm doing?
Push her harder.
Here, take this.
I was happy before you came into my life... do you know that?
I had my work, my life... and then you ruined everything!
That's not true.
You don't feel that way.
You can't feel that way!
Twenty-three percent.
I do, Kirsten.
That's exactly how I feel.
Please, Mom, don't say that.
It's the truth.
No, you love me!
I know you do.
You're wrong.
But I love you.
I don't care.
Now leave me alone!
- Mom, please.
- Nine percent.
I don't want to be with you.
- Leave!
- No!
- Leave!
- Mom!
- Go, damn it!
- Mom!
Kirsten.
(crying)
You can't help me if you're stuck in here.
Mom?
Get out of my life!
- Mom!
- I don't love you!
- Mom!
- Zero percent.
We're disentangled.
Mom!
(rapid beeping)
Mom!
(machine powers down)
(crying)
(sobbing)
- Kirsten.
Kirsten.
Shh.
- (sobbing)
It's okay.
That wasn't her.
No.
She said things.
No, no.
No, that...
that wasn't her, okay?
That was me.
I said those things.
- That...
- (gasps)
What?
That was you?
Talking through my mother the whole time?
It was the only way to get you to bounce.
(Kirsten crying softly)
Kirsten.
Arrest them all.
What?
(sighs)
Hey!
Slow down.
How long?
You asleep?
Closin' in on 18 hours.
- Cameron.
- He saved you.
Why are you here?
I...
I thought you hated me.
Yeah.
Uh... about that.
I was just mad at you, but... feels like a pretty long time ago.
Where is Cameron?
Where's Camille?
You know the unctuous guy?
At the NSA, the one who looks like a sci-fi villain?
- Blair.
- He arrested everyone.
So, you know about the Stitchers technology.
Yes, and I know my father.
Our father helped build it.
He trapped me inside my own memory.
He's not my father, not anymore.
So where did Blair take everyone?
I don't know.
When you bounced, they ushered me out of the interrogation room.
How many guards are sitting outside right now?
None.
Blair said you weren't going anywhere.
(scoffs)
Well, he's wrong.
Well, the unsinkable Miss Clark.
Thought you'd have bodyguards to protect you against rogue agents.
- Budget cuts.
- Mmm.
I am surprised to see you back on your feet so quickly, Miss Clark.
My sister helped me.
Ah!
The sister you're a fool for trusting.
- That sister?
- Where's my team?
Your small, erratic team of warrior-scientist friends are being detained.
- Pending relocation.
- Relocation?
What's that code for?
Execution?
Don't be a child, Miss Clark.
Now, please, if you'll excuse me,
I need to prepare for my meeting with Admiral Decker.
He's my boss.
Everyone answers to a higher authority, Miss Clark.
What about my team?
I am preparing a new, more trustworthy team for you, so the work of the Stitchers Program will continue.
No, it won't, not without me.
Seriously?
(scoffs) This again?
All right.
All right.
Come with me.
I would've thought you'd be ready for a change in your team, considering how Goodkin used your mother's memory against you.
Well, it worked, didn't it?
It got me to bounce.
Well, but at what cost?
Hmm?
How will you remember your mother now?
How will you react to her when you are reunited?
Yeah.
Reunited.
- You know where she is.
- I do.
Someplace safe.
- I want the truth.
- That is the truth.
Trust me, the NSA needs her hale and hearty as badly as you do.
(sighs)
Please.
(clears throat)
The lab accident that happened to your mother, the one when you were eight years old, do you have any idea what she was working on?
- Project Grasshopper.
- Yeah, that's the name.
But its purpose?
No?
Well, Project Grasshopper's goal was to accelerate the evolution of the human brain.
You can't speed up evolution.
Yes, you can.
Why would anyone want to?
Well, imagine if world leaders knew instantly what other world leaders felt and thought?
If they could immediately intuit the wants, needs, fears, desires of their counterparts.
You tell me.
What would that mean?
- The end of conflict?
- Yes.
The end of war.
Hunger, poverty, pretty much all the bad stuff that keeps nice people, like me, up at night.
Project Grasshopper was a failure.
Ah!
That depends on who you ask.
The lab accident accelerated your mother's brain.
She evolved in ways more complex than we understand.
We tried to recreate it, and we failed, and that is why we need to keep your mother safe.
So that after Stitching technology is perfected, we can Stitch into her living, evolved brain and map it completely, every neuron, until we understand her completely.
We're saving the world, Miss Clark.
- Our cases are training missions?
- Yes!
Designed to teach us everything there is to know about Stitching.
And when we are done...
when we are done... you get to complete the rescue mission you started with your father all those years ago and finally pull your mother out of her endless sleep.
Oh, suddenly, I'm not such a bad guy, am I?
Your mother's alive and well.
One day, you'll be reunited with her, but not if you quit the program.
- I can't do it without my team!
- Yes, you can!
They're very, very smart people, sure, but they are just people.
You will stay with the program if you want to save your mother, Miss Clark.
(elevator dings)
You sure it's okay for me to be here?
I stopped caring what's okay about an hour ago.
- Who's there?
- (gasps)
Jesus.
Tim!
- Who's the skirt?
- Who's the ape?
(sighs) That's Tim.
He works here in Engineering.
God, what happened to your hair?
I cut it.
I figured I'm going to prison, why wait?
Why aren't you detained?
I am.
I need to 3D print some spare parts for the new team before I get shipped off.
I hope it's some place nice like Cleveland.
Mmm.
Are you sure Blair has no idea Linus has it?
Positive.
If Linus is half as smart as I think he is, he found a way to keep it on him.
Question.
What are we talking about?
There it is.
I lent Linus my smart-watch.
He still has it.
This is gonna be harder than I wanted.
That's an NSA facility.
Biometrics, photo ID.
- It's impossible.
- Kirsten:
Mmm.
Well, that's what people say about hacking into the memories of the dead.
No, that sounds reasonable.
You know how I'm gonna get them out of there?
Through the front door.
Kirsten:
Nora Dublin, 42 years old.
Highest ranking woman in the NSA security hierarchy.
Got the promotion from the President himself.
Holds the rank of Security Commander.
Currently stationed in Cairo.
You look good for 42.
It's clean living.
What about the biometrics?
You don't happen to have Nora Dublin's fingers lying around, do you?
I'm about to.
(whirring)
I hope this will fool the biometrics scanner.
I've never printed anything this thin and flexible.
I have no idea how long it will last.
Hopefully long enough.
(exhales)
(talking indistinctly)
- Good evening.
- Ma'am.
Commander Dublin.
From the Cairo office?
- Yes.
- What brings you to LA?
I'm here to oversee a prisoner transfer from Detention Block AA-23.
We don't have detention blocks.
Well, in Cairo, that's what we call where the prisoners are held.
If you call it something different here, that's your business, not mine.
(computer beeps)
It's good.
- Thank you.
- Hold it, Commander.
I need to call this in because that's my business.
(phone dialing)
Woman:
Director Mitchell Blair's office.
Guard:
Yes, this is Post 1477E16.
Calling in for confirmation of a prisoner transfer.
Stand by for Director Blair.
This is Blair.
Yes, I'm at Post 1477E16.
Is this about the prisoner transfer from Detention Block AA-23?
- Yes, sir.
- I concur.
- Concur?
- Approve?
She's good.
Good to go.
It's all good.
Tell Commander Dublin, I say hello.
Will do, sir.
Sorry to bother you.
Sorry for the delay, Commander.
- Director Blair sends his regards.
- That's so Director Blair.
Guard:
Place your right hand on the scanner, please.
(beeping rapidly)
(buzzing)
(beeping rapidly)
(buzzing)
Commander, may I see your credentials one more time?
When was the last time you had this scanner cleaned?
Hmm?
Ma'am?
(beeping rapidly)
(beeps)
In Cairo, we clean our scanners daily.
- Commander, let me escort you.
- That would be lovely.
Here we are, the, uh... detention blocks.
Thank you.
- I'll take it from here.
- Are you sure?
These prisoners attacked a fully-armed NSA unit.
I can take care of myself.
- I'll wait outside.
Just in case.
- Mm-hmm.
You got to be freakin' kidding me!
Well, look who finally showed up.
- Camille:
Told you!
- (snaps fingers)
Kirsten, what the hell are you doing here?
Getting you out?
Please tell me you're not cooking.
Yeah, crepes.
You want?
I thought you guys were in trouble.
It's like a country club!
We're being reassigned, not water-boarded.
(sighs)
Okay, well, Blair plans to continue with the program.
I told him I wouldn't do it without you.
Let me guess.
He didn't care?
He... he said my mother's still alive, and that as soon as we perfect Stitching, I'll be able to save her.
- He told you all of that?
- That sounds a little crazy.
At least he didn't screw with my memory of her.
I will explain it when we're outta here.
All right, so what's the plan?
Something that doesn't involve us getting shot on the way out?
No, I worked up a security clearance, told the guards I'm taking charge of you.
It's a prisoner transfer from Detention Block AA-23.
- Mmm!
That's my girl!
- Blade Runner?
- Star Wars.
- Darn.
We're gonna walk out of here together, then we're gonna find my mother, and we're gonna use that knowledge as leverage.
Force Blair to let you all continue with the program.
NSA protocol is that prisoner transfers require at least one armed guard.
I don't suppose you're carrying a gun.
You said we couldn't.
Your idea, not mine.
Only one armed guard?
Done!
(indistinct radio chatter)
Ivy told me about your dad.
Linus, I'm so sorry.
He was a good man.
Yeah.
He was the best.
Thanks.
Hey.
- Can we talk about the Stitch?
- I'd rather not.
Look, I'm sorry about what I did to get you to bounce, but...
It's not that I'm not grateful, it's just now I'm stuck remembering my mother that way.
She wasn't real.
She was to me.
(indistinct chatter)
(muffled groans)
(grunting)
Thank you for your cooperation.
(alarms wailing)
- Freeze!
Stay where you are!
- Right there!
Guess crepes are back on the menu.
We've had plenty of time to check.
There's no other way out.
- Well, maybe you missed something.
- (line buzzing)
Then again, maybe we didn't.
- You'll be fine.
- I'm worried about everyone else.
Well, we'll be fine too.
I've always wanted to spend more time in an Arctic weather station.
Joking.
I...
I have no idea where Blair's reassigning me.
Why don't you just quit?
- You could go back to research.
- What?
!
And give up show business?
Nah.
Maybe if I play nice, and don't piss anyone off for a while,
Blair will let me back in the Stitch lab, but...
Why would you even want to?
Because that's where you'll be.
Okay, you need to keep Stitching.
- Not without you.
- Yes, without me!
It's the only hope your mother has.
Look, look, as long as I know you're safe,
I'll be okay, and...
You know, I am...
I am sorry about what I did to your memory of her, but that's why you need to keep Stitching, so you can save your mother and make some new memories.
(rapid beeping, buzzing)
(door opens)
We're needed back at the lab.
Something's happened.
(elevator dings)
They showed up about a half hour ago.
What is she doing here?
She helped me rescue you guys.
Camille:
So, this is what rescued looks like?
Oh, hi, Mitch.
Great to see you again.
Not now, Engelson.
New case has come in.
27 years old.
Hit and run... while jogging downtown.
His name is Nathan Blair.
He's my son.
Mitchell, I am so sorry.
I need to know who did this and if it was premeditated.
Maybe someone killed Nathan to get to me.
I need to know who.
Mitchell, I don't think that this is good for you.
He was my son.
Okay.
No.
(sighs) Kirsten, come with me.
We have him where we want him.
Negotiate, get pardons.
Make him tell us where my mother is.
"We have him where we want him?" Is that who you are?
Yeah, and I didn't see him crying over the people I lost.
Me neither.
That man kept me from finding out that my father had died for three days.
I didn't even get to go to my own father's funeral because of Blair.
I'm not doing jack for him.
And that is why you two are better than he is.
- I'm not so sure about that.
- I am.
Go suit up.
Hey!
Look, I don't know how ready you are to Stitch so soon after... you know, but first time something goes wrong, I want you to bounce, okay?
- Mm-hmm.
- I almost lost you once.
I'm not doing that again.
Hey.
You're cute when you're worried about me.
Then I must be cute all the time.
Cameron:
All right, lights at 20 percent, please.
(lights, electricity buzzing)
I need a go-no-go for Stitch Neuro-sync.
- Life Sci?
- Go.
- Sub-Bio?
- Go.
- Cameron:
Engineering?
- Go.
- Communications?
- Go!
- Medical.
- We are a go.
Comm check.
One, two, one, two.
- I hear you, Cameron.
- All right, mission clock set to five minutes, please.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, this one's family.
So, let's get it right.
Induce Stitch Neuro-sync on my mark.
In three... two... one...
- mark.
- (whirring)
Blair: "All that night, we were in a great bustle
"getting things in their place...
- squire's friends..."
- Cameron:
What do you see, Kirsten?
Nathan's seven years old, maybe, eight.
Blair's reading to him in the office.
Treasure Island.
Kirsten:
Blair's being very sweet to him.
He loved that book.
"The boatswain sounded his pipe..."
(boatswain's whistle)
"and the crew began to man the capstan-bars.
And the crew began to man the capstan-bars."
(boatswain's whistle)
(Blair's voice overlapping)
Located a memory hotspot.
- How hot?
- Molten.
All right, K, you're on the move.
You don't even know her!
The NSA knows her family.
She's not her parents.
Blair:
We are all our parents.
That's who we become.
Blair and Nathan are fighting.
It's about a girl.
You think that she's using me to get to you?
I can't rule it out.
Everything makes sense when I'm with her, Dad.
God, sentiment like that is proof you're not ready to get married, not just to her, but to anyone.
Do not turn your back on me, young man!
You're wrong!
Not all of us become our parents.
That's the last memory Nathan had with Blair in it.
That's the last time I saw him alive.
Approaching death memory.
(Nathan panting)
- (tires squeal) - (Nathan groans)
Kirsten, talk to me, Sunshine.
(footsteps approaching)
(Nathan breathes shallowly)
Blair wants to kill your mother.
Do not trust him.
Find out where she is, and find a way to tell me.
Together, we can save her.
I'm counting on you, sweetheart.
- Oh my God.
- Kirsten, what is it?
Cameron:
Will you talk to me, damn it?
Cameron.
You okay there?
Kirsten, bounce.
And hey, I don't think you're a bad person for calling the NSA on me.
Kirsten, Daddy loves you so much.
(gasps)
Death memory in six seconds.
Kirsten, damn it, make the bounce.
(rapid beeping)
- (gasping) - (machinery whirs)
Well?
What'd you see?
Don't play with me, Miss Clark.
What'd you see?
- Nothing.
- What'd you see?
!
Nothing.
Sidearm.
Now.
- (gasps)
- Blair!
Tell me, or I will shoot her.
Kirsten, don't tell this ass-hat anything.
Blair, take it easy.
I would stop moving, right now, Detective, if I were you.
Mitchell, I know you're upset, but you don't have to do this.
What did you see?
I saw my father kill your son.
What?
He knew you'd make us Stitch, so he wanted to give me a warning.
He said you're gonna kill my mother.
Why would I kill your mother?
You tell me.
That son of a bitch... killed my son to tell you that.
I'm gonna find your psychopathic father, and when I do, I am gonna kill him.
That's my warning.
Touch me again, and I'll rip out your ribcage and wear it like a vest.
There are several vans waiting outside.
You'll all be held for reassignment.
All except you, Miss Clark.
What makes you think I'll keep working here after you take everyone away from me?
I haven't taken everyone away from you.
Not yet.
He used me to make you stay, didn't he?
(sighs) You know, this lab... it used to remind me of everything that was wrong in my life.
And now it's pretty much the only place where... everything's right.
Kirsten...
- I'm so sorry...
- It's not your fault.
And as long as my mom is out there somewhere, alive,
I'm not done.
What about Blair?
I was the smartest person in the room.
But Cameron, Camille, Linus, even Maggie and Fisher, they're... they're all so much smarter than I am in so many ways.
But... there is one person that I'm smarter than.
Mitchell Blair.
You got something on him in the Stitch, didn't you?
Oh, yeah.
Nora Dublin?
Credentials, please.
You look younger than I remember, Miss Dublin.
I apologize, Admiral.
My name is Kirsten Clark, and I work for a secret division of the NSA that hacks into the memories of the dead.
It's called the Stitchers Program, but you knew that.
- That's ridiculous.
- You know it's not.
Leave us.
You lured me here by falsely claiming to be a high-ranking NSA Commander.
I should have you arrested.
I know... but as Secretary of Defense,
I thought you should know that someone is threatening to go public about the Stitchers Program, as well as your personal knowledge of the billions of dollars that have been diverted developing it.
- Who?
- Me.
Kirsten:
You know Daniel Stinger, and you certainly know Mitchell Blair.
That means you know about the Stitchers Program.
Let's just say for a moment you're right.
- Why are we here?
- To make a deal.
My colleagues are being reassigned.
I don't want that to happen.
Anything else?
I want Maggie Baptiste to run the Stitchers Program.
I never want to see Mitchell Blair again.
(chuckles) Is that it?
No.
I'm looking for someone.
And I know you know where she is.
Who are you looking for?
- My mother.
- (inhales, exhales)
Well, I'm not sure what you did.
Not sure if I want to know either, but well done.
All I can say is that it's good to have friends in high places.
Speaking of which, congratulations on your promotion.
Well, just because I've been offered Blair's job doesn't mean that I want it.
Sure you do.
(knocking)
May I come in?
- Always.
- (Kirsten giggles)
So...
Kirsten Clark saves the day again.
- It was a team effort.
- Well.
Is Nina here?
Yeah, about that.
This was waiting for me when I got home.
"Cameron, I waited three days for you.
"Every time I heard a noise in the hall,
"I would go to the door thinking it was you coming home,
"but it never was.
"I love you, but I can't wait for you anymore.
Take care of yourself.
Love, Nina."
Cameron...
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I mean, I love Nina, but I...
I wasn't in love with her.
Took me a while, but I think I finally figured that out.
How long would you have waited for me when I was trapped in my memory?
Forever.
Everything makes sense when I'm with you.

Maybe just a waffle to go?
Or...
Or two, maybe two waffles to go?
And will you put some eggs in that?
Honey, this might be the most important trial of my career.
Defending Brad?
He's not just Brad, he's your mother's husband.
And if your mother's husband goes back to jail, I mean, she's just gonna, peck out my soul until I'm nothing but a hollow shell.
Oh, you know... maybe a few pieces of bacon?
Okay, yeah.
Wait.
Is this it?
Is this the letter from the doctor saying what the sex of our baby is?
You've had our baby in your briefcase this entire time and you didn't tell me?
No, because we already decided we didn't wanna find out the sex.
Well, that was a little more of a "you" than a "we" decision.
Come on, don't you wanna know?
This makes it so real.
Yeah, 'cause up until now, it's just been this crazy fantasy.
Hey, guys, I've been doing some spring cleaning, and thought you might like some of Emma's old clothes for the baby.
Or you just didn't feel like doin' laundry.
Don't poke holes in this, you're getting free clothes.
I so don't have time for this.
All right, wish me luck.
Luck, I predict that thing will be gone before you hit the elevator.
Look at you, dude!
Your lips don't even move anymore when you're trying to read!
The sex of our baby is in this envelope and
Riley doesn't want to know what it is.
You'd wanna know if you were havin' a boy or a girl, right?
Hell, yeah.
Although I'd have been cool just knowing I was having a baby.
Why don't you open it?
Because I promised Riley I wouldn't.
Oh, right.
Sacred bond.
Gotcha.
Which is why I'll open it!
And if we get caught, we can blame it on Emma.
Honestly, it's one of the best parts about havin' a kid.
Oh!
Pregnancy brain.
What was I thinking?
And you were right.
Dude!
It never fails!

Okay, Mrs. Wheeler, are you ready to head to the courthouse?
Do you mean am I ready to see the man of my dreams locked away?
Am I ready to be left alone, out in the cold with no one to turn to?
No!
No, I am not ready!
Oh, my God!
I can't lose him!
(crying)
Mrs. Wheeler, calm down.
All right?
It is gonna be okay.
I know, I was just practicing for my big moment on the stand.
And if that doesn't sway the jury, then these babies definitely will.
Well, they didn't sway me to make you breakfast this morning.
Okay, all today is about is getting this thing postponed.
When Bustamonte fled the country,
I managed to get a box of his files seized at the border.
Box?
I mean, what's in the box?
Bank statements that will hopefully prove he is the real mastermind behind the whole scheme.
You're a genius!
But it hasn't arrived.
You're an idiot!
Mrs. Wheeler, this box is the only thing we have to prove Brad is innocent.
And, when I say innocent,
I mean only slightly guilty.
Well, I hope we get that old judge who erased all my parking tickets.
I only had to go to second base for him for that.
But I am willing to hit a home run, huh?
No.
No, no, no.
Well, unfortunately, we have Judge Johnson.
Yeah, soon to be known as Lady Justice.
This is her last trial before she leaves to star in her own TV show.
And now I'm interested.
And you weren't when it was just about my husband spending his life in jail?
Yeah, not so much.
But!
But I heard that Judge Johnson is gonna be the new face of daytime TV.
I was just gonna send her my head shot, but my real head would be better.
Look, you have to help me get in to see her.
Yeah, yeah, because it's not like Riley has anything better to do.
Um, I heard her defense, so, no, I don't think she does.
Okay, you know what?
Brad is gonna be fine.
I am going to win this case, and he is going to go free.
Okay.
Oh, God, even I don't believe me.
Let's go.
Oh, hey, babe.
I feel like I didn't give you a proper send-off.
I used to kiss your father like that.
He's gay now.
Can we go?
Let's do this!
Yeah, all right, you are not coming.
I know.
But if you see a dude there that looks like me, it's not.
You're just being racist.
Oh, come on.
Did you get it?
No, that bag was full of candy wrappers.
It's like a chocolate cemetery in there.
(whispers) Brad.
You stay strong.
And know that if things don't go your way,
I will be right here beside you...
at least through the first appeal.
Have no fear, Lady Justice is here.
That little catchphrase is gonna make me a million dollars.
Uh, Ms. Perrin, I see here that you're petitioning to court to postpone this trial.
I...
I am, your honor.
I am just waiting on a box of evidence that will prove that my client...
Do you actually know what's in this box?
Oh, yes, completely.
Not one hundred percent exactly, no, but I have a very strong hunch.
Mm.
I had a hunch that leftover Indian food would make a good breakfast.
(chuckles) So much for hunches.
Petition denied.
So... good news.
We're going to trial.
- Excuse me...
- (Both scream)
Who the hell are you?
Tucker Dobbs.
I hope you don't mind, I let myself in.
I do mind, but I think I know you.
You've been in my court before.
Guilty of breaking my heart, if I recall.
(laughing) Uh... that's me.
Uh, first of all, I just want you to know that I am a huge fan of your work, and second, you need me.
What I need is a manicure, a mai tai, and a boy toy with an ass so tight I can bounce a quarter off of it.
Any chance you got change for a dollar?
Uh, no, no.
I meant you need me for your show.
I produced for the Mary Hart show for two years...
No, forget it, forget it.
I already got a pack of yappy producers telling' me what to do.
But what you don't have is a yappy on-air sidekick.
Right?
You know, feeding' you lines and makin' you look good.
Ooh.
I like lookin' good.
Okay.
Get yourself a uniform, I'll let you audition.
And...
And start thinking of some catchphrases.
Yeah, um...
You don't need to wear no pants, the robe decides what's de evidence.
- Yeah, but not that one.
- Yeah, okay.
Okay.
Here's how it's gonna go.
We'll intercept her in a neutral spot, the coffee shop on the corner of Wall and Chambers.
While she's focused on shoving a chocolate croissant down her gullet,
I'll surreptitiously extract the envelope, run across the road, photocopy the contents, and replace it before she even knows it went missing.
What do you think?
It honestly cannot be any simpler.
Something tells me it could be.
Look, do you want that envelope or not?
It's not like she's gonna walk in here and drop it in our laps.
That was a total crap cocktail with a double crap chaser!
Mrs. Wheeler, it really wasn't that bad.
I mean, honestly, I thought it was gonna be a lot worse.
Hey, and what are we supposed to do if we never get that box of so-called evidence?
Let Brad go to jail just because he broke a couple of stupid laws?
That is kind of how the system works.
Bonnie:
Hey!
What are you two so excited about?
Oh, uh, we're both just really happy the trial's goin' so well.
It's not.
Then we should probably leave you alone to strategize, bye!
- Ready?
- Yes!
No, wait!
Okay, tell me.
Wait, no, don't tell me!
- I don't know...
- Oh-ho, too late!
What the hell is this?
Oh my God, it's not a boy or a girl?
What am I having?
It doesn't matter, I will love it anyway.
No, it's a phone number to something called the Baby Place, with a special code.
Oh, I forgot.
Yeah, we told the doctor to send the results to this baby shop that sends us a cake that's either blue or pink on the inside, so we can be surprised.
It was my idea.
That's genius.
Not the idea, that was lame.
But now all you have to do is call the store.
We can't.
Only Riley can tell them where to deliver the cake.
Got it. (as Riley) Hey, yeah, like, this is Riley Perrin, and I've got, like, this cake, okay?
That was horrible. (as Riley) Hi, this is Riley Perrin, wife of husband Danny Wheeler?
He's a hockey player.
I was horrible?
(both imitating Riley)
What the hell is the matter with you two?
Oh, uh, we're trying to impersonate Riley so we can find out the sex of my baby.
(as Riley) Hello?
This is Riley Perrin, and, and I'll sue your ass if you don't tell me what I'm having!
Well, start dialing!
Pretty big day Emma, we're about to find out if you're getting a boy cousin or a girl cousin.
I want a puppy!
Well, I want a motorcycle and a girlfriend named Bambi, but we all have our disappointments.
She finally left.
Oh my God.
Is that it?
Is that the cake?
No, I just decided to get up early and do a little baking.
Yes, that's the cake!
Would you like to do the honors?
Yes.
No.
I can't.
Or maybe I can.
Heh!
You know what?
Just give me a minute.
You're gonna be a dad.
Man up, dude!
- It's a girl!
- It's a girl!
I'm havin' a girl!
You're havin' a girl!
- (both laughing)
- Finally, someone else will understand how hard it is to raise a girl.
They look so cute, but they're really just small women!
Hey, what's that?
I don't know, it came with the cake.
Maybe should've looked at this first.
It seems this cake actually belongs to a Gordon and Melinda Miller.
Riley's havin' someone else's baby?
No, Danny.
Someone else is havin' Riley's baby?
No, Danny!
- Is Riley...
- Just forget it.
All right, order in the court.
Put your papers away.
We ready to start, and Lady Justice don't play.
(laughter)
I better bang this gavel before this court unravels. (laughs)
When did Tucker become the po-po?
That's prison slang for copper.
Well, he's auditioning to be her TV bailiff.
Normally, I would just freak out, but honestly, it's the least of our problems.
My God!
He is gonna make a mockery of these proceedings!
Okay, Brad, at the first opportunity, take your shirt off.
Got it.
Okay, Counselor, since you seem to have no case, no evidence, and no witnesses, can I assume that you're just gonna stare at me until somebody yells "guilty" and puts you outta your misery?
Oh God, could you?
I mean...
Uh, no, no, I...
I have witnesses.
Uh, a witness.
I would like to call the defendant to the stand.
I need you to stall.
We need time to get that box of evidence.
Got it.
Could you please state your name and occupation?
(clears throat) Hmm!
(speaking slowly) Brad...
ley!
What are you doing?
(whispers) Stalling.
(speaking slowly) Walk... er!
Hey, so congrats on the baby.
Here's your cake.
There was a slight mishap on the subway, but good news, you're havin' a girl!
Really?
That's it?
Months of anticipation, people flying in from around the country for this party, and you just blurt it out?
Maybe you'd like to name her, too.
Oh, I like Elisa.
It was on our list, but we ended up crossing it off, so feel free to take it.
And in exchange for that priceless gift, could we possibly take our cake now?
You seem to be busy.
We don't have your cake.
We sent it back when we read the envelope and realized it wasn't ours.
Like normal people!
Right, honey?
Actually, I ate it.
Sorry, it's my cheat day.
Oh, well, that's okay, but what am I having?
Oh-ho... wouldn't you like to know?
Yes!
Yes, I would like to know!
And, I believe, the defense rests.
Well, that was a disaster!
Mr. Walker, I suggest that you get your affairs in order.
Let's take a break.
All right, don't get your panties in a bunch.
Lady Justice is just breakin' for lunch!
(laughter)
Riley, you have to do something.
I can't go back to jail!
I've already done my screw you tour of Cell Block C, plus I gave away my shampoo and my lucky shiv!
Brad, I am so sorry.
If only she'd allowed us
- to postpone, we wouldn't be...
- (phone vibrates)
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I have to go to the office, I will be right back.
What, what, what?
Bon-Bon, what am I gonna do?
Prison is such a cold and lonely place, and my life is so empty!
Even with the badminton tournament comin' up.
I know, I know.
Oh, my God.
Brad!
Brad!
We are completely alone.
No one came to take you back to lockup!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Well, I was thinking that my life is pretty much over, but sure, why not?
No, no, not now!
No.
No.
I'm busting you out of here.
Just put your head down and keep going until I say stop.
And if we make it out of here alive, get used to hearing that.
Problem solved!
The Baby Place said the baker is gone for the day but they'd send something else instead.
There should be a box here any second.
Oh, man, the anxiety's killin' me.
I knew I never should've gone behind Riley's back.
Dude, it's your kid, too.
You have the right to know whether it's comin' out with a dingley-doo or a vee-jingley-jay.
Hi.
Did the box come?
They called and said there was a box coming!
Box?
What box?
Why would there be a box?
Well, they called the office and said it was on its way, so I ran all the way over there before I realized they might be sending it to the apartment.
You should probably sit down, you crazy pregnant lady.
And we'll go look for this mystery box of yours.
Now, Danny.
Let's go now.
I thought she didn't want to know the sex of the baby.
Dude, her hormones are raging' right now!
I don't even know what she wants!
Except I'm supposed to know what she wants!
- Hey, she might know about the box...
- (Elevator dings) ...but she obviously doesn't know that we're the ones who called.
I've got a box for a Riley Perrin.
I'm Riley!
It can be a boy's name, too.
Thank you.
See you later.
Okay, and you're sure they said it was coming here?
All right, I'll go check my apartment.
Hold on.
(gasps) Riley Perrin?
Oh, my God, yes, thank you!
You saved my life!
- Mrs. Wheeler?
- Oh!
Riley!
Hi!
Um, I, um...
I just slipped in here to check on Emma.
I got it!
I got the box.
Brad's gonna go free!
What?
Really?
Oh, my God, Riley, that's amazing!
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God, I'm so happy!
(Bonnie laughing)
(gasps) Oh, my God!
Brad, what are you doing here?
Well, you know, it seemed like you were gonna lose, so...
So you broke him out?
You're right... she is totally not cool.
I know.
(knocking on door)
Lady Justice is in the house!
Call her up to sue your spouse!
(laughing) Man, I'm killin' it out there!
I'm about to kill you in here.
What do you think you're doin' out there, upstaging me.
It's called the Lady Justice Show, not the Stupid, Wise-crackin' Sidekick Show.
Who'd ever watch a show with a dumb name like that?
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
I'll...
I'll pull it back.
Please.
I really need this job.
Finish up your day and then you're on your way.
Ooh, I like that.
Maybe I can work that in.
What?
Whoa!
That is...
Is that a quarter on the floor?
Oh, my God.
I'm bettin' right now you wish you'd done a few more squats.
Okay.
I'm gonna do it.
Wait, wait, wa.
Dude, dude, dude.
Now that it's here a second time, I feel like maybe we shouldn't open it.
And this is something you should be sharing with Riley.
And more importantly, it doesn't matter if it's a boy or a girl, just as long as it's healthy.
I don't care, I gotta know.
Wait.
What is this?
Luis Bustamonte?
Oh, no.
This is the box of evidence that Riley's been waiting for.
We've gotta get to the courthouse.
Okay, but if Riley finds out, I'm on the record for giving you that speech.
Yo, the judge is here.
Okay, let's put this gavel to the metal and get this trial started.
(chuckles)
You want me to rap, you want me to rhyme, well, this is my courtroom and I ain't got the...
- Time?
- Oh, yeah.
I was gonna say that.
Look, help a sister out, I'll let you back in.
Really?
I can have the job?
Mm.
Hey, order in the court.
I'm back in the hizzy, she said I got the job, and you know y'all missed me.
(all laughing)
Well, let's get this trainwreck over with.
Wait.
Where's the train?
Your Honor!
Your Honor, I'm here, and I've got it, I've got the box.
Oh.
And where's the defendant?
Here I am!
Here I am.
Sorry, I, uh, just dropped a contact.
You never know where they're gonna roll off to.
Your Honor, this box will show that Brad Walker is a relatively innocent man.
All right, I would like to present into evidence this...
- Riley!
- Oh, my God.
What is going on?
(gasps) We're havin' a boy.
Oh, my God, we're havin' a boy!
We are?
Oh, my God, I'm so happy.
We're gonna have a son.
I love you.
A boy.
This is amazing!
Finally... someone will know my pain!
Well, this...
This all could not be sweeter.
But, um...
Hello!
I am on trial for my life here!
Oh, right, um...
Oh, I believe this one is yours.
Slight mix-up, all your fault.
Don't worry, you can apologize later.
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
It's all here.
It's all here!
Everything!
Names, dates, times proving that my client didn't do almost everything he was accused of, just, in your face!
Is where I would like to respectfully place these papers.
Okay.
Uh... well.
In light of this evidence, I have no choice but to set you free.
However, I cannot free you from these lunatics that you call family.
Ooh!
May God have mercy on your soul.
And with the new facts come to light, the strong defense wins the fight.
Our man Brad is free to go.
This is the Lady Justice Show, y'all.
- Well, cheers to you Riley.
- Thanks.
I am pretty proud of myself.
Though, no thanks to any of the idiots who live in this place.
You think they would be at least a little more supportive of someone who's nine months pregnant.
Well, unfortunately, I don't think this is gonna make them any more respectful.
(drumming)
Sadly, they get to take theirs off.
You get to take yours off in a few weeks.
Oh, who am I kidding?
You're probably never losing half of that.
What if it's sooner than a few weeks?
How much sooner?
Aah, like right now!
Oh God, I think I'm having a baby!
- Oh, my God!
- Now?
Now?
It's happening, she's having a baby!
Someone get the door!
Get the door!
(clamoring)
Oh, my God!
And remember, whatever drugs they offer, take 'em!
Come on!
You gotta eat somethin'.
I mean, it's almost nine o'clock, you're usually on your third breakfast by now.
Sorry, but I'm just way too nervous to eat anything.
You know what?
Maybe just a waffle to go?
Or...
Or two, maybe two waffles to go?
And will you put some eggs in that?
Honey, this might be the most important trial of my career.
Defending Brad?
He's not just Brad, he's your mother's husband.
And if your mother's husband goes back to jail, I mean, she's just gonna, peck out my soul until I'm nothing but a hollow shell.
Oh, you know... maybe a few pieces of bacon?
Okay, yeah.
Wait.
Is this it?
Is this the letter from the doctor saying what the sex of our baby is?
You've had our baby in your briefcase this entire time and you didn't tell me?
No, because we already decided we didn't wanna find out the sex.
Well, that was a little more of a "you" than a "we" decision.
Come on, don't you wanna know?
This makes it so real.
Yeah, 'cause up until now, it's just been this crazy fantasy.
Hey, guys, I've been doing some spring cleaning, and thought you might like some of Emma's old clothes for the baby.
Or you just didn't feel like doin' laundry.
Don't poke holes in this, you're getting free clothes.
I so don't have time for this.
All right, wish me luck.
Luck, I predict that thing will be gone before you hit the elevator.
Look at you, dude!
Your lips don't even move anymore when you're trying to read!
The sex of our baby is in this envelope and
Riley doesn't want to know what it is.
You'd wanna know if you were havin' a boy or a girl, right?
Hell, yeah.
Although I'd have been cool just knowing I was having a baby.
Why don't you open it?
Because I promised Riley I wouldn't.
Oh, right.
Sacred bond.
Gotcha.
Which is why I'll open it!
And if we get caught, we can blame it on Emma.
Honestly, it's one of the best parts about havin' a kid.
Oh!
Pregnancy brain.
What was I thinking?
And you were right.
Dude!
It never fails!
Sometimes I wonder if women can actually smell deceit.
We can.
♪ It's amazing how the unexpected ♪
♪ Can take your life and change direction ♪
Okay, Mrs. Wheeler, are you ready to head to the courthouse?
Do you mean am I ready to see the man of my dreams locked away?
Am I ready to be left alone, out in the cold with no one to turn to?
No!
No, I am not ready!
Oh, my God!
I can't lose him!
Mrs. Wheeler, calm down.
All right?
It is gonna be okay.
I know, I was just practicing for my big moment on the stand.
And if that doesn't sway the jury, then these babies definitely will.
Well, they didn't sway me to make you breakfast this morning.
Okay, all today is about is getting this thing postponed.
When Bustamonte fled the country,
I managed to get a box of his files seized at the border.
Box?
I mean, what's in the box?
Bank statements that will hopefully prove he is the real mastermind behind the whole scheme.
You're a genius!
But it hasn't arrived.
You're an idiot!
Mrs. Wheeler, this box is the only thing we have to prove Brad is innocent.
And, when I say innocent,
I mean only slightly guilty.
Well, I hope we get that old judge who erased all my parking tickets.
I only had to go to second base for him for that.
But I am willing to hit a home run, huh?
No.
No, no, no.
Well, unfortunately, we have Judge Johnson.
Yeah, soon to be known as Lady Justice.
This is her last trial before she leaves to star in her own TV show.
And now I'm interested.
And you weren't when it was just about my husband spending his life in jail?
Yeah, not so much.
But!
But I heard that Judge Johnson is gonna be the new face of daytime TV.
I was just gonna send her my head shot, but my real head would be better.
Look, you have to help me get in to see her.
Yeah, yeah, because it's not like Riley has anything better to do.
Um, I heard her defense, so, no, I don't think she does.
Okay, you know what?
Brad is gonna be fine.
I am going to win this case, and he is going to go free.
Okay.
Oh, God, even I don't believe me.
Let's go.
Oh, hey, babe.
I feel like I didn't give you a proper send-off.
I used to kiss your father like that.
He's gay now.
Can we go?
Let's do this!
Yeah, all right, you are not coming.
I know.
But if you see a dude there that looks like me, it's not.
You're just being racist.
Oh, come on.
Did you get it?
No, that bag was full of candy wrappers.
It's like a chocolate cemetery in there.
Brad.
You stay strong.
And know that if things don't go your way,
I will be right here beside you...
at least through the first appeal.
Have no fear, Lady Justice is here.
That little catchphrase is gonna make me a million dollars.
Uh, Ms. Perrin, I see here that you're petitioning to court to postpone this trial.
I...
I am, your honor.
I am just waiting on a box of evidence that will prove that my client...
Do you actually know what's in this box?
Oh, yes, completely.
Not one hundred percent exactly, no, but I have a very strong hunch.
Mm.
I had a hunch that leftover Indian food would make a good breakfast.
So much for hunches.
Petition denied.
So... good news.
We're going to trial.
Excuse me...
Who the hell are you?
Tucker Dobbs.
I hope you don't mind, I let myself in.
I do mind, but I think I know you.
You've been in my court before.
Guilty of breaking my heart, if I recall.
Uh... that's me.
Uh, first of all, I just want you to know that I am a huge fan of your work, and second, you need me.
What I need is a manicure, a mai tai, and a boy toy with an ass so tight I can bounce a quarter off of it.
Any chance you got change for a dollar?
Uh, no, no.
I meant you need me for your show.
I produced for the Mary Hart show for two years...
No, forget it, forget it.
I already got a pack of yappy producers telling' me what to do.
But what you don't have is a yappy on-air sidekick.
Right?
You know, feeding' you lines and makin' you look good.
Ooh.
I like lookin' good.
Okay.
Get yourself a uniform, I'll let you audition.
And...
And start thinking of some catchphrases.
Yeah, um...
You don't need to wear no pants, the robe decides what's de evidence.
- Yeah, but not that one.
- Yeah, okay.
Okay.
Here's how it's gonna go.
We'll intercept her in a neutral spot, the coffee shop on the corner of Wall and Chambers.
While she's focused on shoving a chocolate croissant down her gullet,
I'll surreptitiously extract the envelope, run across the road, photocopy the contents, and replace it before she even knows it went missing.
What do you think?
It honestly cannot be any simpler.
Something tells me it could be.
Look, do you want that envelope or not?
It's not like she's gonna walk in here and drop it in our laps.
That was a total crap cocktail with a double crap chaser!
Mrs. Wheeler, it really wasn't that bad.
I mean, honestly, I thought it was gonna be a lot worse.
Hey, and what are we supposed to do if we never get that box of so-called evidence?
Let Brad go to jail just because he broke a couple of stupid laws?
That is kind of how the system works.
Hey!
What are you two so excited about?
Oh, uh, we're both just really happy the trial's goin' so well.
It's not.
Then we should probably leave you alone to strategize, bye!
- Ready?
- Yes!
No, wait!
Okay, tell me.
Wait, no, don't tell me!
- I don't know...
- Oh-ho, too late!
What the hell is this?
Oh my God, it's not a boy or a girl?
What am I having?
It doesn't matter, I will love it anyway.
No, it's a phone number to something called the Baby Place, with a special code.
Oh, I forgot.
Yeah, we told the doctor to send the results to this baby shop that sends us a cake that's either blue or pink on the inside, so we can be surprised.

Not the idea, that was lame.
But now all you have to do is call the store.
We can't.
Only Riley can tell them where to deliver the cake.

Hey, yeah, like, this is Riley Perrin, and I've got, like, this cake, okay?
That was horrible.
Hi, this is Riley Perrin, wife of husband Danny Wheeler?
He's a hockey player.

What the hell is the matter with you two?
Oh, uh, we're trying to impersonate Riley so we can find out the sex of my baby.

All right, order in the court.
Put your papers away.

Riley, you have to do something.
I can't go back to jail!
I've already done my screw you tour of Cell Block C, plus I gave away my shampoo and my lucky shiv!
Brad, I am so sorry.
If only she'd allowed us to postpone, we wouldn't be...
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I have to go to the office, I will be right back.
What, what, what?
Bon-Bon, what am I gonna do?
Prison is such a cold and lonely place, and my life is so empty!
Even with the badminton tournament comin' up.
I know, I know.
Oh, my God.
Brad!
Brad!
We are completely alone.
No one came to take you back to lockup!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Well, I was thinking that my life is pretty much over, but sure, why not?
No, no, not now!
No.
No.
I'm busting you out of here.
Just put your head down and keep going until I say stop.
And if we make it out of here alive, get used to hearing that.
Problem solved!
The Baby Place said the baker is gone for the day but they'd send something else instead.

I don't even know what she wants!

Hey, she might know about the box but she obviously doesn't know that we're the ones who called.
I've got a box for a Riley Perrin.
I'm Riley!
It can be a boy's name, too.
Thank you.
See you later.
Okay, and you're sure they said it was coming here?
All right, I'll go check my apartment.
Hold on.
Riley Perrin?
Oh, my God, yes, thank you!
You saved my life!
- Mrs. Wheeler?
- Oh!
Riley!
Hi!
Um, I, um...
I just slipped in here to check on Emma.
I got it!
I got the box.
Brad's gonna go free!
What?
Really?
Oh, my God, Riley, that's amazing!
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God, I'm so happy!
Oh, my God!
Brad, what are you doing here?
Well, you know, it seemed like you were gonna lose, so...
So you broke him out?
You're right... she is totally not cool.
I know.
Lady Justice is in the house!
Call her up to sue your spouse!
Man, I'm killin' it out there!
I'm about to kill you in here.
What do you think you're doin' out there, upstaging me.
It's called the Lady Justice Show, not the Stupid, Wise-crackin' Sidekick Show.
Who'd ever watch a show with a dumb name like that?
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
I'll...
I'll pull it back.
Please.
I really need this job.
Finish up your day and then you're on your way.
Ooh, I like that.
Maybe I can work that in.
What?
Whoa!
That is...
Is that a quarter on the floor?
Oh, my God.
I'm bettin' right now you wish you'd done a few more squats.
Okay.
I'm gonna do it.
Wait, wait, wa.
Dude, dude, dude.
Now that it's here a second time, I feel like maybe we shouldn't open it.
And this is something you should be sharing with Riley.
And more importantly, it doesn't matter if it's a boy or a girl, just as long as it's healthy.
I don't care, I gotta know.
Wait.
What is this?
Luis Bustamonte?
Oh, no.
This is the box of evidence that Riley's been waiting for.
We've gotta get to the courthouse.
Okay, but if Riley finds out, I'm on the record for giving you that speech.
Yo, the judge is here.
Okay, let's put this gavel to the metal and get this trial started.
You want me to rap, you want me to rhyme, well, this is my courtroom and I ain't got the...
- Time?
- Oh, yeah.
I was gonna say that.
Look, help a sister out, I'll let you back in.
Really?
I can have the job?
Mm.
Hey, order in the court.
I'm back in the hizzy, she said I got the job, and you know y'all missed me.
Well, let's get this trainwreck over with.
Wait.
Where's the train?
Your Honor!
Your Honor, I'm here, and I've got it, I've got the box.
Oh.
And where's the defendant?
Here I am!
Here I am.
Sorry, I, uh, just dropped a contact.
You never know where they're gonna roll off to.
Your Honor, this box will show that Brad Walker is a relatively innocent man.
All right, I would like to present into evidence this...
- Riley!
- Oh, my God.
What is going on?
We're havin' a boy.
Oh, my God, we're havin' a boy!
We are?
Oh, my God, I'm so happy.
We're gonna have a son.
I love you.
A boy.
This is amazing!
Finally... someone will know my pain!
Well, this...
This all could not be sweeter.
But, um...
Hello!
I am on trial for my life here!
Oh, right, um...
Oh, I believe this one is yours.
Slight mix-up, all your fault.
Don't worry, you can apologize later.
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
It's all here.
It's all here!
Everything!
Names, dates, times proving that my client didn't do almost everything he was accused of, just, in your face!
Is where I would like to respectfully place these papers.
Okay.
Uh... well.
In light of this evidence, I have no choice but to set you free.
However, I cannot free you from these lunatics that you call family.
Ooh!
May God have mercy on your soul.
And with the new facts come to light, the strong defense wins the fight.
Our man Brad is free to go.
This is the Lady Justice Show, y'all.
- Well, cheers to you Riley.
- Thanks.
I am pretty proud of myself.
Though, no thanks to any of the idiots who live in this place.
You think they would be at least a little more supportive of someone who's nine months pregnant.
Well, unfortunately, I don't think this is gonna make them any more respectful.
Sadly, they get to take theirs off.
You get to take yours off in a few weeks.
Oh, who am I kidding?
You're probably never losing half of that.
What if it's sooner than a few weeks?
How much sooner?
Aah, like right now!
Oh God, I think I'm having a baby!
- Oh, my God!
- Now?
Now?
It's happening, she's having a baby!
Someone get the door!
Get the door!
Oh, my God!
And remember, whatever drugs they offer, take 'em!
Warlocks, vampires...
All the legends are true.
We protect the human world from the demon world.
You're a Shadowhunter, just like the rest of us.
I'm getting married to Lydia.
Maybe you should do what's in your heart.
I am your father, Clary...
And Jace's.
I need to talk to you.
I think I'm becoming a vampire.
Got a lot of stuff to work on here.
Like controlling my murderous tendencies.
The Mortal Cup is the most important object in the Shadow World.
Valentine has the Cup.
He'll create an army of Shadowhunters.
He'll kill thousands just creating the army.
Strike where your opponent is vulnerable.
He's here.
- Where's your brother?
- Stay away from her!
Simon!
Fight me, and watch your friends die.
- They make you weak.
- Jace...
Valentine is wrong.
- You're not like him.
- You don't know that, Clary.
You don't know that.
Jace...
Join me...
And my son!
Together, we can rid the world of the demons who plague it.
You are the new breed of Shadowhunters!
Jace...
Clary?
Clary.
- How did you get here?
- I Portaled in.
Come on, let's go.
We don't have much time.
- I can't.
- What?
Look, we got to get you out of here.
No, I'm not leaving without you.
My dear Clarissa.
- You are tenacious, aren't you?
- Stay back.
I killed him.
- Jace, come on.
Let's go.
- Valentine...
- We have to go, now!
- No!
Get 'em!
Miss me, son?
Jace!
What is this place?
Looks like a Downworld prison.
More like a zoo.
Where's the Portal?
Your skills may be unparalleled...
But your loyalty is sorely lacking.
String him up.
Any word from the Clave?
Not yet, and we've been trying for the past four hours.
- Something's up.
- Mmm, the Clave being unhelpful?
Who's shocked?
Show of hands?
I'm worried.
I can't sense Jace through our parabatai bond.
We'll find him, Alexander.
When we arrested Hodge, he said Valentine was on a ship.
They must still be over water.
Pull up the waterways around New York.
The ship couldn't have gone too far.
- Anything?
- Sorry.
There's got to be something!
I don't see him.
All right, listen up!
I want 24/7 monitoring of the Hudson and East Rivers.
If you see anything unusual, you come to me first.
I've got this, Alec.
Then why haven't you found Jace yet?
Don't forget who you're talking to.
I am still the head of this institute.
And my brother is still missing!
- Why don't you just take a break?
- Not now, Izzy.
Isabelle's right, and it's not a request.
You're dismissed.
Fine!
Hey...
Everybody, just back off!
Mom.
- My sweet girl!
- I never thought I'd see you again.
I'm so sorry.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
All I ever wanted to do was to protect you.
I know, but...
I'm not a kid anymore.
You don't have to protect me.
Yes, I do.
By telling me lies?
Clary...
It's my life.
I...
I had a right to know.
I was scared.
Because you married a psychopath...
My father.
So, you know.
- Mom, how could you?
- Oh, Clary.
Your father, he wasn't always like this.
- I deserved to know who I really am.
- I know.
And I promise from now on, no more lies.
Okay.
I have something for you.
Where did you get this?
Under the floorboards.
When I was a little kid and I couldn't sleep, I...
Used to watch you take it out and cry over it in your bedroom.
I used to think it was about my father, but now...
I know it's about my brother.
Jonathan.
His name is Jace.
He's alive.
That's impossible.
I'm sorry for how I reacted before.
It's not personal.
I get it.
I'm a lot to get used to.
I know what you're going through, Alexander.
No, I...
I don't think you do.
Jace is a part of me.
Through a rune, we are both physically and emotionally connected.
If he dies, a part of me dies, too.
And I know he's out there.
And he's in trouble, and there's not a damn thing I can do about it.
Tell me what I can do.
Help me track Jace.
I want to use our rune.
I just need your magic for the pain.
- I can't help you with this.
- Why not?
The last time you used a rune to track Jace, it almost killed you.
Why can't you just do this one thing?
After everything I've done for you.
You don't understand, I saw them burn.
Sorry, I just wanted to make sure everything was...
- Okay.
- Luke.
You all right?
Is it true?
Is Jonathan alive?
I couldn't believe it either at first.
Hey, guys.
- Simon.
- Hey, Mrs. F.
Good to see you on your feet again.
You look great...
Considering the coma situation.
What're you doing here?
Um...
It's kind of a long story.
So, um, a lot...
A lot happened while you were away.
- Yeah.
- Like what?
You're a vampire.
We have to get to the ops center, right now.
We are at war.
Valentine now has the Mortal Cup, with which he is, no doubt, raising a new army, and one of our own has joined him.
Looks like the queen's taking back her kingdom.
As a result, the Clave has declared a state of emergency at the Institute.
Their first priority is to replace the current leadership, who they have deemed wholly ineffectual.
It is an honor to introduce the newly appointed head of the New York Institute,
Clave representative, Victor Aldertree.
- Did you know about this?
- No.
But maybe this is why Dad went back to Idris.
Maryse went behind my back.
My fellow Shadowhunters.
It's an honor to be here with you all.
We have to find Jace Wayland.
He's a Shadowhunter, and we don't leave our people behind.
The answer to his location may very well lie in this room.
So, I wanna speak with everyone who went on a mission where Jace disappeared.
One last thing.
Effective immediately, the Institute is on lockdown.
But it's only temporary.
Let's turn this institute around.
Wait, if we're on lockdown, who's out there looking for Jace?
We'll think of something.
Don't worry.
Jace is tough.
Valentine will never break him.
Enough!
I killed you twice today.
You want to go for another round, huh?
You're a born fighter.
I like it.
Get dressed.
We have a lot to talk about.
You wanted to see me?
Yes, Clary.
Take a seat.
Sorry about the camera.
Like I told your friends when they came in, this is official business, so...
I have to be official.
Now...
Let's talk about Jace.
Okay.
You had the impression he was saving your lives by leaving with Valentine?
It's more than an impression.
It's what actually happened.
If he had tried anything, the rest of us would have been killed.
Was he within striking distance of Valentine?
I told you, it...
It...
Could he have taken the man out?
It was an impossible situation, okay?
Jace tried to warn us.
He told us Valentine was on the way.
So...
Jace knew ahead of time that Valentine was setting a trap.
- How do you suppose he knew that?
- I don't know.
He told us to get out of there.
Next thing I knew, I had a seraph blade to my throat.
Oh.
Got it.
Look, Jace saved our lives.
We have to find him.
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
Mmm.
Needs pecorino, hmm?
Do you remember your fifth birthday?
And I made you spaghetti?
Your absolute favorite.
Michael Wayland used to make me spaghetti.
Just try some.
You really think I want to have a meal with you?
Didn't I teach you not to play with knives?
Look, I know that head of yours is full of questions.
So, go ahead.
Don't be shy.
Why did you fake your death and pretend to be Michael Wayland?
To protect you from my enemies.
As Michael Wayland, I knew you'd be safe.
- Safe?
- Mmm-hmm.
You made me an orphan.
I spent my entire life mourning a father
I thought died in front of my eyes.
Well, it made you stronger, didn't it?
No, the Lightwoods made me strong.
They took me in, they trained me.
If anyone's my parents, they are.
I had no choice, Jonathan.
My enemies were closing in.
I sent you to a place where I knew you would be cared for.
Father of the year.
Look, we had ten years together, and sure...
I may have been hard on you, but...
It's because I loved you, son.
No.
All you've ever done is lie to me.
You told me I never had a mother.
What did you want me to say?
That I saved you and that your mother deserted you?
- She left you to die in Idris.
- What?
Why would she do that?
Because you're different.
You're special.
Look, I know that you have always felt more powerful than everyone else around you.
That's because you are.
You experimented on me?
I made you stronger, faster...
More lethal than any other Shadowhunter.
Why?
To create the perfect weapon, the ideal marriage of good and evil.
A Shadowhunter with pure demon blood.
Hey!
Hey!
Are you goin' home?
Where else would I be going?
My interview's over, and I'm exhausted.
Besides, at my house, there's steak and vodka.
I'd rather be there.
Wait, you're just...
You're not gonna help?
You really don't get it, do you?
You didn't risk anything for me, you did it for you.
What?
Are you seriously doing this right now?
Right now?
You know damn well I want to find Jace just as much as you do, but that's no excuse to treat me like...
Well, then, what do you want from me?
At the moment...
Nothing.
Who sounded the alarm?
- What's going on?
- Oh, no.
Jace.
Aldertree said he wanted to rescue Jace.
Actually, Clary, I said I wanted to find him.
And you gave me the clue I needed to do just that.
- What did you tell him?
- Alec, it...
Is this everyone?
Fantastic.
First up, all Downworlders are forbidden from entering the Institute without my prior approval.
For those still present, good day.
Mr. Graymark...
I'm not leaving Jocelyn.
Besides, my badge gives access to resources that you don't have.
I can help you find Jace.
That's generous of you, but I'm going to have to insist.
- Call me when you can.
- Yeah.
You, too...
Simon.
Simon, right?
It's almost dawn.
I don't have anywhere to go.
Hey, you're a smart guy.
I'm sure you'll figure something out.
Simon, come on.
I'll be okay.
Now...
Let's get to it.
I've reviewed your statements, along with the reports of your unsanctioned missions.
And I can come to no other conclusion that Jace Wayland is a traitor to the Clave.
Jace is not a traitor.
Point of fact.
Clary said Jace called to warn you about Valentine's trap, which got me thinking...
Jace had multiple chances to kill Valentine, but chose to let him leave.
Now, Valentine, Jace, and the Cup are missing.
Do the math.
There is no way we're going to help you hunt Jace.
And I'd never ask you to.
You and your friends are prohibited from any further involvement for the hunt for Jace Wayland.
What?
The rest of you, back to work.
I'm lifting the lockdown on the Institute, except for Clary and Jocelyn.
Given your relationship to Valentine and Jace,
I want to keep a close eye on you.
This is ridiculous!
- Clary...
- No!
We cannot just sit around.
Okay, they're going to kill Jace.
He's your son.
I know you think you understand this world, but you don't.
Dismissed!
You can't do this.
See, that's the thing about being the boss.
I can and I did.
Then revoke the dead-or-alive order.
Jace is one of us.
Challenging the authority of the head of the Institute is grounds for severe punishment, including de-runing.
Thanks for letting me crash here.
- You're a lifesaver.
- You can stay as long as you like.
I'll be at the station when you wake up tonight.
So, um, this...
This Aldertree guy...
He's got issues, right?
Aldertree's not the problem, the Clave is.
They're scared, so they're clamping down.
So, do you think it's true...
What they're saying about Jace?
That he's working with Valentine?
- I don't think so.
- I mean...
He could come for Clary next.
He's totally hung up on her.
So, are you worried about Jace?
Or maybe telling Clary how you feel?
Be bold, Simon.
I'm bold...
Adjacent.
I gotta take this. "Adjacent."
Garroway.
Bold.
I can totally be bold.
What's up, guys?
We know Luke said you could crash here...
But not here.
You don't want to touch me.
Encanto.
What the hell are you doing?
Encanto.
Um...
Encanto.
It's supposed to make you do whatever I tell you to.
You're the worst vampire ever.
Okay.
Welcome to your new home.
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Impressive, aren't they?
But they still don't have the inherent gifts that you have.
You took to a seraph blade the way a baby takes to a bottle.
What kind of a father experiments on his son with pure demon blood?
A father with perspective.
We both want the same thing.
To save this world from demons.
The Clave fights demons.
The Clave has grown soft...
Protecting Downworlders with the Accords.
All Downworlders, one day, will give in to their violent tendencies.
It's unavoidable.
Even a single drop of demon blood running in your veins, makes you a threat to humanity.
I...
I know plenty of Downworlders who play by the rules.
They control their urges.
You're thinking of Lucian Graymark, warlocks like Magnus Bane, and even...
Clarissa's little vampire friend Simon?
No matter how good they try to be,
Downworlders cannot control their demonic blood forever.
If that blood is so evil, why did you put it in me?
To fight fire with fire.
I wouldn't jump if I were you.
Why?
Because I'm your ultimate weapon?
This warlock is infamous for crimes against mundanes.
There's something else I want you to see.
- Come on, let's do this.
- Do what?
You seriously want to train right now?
We have to find Jace before Victor gets him killed.
Training's important.
So, pay attention to what I'm about to show you.
You need to watch your footwork.
Aldertree threatened to de-rune me if I tried to find Jace.
So, how do we get to him?
Let's go again.
Have you studied The Art of War?
That was not on the reading list at art school.
You should learn it.
Sun Tzu gives excellent advice.
Like what?
"Move swift as the Wind and closely-formed as the Wood.
"Attack like Fire."
But my favorite...
"To know your enemy, you must become your enemy."
I'm a quick study.
Alec.
Alec, slow down.
Where are you going?
Magnus'.
I couldn't just sit in there and not do anything.
He'll help me find my brother.
Jace is not your brother.
He's not your blood.
He's closer than blood.
He's my parabatai.
Alec, we looked like fools taking in Valentine's son, caring for him like our own.
It was the right thing to do.
It was a mistake.
It put our family in danger.
You need to forget Jace.
He made his choice.
Do you even hear what you're saying?
If you kill him, you kill a part of me.
When you have a cancer, you cut it out before it destroys you.
Son...
Life is full of hard choices.
Don't kid yourself.
You're not making a hard choice.
You're saving your own ass.
And unlike you, I don't push someone away just 'cause they're a hard choice.
Luke!
I need your help.
What, we on a first name basis now?
Man, get off my docks.
Oh, God, sorry.
In order to know my enemy, I had to become my enemy.
I had to get out of the Institute.
- Aldertree forbid me to leave.
What's with that guy?
I took one of Jace's gloves to try and track him, but it's not working.
Can you see if the police know anything?
Yeah, I'll contact the Coast Guard.
See what they know.
By the way, Simon's in the supply room.
- Simon's here?
- Yeah.
- I'll let you know what I find.
- Thank you.
Yeah.
Clary's safe.
She's with me.
I don't know how to do this.
I don't even know where to start.
You think there'd be some sort of handbook for the Shadow World, like...
Shadowhunting for Dummies.
Clary!
- Thank God I found you.
- Let me guess.
Luke called you.
And what are you even doing here?
You're not supposed to leave either.
I went to Aldertree and asked him to let me bring you back.
You told him?
I'm not going back...
I know.
I just said that so he would let me out.
I want to help you.
I'm here for you.
We need to find Jace, right?
Let's find him together.
I tried tracking him with the glove, but...
Let me show you something.
Give me your phone and stele.
Here are some basics of Shadowhunting.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom, open the door!
First rule of Shadowhunting, don't give anyone your phone or stele.
Thanks.
Magnus.
I'm not good at apologies...
But I'm...
I'm sorry.
Continue.
I'm...
Really sorry.
For?
Look, can you just cut that out for a second?
You were right.
When I called off my wedding, that was for me.
But this is all just...
It's very new.
This may surprise you, but you're new for me, too.
Look, with Jace missing, it's just like...
The ground has shifted, and I can't keep my balance.
Just...
I didn't mean to take it out on you.
I'm sorry.
You're forgiven.
Also...
You're great at apologies.
Thanks.
I've been working on it.

Here's the thing...
We're always going to face challenges.
So, when things get crazy, don't push me away.
Simon, your phone gets no cell service down here.
That's okay.
I think I'm making progress.
Simon, just stop.
Okay?
It's no use.
We're stuck down here.
I'm enjoying our together time.
Reminds me of 10th grade when we snuck into my mom's liquor cabinet.
Oh, God.
Oh, it was my first wicked hangover.
This is worse.
Mmm...
- It...
No, it's not.
- No...
- It's ridiculous.
- Oh...
How crazy our lives have gotten in the last few weeks.
Yeah.
You kill demons now.
Yeah.
I drink blood now.
And it used to be that...
The biggest problem we had was that...
I was secretly and totally...
- Here.
Track my mom with your phone.
- Yeah.
We don't have much time.
Hey.
You did it.
Yay for me.
All right, Alec, ready to track your parabatai?
I got them.
What just happened?
Did it start?
I don't need to.
I sense him.
He's on land.
We're stopping for pizza?
Reggie served the best pie in all of Brooklyn.
Note the past tense.
When Reggie's wife, Maria, turned into a vampire, she slaughtered Reggie and created a den inside.
What does this have to do with me?
You really think love will keep you from hurting your family and friends?
No matter how hard you fight it, demon blood will make you kill.
It starts in a small way.
Urges.
See, that's why you want Clary, and that is why you always will.
Everyone run.
Get out.
Out, now.
Hey, out!
Hey!
Which one of you is Maria?
Who's asking?
Jace is back.
Call off your men.
Izzy and I will bring him back alive.
One step ahead of you.
We got a hit on the map.
We're mobilizing now.
You're not listening.
Go ahead and de-rune me.
We won't let you do this.
Hold them here until we get back.
I'm sorry.
I'll do what I can to help Jace.
Pretty strong, even for a Shadowhunter.
You're feeding on innocent mundanes.
A girl's gotta eat.
- Your mom's close.
- Then run faster!
I'm a vampire.
I'm running slow for you.
You're done.
You're done.
- You can't kill me.
- Watch me.
I surrender to the authority of the Clave.
Aw, look at you.
You got your stick all ready to go and now you can't use it.
No, you broke the Accords.
You killed innocent mundanes.
And now, you're gonna die just like your friends.
But unlike them,
I'm no longer a threat.
I know my rights.
- Your rights?
- Yeah, my rights.
I might have broken the Accords, but I know you won't.
You don't know anything about me.
I know you're weak.
Mmm.
I can smell it.
And you'll do whatever the Clave tells you to do.
- Now, get off of me.
- Jonathan.
Are you going to let her mock you after what she did?
This thing in front of you...
She was once Reggie the pizza guy's sweet and loving wife.
You leave my husband out of this!
Whoa.
You mean the man you murdered?
You mean the man you devoured?
That's what you mean.
Ah, that's my boy.
No!
Run, Jonathan.
They want you dead.
Mom, stop!
What have you done?

We don't have much time.

- What?
Look, we got to get you out of here.
No, I'm not leaving without you.
My dear Clarissa.
- You are tenacious, aren't you?
- Stay back.
I killed him.
- Jace, come on.
Let's go.
- Valentine...
- We have to go, now!
- No!
Get 'em!
Miss me, son?
Jace!
What is this place?
Looks like a Downworld prison.
More like a zoo.
Where's the Portal?
Your skills may be unparalleled...
But your loyalty is sorely lacking.
String him up.
Any word from the Clave?
Not yet, and we've been trying for the past four hours.
- Something's up.
- The Clave being unhelpful?
Who's shocked?
Show of hands?
I'm worried.
I can't sense Jace through our parabatai bond.
We'll find him, Alexander.
When we arrested Hodge, he said Valentine was on a ship.
They must still be over water.
Pull up the waterways around New York.
The ship couldn't have gone too far.
- Anything?
- Sorry.
There's got to be something!
I don't see him.
All right, listen up!
I want 24/7 monitoring of the Hudson and East Rivers.
If you see anything unusual, you come to me first.
I've got this, Alec.
Then why haven't you found Jace yet?
Don't forget who you're talking to.
I am still the head of this institute.
And my brother is still missing!
- Why don't you just take a break?
- Not now, Izzy.
Isabelle's right, and it's not a request.
You're dismissed.
Fine!
Hey...
Everybody, just back off!
Mom.
- My sweet girl!
- I never thought I'd see you again.
I'm so sorry.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
All I ever wanted to do was to protect you.
I know, but...
I'm not a kid anymore.
You don't have to protect me.
Yes, I do.
By telling me lies?
Clary...
It's my life.
I...
I had a right to know.
I was scared.
Because you married a psychopath...
My father.
So, you know.
- Mom, how could you?
- Oh, Clary.
Your father, he wasn't always like this.
- I deserved to know who I really am.
- I know.
And I promise from now on, no more lies.
Okay.
I have something for you.
Where did you get this?
Under the floorboards.
When I was a little kid and I couldn't sleep, I...
Used to watch you take it out and cry over it in your bedroom.
I used to think it was about my father, but now...
I know it's about my brother.
Jonathan.
His name is Jace.
He's alive.
That's impossible.
I'm sorry for how I reacted before.
It's not personal.
I get it.
I'm a lot to get used to.
I know what you're going through, Alexander.
No, I...
I don't think you do.
Jace is a part of me.
Through a rune, we are both physically and emotionally connected.
If he dies, a part of me dies, too.
And I know he's out there.
And he's in trouble, and there's not a damn thing I can do about it.
Tell me what I can do.
Help me track Jace.
I want to use our rune.
I just need your magic for the pain.
- I can't help you with this.
- Why not?
The last time you used a rune to track Jace, it almost killed you.
Why can't you just do this one thing?
!
After everything I've done for you.!
You don't understand, I saw them burn.
Sorry, I just wanted to make sure everything was...
- Okay.
- Luke.
You all right?
Is it true?
Is Jonathan alive?
I couldn't believe it either at first.
Hey, guys.
- Simon.
- Hey, Mrs. F.
Good to see you on your feet again.
You look great...
Considering the coma situation.
What're you doing here?
It's kind of a long story.
So... a lot...
A lot happened while you were away.
- Yeah.
- Like what?
You're a vampire.
We have to get to the ops center, right now.
We are at war.
Valentine now has the Mortal Cup, with which he is, no doubt, raising a new army, and one of our own has joined him.
Looks like the queen's taking back her kingdom.
As a result, the Clave has declared a state of emergency at the Institute.
Their first priority is to replace the current leadership, who they have deemed wholly ineffectual.
It is an honor to introduce the newly appointed head of the New York Institute,
Clave representative, Victor Aldertree.
- Did you know about this?
- No.
But maybe this is why Dad went back to Idris.
Maryse went behind my back.
My fellow Shadowhunters.
It's an honor to be here with you all.
We have to find Jace Wayland.
He's a Shadowhunter, and we don't leave our people behind.
The answer to his location may very well lie in this room.
So, I wanna speak with everyone who went on a mission where Jace disappeared.
One last thing.
Effective immediately, the Institute is on lockdown.
But it's only temporary.
Let's turn this institute around.
Wait, if we're on lockdown, who's out there looking for Jace?
We'll think of something.
Don't worry.
Jace is tough.
Valentine will never break him.
Enough!
I killed you twice today.
You want to go for another round, huh?
You're a born fighter.
I like it.
Get dressed.
We have a lot to talk about.
You wanted to see me?
Yes, Clary.
Take a seat.
Sorry about the camera.
Like I told your friends when they came in, this is official business, so...
I have to be official.
Now...
Let's talk about Jace.
Okay.
You had the impression he was saving your lives by leaving with Valentine?
It's more than an impression.
It's what actually happened.
If he had tried anything, the rest of us would have been killed.
Was he within striking distance of Valentine?
I told you, it...
It...
Could he have taken the man out?
It was an impossible situation, okay?
Jace tried to warn us.
He told us Valentine was on the way.
So...
Jace knew ahead of time that Valentine was setting a trap.
- How do you suppose he knew that?
- I don't know.
He told us to get out of there.
Next thing I knew, I had a seraph blade to my throat.
Got it.
Look, Jace saved our lives.
We have to find him.
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
Needs pecorino?
Do you remember your fifth birthday?
And I made you spaghetti?
Your absolute favorite.
Michael Wayland used to make me spaghetti.
Just try some.
You really think I want to have a meal with you?
Didn't I teach you not to play with knives?
Look, I know that head of yours is full of questions.
So, go ahead.
Don't be shy.
Why did you fake your death and pretend to be Michael Wayland?
To protect you from my enemies.
As Michael Wayland, I knew you'd be safe.
Safe?
You made me an orphan.
I spent my entire life mourning a father
I thought died in front of my eyes.
Well, it made you stronger, didn't it?
No, the Lightwoods made me strong.
They took me in, they trained me.
If anyone's my parents, they are.
I had no choice, Jonathan.
My enemies were closing in.
I sent you to a place where I knew you would be cared for.
Father of the year.
Look, we had ten years together, and sure...
I may have been hard on you, but...
It's because I loved you, son.
No.
All you've ever done is lie to me.
You told me I never had a mother.
What did you want me to say?
That I saved you and that your mother deserted you?
- What?
- She left you to die in Idris.
Why would she do that?
Because you're different.
You're special.
Look, I know that you have always felt more powerful than everyone else around you.
That's because you are.
You experimented on me?
I made you stronger, faster...
More lethal than any other Shadowhunter.
Why?
To create the perfect weapon, the ideal marriage of good and evil.
A Shadowhunter with pure demon blood.
Hey!
Hey!
Are you goin' home?
Where else would I be going?
My interview's over, and I'm exhausted.
Besides, at my house, there's steak and vodka.
I'd rather be there.
Wait, you're just...
You're not gonna help?
You really don't get it, do you?
You didn't risk anything for me, you did it for you.
What?
Are you seriously doing this right now?
Right now?
You know damn well I want to find Jace just as much as you do, but that's no excuse to treat me like...
Well, then, what do you want from me?
!
At the moment...
Nothing.
Who sounded the alarm?
WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE
- What's going on?
- Oh, no.
Jace.
Aldertree said he wanted to rescue Jace.
Actually, Clary, I said I wanted to find him.
And you gave me the clue I needed to do just that.
- What did you tell him?
- Alec, it...
Is this everyone?
Fantastic.
First up, all Downworlders are forbidden from entering the Institute without my prior approval.
For those still present, good day.
Mr. Graymark...
I'm not leaving Jocelyn.
Besides, my badge gives access to resources that you don't have.
I can help you find Jace.
That's generous of you, but I'm going to have to insist.
- Call me when you can.
- Yeah.
You, too...
Simon.
Simon, right?
It's almost dawn.
I don't have anywhere to go.
Hey, you're a smart guy.
I'm sure you'll figure something out.
Simon, come on.
I'll be okay.
Now...
Let's get to it.
I've reviewed your statements, along with the reports of your unsanctioned missions.
And I can come to no other conclusion that Jace Wayland is a traitor to the Clave.
Jace is not a traitor.
Point of fact.
Clary said Jace called to warn you about Valentine's trap, which got me thinking...
Jace had multiple chances to kill Valentine, but chose to let him leave.
Now, Valentine, Jace, and the Cup are missing.
Do the math.
There is no way we're going to help you hunt Jace.
And I'd never ask you to.
You and your friends are prohibited from any further involvement for the hunt for Jace Wayland.
What?
The rest of you, back to work.
I'm lifting the lockdown on the Institute, except for Clary and Jocelyn.
Given your relationship to Valentine and Jace,
I want to keep a close eye on you.
This is ridiculous!
- Clary...
- No!
We cannot just sit around.
Okay, they're going to kill Jace.
He's your son.
I know you think you understand this world, but you don't.
Dismissed!
You can't do this.
See, that's the thing about being the boss.
I can and I did.
Then revoke the dead-or-alive order.
Jace is one of us.
Challenging the authority of the head of the Institute is grounds for severe punishment, including de-runing.
JADE WOLF CHINESE FOOD
Thanks for letting me crash here.
- You're a lifesaver.
- You can stay as long as you like.
I'll be at the station when you wake up tonight.
So... this...
This Aldertree guy...
He's got issues, right?
Aldertree's not the problem, the Clave is.
They're scared, so they're clamping down.
So, do you think it's true...
What they're saying about Jace?
That he's working with Valentine?
- I don't think so.
- I mean...
He could come for Clary next.
He's totally hung up on her.
So, are you worried about Jace?
Or maybe telling Clary how you feel?
Be bold, Simon.
I'm bold...
Adjacent.
I gotta take this. "Adjacent."
Garroway.
Bold.
I can totally be bold.
What's up, guys?
We know Luke said you could crash here...
But not here.
You don't want to touch me.
Encanto.
What the hell are you doing?
Encanto.
Encanto.
It's supposed to make you do whatever I tell you to.
You're the worst vampire ever.
Okay.
Welcome to your new home.
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Impressive, aren't they?
But they still don't have the inherent gifts that you have.
You took to a seraph blade the way a baby takes to a bottle.
What kind of a father experiments on his son with pure demon blood?
A father with perspective.
We both want the same thing.
To save this world from demons.
The Clave fights demons.
The Clave has grown soft...
Protecting Downworlders with the Accords.
All Downworlders, one day, will give in to their violent tendencies.
It's unavoidable.
Even a single drop of demon blood running in your veins, makes you a threat to humanity.
I...
I know plenty of Downworlders who play by the rules.
They control their urges.
You're thinking of Lucian Graymark, warlocks like Magnus Bane, and even...
Clarissa's little vampire friend Simon?
No matter how good they try to be,
Downworlders cannot control their demonic blood forever.
If that blood is so evil, why did you put it in me?
To fight fire with fire.
I wouldn't jump if I were you.
Why?
Because I'm your ultimate weapon?
This warlock is infamous for crimes against mundanes.
There's something else I want you to see.
- Come on, let's do this.
- Do what?
You seriously want to train right now?
We have to find Jace before Victor gets him killed.
Training's important.
So, pay attention to what I'm about to show you.
You need to watch your footwork.
Aldertree threatened to de-rune me if I tried to find Jace.
So, how do we get to him?
Let's go again.
Have you studied The Art of War?
That was not on the reading list at art school.
You should learn it.
Sun Tzu gives excellent advice.
Like what?
"Move swift as the Wind and closely-formed as the Wood.
"Attack like Fire."
But my favorite...
"To know your enemy, you must become your enemy."
I'm a quick study.
Alec.
Alec, slow down.
Where are you going?
Magnus'.
I couldn't just sit in there and not do anything.
He'll help me find my brother.
Jace is not your brother.
He's not your blood.
He's closer than blood.
He's my parabatai.
Alec, we looked like fools taking in Valentine's son, caring for him like our own.
It was the right thing to do.
It was a mistake.
It put our family in danger.
You need to forget Jace.
He made his choice.
Do you even hear what you're saying?
If you kill him, you kill a part of me.
When you have a cancer, you cut it out before it destroys you.
Son...
Life is full of hard choices.
Don't kid yourself.
You're not making a hard choice.
You're saving your own ass.
And unlike you, I don't push someone away just 'cause they're a hard choice.
Luke!
I need your help.
What, we on a first name basis now?
Man, get off my docks.
Oh, God, sorry.
In order to know my enemy, I had to become my enemy.
I had to get out of the Institute.
- Aldertree forbid me to leave.
- What's with that guy?
I took one of Jace's gloves to try and track him, but it's not working.
Can you see if the police know anything?
Yeah, I'll contact the Coast Guard.
See what they know.
By the way, Simon's in the supply room.
- Simon's here?
- Yeah.
- I'll let you know what I find.
- Thank you.
Yeah.
Clary's safe.
She's with me.
I don't know how to do this.
I don't even know where to start.
You think there'd be some sort of handbook for the Shadow World, like...
Shadowhunting for Dummies.
Clary!
- Thank God I found you.
- Let me guess.
Luke called you.
And what are you even doing here?
You're not supposed to leave either.
I went to Aldertree and asked him to let me bring you back.
You told him?
I'm not going back...
I know.
I just said that so he would let me out.
I want to help you.
I'm here for you.
We need to find Jace, right?
Let's find him together.
I tried tracking him with the glove, but...
Let me show you something.
Give me your phone and stele.
Here are some basics of Shadowhunting.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom, open the door!
First rule of Shadowhunting, don't give anyone your phone or stele.
Thanks.
Magnus.
I'm not good at apologies...
But I'm...
I'm sorry.
Continue.
I'm...
Really sorry.
For?
Look, can you just cut that out for a second?
You were right.
When I called off my wedding, that was for me.
But this is all just...
It's very new.
This may surprise you, but you're new for me, too.
Look, with Jace missing, it's just like...
The ground has shifted, and I can't keep my balance.
Just...
I didn't mean to take it out on you.
I'm sorry.
You're forgiven.
Also...
You're great at apologies.
Thanks.
I've been working on it.
Here's the thing...
We're always going to face challenges.
So, when things get crazy, don't push me away.
Simon, your phone gets no cell service down here.
That's okay.
I think I'm making progress.
Simon, just stop.
Okay?
It's no use.
We're stuck down here.
I'm enjoying our together time.
Reminds me of 10th grade when we snuck into my mom's liquor cabinet.
Oh, God.
Oh, it was my first wicked hangover.
This is worse.
- It...
No, it's not.
- No...
It's ridiculous.
How crazy our lives have gotten in the last few weeks.
Yeah.
You kill demons now.
Yeah.
I drink blood now.
And it used to be that...
The biggest problem we had was that...
I was secretly and totally...
- Here.
Track my mom with your phone.
- Yeah.
We don't have much time.
Hey.
You did it.
Yay for me.
All right, Alec, ready to track your parabatai?
I got them.
What just happened?
Did it start?
I don't need to.
I sense him.
He's on land.
We're stopping for pizza?
Reggie served the best pie in all of Brooklyn.
Note the past tense.
When Reggie's wife, Maria, turned into a vampire, she slaughtered Reggie and created a den inside.
What does this have to do with me?
You really think love will keep you from hurting your family and friends?
No matter how hard you fight it, demon blood will make you kill.
It starts in a small way.
Urges.
See, that's why you want Clary, and that is why you always will.
Hey.
Everyone run.
Get out.
Out, now.
Hey, out!
Hey!
Which one of you is Maria?
Who's asking?
Jace is back.
Call off your men.
Izzy and I will bring him back alive.
One step ahead of you.
We got a hit on the map.
We're mobilizing now.
You're not listening.
Go ahead and de-rune me.
We won't let you do this.
Hold them here until we get back.
I'm sorry.
I'll do what I can to help Jace.
Pretty strong, even for a Shadowhunter.
You're feeding on innocent mundanes.
A girl's gotta eat.
- Your mom's close.
- Then run faster!
I'm a vampire.
I'm running slow for you.
You're done.
You're done.
- You can't kill me.
- Watch me.
I surrender to the authority of the Clave.
Look at you.
You got your stick all ready to go and now you can't use it.
No, you broke the Accords.
You killed innocent mundanes.
And now, you're gonna die just like your friends.
But unlike them,
I'm no longer a threat.
I know my rights.
- Your rights?
- Yeah, my rights.
I might have broken the Accords, but I know you won't.
You don't know anything about me.
I know you're weak.
I can smell it.
And you'll do whatever the Clave tells you to do.
- Now, get off of me.!
- Jonathan.
Are you going to let her mock you after what she did?
This thing in front of you...
She was once Reggie the pizza guy's sweet and loving wife.
You leave my husband out of this!
You mean the man you murdered?
You mean the man you devoured?
That's what you mean.
That's my boy.
No!
Run, Jonathan.
They want you dead.
Mom, stop!
What have you done?
- (GROWLS) - (CLARY SCREAMS)
(DEMON SHRIEKING)
JACE:
Warlocks, vampires...
All the legends are true.
We protect the human world from the demon world.
You're a Shadowhunter, just like the rest of us.
ALEC:
I'm getting married to Lydia.
MAGNUS:
Maybe you should do what's in your heart.
I am your father, Clary...
And Jace's.
I need to talk to you.
I think I'm becoming a vampire.
Got a lot of stuff to work on here.
Like controlling my murderous tendencies.
JACE:
The Mortal Cup is the most important object in the Shadow World.
ALEC:
Valentine has the Cup.
He'll create an army of Shadowhunters.
ISABELLE:
He'll kill thousands just creating the army.
Strike where your opponent is vulnerable.
He's here.
- Where's your brother?
- Stay away from her!
ISABELLE:
Simon!
Fight me, and watch your friends die.
- They make you weak.
- Jace... (VOICE BREAKING) Valentine is wrong.
- You're not like him.
- You don't know that, Clary.
You don't know that.
Jace...
Join me...
And my son!
Together, we can rid the world of the demons who plague it.
You are the new breed of Shadowhunters!
(FAINT CHEERING)
CLARY:
Jace...
Clary?
Clary.
- How did you get here?
- I Portaled in.
Come on, let's go.
We don't have much time.
- I can't.
- What?
Look, we got to get you out of here.
No, I'm not leaving without you.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
My dear Clarissa.
- You are tenacious, aren't you?
- Stay back.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
(BOTH CONTINUE GRUNTING)
(GRUNTS)
(PANTING)
I killed him.
- Jace, come on.
Let's go.
- MAN:
Valentine...
- We have to go, now!
- No!
Get 'em!

Miss me, son?

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
ISABELLE:
Any word from the Clave?
LYDIA:
Not yet, and we've been trying for the past four hours.
- Something's up.
- Mmm, the Clave being unhelpful?
Who's shocked?
Show of hands?
I'm worried.
I can't sense Jace through our parabatai bond.
We'll find him, Alexander.
When we arrested Hodge, he said Valentine was on a ship.
They must still be over water.
Pull up the waterways around New York.
The ship couldn't have gone too far.
- Anything?
- Sorry.
There's got to be something!
I don't see him.
All right, listen up!
I want 24/7 monitoring of the Hudson and East Rivers.
If you see anything unusual, you come to me first.
I've got this, Alec.
Then why haven't you found Jace yet?
Don't forget who you're talking to.
I am still the head of this institute.
And my brother is still missing!
- Why don't you just take a break?
- Not now, Izzy.
Isabelle's right, and it's not a request.
You're dismissed.
Fine!
Hey...
Everybody, just back off!
Mom.
(SIGHS)
- My sweet girl!
- I never thought I'd see you again.
I'm so sorry.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
All I ever wanted to do was to protect you.
I know, but...
I'm not a kid anymore.
You don't have to protect me.
Yes, I do.
By telling me lies?
Clary...
It's my life.
I...
I had a right to know.
I was scared.
Because you married a psychopath...
My father.
So, you know.
- Mom, how could you?
- Oh, Clary.
Your father, he wasn't always like this.
- I deserved to know who I really am.
- I know.
And I promise from now on, no more lies.
Okay.
I have something for you.
JOCELYN:
Where did you get this?
Under the floorboards.
When I was a little kid and I couldn't sleep, I...
Used to watch you take it out and cry over it in your bedroom.
I used to think it was about my father, but now...
I know it's about my brother.
Jonathan.
His name is Jace.
He's alive.
That's impossible.
I'm sorry for how I reacted before.
It's not personal.
I get it.
I'm a lot to get used to.
I know what you're going through, Alexander.
(STAMMERS) No, I...
I don't think you do.
Jace is a part of me.
Through a rune, we are both physically and emotionally connected.
If he dies, a part of me dies, too.
And I know he's out there.
And he's in trouble, and there's not a damn thing I can do about it.
Tell me what I can do.
Help me track Jace.
I want to use our rune.
I just need your magic for the pain.
- I can't help you with this.
- Why not?
The last time you used a rune to track Jace, it almost killed you.
Why can't you just do this one thing?
After everything I've done for you.
You don't understand, I saw them burn.
Sorry, I just wanted to make sure everything was...
- Okay.
- Luke.
You all right?
Is it true?
Is Jonathan alive?
I couldn't believe it either at first.
SIMON:
Hey, guys.
- Simon.
- SIMON:
Hey, Mrs. F.
Good to see you on your feet again.
You look great...
Considering the coma situation.
What're you doing here?
Um...
It's kind of a long story.
So, um, a lot...
A lot happened while you were away.
- Yeah.
- Like what?
You're a vampire.
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)
We have to get to the ops center, right now.
We are at war.
Valentine now has the Mortal Cup, with which he is, no doubt, raising a new army, and one of our own has joined him.
Looks like the queen's taking back her kingdom.
As a result, the Clave has declared a state of emergency at the Institute.
Their first priority is to replace the current leadership, who they have deemed wholly ineffectual.
It is an honor to introduce the newly appointed head of the New York Institute,

It's an honor to be here with you all.
We have to find Jace Wayland.

VALENTINE:
Enough!
(JACE PANTING)
I killed you twice today.
You want to go for another round, huh?
You're a born fighter.
I like it.
Get dressed.
We have a lot to talk about.
- CLARY:
You wanted to see me?
- (DOOR CLOSES)
Yes, Clary.
Take a seat.
Sorry about the camera.
Like I told your friends when they came in, this is official business, so...
I have to be official.
- (REMOTE BEEPS)
- Now...
Let's talk about Jace.
Okay.
You had the impression he was saving your lives by leaving with Valentine?
It's more than an impression.
It's what actually happened.
If he had tried anything, the rest of us would have been killed.
Was he within striking distance of Valentine?
I told you, it...
It...
Could he have taken the man out?
It was an impossible situation, okay?
Jace tried to warn us.
He told us Valentine was on the way.
So...
Jace knew ahead of time that Valentine was setting a trap.
- How do you suppose he knew that?
- I don't know.
He told us to get out of there.
Next thing I knew, I had a seraph blade to my throat.
Oh.
Got it.
Look, Jace saved our lives.
We have to find him.
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
Mmm.
Needs pecorino, hmm?
Do you remember your fifth birthday?
And I made you spaghetti?
Your absolute favorite.
Michael Wayland used to make me spaghetti.
Just try some.
You really think I want to have a meal with you?
(SIGHS)
Didn't I teach you not to play with knives?
Look, I know that head of yours is full of questions.
So, go ahead.
Don't be shy.
Why did you fake your death and pretend to be Michael Wayland?
To protect you from my enemies.
As Michael Wayland, I knew you'd be safe.
- Safe?
- Mmm-hmm.
You made me an orphan.
I spent my entire life mourning a father
I thought died in front of my eyes.
Well, it made you stronger, didn't it?
No, the Lightwoods made me strong.
They took me in, they trained me.
If anyone's my parents, they are.
I had no choice, Jonathan.
My enemies were closing in.
I sent you to a place where I knew you would be cared for.
Father of the year.
Look, we had ten years together, and sure... (INHALES SHARPLY)
I may have been hard on you, but...
It's because I loved you, son.
No.
All you've ever done is lie to me.
You told me I never had a mother.
What did you want me to say?
That I saved you and that your mother deserted you?
- She left you to die in Idris.
- What?
Why would she do that?
Because you're different.
You're special.
Look, I know that you have always felt more powerful than everyone else around you.
That's because you are.
(GRUNTS)
(GASPS AND PANTS)
You experimented on me?
I made you stronger, faster...
More lethal than any other Shadowhunter.
Why?
To create the perfect weapon, the ideal marriage of good and evil.
A Shadowhunter with pure demon blood.
Hey!
Hey!
Are you goin' home?
Where else would I be going?
My interview's over, and I'm exhausted.
Besides, at my house, there's steak and vodka.
I'd rather be there.
Wait, you're just...
You're not gonna help?
You really don't get it, do you?
You didn't risk anything for me, you did it for you.
What?
(STUTTERS)
Are you seriously doing this right now?
Right now?
You know damn well I want to find Jace just as much as you do, but that's no excuse to treat me like...
Well, then, what do you want from me?
At the moment...
Nothing.
(ALARM BLARING)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
ALEC:
Who sounded the alarm?
- What's going on?
- Oh, no.
CLARY:
Jace.
(ALARM CONTINUES BLARING)
Aldertree said he wanted to rescue Jace.
Actually, Clary, I said I wanted to find him.
And you gave me the clue I needed to do just that.
- What did you tell him?
- Alec, it...
ALDERTREE:
Is this everyone?
Fantastic.
First up, all Downworlders are forbidden from entering the Institute without my prior approval.
For those still present, good day.
Mr. Graymark...
I'm not leaving Jocelyn.
Besides, my badge gives access to resources that you don't have.
I can help you find Jace.
That's generous of you, but I'm going to have to insist.
- LUKE:
Call me when you can.
- Yeah.
You, too...
Simon.
Simon, right?
It's almost dawn.
I don't have anywhere to go.
Hey, you're a smart guy.
I'm sure you'll figure something out.
Simon, come on.
(WHISPERS) I'll be okay.
(ALDERTREE CLAPS) Now...
Let's get to it.
I've reviewed your statements, along with the reports of your unsanctioned missions.
And I can come to no other conclusion that Jace Wayland is a traitor to the Clave.
Jace is not a traitor.
Point of fact.
Clary said Jace called to warn you about Valentine's trap, which got me thinking...
Jace had multiple chances to kill Valentine, but chose to let him leave.
Now, Valentine, Jace, and the Cup are missing.
Do the math.
There is no way we're going to help you hunt Jace.
And I'd never ask you to.
You and your friends are prohibited from any further involvement for the hunt for Jace Wayland.
What?
The rest of you, back to work.
I'm lifting the lockdown on the Institute, except for Clary and Jocelyn.
Given your relationship to Valentine and Jace,
I want to keep a close eye on you.
(INDISTINCT MURMURING)
This is ridiculous!
- Clary...
- No!
We cannot just sit around.
Okay, they're going to kill Jace.
He's your son.
I know you think you understand this world, but you don't.
Dismissed!
You can't do this.
See, that's the thing about being the boss.
I can and I did.
ISABELLE:
Then revoke the dead-or-alive order.
Jace is one of us.
Challenging the authority of the head of the Institute is grounds for severe punishment, including de-runing.
Thanks for letting me crash here.
- You're a lifesaver.
- You can stay as long as you like.
I'll be at the station when you wake up tonight.
So, um, this...
This Aldertree guy...
He's got issues, right?
Aldertree's not the problem, the Clave is.
They're scared, so they're clamping down.
So, do you think it's true...
What they're saying about Jace?
That he's working with Valentine?
- I don't think so.
- I mean...
He could come for Clary next.
He's totally hung up on her.
So, are you worried about Jace?
Or maybe telling Clary how you feel?
Be bold, Simon.
I'm bold...
Adjacent.
(BOTH CHUCKLING)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
I gotta take this. "Adjacent."
- (CELL PHONE BEEPS)
- Garroway.
(SCOFFS) Bold.
I can totally be bold.
What's up, guys?
We know Luke said you could crash here...
But not here.
You don't want to touch me.
Encanto.
What the hell are you doing?
Encanto.
Um...
Encanto.
It's supposed to make you do whatever I tell you to.
You're the worst vampire ever.
(GRUNTS) Okay.
Welcome to your new home.
(DOOR SLAMS)
(SIGHS)
(SIGHS)
MAN: (SHOUTING) Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
(SHOUTING CONTINUES)
VALENTINE:
Impressive, aren't they?
But they still don't have the inherent gifts that you have.
You took to a seraph blade the way a baby takes to a bottle.
What kind of a father experiments on his son with pure demon blood?
A father with perspective.
We both want the same thing.
To save this world from demons.
The Clave fights demons.
The Clave has grown soft...
Protecting Downworlders with the Accords.
All Downworlders, one day, will give in to their violent tendencies.
It's unavoidable.
Even a single drop of demon blood running in your veins, makes you a threat to humanity.
I...
I know plenty of Downworlders who play by the rules.
They control their urges.
You're thinking of Lucian Graymark, warlocks like Magnus Bane, and even...
Clarissa's little vampire friend Simon?
No matter how good they try to be,
Downworlders cannot control their demonic blood forever.
If that blood is so evil, why did you put it in me?
To fight fire with fire.
(SHOUTING CONTINUES)
I wouldn't jump if I were you.
Why?
Because I'm your ultimate weapon?
(MAN SHOUTING)
(SCREAMING)
This warlock is infamous for crimes against mundanes.
There's something else I want you to see.
- Come on, let's do this.
- Do what?
You seriously want to train right now?
We have to find Jace before Victor gets him killed.
Training's important.
So, pay attention to what I'm about to show you.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
You need to watch your footwork.
Aldertree threatened to de-rune me if I tried to find Jace.
So, how do we get to him?
Let's go again.
(GRUNTING)
Have you studied The Art of War?
That was not on the reading list at art school.
You should learn it.
Sun Tzu gives excellent advice.
(CLARY GRUNTING)
Like what?
"Move swift as the Wind and closely-formed as the Wood.
"Attack like Fire."
But my favorite...
"To know your enemy, you must become your enemy."
(BOTH GRUNT)
I'm a quick study.
MARYSE:
Alec.
Alec, slow down.
Where are you going?
Magnus'.
I couldn't just sit in there and not do anything.
He'll help me find my brother.
Jace is not your brother.
He's not your blood.
He's closer than blood.
He's my parabatai.
Alec, we looked like fools taking in Valentine's son, caring for him like our own.
It was the right thing to do.
It was a mistake.
It put our family in danger.
(SIGHS) You need to forget Jace.
He made his choice.
Do you even hear what you're saying?
If you kill him, you kill a part of me.
When you have a cancer, you cut it out before it destroys you.
Son...
Life is full of hard choices.
(SCOFFS) Don't kid yourself.
You're not making a hard choice.
You're saving your own ass.
And unlike you, I don't push someone away just 'cause they're a hard choice.
Luke!
I need your help.
What, we on a first name basis now?
Man, get off my docks.
(CHUCKLES) Oh, God, sorry.
In order to know my enemy, I had to become my enemy.
I had to get out of the Institute.
- Aldertree forbid me to leave.
What's with that guy?
I took one of Jace's gloves to try and track him, but it's not working.
Can you see if the police know anything?
Yeah, I'll contact the Coast Guard.
See what they know.
By the way, Simon's in the supply room.
- Simon's here?
- Yeah.
- I'll let you know what I find.
- Thank you.
Yeah.
Clary's safe.
She's with me.
(SIGHS) I don't know how to do this.
I don't even know where to start.
You think there'd be some sort of handbook for the Shadow World, like...
Shadowhunting for Dummies.
Clary!
- Thank God I found you.
- CLARY:
Let me guess.
Luke called you.
And what are you even doing here?
You're not supposed to leave either.
I went to Aldertree and asked him to let me bring you back.
You told him?
I'm not going back...
I know.
I just said that so he would let me out.
I want to help you.
I'm here for you.
We need to find Jace, right?
Let's find him together.
I tried tracking him with the glove, but...
Let me show you something.
Give me your phone and stele.
Here are some basics of Shadowhunting.
Mom!
CLARY:
Mom!
Mom, open the door!
First rule of Shadowhunting, don't give anyone your phone or stele.
- Thanks.
- (CLICKS TONGUE)
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
Magnus.
I'm not good at apologies...
But I'm...
I'm sorry.
Continue.
I'm...
Really sorry.
For?
Look, can you just cut that out for a second?
You were right.
When I called off my wedding, that was for me.
But this is all just...
It's very new.
This may surprise you, but you're new for me, too.
Look, with Jace missing, it's just like...
The ground has shifted, and I can't keep my balance.
Just...
I didn't mean to take it out on you.
I'm sorry.
You're forgiven.
Also...
You're great at apologies.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
(INHALES DEEPLY) Thanks.
I've been working on it.
Here's the thing...
We're always going to face challenges.
So, when things get crazy, don't push me away.
(DOOR THUDS)
Simon, your phone gets no cell service down here.
That's okay.
I think I'm making progress.
Simon, just stop.
Okay?
It's no use.
We're stuck down here.
(SIMON GRUNTS)
(CLARY SIGHS)
- I'm enjoying our together time.
- (CHUCKLES)
Reminds me of 10th grade when we snuck into my mom's liquor cabinet.
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)
- Oh, God.
Oh, it was my first wicked hangover.
- (LAUGHS) - (GROANS)
This is worse.
Mmm...
- It...
No, it's not.
- No... (BOTH LAUGHING)
- It's ridiculous.
- Oh...
How crazy our lives have gotten in the last few weeks.
Yeah.
You kill demons now.
Yeah.
I drink blood now.
And it used to be that...
The biggest problem we had was that...
I was secretly and totally... (CREAKS)
- Here.
Track my mom with your phone.
- Yeah.
- We don't have much time.
- (CELL PHONE BEEPS)
Hey.
You did it.
(CHUCKLES)
Yay for me.
MAGNUS:
All right, Alec, ready to track your parabatai?
(ENERGY PULSATING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
- (RAPID BEEPING)
- I got them.
MAGNUS:
What just happened?
Did it start?
I don't need to.
I sense him.
He's on land.
JACE:
We're stopping for pizza?
Reggie served the best pie in all of Brooklyn.
Note the past tense. (INHALES SHARPLY)
When Reggie's wife, Maria, turned into a vampire, she slaughtered Reggie and created a den inside.
What does this have to do with me?
You really think love will keep you from hurting your family and friends?
No matter how hard you fight it, demon blood will make you kill.
It starts in a small way.
Urges.
See, that's why you want Clary, and that is why you always will.

(GRUNTS)
Jace is back.
Call off your men.
Izzy and I will bring him back alive.
One step ahead of you.
We got a hit on the map.
We're mobilizing now.
You're not listening.
Go ahead and de-rune me.
We won't let you do this.
Hold them here until we get back.
I'm sorry.
I'll do what I can to help Jace.

- Then run faster!
I'm a vampire.
I'm running slow for you.
(GRUNTS)
(SNARLING)
You're done.
You're done.
- You can't kill me.
- Watch me.
I surrender to the authority of the Clave.
(GRUNTS)
(LAUGHING)
Aw, look at you.
You got your stick all ready to go and now you can't use it.
No, you broke the Accords.
You killed innocent mundanes.
And now, you're gonna die just like your friends.
But unlike them,
I'm no longer a threat.
I know my rights.
- Your rights?
- Yeah, my rights.
I might have broken the Accords, but I know you won't.
You don't know anything about me.
I know you're weak.
(SNIFFING) Mmm.
I can smell it.
And you'll do whatever the Clave tells you to do.
- Now, get off of me.
- Jonathan.
Are you going to let her mock you after what she did?
This thing in front of you...
She was once Reggie the pizza guy's sweet and loving wife.
You leave my husband out of this!
Whoa.
You mean the man you murdered?
You mean the man you devoured?
That's what you mean.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
- (SNARLS) - (GRUNTS)
Ah, that's my boy.
(GASPS)
(GROANS)
No!
Run, Jonathan.
They want you dead.
Mom, stop!
(PANTING)
What have you done?
Warlocks, vampires...
All the legends are true.
We protect the human world from the demon world.
You're a Shadowhunter, just like the rest of us.
I'm getting married to Lydia.
Maybe you should do what's in your heart.
I am your father, Clary...
And Jace's.
I need to talk to you.
I think I'm becoming a vampire.
Got a lot of stuff to work on here.
Like controlling my murderous tendencies.
The Mortal Cup is the most important object in the Shadow World.
Valentine has the Cup.
He'll create an army of Shadowhunters.
He'll kill thousands just creating the army.
Strike where your opponent is vulnerable.
He's here.
- Where's your brother?
- Stay away from her!
Simon!
Fight me, and watch your friends die.
- They make you weak.
- Jace...
Valentine is wrong.
- You're not like him.
- You don't know that, Clary.
You don't know that.
Jace...
Join me...
And my son!
Together, we can rid the world of the demons who plague it.
You are the new breed of Shadowhunters!
Jace...
Clary?
Clary.
- How did you get here?
- I Portaled in.
Come on, let's go.
We don't have much time.
- I can't.
- What?
Look, we got to get you out of here.
No, I'm not leaving without you.
My dear Clarissa.
- You are tenacious, aren't you?
- Stay back.
I killed him.
- Jace, come on.
Let's go.
- Valentine...
- We have to go, now!
- No!
Get 'em!
Miss me, son?
Jace!
What is this place?
Looks like a Downworld prison.
More like a zoo.
Where's the Portal?
Your skills may be unparalleled...
But your loyalty is sorely lacking.
String him up.
Any word from the Clave?
Not yet, and we've been trying for the past four hours.
- Something's up.
- Mmm, the Clave being unhelpful?
Who's shocked?
Show of hands?
I'm worried.
I can't sense Jace through our parabatai bond.
We'll find him, Alexander.
When we arrested Hodge, he said Valentine was on a ship.
They must still be over water.
Pull up the waterways around New York.
The ship couldn't have gone too far.
- Anything?
- Sorry.
There's got to be something!
I don't see him.
All right, listen up!
I want 24/7 monitoring of the Hudson and East Rivers.
If you see anything unusual, you come to me first.
I've got this, Alec.
Then why haven't you found Jace yet?
Don't forget who you're talking to.
I am still the head of this institute.
And my brother is still missing!
- Why don't you just take a break?
- Not now, Izzy.
Isabelle's right, and it's not a request.
You're dismissed.
Fine!
Hey...
Everybody, just back off!
Mom.
- My sweet girl!
- I never thought I'd see you again.
I'm so sorry.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
All I ever wanted to do was to protect you.
I know, but...
I'm not a kid anymore.
You don't have to protect me.
Yes, I do.
By telling me lies?
Clary...
It's my life.
I...
I had a right to know.
I was scared.
Because you married a psychopath...
My father.
So, you know.
- Mom, how could you?
- Oh, Clary.
Your father, he wasn't always like this.
- I deserved to know who I really am.
- I know.
And I promise from now on, no more lies.
Okay.
I have something for you.
Where did you get this?
Under the floorboards.
When I was a little kid and I couldn't sleep, I...
Used to watch you take it out and cry over it in your bedroom.
I used to think it was about my father, but now...
I know it's about my brother.
Jonathan.
His name is Jace.
He's alive.
That's impossible.
I'm sorry for how I reacted before.
It's not personal.
I get it.
I'm a lot to get used to.
I know what you're going through, Alexander.
No, I...
I don't think you do.
Jace is a part of me.
Through a rune, we are both physically and emotionally connected.
If he dies, a part of me dies, too.
And I know he's out there.
And he's in trouble, and there's not a damn thing I can do about it.
Tell me what I can do.
Help me track Jace.
I want to use our rune.
I just need your magic for the pain.
- I can't help you with this.
- Why not?
The last time you used a rune to track Jace, it almost killed you.
Why can't you just do this one thing?
After everything I've done for you.
You don't understand, I saw them burn.
Sorry, I just wanted to make sure everything was...
- Okay.
- Luke.
You all right?
Is it true?
Is Jonathan alive?
I couldn't believe it either at first.
Hey, guys.
- Simon.
- Hey, Mrs. F.
Good to see you on your feet again.
You look great...
Considering the coma situation.
What're you doing here?
Um...
It's kind of a long story.
So, um, a lot...
A lot happened while you were away.
- Yeah.
- Like what?
You're a vampire.
We have to get to the ops center, right now.
We are at war.
Valentine now has the Mortal Cup, with which he is, no doubt, raising a new army, and one of our own has joined him.
Looks like the queen's taking back her kingdom.
As a result, the Clave has declared a state of emergency at the Institute.
Their first priority is to replace the current leadership, who they have deemed wholly ineffectual.
It is an honor to introduce the newly appointed head of the New York Institute,
Clave representative, Victor Aldertree.
- Did you know about this?
- No.
But maybe this is why Dad went back to Idris.
Maryse went behind my back.
My fellow Shadowhunters.
It's an honor to be here with you all.
We have to find Jace Wayland.
He's a Shadowhunter, and we don't leave our people behind.
The answer to his location may very well lie in this room.
So, I wanna speak with everyone who went on a mission where Jace disappeared.
One last thing.
Effective immediately, the Institute is on lockdown.
But it's only temporary.
Let's turn this institute around.
Wait, if we're on lockdown, who's out there looking for Jace?
We'll think of something.
Don't worry.
Jace is tough.
Valentine will never break him.
Enough!
I killed you twice today.
You want to go for another round, huh?
You're a born fighter.
I like it.
Get dressed.
We have a lot to talk about.
You wanted to see me?
Yes, Clary.
Take a seat.
Sorry about the camera.
Like I told your friends when they came in, this is official business, so...
I have to be official.
Now...
Let's talk about Jace.
Okay.
You had the impression he was saving your lives by leaving with Valentine?
It's more than an impression.
It's what actually happened.
If he had tried anything, the rest of us would have been killed.
Was he within striking distance of Valentine?
I told you, it...
It...
Could he have taken the man out?
It was an impossible situation, okay?
Jace tried to warn us.
He told us Valentine was on the way.
So...
Jace knew ahead of time that Valentine was setting a trap.
- How do you suppose he knew that?
- I don't know.
He told us to get out of there.
Next thing I knew, I had a seraph blade to my throat.
Oh.
Got it.
Look, Jace saved our lives.
We have to find him.
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
Mmm.
Needs pecorino, hmm?
Do you remember your fifth birthday?
And I made you spaghetti?
Your absolute favorite.
Michael Wayland used to make me spaghetti.
Just try some.
You really think I want to have a meal with you?
Didn't I teach you not to play with knives?
Look, I know that head of yours is full of questions.
So, go ahead.
Don't be shy.
Why did you fake your death and pretend to be Michael Wayland?
To protect you from my enemies.
As Michael Wayland, I knew you'd be safe.
- Safe?
- Mmm-hmm.
You made me an orphan.
I spent my entire life mourning a father
I thought died in front of my eyes.
Well, it made you stronger, didn't it?
No, the Lightwoods made me strong.
They took me in, they trained me.
If anyone's my parents, they are.
I had no choice, Jonathan.
My enemies were closing in.
I sent you to a place where I knew you would be cared for.
Father of the year.
Look, we had ten years together, and sure...
I may have been hard on you, but...
It's because I loved you, son.
No.
All you've ever done is lie to me.
You told me I never had a mother.
What did you want me to say?
That I saved you and that your mother deserted you?
- She left you to die in Idris.
- What?
Why would she do that?
Because you're different.
You're special.
Look, I know that you have always felt more powerful than everyone else around you.
That's because you are.
You experimented on me?
I made you stronger, faster...
More lethal than any other Shadowhunter.
Why?
To create the perfect weapon, the ideal marriage of good and evil.
A Shadowhunter with pure demon blood.
Hey!
Hey!
Are you goin' home?
Where else would I be going?
My interview's over, and I'm exhausted.
Besides, at my house, there's steak and vodka.
I'd rather be there.
Wait, you're just...
You're not gonna help?
You really don't get it, do you?
You didn't risk anything for me, you did it for you.
What?
Are you seriously doing this right now?
Right now?
You know damn well I want to find Jace just as much as you do, but that's no excuse to treat me like...
Well, then, what do you want from me?
At the moment...
Nothing.
Who sounded the alarm?
- What's going on?
- Oh, no.
Jace.
Aldertree said he wanted to rescue Jace.
Actually, Clary, I said I wanted to find him.
And you gave me the clue I needed to do just that.
- What did you tell him?
- Alec, it...
Is this everyone?
Fantastic.
First up, all Downworlders are forbidden from entering the Institute without my prior approval.
For those still present, good day.
Mr. Graymark...
I'm not leaving Jocelyn.
Besides, my badge gives access to resources that you don't have.
I can help you find Jace.
That's generous of you, but I'm going to have to insist.
- Call me when you can.
- Yeah.
You, too...
Simon.
Simon, right?
It's almost dawn.
I don't have anywhere to go.
Hey, you're a smart guy.
I'm sure you'll figure something out.
Simon, come on.
I'll be okay.
Now...
Let's get to it.
I've reviewed your statements, along with the reports of your unsanctioned missions.
And I can come to no other conclusion that Jace Wayland is a traitor to the Clave.
Jace is not a traitor.
Point of fact.
Clary said Jace called to warn you about Valentine's trap, which got me thinking...
Jace had multiple chances to kill Valentine, but chose to let him leave.
Now, Valentine, Jace, and the Cup are missing.
Do the math.
There is no way we're going to help you hunt Jace.
And I'd never ask you to.
You and your friends are prohibited from any further involvement for the hunt for Jace Wayland.
What?
The rest of you, back to work.
I'm lifting the lockdown on the Institute, except for Clary and Jocelyn.
Given your relationship to Valentine and Jace,
I want to keep a close eye on you.
This is ridiculous!
- Clary...
- No!
We cannot just sit around.
Okay, they're going to kill Jace.
He's your son.
I know you think you understand this world, but you don't.
Dismissed!
You can't do this.
See, that's the thing about being the boss.
I can and I did.
Then revoke the dead-or-alive order.
Jace is one of us.
Challenging the authority of the head of the Institute is grounds for severe punishment, including de-runing.
Thanks for letting me crash here.
- You're a lifesaver.
- You can stay as long as you like.
I'll be at the station when you wake up tonight.
So, um, this...
This Aldertree guy...
He's got issues, right?
Aldertree's not the problem, the Clave is.
They're scared, so they're clamping down.
So, do you think it's true...
What they're saying about Jace?
That he's working with Valentine?
- I don't think so.
- I mean...
He could come for Clary next.
He's totally hung up on her.
So, are you worried about Jace?
Or maybe telling Clary how you feel?
Be bold, Simon.
I'm bold...
Adjacent.
I gotta take this. "Adjacent."
Garroway.
Bold.
I can totally be bold.
What's up, guys?
We know Luke said you could crash here...
But not here.
You don't want to touch me.
Encanto.
What the hell are you doing?
Encanto.
Um...
Encanto.
It's supposed to make you do whatever I tell you to.
You're the worst vampire ever.
Okay.
Welcome to your new home.
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Impressive, aren't they?
But they still don't have the inherent gifts that you have.
You took to a seraph blade the way a baby takes to a bottle.
What kind of a father experiments on his son with pure demon blood?
A father with perspective.
We both want the same thing.
To save this world from demons.
The Clave fights demons.
The Clave has grown soft...
Protecting Downworlders with the Accords.
All Downworlders, one day, will give in to their violent tendencies.
It's unavoidable.
Even a single drop of demon blood running in your veins, makes you a threat to humanity.
I...
I know plenty of Downworlders who play by the rules.
They control their urges.
You're thinking of Lucian Graymark, warlocks like Magnus Bane, and even...
Clarissa's little vampire friend Simon?
No matter how good they try to be,
Downworlders cannot control their demonic blood forever.
If that blood is so evil, why did you put it in me?
To fight fire with fire.
I wouldn't jump if I were you.
Why?
Because I'm your ultimate weapon?
This warlock is infamous for crimes against mundanes.
There's something else I want you to see.
- Come on, let's do this.
- Do what?
You seriously want to train right now?
We have to find Jace before Victor gets him killed.
Training's important.
So, pay attention to what I'm about to show you.
You need to watch your footwork.
Aldertree threatened to de-rune me if I tried to find Jace.
So, how do we get to him?
Let's go again.
Have you studied The Art of War?
That was not on the reading list at art school.
You should learn it.
Sun Tzu gives excellent advice.
Like what?
"Move swift as the Wind and closely-formed as the Wood.
"Attack like Fire."
But my favorite...
"To know your enemy, you must become your enemy."
I'm a quick study.
Alec.
Alec, slow down.
Where are you going?
Magnus'.
I couldn't just sit in there and not do anything.
He'll help me find my brother.
Jace is not your brother.
He's not your blood.
He's closer than blood.
He's my parabatai.
Alec, we looked like fools taking in Valentine's son, caring for him like our own.
It was the right thing to do.
It was a mistake.
It put our family in danger.
You need to forget Jace.
He made his choice.
Do you even hear what you're saying?
If you kill him, you kill a part of me.
When you have a cancer, you cut it out before it destroys you.
Son...
Life is full of hard choices.
Don't kid yourself.
You're not making a hard choice.
You're saving your own ass.
And unlike you, I don't push someone away just 'cause they're a hard choice.
Luke!
I need your help.
What, we on a first name basis now?
Man, get off my docks.
Oh, God, sorry.
In order to know my enemy, I had to become my enemy.
I had to get out of the Institute.
- Aldertree forbid me to leave.
What's with that guy?
I took one of Jace's gloves to try and track him, but it's not working.
Can you see if the police know anything?
Yeah, I'll contact the Coast Guard.
See what they know.
By the way, Simon's in the supply room.
- Simon's here?
- Yeah.
- I'll let you know what I find.
- Thank you.
Yeah.
Clary's safe.
She's with me.
I don't know how to do this.
I don't even know where to start.
You think there'd be some sort of handbook for the Shadow World, like...
Shadowhunting for Dummies.
Clary!
- Thank God I found you.
- Let me guess.
Luke called you.
And what are you even doing here?
You're not supposed to leave either.
I went to Aldertree and asked him to let me bring you back.
You told him?
I'm not going back...
I know.
I just said that so he would let me out.
I want to help you.
I'm here for you.
We need to find Jace, right?
Let's find him together.
I tried tracking him with the glove, but...
Let me show you something.
Give me your phone and stele.
Here are some basics of Shadowhunting.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom, open the door!
First rule of Shadowhunting, don't give anyone your phone or stele.
Thanks.
Magnus.
I'm not good at apologies...
But I'm...
I'm sorry.
Continue.
I'm...
Really sorry.
For?
Look, can you just cut that out for a second?
You were right.
When I called off my wedding, that was for me.
But this is all just...
It's very new.
This may surprise you, but you're new for me, too.
Look, with Jace missing, it's just like...
The ground has shifted, and I can't keep my balance.
Just...
I didn't mean to take it out on you.
I'm sorry.
You're forgiven.
Also...
You're great at apologies.
Thanks.
I've been working on it.
Here's the thing...
We're always going to face challenges.
So, when things get crazy, don't push me away.
Simon, your phone gets no cell service down here.
That's okay.
I think I'm making progress.
Simon, just stop.
Okay?
It's no use.
We're stuck down here.
I'm enjoying our together time.
Reminds me of 10th grade when we snuck into my mom's liquor cabinet.
Oh, God.
Oh, it was my first wicked hangover.
This is worse.
Mmm...
- It...
No, it's not.
- No...
- It's ridiculous.
- Oh...
How crazy our lives have gotten in the last few weeks.
Yeah.
You kill demons now.
Yeah.
I drink blood now.
And it used to be that...
The biggest problem we had was that...
I was secretly and totally...
- Here.
Track my mom with your phone.
- Yeah.
We don't have much time.
Hey.
You did it.
Yay for me.
All right, Alec, ready to track your parabatai?
I got them.
What just happened?
Did it start?
I don't need to.
I sense him.
He's on land.
We're stopping for pizza?
Reggie served the best pie in all of Brooklyn.
Note the past tense.
When Reggie's wife, Maria, turned into a vampire, she slaughtered Reggie and created a den inside.
What does this have to do with me?
You really think love will keep you from hurting your family and friends?
No matter how hard you fight it, demon blood will make you kill.
It starts in a small way.
Urges.
See, that's why you want Clary, and that is why you always will.
Everyone run.
Get out.
Out, now.
Hey, out!
Hey!
Which one of you is Maria?
Who's asking?
Jace is back.
Call off your men.
Izzy and I will bring him back alive.
One step ahead of you.
We got a hit on the map.
We're mobilizing now.
You're not listening.
Go ahead and de-rune me.
We won't let you do this.
Hold them here until we get back.
I'm sorry.
I'll do what I can to help Jace.
Pretty strong, even for a Shadowhunter.
You're feeding on innocent mundanes.
A girl's gotta eat.
- Your mom's close.
- Then run faster!
I'm a vampire.
I'm running slow for you.
You're done.
You're done.
- You can't kill me.
- Watch me.
I surrender to the authority of the Clave.
Aw, look at you.
You got your stick all ready to go and now you can't use it.
No, you broke the Accords.
You killed innocent mundanes.
And now, you're gonna die just like your friends.
But unlike them,
I'm no longer a threat.
I know my rights.
- Your rights?
- Yeah, my rights.
I might have broken the Accords, but I know you won't.
You don't know anything about me.
I know you're weak.
Mmm.
I can smell it.
And you'll do whatever the Clave tells you to do.
- Now, get off of me.
- Jonathan.
Are you going to let her mock you after what she did?
This thing in front of you...
She was once Reggie the pizza guy's sweet and loving wife.
You leave my husband out of this!
Whoa.
You mean the man you murdered?
You mean the man you devoured?
That's what you mean.
Ah, that's my boy.
No!
Run, Jonathan.
They want you dead.
Mom, stop!
What have you done?
Mumbai team is feeling the heat here.
Easy, easy!
Vohra to Anees now.
- Slow!
He scrambles for a run, has no idea where the ball is.
It's all happening here in Mumbai.
The umpire signals a timeout.
Come on, Mumbai!
All you Mavericks fans!
Guess who's in the house?
Let's hear a roar for the one and only...
Zarina Malik!
They have beaten the best!
Mavericks are the greatest!
They have beaten the best!
Mavericks are the greatest!
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Go Mavericks!
Welcome back from the Tizen Timeout.
The players have returned to their positions.
And it's gonna be Mirza to Anees.
Finally...
Some contact with the ball.
Bottom edge, and they get a couple.
That's Twenty20 for you, doesn't matter how the runs come... it sure has stirred the crowd.
Zarina Malik, on her feet as always.
Relentless in her cheering.
She's seen it all.
Been there for the Mavericks since the very beginning, supporting them in every game.
Tonight though, surely she must be a little nervous from the inside.
Ma'am...
Ma'am!
- Hang on, Mr Bhatia.
Madam, please!
If you don't do something now, we will lose the team.
Zarina Malik is going to have to find a new financial partner to see the Mavericks through to the next season.
These players, they've worked so hard for this team.
Yes, very very hard.
Harder... harder!
So here's Mirza steaming in again.
And once again the bounce flummoxing him!
- Fuckwit!
He won't last three balls!
Don't talk.
Just fuck!
The Mavericks coach Niranjan Suri and captain Arvind Vashishth standing in the dugout, looking very very tense at the moment, and rightly so.
Anees, bastard!
Play with your eyes open!
Should I come there and wake you the fuck up?
He's right though.
That's enough!
Mumbai Mavericks will sign the agreement with the Gujral Group tomorrow morning.
Do you understand?
- Yes, Miss Malik!
Good.
Get it done.
Anees steps out this time...
But oh, he misses it again.
Beaten by pace once more.
I need a cigarette.
Vayu's not here, coach.
Gimme the coke.
Fuck!
Arvind, we have a small problem.
Vayu...
Vayu!
He's back against the wall now.
Mirza, in great rhythm.
Swing and a miss.
And that's yet another beautiful delivery.
He's a goner!
Go and find him.
Come on!
Why me?
Raghu...
- If I go, who will pray?
Stop jerking around, go and find him fast!
Raghu, hurry up!
Hold it.
Hold it, man!
Hold it.
Next ball, bowled.
I'm almost there.
Say my name, Vayu!
Say my name!
Say my name!
- Bitch!
... on middle and off, flattening the stumps.
What a wonderful exhibition of bowling we have here!
This may actually be a blessing in disguise for the Mavericks because this brings Vayu Raghavan in.
But wait, there seems to be some confusion in the dugout.
Is there a change in the batting order here?
The crowd is getting restless.
They are chanting his name.
Where is Vayu Raghavan?
Vayu!
Vayu!
Vayu sir, please...
Here you go.
- Er... selfie?
Vayu!
Vayu, asshole!
Some day you will get timed out.
Gloves.
Helmet.
- I don't use protection, get it?
You came inside me again, you asshole!
Water.
Run.
- Yeah.
Run!
Hey there, how's your mum doing?
What?
- I asked, how's your mum?
Coz I was fucking her all night, get it?
Motherfucker!
- That's right!
Go on, get bowling.
Asshole!
Vayu and Mirza exchanging words.
The bowler does not look happy.
Okay, alright!
Ma'am...
An angry looking Mirza runs in to bowl.
The delivery is fast and full, and Vayu steps out of the crease and slams that over long off...
And that's gone for the maximum!
And a comfortable win for the Mavericks at the end... thanks to Vayu's blistering knock of 53.
So after Match Number 28 we're at the halfway stage of this edition of the PPL...
Switch to Cam 7.
Meera on screen.
Rahul, check focus.
Meera, two minutes.
Do we have to do this?
- Yes, Meera.
Of course, we have to.
He's scored 53 runs in 18 balls.
Vayu!
Vayu!
Vayu!
Vayu!
I don't understand why I always get stuck with Vayu duty!
Cleavage... check.
Meera Nagpal, hands off.
Rahul, you know, I played football and hockey for India's under-19 teams.
It's never been done by an Indian athlete before.
But no, no, no...
What does Sunil care about?
- Your cleavage.
Yes!
I love your cleavage, so do 90 percent of my viewers.
Why don't you zoom into it then?
Why bother showing my face?
Should I, Sir?
- Shut up!
Meera... he's here.
Now stay cool.
He's not your ex anymore, he's just another cricketer.
4, 3, 2 and...
Vayu Raghavan, that was such a difficult pitch to bat on.
How did you make it look so easy?
- Meera, come on...
Nice.
What's the mood like in the dressing room?
I... don't know.
You know, now that the future of the Mumbai Mavericks is uncertain..?
It's okay.
Meera, do something.
Vayu Raghavan, ladies and gentlemen.
Now going back to the studio for more coverage.
This is me, Meera Nagpal, signing off.
Good night.
And cut!
Are you pissed with me?
- What?
Why don't you answer my calls?
Or reply to my messages.
We can be heard.
Come to dinner with me.
Try someone else.
In fact, why don't you take her along?
Who?
- You know, the cheerleader you were with, before you came out to bat.
And stop doing drugs.
You're a professional cricketer for fuck's sake!
Not a 19-year old college-going kid!
Stop calling me.
Stop messaging me.
And stop fucking following me!
Asshole!
Mavericks are the greatest!
We've screwed the best!
Motherfuckers!
Hush.
Shh!
- Hi, guys.
Hi.
- Take it easy.
Where's Vayu?
Doesn't matter.
As the Mavericks captain,
I'm pretty sick and tired of all this gossip that's doing the rounds.
'This team is done, it is going down the crapper, etc'
And who better to put all these rumours to rest than the co-owner of our team,
Zarina Malik.
Are you ready?
Oui.
Mumbai Mavericks has a new co-owner!
Cheers!
It's Mr Parmeshwar Gujral of the Gujral Group of Industries.
And we're going to be together for this whole season and God willing, for many many more seasons to come.
Yes!
And thank you all for playing so well today.
And... screw the beer, coach.
Tonight calls for champagne.
Yes, absolutely.
- Yes, why not?
Look who's here.
Casanova!
What's gotten into him?
What's wrong?
Did Meera give you the finger again?
Sure looks like it.
Well... did someone mention champagne?
Right!
- Three cheers for...
Mavericks!
- Mavericks!
Hip hip hurray!
Hip hip hurray!
Hip hip hurray!
You could've stayed a bit longer.
I know, but...
I thought I should let your players celebrate in peace.
Anyway, I have to go to sign the agreement tomorrow morning.
Yeah.
So, well played today.
- Yeah.
The whole team did really well.
Especially, Vayu and...
Arvind,
I think we both know what your contribution really is.
Hey.
Congrats to all of us.
You are a real inspiration.
As in?
- How long has it been since you quit smoking?
2 months, 13 days.
And none this season.
- Damn, I think it's time I quit too.
You should try it.
- Another time.
Anyway, I'm off.
Enjoy the rest of the evening.
Shall we, Mr Bhatia?
Bye, guys.
- Thanks for the champagne.
Well captain, I think the occasion calls for a single malt.
Just one drink?
- No man, a bottle.
C'mon.
Come on.
You need to go?
No, coach.
Let's get that drink.
- Come on.
What are you up to, boy?
Hari Om!
Getting an early start to your day, as usual, Mr Gujral?
Is that the secret to your success?
Who are you?
Doesn't matter.
Hello?
- Good morning, Gujral!
Bhaisahab..?
Former sweethearts Imtiaz Khan and Zarina Malik are getting back together for a summer blockbuster, 'Flights of Fantasy'.
Many are saying that this is Zarina's desperate effort to reclaim her past glory with a spate of flops over the last two years.
Yes, my baby!
My baby!
How are you, baby?
How are you, my love?
I love you.
I love you.
Zarina, it took me 25 years to build this business.
And only 6 months to go bankrupt!
Mr Damani, you will be back.
Stubborn men like you don't give up so easily.
You are no less stubborn.
You're willing to go any length to keep the team together.
I'm very sorry for all this, Zarina.
Six years with the Mumbai Mavericks!
I never imagined one day I'd have to sell this team.
You will always be part of the Mavericks.
Always.
You are very kind.
But I'm just an ordinary fan now.
And you know, it's probably all for the best.
Parmeshwar Gujral is like a brother to me.
He'll be the perfect owner.
Meet my new team...
My lawyers!
Yes, father.
I've reached.
Whom did you meet?
No one yet.
I have some documents to sign first.
Okay, okay.
Keep practicing.
And remember to use the short ball sensibly.
- Done?
Yes, father.
I'll call you back.
I'm a little busy.
Yes, sir...
Why haven't you signed these yet?
Sir, I need a little time to read these...
What's there to read?
Look.
You will be paid a million bucks, every year, for three years.
You just have to do exactly as the team management says.
On the field and off it, too.
Off the field...
what does that mean, sir?
Is there more to this than cricket?
Son, just cut the bullshit.
Do you know why you are here?
Because, one of our players is injured.
You are just a replacement.
And this game is far bigger than your village cricket.
Now don't waste time.
Especially mine.
Sign it.
May I leave, sir?
Where to?
Sir, I have a few relatives in Bandra.
I'll stay with them.
- In Bandra?
You will stay right here.
At the hotel.
Along with the rest of the team.
Your captain is staying here too, even though he has a house in Mumbai.
Hang on.
Room card.
It's a key... the key to your room.
You are the new boy...
from up north, right?
Oh, yes.
The coach spoke about you.
Said you hailed from my neck of the woods.
A fast bowler.
Welcome.
Why don't you... join me?
But I have to go up, sir.
Everyone has to go up eventually.
Come to my room now.
I'm your senior.
I'm your mentor now.
Let's go pop your cherry.
Let's get to know you better, I mean.
Come on!
Keep going.
The room to your right.
Here we are.
Where exactly are you from?
- Lalganj, in the Mirzapur district.
That's my home, sir.
Which village?
- Tendui.
Do you know of it?
Damn boy!
My village is right next door.
Phuliari!
You know, where your people come every week to watch movies.
Beer?
- No, sir.
Okay.
Get me one from the fridge.
Chilled!
My grandpa is the village chief.
Raghubeer Mishra.
You must've heard the name.
You surely know my name?
Yes, sir.
Devender Mishra.
Bravo!
What did you say your name was?
Prashant Kanaujia.
What's that?
Why are you mumbling?
Speak up.
Prashant Kanaujia.
Keep it there.
I'm of a high caste.
You bastards!
No matter how far you folks run, no matter where you try and hide, we will always be around.
Get this straight!
Never forget your caste or your status!
Understood?
Get lost.
Beat it!
Bloody oaf!
Get out!
Hello, Parmeshwar?
Where are you?
What do you mean?
I'm sorry.
The deal is off.
What?
!
Is it done?
Yes, Bhaisahab.
Good.
I just ended a 20 year old friendship.
For a friendship lost, you've forged another.
The ownership structure of the Mavericks is quite simple.
As you know,
Mr Damani and his firm own 85 percent of Mumbai Mavericks and the remaining 15 percent belongs to you.
Gujral was willing to buy out all of Mr Damani's 85 percent.
Now with Gujral gone and so little time,
I'm afraid, we don't have any option.
And if we don't find someone soon...
According to PPL Council laws, if we don't find somebody in two days, the Mavericks will be dissolved at the end of this season.
The Mavericks' name will cease to exist.
As will its owners.
You will have to give up your stake.
There has to be someone, somewhere.
We had called a press conference tomorrow, to announce the deal.
We have to cancel that.
I'm sorry, Zarina.
Nobody wanted this.
Maybe we can apply for another extension.
It's too late for that.
Excuse me.
Zarina ma'am, you have to leave for Filmistan.
Cancel the shoot.
Zarina, don't do this.
I'll talk it over with some of my associates.
We'll find a solution.
Ma'am, if you cancel today, it'll be difficult to coordinate with Imtiaz sir's schedule.
I said, cancel the shoot!
Madam, this is the only movie we have in hand right now.
And if you don't...
Fine!
But you need to figure this out.
The Mavericks is my team.
And it'll stay that way.
When did you injure your back?
What?
- When did you injure your back?
I don't know what you're talking about.
- Your short ball percentage has fallen from 32 percent last season to about 15 percent this season.
Which means you bowled two short balls an over last year as opposed to just one this year.
Your average speed has also fallen by about 15 percent this year.
And you're using the slower ball a lot more.
So I'm asking you again, when did you injure your back?
Okay, numbers lady,
I injured it two months ago.
- And you didn't tell the management.
Because you wanna play the Ashes, right?
Rohini...
- You're an idiot, Hamish McCall!
In a couple of matches, your back will give and you'll never play another game again.
You're twice my size but don't have half the brain cells I do.
Dwight, you're up next.
Hang on.
I'll be right back.
Don't leave before I've spoken to you.
Prashant... finally!
I've been looking for you for a while now.
Where were you hiding?
Well... you are?
In the UP Inter District finals, 6 for 29.
At the Indian team's net session during the Kanpur Test, you took the captain's wicket.
The winner of Top Gun Fast Bowling Contest.
149 kilometres per hour.
Your stock delivery is the outswinger but you can move it the other way, too.
How do you know so much about me?
It's my job.
Rohini
- Mavericks' team analyst.
Welcome aboard.
See you around.
Oops!
You're going in to see Vayu?
Yes.
- But I...
We just...
- Don't worry.
I'm not here for that.
I'm his sister.
So why don't you stop guarding the door and let me through.
Thank you very much.
- Sorry!
Vayu!
Asshole!
You're late again!
The others are warming up in the gym already.
I was doing that too.
Susie was... helping me warm up.
Hit straight over the bowler's head for a glorious six!
Hey, yesterday's Big Bash game.
Wanna play?
No.
Just two balls.
Come on.
And he has pierced mid-on, the ball races to the fence.
Come.
Okay, let's see.
The captain is making some field changes now.
The keeper is moving to his right.
The first slip is in place.
They can't let Taylor run away with the game.
Why is he placing a leg slip?
- Get to the point.
The bowler's at his run-up.
- Taylor is firmly in command now.
The batsman has a middle stump guard.
It won't be an outswinger.
It'll be an inswinging length ball into his body.
They're trying to get him caught at that leg slip.
Off the pads!
Oh...
Not bad, Roro.
The next one will be an outswinger.
That was so close to leg slip.
- See, the batsman is also taking a leg stump guard.
Personally, I'd move the point fielder back a little.
He has a dangerous square cut.
That's been cut away!
- Motherfucker!
What a square cut!
Just like Sehwag.
Not bad, Roro!
2 for 2, lucky guesses huh?
Just admit it, brother.
I am smarter than you.
Really?
Okay, predict the next ball.
- Four runs added to the score.
This is turning out to be an expensive over.
He is moving square leg to fine, no?
Bouncer.
I think, he's gonna go full and swinging.
He's gonna get bowled right through the middle.
And he's bowled him...
- Fuck!
That was a peach of a delivery...
How the hell did you..?
The stumps have been shattered.
Why are you smiling?
Just.
Wait a second, wait!
You have seen this match, haven't you?
Yeah, you have.
If it's been recorded on camera, I have seen it, Vayu!
You're such an ass, you know!
And this is why you don't get laid.
Jackass!
Don't talk to me like that, okay?
Get your clothes on!
Fucker.
Cheater!
Okay, okay, okay!
Hey, sexy!
- Hey, what's up?
Bitch!
What is Sarah doing here anyway?
I hear she wasn't even needed on shoot today.
Ma'am, we are ready for a rehearsal.
- Later.
Ma'am is not feeling well.
But Ma'am, Imtiaz sir said...
- Don't you get it?
Go.
But ma'am...
- Get out!
And tell them I won't be rehearsing today.
What the f..!
A chocolate right before we shoot?
Guilty pleasures, huh?
It's for my blood pressure.
Really?
Anyway, I wanted to rehearse for your sake.
Fewer takes, everyone's happy.
Why don't you do a rehearsal with Sarah Fonseca?
She needs them.
You have your guilty pleasures.
I have mine.
She's a talented girl.
Super talented.
Julie.
You're an asshole, Imtiaz!
You sound just like my Twitter trolls.
Anyway, what happened at your meeting?
It's good.
Everything is fine.
Okay.
Zarina Malik, one more time.
What happened at your meeting?
I might be an asshole, Zarina, but I'm a useful one.
You know Vikrant Dhawan?
Everyone does.
I think he's interested in your team.
So why don't you put away your bar of chocolate and go and try and convince him?
He can help.
I don't need your help.
You won't be here but for the help that you got along the way, Zarina.
None of us would.
Everyone needs help.
Vikrant, I've got Gujral to drop the deal.
Zarina?
- She should call anytime now.
Good.
The field is wide open.
Thank you, Bhaisahab.
Sir, Ms Zarina Malik has called.
In how long do we land?
- 45 minutes.
Set it up.
Sure, sir.
Ah, Zarina.
Hello.
- Here already?
Vikrant's moving fast, hm?
Excuse me..?
You'll be fine.
Ms Malik.
Welcome.
I see you've met my lovely wife, Sudha.
- Yes.
Actually, Sudha is a big fan.
It's true.
Hindi films are my weakness.
Thank you, darling.
I'll take it from here.
All the best.
Go easy on her, tiger.
Zarina.
Shall we?
Ms Malik, you look just like you do in your movies.
You've seen my movies?
Ah!
You got me there!
Can't say I really have.
- Thought so.
Please.
- So let's get down to business.
Are you buying the Mavericks?
You don't like to waste time, do you?
The Mavericks are a good team, Mr Dhawan.
Is that so?
Imtiaz ceased to think with his brain years ago.
You sent him to me.
Which means, you're interested.
Something to drink?
Only after we make the deal.
I like your style, Ms Malik.
So if you're interested, how come we didn't hear about it until now?
Ms Malik, success... is all about timing.
You are one day away from losing your team.
Do you really think it's a mere coincidence that I showed up just now?
So you do want to buy the Mavericks.
And I'm here, because you want me to convince Mr Damani to sell at your price.
You're good.
Very good.
May I ask what this price might be?
It's always such a pleasure talking to an intelligent lady.
I aim to please.
But I would never betray Mr Damani.
Not like this.
I don't really like the word 'betray'.
All I'm asking you to do is help me help you save the Mavericks.
I could sign those papers tonight.
And you and I could both do that press conference tomorrow morning, together.
Okay.
Give me two hours.
And come to Mr Damani's office.
We'll sign the papers.
Ms Malik, I've had a long day.
Please ask Mr Damani to come here.
I'll be waiting.
- Okay.
And Ms Malik, remember...
For the Mavericks!
Right, Mr Dhawan.
Please... call me Vikrant.
Excuse me...
Here.
Is it open?
I'm compelled to sell this team, but I never expected such a low offer.
This is not even half of what Gujral was offering.
What's the half of zero, Mr Damani?
Mr Gujral gave you precisely zero rupees.
That amount there is a lot more.
Mr Damani,
I understand your attachment to the Mavericks.
In fact, there is nothing I want more than for you to remain the owner of the Mavericks.
It's in your hands now.
No compulsion.
Pritish, get Mr Damani a drink.
Ms Malik,
I'll be waiting outside.
Thank you.
Are you sure, Zarina?
- What..?
Sir, what choice do we have?
If only I had some more time..!
Time is what we don't have.
What we do have though is Mr Dhawan.
Sir, he has one of the largest sports management companies in the world.
He knows cricket and cricketers.
And he has a fantastic network.
He's the right man for the Mavericks.
Sir, the future of the team is at stake.
And mine, too.
Pritish...
Could you please call Mr Dhawan back in?
Sir.
So, if film stars can become team owners, why can't team owners become film stars?
No no, but on a serious note,
I'm really looking forward to my first game as team owner of the Mavericks.
We finalized the deal and signed the papers last night.
Even capped it off with a small little celebration.
So Mr Dhawan, why did you decide to buy the Mavericks?
Since the inception of the PowerPlay League six years ago, the Mavericks have won the title twice.
The team is led by a former India Test captain.
Our batting is flamboyant, our bowling has variety.
You ask me why I bought the Mavericks.
I ask you, why the heck not?
Mr Dhawan, so what about Ms Zarina Malik now?
You want to know what will happen with Ms Zarina Malik.
What the fuck!
Vikrant!
We're clones.
We're someone's experiment.
They're killing us off.
Bet you could bounce me like a ball.
Mira saw you screwing my husband!
- Alison!
- You came into my house and probed my wife.
I quit!
Who's the science now, bitch?
Mr. Pouchino, what about that refund?
- I got refund.
- M.K. is dead.
- I don't want to with you!
- Enough!
- I'm going with Rachel!
- No, that's enough!
We are going to take such good care of you.
Oh, my goodness!
I have stick in belly.
- Ah!
Ah!
- Now, where's Helena?
- Come on!
- Gonna be so good.
Hendrix, that was quite the feed.
I mean, I'll have to unbutton here.
Was that a cream-cheese frosting?
- I don't know, is it?
- Oh, you are evil,
- Alison Hendrix.
- I'll email you the recipe.
No, you will not.
Hey!
Haha!
She's so tough.
- Hello.
- Hey, Alison, it's Beth.
I told you not to call me anymore.
Look.
You know ignoring this isn't gonna make it go away.
- OK?
I warned you when we met.
- Beth, we look alike, that's it.
This other C-word business,
I-I-I don't even know what to say about it.
It's hokum.
OK?
The, uh...
- Alison?
- Uh...
Yeah.
Great!
All sold.
Raffle tickets sold!
Great!
OK.
Bye.
You have been phone-fussing all night.
Have you got something going on the side?
What?
!
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Yeah.
Ahem!
So, guys, uhhh,
Aynsley and I have a little proposition for the two of you.
We've been thinking that it's time to shake things up a little bit.
Oh.
I, uh...
Oh!
No.
- Oh, my God!
- No, no, no.
- No, no!
Not that!
No, no, no!
- OK, what we were thinking was a little... magic mushrooms.
Yeah, no.
I can't.
I tried them once, and they went right to my bowels.
Ohh, Donnie, come on!
No.
Alison and I, we prefer to stick to alcohol poisoning, right?
- Is everything OK there, honey?
- Yeah, yeah.
Why don't we open up a Merlot.
Mhm?
You know what?
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Yes.
That is what I'm talking about, Hendrix.
Right here!
Are you sure about this?
She's in denial.
She needs to see another face.
Yeah, but you're basically asking me to, like, drop a bomb in the middle of a Norman Rockwell painting.
Yeah.
Just get it over with.
OK.
We need Helena's location, and you're going to tell me.
So where did she go, Mr. Hendrix?
I already told you, I don't know.
Abandoned you, did she?
Like you abandoned me in the woods?
I didn't abandon you, Alison.
Look, Mister...?
- Frontenac.
- Right.
Tell Rachel when you found me, I was looking for Helena.
No, tell Rachel that Helena's not gonna let her suck stem cells out of her babies!
Not exactly a scientist, are you, Mrs. Hendrix.
I studied kinesiology.
Cosima is a real scientist and a very valuable one.
Sarah and Helena are fertile, biologically priceless.
- And then there's you.
- I'm a mother
- and a homemaker.
- As you go back today to your vapid existence,
I want you to consider your worth.
Because even M.K. had more value than you.
My hand is purple, and it makes the hair all fuzzy.
- I'm seeing tracers.
- Why are my socks wet?
OK...
Cold water for everyone.
Yeah?
Got ice in it and everything.
And I've got
- poison control on speed dial.
- Donnie, Donnie, bro, have a beer, take your shirt off.
What?
No!
It's Alison's
- mystery man again.
- What?
!
Honey, don't you think maybe we should be turning that off?
- I have to get the raffle tickets.
- Wait-wait-wait.
Uhh... wait, wait, wait, wait.
What about the buddy system?
- No, no.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
- OK.
Alison.
Hey.
Oh, Christmas.
I have neighbours.
I...
I know.
I'm sorry.
- You're the other one.
- Yeah, I'm Cosima.
Umm, I know.
I'm sorry about this whole ambush thing.
It was totally Beth's idea.
She just thought it would be a good idea for you to see
- another one of us.
- You have a nose ring.
Yeah, brilliant observation.
- We are so completely different.
- I know, which you may find totally freaky, but I find it...
I find it so fascinating!
Like, this is you and I'm from
- "Berkeley." OK?
- I don't even know what that means.
And like, Beth is a cop.
Right?
You know?
But genetically speaking, we're all... we're all family.
Who are we really?
Yeah, that's the existential question, isn't it?
But what Beth is proposing is that we all get together, hang out all the time.
OK, you're just gonna stay with us.
Whoa.
Whoa!
No.
No.
Whoa.
We're gonna talk.
We're gonna talk, talk, talk about it.
Dude, are you high?
'Cause your eyes are like saucers.
- I can't deal with this.
- Our...
OK.
Alright.
Shit.
Oh, M.K.
I could have done something.
Sarah, Sarah, I could have been a decoy or something.
Alison, they were watching you too.
I think we all just need to lay low today, regroup.
That sounds like a pretty good idea to me.
Yes.
Just go back to my useless life
- like I've been told.
- Honey?
Honey?
Kira?
Wanna give me...
Hey.
She just...
She needs a bit of space, love.
So do you.
I will bring her to Dyad.
She won't even tell me what Rachel did to her, and I'm meant to send her back there.
I know it's not easy, but keep the faith.
We're not without allies.
Stay here.
Chain yourself to your sister today.
Donnie, I'm not in the mood for the Church Fall Fun Fairl.
Not with Nona Walker in charge!
Honey, we are still the entertainment.
I am doing my dance, and we are singing our duet, right?
♪ Ain't no mountain high enough ♪
♪ Ain't no valley... ♪
OK.
Honey, come on.
What is the Fall Fun Fair without Team Hendrix?
I can't stop thinking about M.K.
and Cosima out there all alone.
Why do I love my sisters so much when they're ruined my life.
Hey, your life isn't ruined.
It's just waiting for you to come back and sparkle it up.
You're right.
You're right.
I made this fair what it is today, and I won't be sidelined by Nona Walker.
- What...
Not what I meant.
- Get dressed.
Full regalia.
I'll be at the church.
Hi!
- Hi.
- Let's put
- the drinks on the dessert table.
- Right over there?
Oh no, maybe with the side dishes.
I'm sorry,
I know it's heavy.
Does that seem good?
Side dishes?
Uh, drinks always on a separate table.
That way, you avoid a log jam.
- Good.
- Alison, you're early, the Fair doesn't start for another hour.
Well, it might not start at all at this rate.
Where are we here?
OK, so let's just take a big breath, dear.
- OK?
- Excuse me?
Well, they said that you might do this, try to undermine me.
Who said that?
Well, Eileen and Nina and Nancy and Sta...
Well, everybody.
And I said, "No, Alison's not like that."
So for your sake, let's just not prove them right, OK?
- OK.
- Great!
Maybe next year, Alison.
That one goes on the hot-dog table.
- Nona.
- Alison, you're still here?
I-I-I wanted to apologize to you.
I've not been myself lately.
My family and my reputation, you know.
So just feeling a little useless.
- Oh, golly!
- You must be parched, you're working so hard.
Have a drink.
Oh, it's very thoughtful of you, thank you!
- No problem.
- Alison, welcome.
I hope you're not too dispirited about
- the changing of the guard.
- N-no.
No!
Nonna and I have worked it out.
Well, God bless.
He sees your deeds big and small.
So you can take solace in that.
- Mm-hmm.
- Ah-ah-ah!
I just realized that I have had this in my car for weeks.
The paraffins alone would have killed you.
I'll get you a different one.
Aldous was so proud when he published this book, and yet, P.T. Westmoreland told me he wrote it.
And Aldous just dumbed it down.
I didn't know that.
Well, the imaging alone shows the foetus had a rapid
- and unexplained recovery.
- Yes,
Helena's children could prove even more vital than Kira.
Donnie Hendrix may be holding back regarding Helena.
Well, we have more persuasive leverage, don't we?
I'll instruct the detectives.
Detective Bell, what's going on?
You tell me.
I am highland dancing later today.
Is that breaching my bail conditions?
We have a search warrant.
For what?
I, uh, I've already been charged.
This isn't about drug trafficking, Donnie.
It's about a bunch of dead Portuguese gangsters and one seriously bloody paper cutter.
Oh, come on!
This is, uh... this is a shakedown.
Step aside, Braveheart.
Alison, what are you doing here?
Uhhh...
I'm loving my neighbours, Eileen, and try not to judge.
And we all miss her.
Hi, Chad.
Hi, Jake.
Hi, Esme.
We... we...
Pff, I haven't seen you since...
- The funeral, yeah.
- Right.
Right.
I'm-I'm so sorry, guys.
I...
We miss you on Black Oak Drive.
We're up at Aynsley's mother's now.
Uhhh, pretty much just focused on taking care of my VIPs here, uh?
Yeah!
We're gonna go get the hot dogs now.
OK.
She really was pretty, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Do you ever feel like this is somehow our fault?
What are you... what are you talking about?
It was an accident.
She kicked me out of the house because we had an affair.
If anyone had been home, they could have saved her.
You don't know that.
And we can't change the past.
Yeah.
It's good to see you, Alison.
Why do I have this face?
I could have been born with many faces.
I could have been a cop or I could have been a scientist, but, uh...
I wound up microwaving mini-pizzas and chauffeuring kids to circus camp.
Why this life?
!
Because we're happy?
You're so normal.
You golf and you watch TV and you... commute!
Sometimes, you look at me so strangely.
It's like our entire life is a lie.
I... googled
"bad mushroom trip"
and it said, in a couple of hours, you should be right back to normal, OK?
- OK.
- Uh-oh!
- Oh, my God!
- Bad energy in here.
- Oh, my God!
- Alison is no bueno right now.
Oh!
Oh, sweetie, no.
It's just your senses opening up like a flower.
- I don't feel like a flower.
- Oh, sweetie, come outside.
Come feel the grass.
- It's so beautiful.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Be careful with her.
I've said it a hundred times,
- "I don't know where Helena is."
- Anything on here?
Child porn?
Tax evasion?
Pouchy's client list.
No.
I have to call my wife.
I need that cell phone as well.
Are you backing this play?
Donnie... please.
I'm expected on stage at the Fall Fun Fair.
So go, dance with the stars.
No law says you have to stick around.
Are we cool, Donnie?
Yeah, we're cool.
Just... keep 'em out of the garage.
Do you remember your car accident, Kira?
Yeah.
Ms. S said it was a miracle.
What if I told you it might not be a miracle at all.
Might actually be something in your genes.
That's what Auntie Cosima thinks.
Yes, she would.
I have a present for you.
Another very special creature.
- A mouse!
- Mm-hmm!
- Aww!
- This is a spiny mouse.
This mouse has the remarkable ability to grow back its own skin and fur.
- How?
- That is the mystery.
Can I pick him up?
Sure.
He's evolved this way so that, when he's grasped by a predator, he slides right out of his own skin and escapes.
- Oh, come on.
- I think it's rather painless.
Everybody says I can't trust you.
Do you?
This is fun.
Kira's already turning her back on me.
She thinks Rachel's gonna teach her who she is, and I'm just this bitch who just says no.
No.
Yes.
Bum in chair.
You are sitting for me.
- I'm not sitting for you.
- Yes, you are sitting for me because S benched us.
And I know that's agony for you, but then, let's do something constructive with that.
Why do you insist on painting naked?
It's my process.
And you have no influence on it, so just relax.
Eyes forward.
- Prfff!
- Great!
Just be natural.
Ramone!
- You, you ripped us off!
- Mrs. Hendrix?
Kellerman fronted us those pills and you left us holding the bag!
That's not true.
That product was
- bought and paid for.
- You...
Aaah...
You are not gonna weasel me this time.
- I want my 35 grand.
- Oh, just hold on.
Would I come here, to your church, if I scammed you?
Just consider the possibility that Kellerman saw you for the rookie you were and took advantage.
We got taken.
He's a snake, I should have warned you.
I am such a colossal failure at everything.
Not to me, Mrs. Hendrix.
Can I, uh, help take the edge off?
No.
No.
Absolutely not.
God in heaven, I haven't had a drink in ages.
You know, the woman I was a year ago would not recognize the woman I am today.
- Who are you?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Now, I'm the parties-supply guy living in my parents' basement again.
Just promise me you will not end up in Bailey Downs in 10 years wondering what the hell happened to your life.
A toke, Mrs. Hendrix?
Eff it.
Look at the stars.
Some of them are so far away that they've died before the light even reaches us.
Aynsley, do you think this is all there is for us?
Bailey Downs?
You're laughing at me?
No.
No, sweetie.
I hear you.
Sometimes, I've fantasized about jumping in my car and just driving away.
I mean, who knows what's out there for me?
Exactly.
But, Ali, this is a great neighbourhood.
I mean, our lives are filled with joy and kids and barbecues.
But if you really feel like there's some other purpose for you, you should trust that.
Whoo!
Whee!
Ah, Mrs. Hendrix!
- Oh, God!
Whoo!
- Alison, what are you doing?
Donnie.
Donnie, I'm so high.
- I mean, I'm so...
- I'm so high, Donnie.
Is that Ramone?
!
- You little shit!
- Mr. Hendrix,
I swear I didn't rip you off.
I swear!
No.
It was Kellerman with the faraway eyes.
- Alison, come here.
- Talk to the bouncing hand.
Alison, would you please come out here?
!
- Yeah, hurry up!
It's my turn now!
- OK.
Whoa!
Oh!
Wow!
Thank you.
Check complete.
Ah!
- OK, kids, one at a time.
- What is your problem, Donnie?
My problem?
Oh, I don't know.
Just Neo police searching our house.
- What?
!
Police?
- Yeah.
- Why?
- They're trying to tie us
- to Pouchy.
- Ugh!
Well, there's no evidence tying us to Pouchy, is there?
No, but there are a few bodies buried in our garage.
What do you think happens when Rachel discovers that I killed Leekie?
Well, I didn't shoot him in the face, did I?
No, you only let Aynsley Norris strangle to death.
I thought she was my monitor, and that turned out to be you!
Hey, I'm not proud of what I did!
Enger!
Oh, shit!
Planting evidence?
Whoops!
Is that blood from the Pouchino crime scene?
Yeah.
Bloody clothes.
You know the Hendrixes didn't do it, Matty.
Hmm...
There's the irony, I think we both know who did.
Helena.
I added clone blood in there too.
Tie the wife to the crime... the husband spills Helena's location.
Ah!
That kind of looks like a grave, don't it?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm on it.
Ugh!
"Alison"?
Allison?
!
It's Donnie.
Donnie, what's going on?
Oh, a little.
I'm at the church fair.
Alison is blottoed, and the cops are searching my house.
What?
Uh, is Art there?
Yes, he was.
I don't know if he can, but I told him to keep them out of the garage with its occupants.
Oh, shit!
Leekie.
And Helena's dead Castor.
Don't forget about him.
- Donnie, are you saying Alison's relapsed?
- Yes.
With her teenage dealer.
Balls to S. They need an intervention, we gotta go.
Uh, wait there, we're coming.
OK, thank you.
Oh yeah.
Homework, young lady?
It's all done.
Impressive.
What time is Mom coming home?
Soon, I hope.
She said she'd be home by now.
I know.
You wanna talk about what you and Rachel did today?
No.
OK.
Why don't you get ready for bed.
OK.
Alison?
Hey, Chad.
May I, uh, may I sit?
Sure.
You used to call me "Hendrix."
Yeah.
Yeah, I used to do a lot of things, huh?
Hey, are you OK?
No.
There's something I should have told you about Aynsley's death.
Oh, look, you don't have to say anything.
- It's fine.
- No, you have to hear me.
It was my fault.
- I'm responsible, Chad.
- No.
No, no, no.
I shouldn't have said anything back there.
I'm sorry, that was stupid.
You guys had your problems, OK, but those were... those were best friend problems.
But, God, she loved you.
She loved you so much.
We can't change what happened... but if we want to honour Aynsley, we have to move forward.
Thank you.
I should find Donnie before I miss the performance.
Oh, Donnie.
Ahhh...
Oh.
The weirdest people get one.
Oh, God.
Oh!
Ugh.
Oh!
Donnie?
Donnie?
Oh, God!
- Donnie, wake up.
Wake up!
- I don't even know.
I'm right here.
I'm right here.
Wake up.
Wake up, Donnie.
Get up.
- Felix?
- Yes.
Just in the nick of time.
- What's he on?
- Half a bottle of Lorazepam.
- Holy shit!
- Is he OK?
Yes.
He's fine.
Just been dealing with a medical condition.
Looks like they're both alchies.
I'm sorry.
I may have my demons, but don't you dare go after my Donnie!
All right.
You know what?
It's all right.
No.
I know exactly what you all think of me.
But I'm not just a boozer, I'm a pill popper too!
That's right.
And half of you bought them from me!
Oh, God.
Don't pretend you're so innocent.
You're hypocrites!
All of you, hypocrites!
Nona,
I see you.
You know, I've given my heart to this community, and I can't help but feel a little bit hurt that you're pushing me to decide, but, you know...
I have atoned for my sins.
And I have a life that is so much bigger than Bailey Downs.
I am part of a sisterhood that you couldn't even begin to understand.
And thank God, you never will.
Where are you going?
Going to take a leak.
You leave the seat up for me?
- Hey, Art.
- What the hell is going on?
We're so sorry you're in this position.
See?
That's the problem.
I'm not just looking out
- for you anymore.
- I know.
I know.
Look, Rachel can't know what's in there.
- OK?
You have to stall 'em.
- Stall 'em?
Girl, we're halfway to China over there.
Who's even in there anyway?
Duko?
No.
No, no, no.
S got rid of that body.
Do you think she would bury him in the Hendrix garage?
Then who is it?
Sarah, I have lost my line right now.
I need to know.
It's bad, but not for you.
OK?
It's Dr. Leekie.
Donnie killed him.
Oh!
What about Art, Sarah?
Doesn't he have some option?
He's as twisted up as you are, Alison.
This is my fault.
I'm the one that shot Dr. Lee...
- Leekie.
- Sarah, what's Rachel gonna do when she discovers decapitated Leekie?
She's gonna come after all of us.
OK, I'll tell 'em.
- Tell them what?
- Where Helena is.
You knew all along?
Mm-hmm.
She made me swear not to tell anyone but Sarah.
Uh, uh, no, no.
We're not giving up where Helena is.
- No, of course not.
- Well, I'm sorry.
I don't know how to get us out of this.
That's OK.
This is our doing.
Rachel should know that.
Yeah.
- Can you take him home, please?
- Yeah.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna make myself useful for once.
Yes?
Alison Hendrix is here.
Well done, Mr. Frontenac.
Hoohoo!
Found the squishy.
Alison Hendrix.
At last we meet.
Yes, well, I suppose my entire life is filed away here somewhere.
It is.
Not that I've paid much attention to it.
I know you look down on me, Rachel.
You probably wonder why on earth my sisters even bother with me.
But I've been in this fight since the beginning with Beth, even before Sarah, and I'm in it for the long haul.
Well, looks like we're missing something.
Ah!
It was an accident.
Dr. Leekie pushed Donnie over the edge, and he didn't have basic firearm safety.
Aldous Leekie is buried in your garage?
Minus the head which was donated to science.
For most of my life,
I hated Aldous.
But I chose not to kill him.
The other body, who is it?
A Castor.
Tell me Helena's location, and this all goes away.
Even if I knew where she was, I wouldn't tell you.
This isn't our problem, it's yours.
So go ahead, file murder charges against us.
It all leads back to you and your office.
Do you really think your new boss would want all that attention on Neolution?
Here.
Get them out of my house.
Get them out of my house!
- Enger.
- It's Rachel.
Something's come up on my end.
I need to know what you found, Detective.
Ma'am, there's a body here, but, um, we can't ID it just yet.
What, uh, what would you like us to do?
Well, dispose of the bodies discreetly and put the garage back in order.
OK.
We'll stand down.
Looks like the Hendrixes squirmed out of this one.
What would you have me do with you now?
Do whatever you want with me, but leave Helena alone.
I should like to put my hands around your neck and squeeze.
Then, we're not so different, you and I.
You did it, hon.
You went toe to toe with Rachel Duncan and didn't give up where Helena is hiding.
Hey, what's wrong?
I just...
I feel like
I've been rattling around my own skin for some time, and...
I think I finally popped loose.
I need to go away for a while.
Oh!
You're my rock.
I'm not leaving,
I'm just...
I need to see the kids and I, uh... and see who I am outside of all of this.
You mean,
- like a yoga retreat?
- No.
I don't know what my destination is.
I just need...
- I know this is right.
- Yeah.
Oh.
I know there's something you want, my highlander.
Really?
- You wanna do this?
- Mm-hmm.
OK.

Bye.
You have been phone-fussing all night.
Have you got something going on the side?
What?
!
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Yeah.
Ahem!
So, guys, uhhh,
Aynsley and I have a little proposition for the two of you.
We've been thinking that it's time to shake things up a little bit.
Oh.
I, uh...
Oh!
No.
- Oh, my God!
- No, no, no.
- No, no!
Not that!
No, no, no!
- Okay, what we were thinking was a little... magic mushrooms.
Yeah, no.
I can't.
I tried them once, and they went right to my bowels.
Ohh, Donnie, come on!
No.
Alison and I, we prefer to stick to alcohol poisoning, right?
- Is everything Okay there, honey?
- Yeah, yeah.
Why don't we open up a Merlot.
Mhm?
You know what?
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Yes.
That is what I'm talking about, Hendrix.
Right here!
Are you sure about this?
She's in denial.
She needs to see another face.
Yeah, but you're basically asking me to, like, drop a bomb in the middle of a Norman Rockwell painting.
Yeah.
Just get it over with.
Okay.
We need Helena's location, and you're going to tell me.
So where did she go, Mr. Hendrix?
I already told you, I don't know.
Abandoned you, did she?
Like you abandoned me in the woods?
I didn't abandon you, Alison.
Look, Mister...?
- Frontenac.
- Right.
Tell Rachel when you found me, I was looking for Helena.
No, tell Rachel that Helena's not gonna let her suck stem cells out of her babies!
Not exactly a scientist, are you, Mrs. Hendrix.
I studied kinesiology.
Cosima is a real scientist and a very valuable one.
Sarah and Helena are fertile, biologically priceless.
- And then there's you.
- I'm a mother
- and a homemaker.
- As you go back today to your vapid existence,
I want you to consider your worth.
Because even M.K. had more value than you.
My hand is purple, and it makes the hair all fuzzy.
- I'm seeing tracers.
- Why are my socks wet?
Okay...
Cold water for everyone.
Yeah?
Got ice in it and everything.
And I've got
- poison control on speed dial.
- Donnie, Donnie, bro, have a beer, take your shirt off.
What?
No!
It's Alison's

I'm sorry about this whole ambush thing.
It was totally Beth's idea.
She just thought it would be a good idea for you to see
- another one of us.
- You have a nose ring.
Yeah, brilliant observation.
- We are so completely different.
- I know, which you may find totally freaky, but I find it...
I find it so fascinating!
Like, this is you and I'm from.
- "Berkeley." Okay?
- I don't even know what that means.
And like, Beth is a cop.
Right?
You know?
But genetically speaking, we're all... we're all family.
Who are we really?
Yeah, that's the existential question, isn't it?
But what Beth is proposing is that we all get together, hang out all the time.
Okay, you're just gonna stay with us.
Whoa.
Whoa!
No.
No.
Whoa.
We're gonna talk.
We're gonna talk, talk, talk about it.
Dude, are you high?

- Our...
Okay.
Alright.
Shit.
Oh, M.K.
I could have done something.
Sarah, Sarah, I could have been a decoy or something.
Alison, they were watching you too.
I think we all just need to lay low today, regroup.
That sounds like a pretty good idea to me.
Yes.
Just go back to my useless life
- like I've been told.
- Honey?
Honey?
Kira?
Wanna give me...
Hey.
She just...
She needs a bit of space, love.
So do you.
I will bring her to Dyad.
She won't even tell me what Rachel did to her, and I'm meant to send her back there.
I know it's not easy, but keep the faith.
We're not without allies.
Stay here.
Chain yourself to your sister today.
Donnie, I'm not in the mood for the Church Fall Fun Fairl.

Why do I love my sisters so much when they're ruined my life.
Hey, your life isn't ruined.
It's just waiting for you to come back and sparkle it up.
You're right.
You're right.
I made this fair what it is today, and I won't be sidelined by Nona Walker.
- What...
Not what I meant.
- Get dressed.
Full regalia.
I'll be at the church.
Hi!
- Hi.
- Let's put
- the drinks on the dessert table.
- Right over there?
Oh no, maybe with the side dishes.
I'm sorry,
I know it's heavy.
Does that seem good?
Side dishes?
Uh, drinks always on a separate table.
That way, you avoid a log jam.
- Good.
- Alison, you're early, the Fair doesn't start for another hour.
Well, it might not start at all at this rate.
Where are we here?
Okay, so let's just take a big breath, dear.
- Okay?
- Excuse me?
Well, they said that you might do this, try to undermine me.
Who said that?
Well, Eileen and Nina and Nancy and Sta...
Well, everybody.
And I said, "No, Alison's not like that."
So for your sake, let's just not prove them right, Okay?
- Okay.
- Great!
Maybe next year, Alison.
That one goes on the hot-dog table.
- Nona.
- Alison, you're still here?
I-I-I wanted to apologize to you.
I've not been myself lately.
My family and my reputation, you know.
So just feeling a little useless.
- Oh, golly!
- You must be parched, you're working so hard.
Have a drink.
Oh, it's very thoughtful of you, thank you!
- No problem.
- Alison, welcome.
I hope you're not too dispirited about
- the changing of the guard.
- N-no.
No!
Nonna and I have worked it out.
Well, God bless.
He sees your deeds big and small.
So you can take solace in that.
- Mm-hmm.
- Ah-ah-ah!
I just realized that I have had this in my car for weeks.
The paraffins alone would have killed you.
I'll get you a different one.
Aldous was so proud when he published this book, and yet, P.T. Westmoreland told me he wrote it.
And Aldous just dumbed it down.
I didn't know that.
Well, the imaging alone shows the foetus had a rapid
- and unexplained recovery.
- Yes,
Helena's children could prove even more vital than Kira.
Donnie Hendrix may be holding back regarding Helena.
Well, we have more persuasive leverage, don't we?
I'll instruct the detectives.
Detective Bell, what's going on?
You tell me.
I am highland dancing later today.
Is that breaching my bail conditions?
We have a search warrant.
For what?
I, uh, I've already been charged.
This isn't about drug trafficking, Donnie.
It's about a bunch of dead Portuguese gangsters and one seriously bloody paper cutter.
Oh, come on!
This is, uh... this is a shakedown.

Okay.
She really was pretty, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Do you ever feel like this is somehow our fault?
What are you... what are you talking about?
It was an accident.
She kicked me out of the house because we had an affair.
If anyone had been home, they could have saved her.
You don't know that.
And we can't change the past.
Yeah.
It's good to see you, Alison.
Why do I have this face?
I could have been born with many faces.
I could have been a cop or I could have been a scientist, but, uh...
I wound up microwaving mini-pizzas and chauffeuring kids to circus camp.
Why this life?
!
Because we're happy?
You're so normal.
You golf and you watch TV and you... commute!
Sometimes, you look at me so strangely.
It's like our entire life is a lie.

- Bad energy in here.
- Oh, my God!
- Alison is no bueno right now.
Oh!
Oh, sweetie, no.
It's just your senses opening up like a flower.
- I don't feel like a flower.
- Oh, sweetie, come outside.
Come feel the grass.
- It's so beautiful.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Be careful with her.
I've said it a hundred times,
- "I don't know where Helena is."
- Anything on here?
Child porn?
Tax evasion?
Pouchy's client list.
No.
I have to call my wife.
I need that cell phone as well.
Are you backing this play?
Donnie... please.
I'm expected on stage at the Fall Fun Fair.
So go, dance with the stars.
No law says you have to stick around.
Are we cool, Donnie?
Yeah, we're cool.
Just... keep 'em out of the garage.
Do you remember your car accident, Kira?
Yeah.
Ms. S said it was a miracle.
What if I told you it might not be a miracle at all.
Might actually be something in your genes.
That's what Auntie Cosima thinks.
Yes, she would.
I have a present for you.
Another very special creature.
- A mouse!
- Mm-hmm!
- Aww!
- This is a spiny mouse.
This mouse has the remarkable ability to grow back its own skin and fur.
- How?
- That is the mystery.
Can I pick him up?
Sure.
He's evolved this way so that, when he's grasped by a predator, he slides right out of his own skin and escapes.
- Oh, come on.
- I think it's rather painless.
Everybody says I can't trust you.
Do you?
This is fun.
Kira's already turning her back on me.
She thinks Rachel's gonna teach her who she is, and I'm just this bitch who just says no.
No.
Yes.
Bum in chair.
You are sitting for me.
- I'm not sitting for you.
- Yes, you are sitting for me because S benched us.
And I know that's agony for you, but then, let's do something constructive with that.
Why do you insist on painting naked?
It's my process.
And you have no influence on it, so just relax.
Eyes forward.
- Prfff!
- Great!
Just be natural.
Ramone!
- You, you ripped us off!
- Mrs. Hendrix?
Kellerman fronted us those pills and you left us holding the bag!
That's not true.
That product was
- bought and paid for.
- You...
Aaah...
You are not gonna weasel me this time.
- I want my 35 grand.
- Oh, just hold on.
Would I come here, to your church, if I scammed you?
Just consider the possibility that Kellerman saw you for the rookie you were and took advantage.
We got taken.
He's a snake, I should have warned you.
I am such a colossal failure at everything.
Not to me, Mrs. Hendrix.
Can I, uh, help take the edge off?
No.
No.
Absolutely not.

Police?
- Yeah.
- Why?
- They're trying to tie us

Well, there's no evidence tying us to Pouchy, is there?
No, but there are a few bodies buried in our garage.
What do you think happens when Rachel discovers that I killed Leekie?
Well, I didn't shoot him in the face, did I?
No, you only let Aynsley Norris strangle to death.
I thought she was my monitor, and that turned out to be you!
Hey, I'm not proud of what I did!
Enger!
Oh, shit!
Planting evidence?
Whoops!
Is that blood from the Pouchino crime scene?
Yeah.
Bloody clothes.
You know the Hendrixes didn't do it, Matty.
Hmm...
There's the irony, I think we both know who did.
Helena.
I added clone blood in there too.
Tie the wife to the crime... the husband spills Helena's location.
Ah!
That kind of looks like a grave, don't it?
Yes, Ma'am.
I'm on it.
Ugh!

Donnie, what's going on?
Oh, a little.
I'm at the church fair.
Alison is blottoed, and the cops are searching my house.
What?
Uh, is Art there?
Yes, he was.
I don't know if he can, but I told him to keep them out of the garage with its occupants.
Oh, shit!
Leekie.
And Helena's dead Castor.
Don't forget about him.

Sarah, I have lost my line right now.
I need to know.
It's bad, but not for you.
Okay?
It's Dr. Leekie.
Donnie killed him.
Oh!
What about Art, Sarah?
Doesn't he have some option?
He's as twisted up as you are, Alison.
This is my fault.

She's gonna come after all of us.
Okay, I'll tell 'em.

- Where Helena is.
You knew all along?
Mm-hmm.
She made me swear not to tell anyone but Sarah.
Uh, uh, no, no.
We're not giving up where Helena is.
- No, of course not.
- Well, I'm sorry.
I don't know how to get us out of this.
That's Okay.
This is our doing.
Rachel should know that.
Yeah.
- Can you take him home, please?

I know you look down on me, Rachel.
You probably wonder why on earth my sisters even bother with me.
But I've been in this fight since the beginning with Beth, even before Sarah, and I'm in it for the long haul.
Well, looks like we're missing something.
Ah!
It was an accident.
Dr. Leekie pushed Donnie over the edge, and he didn't have basic firearm safety.
Aldous Leekie is buried in your garage?
Minus the head which was donated to science.
For most of my life,
I hated Aldous.
But I chose not to kill him.
The other body, who is it?
A Castor.
Tell me Helena's location, and this all goes away.
Even if I knew where she was, I wouldn't tell you.
This isn't our problem, it's yours.
So go ahead, file murder charges against us.
It all leads back to you and your office.
Do you really think your new boss would want all that attention on Neolution?
Here.
Get them out of my house.
Get them out of my house!
- Enger.
- It's Rachel.
Something's come up on my end.
I need to know what you found, Detective.
Ma'am, there's a body here, but, um, we can't ID it just yet.
What, uh, what would you like us to do?
Well, dispose of the bodies discreetly and put the garage back in order.
Okay.
We'll stand down.
Looks like the Hendrixes squirmed out of this one.
What would you have me do with you now?
Do whatever you want with me, but leave Helena alone.
I should like to put my hands around your neck and squeeze.
Then, we're not so different, you and I.
You did it, hon.
You went toe to toe with Rachel Duncan and didn't give up where Helena is hiding.
Hey, what's wrong?
I just...
I feel like
I've been rattling around my own skin for some time, and...
I think I finally popped loose.
I need to go away for a while.
Oh!
You're my rock.
I'm not leaving,
I'm just...
I need to see the kids and I, uh... and see who I am outside of all of this.
You mean,
- like a yoga retreat?
- No.
I don't know what my destination is.
I just need...
- I know this is right.
- Yeah.
Oh.
I know there's something you want, my highlander.

- You wanna do this?
- Mm-hmm.

Mr. Pouchino, what about that refund?
- I got refund.
- M.K. is dead.
- I don't want to with you!
- Enough!
- I'm going with Rachel!
- No, that's enough!
We are going to take such good care of you.
Oh, my goodness!
I have stick in belly.
- Ah!
Ah!
- Now, where's Helena?
- Come on!
- Gonna be so good.
Hendrix, that was quite the feed.
I mean, I'll have to unbutton here.
Was that a cream-cheese frosting?
- I don't know, is it?
- Oh, you are evil,
- Alison Hendrix.
- I'll email you the recipe.
No, you will not.
Hey!
Haha!
She's so tough.

- Hey, Alison, it's Beth.
I told you not to call me anymore.
Look.
You know ignoring this isn't gonna make it go away.
- Okay?
I warned you when we met.
- Beth, we look alike, that's it.
This other C-word business,
I-I-I don't even know what to say about it.
It's hokum.
Okay?
The, uh...
- Alison?
- Uh...
Yeah.
Great!
All sold.
Raffle tickets sold!
Great!
Okay.
Bye.
You have been phone-fussing all night.
Have you got something going on the side?
What?
!
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Yeah.
Ahem!
So, guys, uhhh,
Aynsley and I have a little proposition for the two of you.
We've been thinking that it's time to shake things up a little bit.
Oh.
I, uh...
Oh!
No.
- Oh, my God!
- No, no, no.
- No, no!
Not that!
No, no, no!
- Okay, what we were thinking was a little... magic mushrooms.
Yeah, no.
I can't.
I tried them once, and they went right to my bowels.
Ohh, Donnie, come on!
No.
Alison and I, we prefer to stick to alcohol poisoning, right?
- Is everything Okay there, honey?
- Yeah, yeah.
Why don't we open up a Merlot.
Mhm?
You know what?
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Yes.
That is what I'm talking about, Hendrix.
Right here!
Are you sure about this?
She's in denial.
She needs to see another face.
Yeah, but you're basically asking me to, like, drop a bomb in the middle of a Norman Rockwell painting.
Yeah.
Just get it over with.
Okay.
We need Helena's location, and you're going to tell me.
So where did she go, Mr. Hendrix?
I already told you, I don't know.
Abandoned you, did she?
Like you abandoned me in the woods?
I didn't abandon you, Alison.
Look, Mister...?
- Frontenac.
- Right.
Tell Rachel when you found me, I was looking for Helena.
No, tell Rachel that Helena's not gonna let her suck stem cells out of her babies!
Not exactly a scientist, are you, Mrs. Hendrix.
I studied kinesiology.
Cosima is a real scientist and a very valuable one.
Sarah and Helena are fertile, biologically priceless.
- And then there's you.
- I'm a mother
- and a homemaker.
- As you go back today to your vapid existence,
I want you to consider your worth.
Because even M.K. had more value than you.
My hand is purple, and it makes the hair all fuzzy.
- I'm seeing tracers.
- Why are my socks wet?
Okay...
Cold water for everyone.
Yeah?
Got ice in it and everything.
And I've got
- poison control on speed dial.
- Donnie, Donnie, bro, have a beer, take your shirt off.
What?
No!
It's Alison's
- mystery man again.
- What?

I'm sorry.
- You're the other one.

I'm sorry about this whole ambush thing.
It was totally Beth's idea.
She just thought it would be a good idea for you to see
- another one of us.
- You have a nose ring.
Yeah, brilliant observation.
- We are so completely different.
- I know, which you may find totally freaky, but I find it...
I find it so fascinating!
Like, this is you and I'm from
- "Berkeley." Okay?
- I don't even know what that means.
And like, Beth is a cop.
Right?
You know?
But genetically speaking, we're all... we're all family.
Who are we really?
Yeah, that's the existential question, isn't it?
But what Beth is proposing is that we all get together, hang out all the time.
Okay, you're just gonna stay with us.
Whoa.
Whoa!
No.
No.
Whoa.
We're gonna talk.
We're gonna talk, talk, talk about it.
Dude, are you high?
'Cause your eyes are like saucers.
- I can't deal with this.
- Our...
Okay.
Alright.
Shit.
Oh, M.K.
I could have done something.
Sarah, Sarah, I could have been a decoy or something.
Alison, they were watching you too.
I think we all just need to lay low today, regroup.
That sounds like a pretty good idea to me.
Yes.
Just go back to my useless life
- like I've been told.
- Honey?
Honey?
Kira?
Wanna give me...
Hey.
She just...
She needs a bit of space, love.
So do you.
I will bring her to Dyad.
She won't even tell me what Rachel did to her, and I'm meant to send her back there.
I know it's not easy, but keep the faith.
We're not without allies.
Stay here.
Chain yourself to your sister today.
Donnie, I'm not in the mood for the Church Fall Fun Fairl.

Honey, come on.
What is the Fall Fun Fair without Team Hendrix?
I can't stop thinking about M.K.
and Cosima out there all alone.
Why do I love my sisters so much when they're ruined my life.
Hey, your life isn't ruined.
It's just waiting for you to come back and sparkle it up.
You're right.
You're right.
I made this fair what it is today, and I won't be sidelined by Nona Walker.
- What...
Not what I meant.
- Get dressed.
Full regalia.
I'll be at the church.
Hi!
- Hi.
- Let's put
- the drinks on the dessert table.
- Right over there?
Oh no, maybe with the side dishes.
I'm sorry,
I know it's heavy.
Does that seem good?
Side dishes?
Uh, drinks always on a separate table.
That way, you avoid a log jam.
- Good.
- Alison, you're early, the Fair doesn't start for another hour.
Well, it might not start at all at this rate.
Where are we here?
Okay, so let's just take a big breath, dear.
- Okay?
- Excuse me?
Well, they said that you might do this, try to undermine me.
Who said that?
Well, Eileen and Nina and Nancy and Sta...
Well, everybody.
And I said, "No, Alison's not like that."
So for your sake, let's just not prove them right, Okay?
- Okay.
- Great!
Maybe next year, Alison.
That one goes on the hot-dog table.
- Nona.
- Alison, you're still here?
I-I-I wanted to apologize to you.
I've not been myself lately.
My family and my reputation, you know.
So just feeling a little useless.
- Oh, golly!
- You must be parched, you're working so hard.
Have a drink.
Oh, it's very thoughtful of you, thank you!
- No problem.
- Alison, welcome.
I hope you're not too dispirited about
- the changing of the guard.
- N-no.
No!
Nonna and I have worked it out.
Well, God bless.
He sees your deeds big and small.
So you can take solace in that.
- Mm-hmm.
- Ah-ah-ah!
I just realized that I have had this in my car for weeks.
The paraffins alone would have killed you.
I'll get you a different one.
Aldous was so proud when he published this book, and yet, P.T. Westmoreland told me he wrote it.
And Aldous just dumbed it down.
I didn't know that.
Well, the imaging alone shows the foetus had a rapid
- and unexplained recovery.
- Yes,
Helena's children could prove even more vital than Kira.
Donnie Hendrix may be holding back regarding Helena.
Well, we have more persuasive leverage, don't we?
I'll instruct the detectives.
Detective Bell, what's going on?
You tell me.
I am highland dancing later today.
Is that breaching my bail conditions?
We have a search warrant.
For what?
I, uh, I've already been charged.
This isn't about drug trafficking, Donnie.
It's about a bunch of dead Portuguese gangsters and one seriously bloody paper cutter.
Oh, come on!
This is, uh... this is a shakedown.

Okay.
She really was pretty, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Do you ever feel like this is somehow our fault?
What are you... what are you talking about?
It was an accident.
She kicked me out of the house because we had an affair.
If anyone had been home, they could have saved her.
You don't know that.
And we can't change the past.
Yeah.
It's good to see you, Alison.
Why do I have this face?
I could have been born with many faces.
I could have been a cop or I could have been a scientist, but, uh...
I wound up microwaving mini-pizzas and chauffeuring kids to circus camp.
Why this life?
!
Because we're happy?
You're so normal.
You golf and you watch TV and you... commute!
Sometimes, you look at me so strangely.
It's like our entire life is a lie.

- Bad energy in here.
- Oh, my God!
- Alison is no bueno right now.
Oh!
Oh, sweetie, no.
It's just your senses opening up like a flower.
- I don't feel like a flower.
- Oh, sweetie, come outside.
Come feel the grass.
- It's so beautiful.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Be careful with her.
I've said it a hundred times,
- "I don't know where Helena is."
- Anything on here?
Child porn?
Tax evasion?
Pouchy's client list.
No.
I have to call my wife.
I need that cell phone as well.
Are you backing this play?
Donnie... please.
I'm expected on stage at the Fall Fun Fair.
So go, dance with the stars.
No law says you have to stick around.
Are we cool, Donnie?
Yeah, we're cool.
Just... keep 'em out of the garage.
Do you remember your car accident, Kira?
Yeah.
Ms. S said it was a miracle.
What if I told you it might not be a miracle at all.
Might actually be something in your genes.
That's what Auntie Cosima thinks.
Yes, she would.
I have a present for you.
Another very special creature.
- A mouse!
- Mm-hmm!
- Aww!
- This is a spiny mouse.
This mouse has the remarkable ability to grow back its own skin and fur.
- How?
- That is the mystery.
Can I pick him up?
Sure.
He's evolved this way so that, when he's grasped by a predator, he slides right out of his own skin and escapes.
- Oh, come on.
- I think it's rather painless.
Everybody says I can't trust you.
Do you?
This is fun.
Kira's already turning her back on me.
She thinks Rachel's gonna teach her who she is, and I'm just this bitch who just says no.
No.
Yes.
Bum in chair.
You are sitting for me.
- I'm not sitting for you.
- Yes, you are sitting for me because S benched us.
And I know that's agony for you, but then, let's do something constructive with that.
Why do you insist on painting naked?
It's my process.
And you have no influence on it, so just relax.
Eyes forward.
- Prfff!
- Great!
Just be natural.
Ramone!
- You, you ripped us off!
- Mrs. Hendrix?
Kellerman fronted us those pills and you left us holding the bag!
That's not true.
That product was
- bought and paid for.
- You...
Aaah...
You are not gonna weasel me this time.
- I want my 35 grand.
- Oh, just hold on.
Would I come here, to your church, if I scammed you?
Just consider the possibility that Kellerman saw you for the rookie you were and took advantage.
We got taken.
He's a snake, I should have warned you.
I am such a colossal failure at everything.
Not to me, Mrs. Hendrix.
Can I, uh, help take the edge off?
No.
No.
Absolutely not.

Just Neo police searching our house.

Police?
- Yeah.
- Why?
- They're trying to tie us

Well, there's no evidence tying us to Pouchy, is there?
No, but there are a few bodies buried in our garage.
What do you think happens when Rachel discovers that I killed Leekie?
Well, I didn't shoot him in the face, did I?
No, you only let Aynsley Norris strangle to death.
I thought she was my monitor, and that turned out to be you!
Hey, I'm not proud of what I did!
Enger!
Oh, shit!
Planting evidence?
Whoops!
Is that blood from the Pouchino crime scene?
Yeah.
Bloody clothes.
You know the Hendrixes didn't do it, Matty.
Hmm...
There's the irony, I think we both know who did.
Helena.
I added clone blood in there too.
Tie the wife to the crime... the husband spills Helena's location.
Ah!
That kind of looks like a grave, don't it?
Yes, Ma'am.
I'm on it.
Ugh!

Donnie, what's going on?
Oh, a little.
I'm at the church fair.
Alison is blottoed, and the cops are searching my house.
What?
Uh, is Art there?
Yes, he was.
I don't know if he can, but I told him to keep them out of the garage with its occupants.
Oh, shit!
Leekie.
And Helena's dead Castor.
Don't forget about him.

I am part of a sisterhood that you couldn't even begin to understand.
And thank God, you never will.
Where are you going?

We're so sorry you're in this position.
See?

- for you anymore.

Duko?
No.
No, no, no.

Do you think she would bury him in the Hendrix garage?
Then who is it?
Sarah, I have lost my line right now.
I need to know.
It's bad, but not for you.
Okay?
It's Dr. Leekie.
Donnie killed him.
Oh!
What about Art, Sarah?
Doesn't he have some option?
He's as twisted up as you are, Alison.
This is my fault.
I'm the one that shot Dr. Lee...
- Leekie.
- Sarah, what's Rachel gonna do when she discovers decapitated Leekie?
She's gonna come after all of us.
Okay, I'll tell 'em.
- Tell them what?
- Where Helena is.
You knew all along?
Mm-hmm.
She made me swear not to tell anyone but Sarah.
Uh, uh, no, no.
We're not giving up where Helena is.
- No, of course not.
- Well, I'm sorry.
I don't know how to get us out of this.
That's Okay.
This is our doing.
Rachel should know that.
Yeah.
- Can you take him home, please?
- Yeah.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna make myself useful for once.
Yes?
Alison Hendrix is here.
Well done, Mr. Frontenac.
Hoohoo!
Found the squishy.
Alison Hendrix.
At last we meet.
Yes, well, I suppose my entire life is filed away here somewhere.
It is.
Not that I've paid much attention to it.
I know you look down on me, Rachel.
You probably wonder why on earth my sisters even bother with me.
But I've been in this fight since the beginning with Beth, even before Sarah, and I'm in it for the long haul.

Okay.

What would you have me do with you now?
Do whatever you want with me, but leave Helena alone.

A Castor.
Tell me Helena's location, and this all goes away.

This isn't our problem, it's yours.
So go ahead, file murder charges against us.

Well, dispose of the bodies discreetly and put the garage back in order.

(theme music)
(hubbub)
What's this presentation supposed to be about anyway?
I don't know, Higgins, but if Detective Murdoch invited us,
I'm sure it's something worthwhile.
It's probably about fingermarks or something boring.
Higgins, fingermarks have allowed us to catch more criminals than you...
Oh, shh, there's the Detective now.
Ladies and gentlemen.
You are about to be the first to witness the most revolutionary development in human history.
- I knew it.
Fingermarks.
- That's right, an invention so incredible that it will irrevocably change life on Earth as we know it.
- (reactions of surprise)
- But before I get too far, allow me to pay tribute to the man who's creation it is, a man who unfortunately cannot be with us here, today, due to his... most unfortunate demise.
That's right, none of us would be able to be here today were it not for the brilliance of the late James Pendrick.
- Late?
- Is Mr. Pendrick dead?
If he's dead and the Inspector was traveling with him, then...
James Pendrick was an inventor of the highest order.
Before he expired, he had nearly perfected a powerful potion of guarana.
Sadly, it was left incomplete.
Until now.
But I, William Murdoch, have taken that dream to reality.
(some puzzled reactions in the crowd)
I have created an additive which will unlock
Mr. Pendrick's formulation.
The result... will be the most incredible innovation the world has ever seen... "Pendrimine!"
- (reactions in the crowd) - (with a chuckle):
My God!
- He hasn't even told us what it does yet.
- Now, some of you may know my friend and colleague,
Inspector Thomas Brackenreid.
Now, as you can see, his best days have passed behind him.
- (chuckles)
- Time had taken its toll.
But, after imbibing just one dose of Pendrimine, this is him today!
(strong reaction from the crowd)
- It can't be...
- That's right!
I'm a young man again!
James Pendrick has given me the gift of eternal bloody youth!
(applause)
(swelling of epic music)
It was like nothing I'd ever experienced.
I could feel myself changing.
In a matter of minutes it was done.
I was young again.
Sir, how do we actually know that... you're you?
Bloody hell, Higgins, who else would I be?
- So, sir, what happens now?
- Will you ever grow old again?
Not if I keep drinking the stuff, Crabtree.
OY!
You'll get yours in due time!
Besides, this is only the additive won't do a thing without Pendrick's formula.
So... where is the actual formula, then?
Ah, Murdoch's squirreled it away where it can't be touched.
So, how did all this come to pass?
I mean, what happened in Panama?
What happened to James Pendrick?
Agh, we journeyed south and reclaimed his stolen formula from Ashmi.
As he toiled, I adventured, in search of the critical ingredient:
the super guarana of Panama.
- (little chuckle)
- But one day I returned to a commotion in our laboratory.
We'd been ransacked, the formula stolen and...
James Pendrick was dead.
Now, I must remind you to prepare yourself for a bit of a shock.
Where has Thomas been all this time, and why didn't he come home when he came back from Panama?
We've had to keep him under close observation.
I remind you this is a highly experimental drug, Mrs. Brackenreid.
- (indistinct comment)
- We all will, Crabtree.
Margaret!
- No...
- It's true, Margaret.
- It's me.
- Ah...
I don't believe it.
You're not Thomas.
Look at you!
I am, Margaret.
I swear it.
- Impossible.
- Let me prove it.
- Ask me anything.
Go on.
- Uh...
Alright.
Where were you when John was born?
I was right here, in Station Four, trapped under three feet of snow.
But when I heard the news,
I dug my way out with a latrine bucket, and was there before the midwife handed him back to you.
Oh, Thomas!
It really is you!
Ah...
- Ooh...
- Ooh... (knocking):
Sir.
Another message for you.
This one couriered over locally.
"Mr. X."
Must be another potential buyer.
Word is spreading, George.
People from all over the world are interested in my Pendrimine.
I'll be inviting them all to a special meeting soon to entertain their official offers.
Sir...
I don't mean to speak out of turn, but... it seems to me that you're not... overly concerned with Mr. Pendrick's murder.
Well, what can we do from here, George?
We know nothing of the circumstances, we have no access to the body, to the police report...
We have little choice but to leave the investigation to the Panamanians.
Yes, I suppose so.
Although, it also surprises me somewhat that you seem... so intent on... selling the Pendrimine.
Only because
I've tried to monetize your inventions in the past, you've always declined.
This one is different, George.
Alone, I could create a few doses of Pendrimine a month.
But someone with sufficient capital could make enough for the entire world!
- So it's not really the money that you're after.
- Not in the least.
The bidding will begin at one hundred million dollars.
(strong reactions)
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, please.
Consider what's on offer here.
Most would give their entire fortunes in exchange for eternal youth!
And I am not just selling one dose, no.
The formula itself, to one buyer.
- The value is limitless.
- (some reactions)
I await your bids.
♪
Henry, have you noticed something about the Detective is different?
The Detective?
Yes.
He's not himself.
The Detective, not the Inspector?
No, the Inspector seems fine.
He's thirty years younger.
Well that's just because he's taken the Pendrimine.
He still acts like the Inspector.
To me, the Detective is acting like somebody else altogether.
- I don't know what to say to that, George.
- Well,
I've got proof.
Look.
Detective Murdoch told me he didn't know anything about the police investigation in Panama into Pendrick's death.
I found this police report in his files.
- You went through his files?
- Unfortunately, it's in Spanish,
I can't make out a word of it.
You don't speak Spanish, do you?
You stole this from the Detective?
Well he wasn't doing anything with it.
I'm telling you, Detective Murdoch has become a money-hungry madman who's turned his back on the law!
He's still our boss, George.
(sigh) Now remember,
- this is strictly off the record.
- Si, claro.
How do you know how to speak Spanish, anyway?
Te lo dije: soy castellana!
Crecìa hablando español todos los dias.
Y mi abuela no hablò una palabra de Ingles.
My grandmother is Spanish.
- Ah.
- Come on, vamos a ver.
(sighing):
Panama City police report.
Dr. James Pendrick.
Homicide.
Inyectado con veneno... he was poisoned.
Poisoned with what?
No identificado.
- Unidentified.
- Muy bien.
It says here he had a number of symptoms:
vomiting, convulsions, excessive slavering, and near instant hair loss.
He was believed to be dead within ten to twenty minutes.
My God!
What kind of poison does all that?
The case remains open.
But they were able to trace the man they believe was the murderer back to a ship which fled Panama under the alias...
- "P.D. Lion."
- P.D. Lion?
Oh!
P.D. Lion!
- That's quite clever.
- How so?
Lion in Spanish is Leon.
P.D. Leon.
Ponce de Leon.
Of course.
If you're gonna chase the fountain of youth, you might as well name yourself after the most famous fountain hunter in history.
Don't worry, I won't write anything.
I'll save this one for my memoirs.
No, it's not that, it's just...
I have no idea what I'm going to do with this.
Detective Murdoch lied to me.
(ominous music)
- Dr. Ogden.
- Oh, George!
What a pleasant surprise!
What can I help you with?
It's a personal matter.
It's about the Detective.
- Oh?
- Have you noticed that he's been... acting strange lately?
Not particularly.
Perhaps a small shift.
We have recently learned that we'll live forever.
Rather a big revelation in one's life!
Right, it's just he seems very... focused on selling this Pendrimine.
Yes.
To a buyer who can deliver it to the world.
Right, yes, he did say that.
Thank you, Doctor.
Um, while I have you, do you know of a poison that could cause hair loss,
- vomiting, and convulsions?
- Uh...
Oh, and excessive saliva.
I can't say that I do.

- He asked about the symptoms?
- He knows something.
It could be a problem.
If all goes according to plan, it will be over tonight.
(indistinct cries and chatter)
(suspenseful, yet comical music)
(inaudible conversation)
- (clicking of some weapon)
- Wait!
Toronto Constabulary!
- Sir, are you all right?
- What's going on?
- George?
- Sir?
I was just...
Bloody hell, Crabtree.
You just let James Pendrick's killer get away!
(suspenseful music)
I don't understand.
If you're both the Inspector, then
- who took the Pendrimine?
- No one, George.
This man isn't the Inspector.
The Pendrimine is a ruse.
It doesn't work?
At all?
I'd best start at the beginning.
Everything you heard about what happened in Panama is true.
We caught Ashmi and resumed work on the formulation.
Then there was an attack.
James' work was stolen.
- So he really was killed.
- Poisoned.
I tried to save him.
He died in my arms.
Murdered for a potion that doesn't even work.
So why pretend that it did?
That was my idea.
After the attack,
I thought I'd track the killer down as best I could.
But he fled the country using an alias.
- (swallowing):
P.D. Lion.
- Precisely.
I found out that he'd traveled to Toronto, so I followed.
On the boat, I met this actor.
Very good looking young lad.
The best mimic I'd ever heard.
Quinton Prout.
Good to meet you, Constable.
Yes, you as well.
The Inspector's plan was simple.
Pretend that I'd created the key "additive."
And that the formula that the thief stole actually worked.
Pendrimine as a whole would be valuable to everyone.
But the additive alone would only be worth something to the person
- who'd stolen the formula.
- Pendrick's killer.
One of the buyers sent a messenger to tell me that he was intent on seeing the additive in person.
- We were to meet him tonight.
- Ambush him, and when he made a grab for it, we were to arrest him.
(sighing):
And I scared him off.
(all three, agreeing):
Hm... (Murdoch):
All we can hope for now is that he'll resurface.
I'll find him.
I can track down that motorized bicycle.
I'll do it first thing tomorrow, I swear.
(soft transition music)
- Hey, George.
- Samuel.
I could use some help.
I could use some myself.
Business has really picked up since we've been in the paper.
Listen, I'm looking for an electric motorized bicycle.
Unusual design.
Thick wheels, brass trimmed battery packs...
Ah, you haven't seen anything like that around here.
But...
I do know a man who knows every motorized bicycle in the city.
- I'll get back to you in an hour?
- I'll be at Station House Four.
Oh, George.
Nina left this for you.
Some of your things, I gather?
How is she?
She's well, as far as I can see.
Right.

Higgins!
The stables are a right mess.
- Get out there!
- Sir, perhaps you've forgotten,
- but I'm a Constable First Class.
- I haven't forgotten a bloody thing, Higgins!
Go!

Detective Murdoch.
My name is Tanner.
Canadian Intelligence.
What can I do for you, Mr. Tanner?
The Prime Minister has heard tell of your invention.
He has sent me to obtain it on behalf of the federal government of Canada.
Well, you are more than welcome to make a bid for it.
Hm.
Think this through, Detective.
Capitalism has its limits.
Even the wealthiest company in the world could not pay your price.
With all due respect, Agent Tanner...
- Hm - ... my formula will change life as we know it.
- No price is too high.
- Oh, I agree.
Can you imagine if, say, the Americans were to live forever?
Their eternal strength would render Canada helpless.
Our nation would be cast into grave peril.
Hm!
Very well, then.
- What's Canada's offer?
- Canada's offer is zero.
We simply hope that you will do the right thing.
It would be a shame if you were to be convicted of... treason.
Good day.

- "The Curse of the Pharaohs."

No, I really don't think you'd like it.
I mean, it's full of... flights of fancy, which...
- which really is its strength, but...
- Perfect!

George, do you not want me to read it?
Come on, I won't be mean.
Of course I want you to read it.
I would like to get you a new copy, this is... very worn.
It's...
Fine.
But get it for me soon, will you?
I don't like the idea of spending a night without George Crabtree by my bedside.

I'm not quite sure how to say this, Inspector.
- It's about your wife.
- Margaret?
- Has she figured it out?
- No, sir,
- quite to the contrary.
- How's that?
Well, last night she expected I would be doing the same things you yourself would do upon your return home.
Ah.
The gate needs mending.
Yes, no I've seen to the gate.
But there were other, shall we say, expectations...
She was rather insistent that I resume my... or rather, that I resume your, uh...
Ahem!
- ... husbandly duties.
- Did you?
- No!
- Well then, what's the problem?
Well, she was rather demanding, sir.
A woman has needs, Mr. Prout.
- And Margaret is very much a woman.
- Oh!
I'm not sure I can keep her at bay much longer.
Have an extra whiskey with supper.
Once she's clearing the dishes, go straight to the bedroom and start snoring.
It always works for me!
Sir.
Sirs.
No.
Sir.
We have an address for the motorbike.
Right. then.
Let's get to it.
- Actually, sir, I wasn't sent to fetch you.
- What?
You're to stay in hiding just in case this isn't our man.
We can't risk exposing the ruse.
Mr. Prout.
Ahem!
Bollocks.
Let's hope this is our man.
I don't care much for being accused of treason.
- Sir, it is a hangable offense.
- Thank you, George.
- This should be it.
- (strange sound)
You there!
Stop!
Toronto Constabulary!
(strange engine sound)
Who are you?
Identify yourself.
You!
- Pendrick's assistant.
- The name is Ashmi,
Detective.
- (epic music)
- When did you last see Mr. Pendrick?
When he found me in Panama.
He and your Inspector reclaimed what I had stolen.
I stayed for a time but could not regain James' trust.
I returned to Canada some weeks ago.
Then why were you after the additive?
And you specifically requested that our Inspector bring it to you.
- Alone.
- But while in Panama
I heard tell of a man.
Another who was after James' work.
I'd hoped to sell it to him.
You believe this man stole the formula?
- That he killed Mr. Pendrick?
- Who is this man?
He came from Asia.
Or possibly the skies themselves.
Some called him a God.
Have you ever heard the name P.D. Lion?
The man of whom I speak had no name.
- Only a letter.
- A letter?
They called him Senor Equis.
George, the card we received.
Mr. X.
He's tried to contact us.
Sir, we have an address.
(knocking)
(nice, exotic music)
Mr. X?
Senor Equis?
Gentlemen.
What took you so long?
Terrence Meyers?
The great rocket shook us and blastered throught the atmosphere.
The azure globe shimmering beneath me, vast oceans rolling, entire continents within my view.
I had flown higher than any living thing ever had.
It was the greatest adventure ever known to man.
And then, nothing.
Blackness.
Not only had I touched the face of God...
I became God.
God?
Hm.
I recall nothing of the descent.
All I know is I awoke to the smiling faces of the Murut.
I was now in Sabah, near the village of Nabawan.
And in that village, I was no longer human.
I was Ranying.
Supreme God, fallen from above.
Good Lord!
These people believed you to be God.
I tried to convince them otherwise, but these people had not seen a tin opener, let alone a flying rocket.
I had, after all, descended upon them as if... by magic.
I...
I lived among the Murut for many, many months.
My soul, purified.
My mind, cleared.
My powers... limitless.
My... tumpas, my tattoos, symbols of my status.
Then how did you end up in Panama?
I was en route to America when... word came from the Prime Minister.
Rumours had surfaced about the possible existence of a "Fountain of Youth"
invented by none other than James Pendrick.
But now, thanks to you, Murdoch, eternal life may be Canada's after all.
Mr. Meyers, the Pendrimine doesn't actually do anything.
- You see...
- You see, it's useless unless it is mixed properly.
The Pendrimine has no effect unless it is combined with my additive using specialized equipment, of course.
What equipment?
Chemical synthesizers that can be found in James Pendrick's laboratory, here, in Toronto.
I see.
Well, hand it all over.
The Canadian government insists on it.
I will.
But not yet.
Murdoch, you can't sell it.
My only aim is to find and apprehend
James Pendrick's killer.
After that, the Pendrimine is yours.
Bloody Meyers.
I thought he was dead!
It seems Pendrick's rocket was safer than it appeared to be.
Why did you lie to Mr. Meyers?
Why would you tell him the truth about anything?
- The man is quite strange.
- Oh, those tattoos!
Why write a cryptic note when he could have called on us directly?
Maybe he's not working for the government at all.
Still, it doesn't hurt to have him in step with our goal.
He now believes the only way to get the Pendrimine is to work with us.
It may be our only hope of catching the killer.
Well, let's do it quickly.
I can't keep Margaret in the dark about this much longer.
The woman has needs.
(light transition music)
China.
Japan.
Russia.
America.
(reacting in disgust):
And of course, the Ottoman Empire.
An international agent from any one of those governments could be your killer.
How exactly do we know that the killer is a spy?
Have you identified the poison that killed him?
No.
Its symptoms are not known to...
Polonium.
Its devastating effects were discovered by the Germans.
Highly radioactive.
Unclear why it's so deadly.
And this poison is only known to the spy community?
- Exactly.
- Mr. Meyers.
I've been looking for you.
Busy doing your job for you, Tanner.
You know you're not supposed to go anywhere without my knowledge.
Dismissed.
Ah!
(exotic flute music)
(from behind the door):
Detective.
I must warn you that that is not the Terrence Meyers of old.
The man I admired as a trainee was lost somewhere in the Bornean jungle.
But he's returned.
- He asked to be brought back.
- Hm.
Is that what he told you?
The moment Terrence Meyers disappeared into low earth orbit, the government began its search.
Meyers knows far, far too much.
- You were the one who found him.
- Yes.
Eventually.
Only he did not want to be retrieved.
He had become one of the savages.
Meyers cannot be trusted.
Eternal life is at stake, as well you know.
Put your faith where it belongs:
in the capable hands of the Canadian government.
- Mr. Tanner...
- I already know you intend to hand over the Pendrimine as soon as you have caught your killer.
Oh,
I have microphones in Meyers' room.
Of course.
Yes, well, I have confidence that you will find your man.
If you don't trust me, well, you can take it straight to the Prime Minister himself.
So Terrence Meyers is alive.
I never expected to see him again.
I fear the old Terrence Meyers may be gone forever.
Julia, the man is deranged.
Do you believe his theory about Pendrick's killer?
I have no reason to doubt it.
So you'll work with him?
I don't see the harm in it.
So long as I don't allow him to skew our investigation.
Although, truth be told, nothing we've tried thus far has worked.
If the killer is a spy, they may sense a trap.
You may be right.
And if that is the case, we need to make him feel desperate.
(horses' hooves and indistinct conversations)
We give the Pendrimine to the government of Canada.
Wonderful.
Hand it over.
At least that's what we want the killer to believe.
I see.
If the killer thinks that Canada has the key to eternal youth, he'll be desperate to get it for his country.
Lest his nation be left behind and so on.
And if he's more desperate, he'll be more likely to make a mistake, I see that, but why lie about it?
Just give it to us,
- the result is the same.
- I can't do that until the killer is caught.
And how exactly are we supposed to prove the Canadian government has it?
By giving a second man a dose of Pendrimine.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
Laurier?
All he has to do is stay out of sight for a few days.
Can you contact him?
Or have Agent Tanner do it?
Well, I suppose but how do we find someone who looks exactly like a young Laurier?
Few people have even seen a photograph of Laurier as a young man.
All we have to do is find someone who looks like a Prime Minister.
The newspapers will run wild with the story and soon the whole world will know!
Murdoch.
Your Laurier gambit may have worked.
We've had contact from six foreign diplomats, all desperate to obtain the drug for their country.
Let's hope one of them is the man we're looking for.
- Hm.
- (light music)
Hm...
Sir.
There's no evidence that any of these men are P.D. Lion.
And what of Pendrick's formula?
Their rooms are being searched now.
Sir!
It's the Inspector.
He's been attacked.
(indistinct chatter)
Sir.
He's still alive, but unconscious.
It seems he was able to fight off his attacker, and perhaps the entire dose of the poison wasn't administered.
Any symptoms?
The same reportedly suffered by Mr. Pendrick.
He had a bottle of the additive.
Where is it now?
Stolen, it would seem, sir.
Hm...
- When did the attack occur?
- An hour ago, maybe less.
All the diplomats were at Station House Number Four.
If one of them did kill Mr. Pendrick,
I suppose he could have sent someone after the additive.
Indeed.
It would be an excellent opportunity, to strike while establishing an iron-clad alibi.
Sir.
One of Meyers' bracelets?
- Murdoch.
What's going on?
- Sir.
The empty vial.
Terrence Meyers, you are under arrest for the attempted murder of Thomas Brackenreid and for the murder of James Pendrick.
(music swelling dramatically)
Oh, this is preposterous.
Clearly I was set up.
You had the empty vial of additive in your hand.
Which I found in my room shortly before you arrived.
We also found one of your bracelets at the scene.
I have all my tumpas.
Six on the right.
- Five on the left.
- Yes, precisely!
There isn't one missing, Murdoch.
I am Ranying.
My people festooned me with one ring for every head which I...
It doesn't matter.
The point is whatever it is you found did not belong to me.
Who put it there then?
I assume any one of those so-called "diplomats."
The Turks have especially had it in for me.
- The Turks.
- The culprit is likely spiriting the Pendrimine away to his homeland while you're sitting here wasting your time with me.
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Brackenreid.
They say he should regain consciousness soon.
Did you catch him?
Whoever did this?
We did.
(sigh)
(someone coughing nearby)
Mrs. Brackenreid!
(softer):
Stay with him.
I'll return as soon as I'm able, I have...
Oh, did his eyes just open?
I have to tell her!
This has gone on long enough.
Sir, we need to maintain the ruse just a bit longer.
- She was kissing another man!
- One she believes to be you.
- What's your point?
- Well sir, it can hardly be characterized
- as an infidelity if she believes...
- Oh, bloody hell, Murdoch!
I don't care what you characterize it as!
Do you know what it's like seeing your wife kissing another man?
Actually sir, James Pendrick kissed Julia in the days leading up to your departure for Panama...
- Right.
Well then, you know what I'm saying.
- I do, but I was able to subsume those feelings knowing that Julia herself clearly had nothing to do in the matter and obviously has no... feelings for James Pendrick or any other man.
- You've thought this through.
- I have.
- Have you talked with her about it?
- Well, that would imply that it bothers me.
Which it doesn't.
Right.
But...
Why are we wasting time, anyway?
We've arrested Meyers.
Sir, something just doesn't seem right.
Why would Terrance Meyers tell us that he was in Toronto if he intended to steal the additive all along?
The man's out of his mind!
He got a taste for power in Borneo and now he won't stop until he achieves more.
All the same, sir, if we could wait another twenty-four hours.
Just to be sure we have the right man.
Fine.
Another day rotting away in Pendrick's study.
(piano music)
Hello, Constable!
Any good crimes lately?
I'm writing a report on a lady who says her neighbour's horse walks too loudly.
"Nina, you'll be in my heart until the day I die.
Or, if I turn into a mummy, much longer.
Love, George."
Louise!
- Louise, let me just say...
- I'm sorry, George.
I had no intention of going through your things.
I understand why you wouldn't want to give away this copy.
Louise, please...
Look, I didn't intend for any of this.
The man I own the garage with happens to be Nina's brother.
I was there, he gave me some things that she'd left.
I guess she didn't want this anymore.
- Why would you keep that from me?
- I don't know, I...
I...
For a moment, I suppose I felt guilty.
The past came rushing back and I...
And you thought you'd made a mistake.
(nice, mellow music)
It would mean the world to me if you'd read my book, Louise.
Then I will.
(birds chirping and indistinct voices)
You have accused Mr. Meyers of murder in the past.
This is different.
Meyers has been in the far east for too long.
What is his story?
Does it seem rational?
He claims that he's been set up.
That a foreign agent has stolen the additive.
But... why bother setting up Meyers?
Why not simply steal the additive and then vanish into thin air?
Well, if you're unswayed by the alternatives, you have to assume you have your killer behind bars.
I suppose.
And what about the Inspector?
Has he told Margaret yet?
Not yet.
Julia, the last time we saw James Pendrick...
Does any of that bother you?
- The kiss?
- Hm.
(with a chuckle):
No!
I haven't thought about it for a moment.
- Does it bother you?
- Of course not.
He was out of his mind.
And now he's dead.
Indeed.
(light music)
Oh my God.
(coughing)
It's time, Mr. Meyers.
We have to hand you over.
How long have we known each other, Murdoch?
Hm?
Ten years, I suppose.
That sounds about right.
Do you honestly consider me a threat to this country?
To my fellow man?
Come on, you know me.
You know they're gonna consider this treason.
I'll be hanged.
Let me go.
It's not up to me, Mr. Meyers.
Sure it is.
Just open the door, turn your back.
You'll never see me again, I swear.
I'll return to my people.
You would go back to Borneo?
I will never set foot in this country again.
So, what difference does it make if they hang me or... if I simply vanish forever?
(wistful music)
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.
Ah!
Thank you, Detective.
All ready, are we, Meyers?
The Prime Minister awaits.
And I assure you he is not in a merciful mood.
♪
Murdoch!
Where's Murdoch?
Murdoch!
- Sir?
- Oh!
No, sir, why are you so old again?
Oh my God, sir, what's happened?
- Just yesterday you were a young man!
- Oh, get off, Crabtree.
- Where's Murdoch?
- Sir?
The place has been ransacked.
All Pendrick's equipment's been stolen.
Of course.
Meyers believed Pendrick's equipment was crucial
- in synthesizing the Pendrimine.
- But I was there.
The place hadn't been robbed yet when Mr. Prout was attacked...
- when Meyers was arrested.
- Who's Mr. Prout?
- Young me!
- But you're young you.
- Oh, shut up, Higgins.
- Then it couldn't be Meyers.
Then who?
Did you tell anyone the lie about the laboratory?
No.
But someone else was listening in on the conversation.
But...
Stop!
Driver, stop!
What's the problem?
What's going on?
Wait a minute...
Agent Tanner, you are under arrest for the murder of James Pendrick
- and the attempted murder...
- Me?
I think not.
We know it was you.
You're P.D. Lion.
What of it?
You can't prove that I killed Pendrick.
You poisoned a man here, in Toronto.
When he recovers, he'll identify you.
So?
If the Inspector survives, what will you charge me with?
Attempted murder?
(chuckles)
It's enough to lock you up.
And stop you from taking the Pendrimine back to Ottawa.
Ottawa?
No, no, no.
In the hands of the masses, eternal life would cause an epidemic of overpopulation.
I took it for myself...
well, myself and... a handful of the wealthiest buyers in the world, so... lock me up.
Five years, ten, twenty.
Time matters not in the face of... (takes a deep breath): ... eternal life.
Ah!
Second ever dose of Pendrimine, mixed by my own hand.
Everlasting youth... is mine.
I don't believe we've met.
Inspector Thomas C. Brackenreid.
(Murdoch):
You've been had.
No... (snigger)
Margaret.
It's me.
But... but... he's you.
I'm sorry but no.
I'm me, warts and all.
- So it was all a lie?
- (He sighs.)
I didn't want to hide it from you.
But I had to.
It was the only way to catch Pendrick's killer.
It had to seem real.
People had to see that you believed it.
(chuckles)
Uh, people believed it, because I played the part.
I didn't believe for one second that this young man was you.
- You didn't?
- Of course not!
He was far too considerate, for one.
I assumed you were up to some kind of nonsense and I went along with it.
You had your fun, and I had mine.
Bloody hell!
Margaret, who is this imposter?
Oh, It's all right, Quentin, I think the horse
- has left the barn on that one.
- (big exhale)
I'll tell you this, Margaret.
It was no fun for one single second
- being locked away in that laboratory.
- Oh, uncomfortable, was it?
Or did you run out of scotch?
The problem wasn't where I was.
It was where I wasn't.
Kept away from my family.
Kept away from you.
Oh Thomas.
(heartwarming music)
Full reinstatement from Prime Minister Laurier.
Oh, and he sends his thanks for exposing Agent Tanner.
I wasn't sure you'd welcome a return to your old position,
- Mr. Meyers.
- (chuckle from Meyers)
Well, they do say the trappings make the man.
Once I was back in my old habiliments,
I found I wanted nothing more than to be in the civilized company of the Canadian federal government.
(George coughs.)
What about the Pendrimine?
I mean, I know it didn't work, but according to the Inspector,
Mr. Pendrick was really getting somewhere with it.
Yes.
We found the stolen formula.
But any further work on his research would be fruitless, I'm afraid.
Perhaps the Detective could do something with it.
I know your additive was a fake, sir, but that's not to say you couldn't make it work if you tried.
I don't know that I could but I suppose do anything, it wouldn't hurt to try.
It's not the research itself that would be fruitless.
It's the Panamanian guarana.
The...
Oh!
Uh, Pendrick's active ingredient.
Hm.
The Americans are building a canal down there.
Our sources tell us that every last trace of Panamanian guarana has been destroyed.
The Americans have ruined any chance the world had at eternal life.
Ah well, there's nothing to say that it would have amounted to anything.
Maybe there is.
Look at this postcard.
Dropped at the front desk.
Unsigned.
"Thanks for saving my life." Sir, whose life did you save?
You tell me.
Is that... ?
Could it really be him?
James bloody Pendrick.
He's still alive.
Announcer:
On an all new Murdoch.
It appears to have originated here.
- Perhaps she triggered it?
- Announcer:
It's a man's world
- where women seek refuge.
- No men allowed!
Announcer:
With explosive consequences.
- We need a man on the inside.
- You mean a woman.
Announcer:
Murdoch Mysteries, next Monday at 8:00 on CBC.
What's this presentation supposed to be about anyway?
I don't know, Higgins, but if Detective Murdoch invited us,
I'm sure it's something worthwhile.
It's probably about fingermarks or something boring.
Higgins, fingermarks have allowed us to catch more criminals than you...
Oh, shh, there's the Detective now.
Ladies and gentlemen.
You are about to be the first to witness the most revolutionary development in human history.
- I knew it.
Fingermarks.
- That's right, an invention so incredible that it will irrevocably change life on Earth as we know it.
But before I get too far, allow me to pay tribute to the man who's creation it is, a man who unfortunately cannot be with us here, today, due to his... most unfortunate demise.
That's right, none of us would be able to be here today were it not for the brilliance of the late James Pendrick.
- Late?
- Is Mr. Pendrick dead?
If he's dead and the Inspector was traveling with him, then...
James Pendrick was an inventor of the highest order.
Before he expired, he had nearly perfected a powerful potion of guarana.
Sadly, it was left incomplete.
Until now.
But I, William Murdoch, have taken that dream to reality.
I have created an additive which will unlock
Mr. Pendrick's formulation.
The result... will be the most incredible innovation the world has ever seen... "Pendrimine!"
My God!
- He hasn't even told us what it does yet.
- Now, some of you may know my friend and colleague,
Inspector Thomas Brackenreid.
Now, as you can see, his best days have passed behind him.
Time had taken its toll.
But, after imbibing just one dose of Pendrimine, this is him today!
- It can't be...
- That's right!
I'm a young man again!
James Pendrick has given me the gift of eternal bloody youth!
It was like nothing I'd ever experienced.
I could feel myself changing.
In a matter of minutes it was done.
I was young again.
Sir, how do we actually know that... you're you?
Bloody hell, Higgins, who else would I be?
- So, sir, what happens now?
- Will you ever grow old again?
Not if I keep drinking the stuff, Crabtree.
OY!
You'll get yours in due time!
Besides, this is only the additive won't do a thing without Pendrick's formula.
So... where is the actual formula, then?
Ah, Murdoch's squirreled it away where it can't be touched.
So, how did all this come to pass?
I mean, what happened in Panama?
What happened to James Pendrick?
Agh, we journeyed south and reclaimed his stolen formula from Ashmi.
As he toiled, I adventured, in search of the critical ingredient:
the super guarana of Panama.
But one day I returned to a commotion in our laboratory.
We'd been ransacked, the formula stolen and...
James Pendrick was dead.
Now, I must remind you to prepare yourself for a bit of a shock.
Where has Thomas been all this time, and why didn't he come home when he came back from Panama?
We've had to keep him under close observation.
I remind you this is a highly experimental drug, Mrs. Brackenreid.
We all will, Crabtree.
Margaret!
- No...
- It's true, Margaret.
- It's me.
- Ah...
I don't believe it.
You're not Thomas.
Look at you!
I am, Margaret.
I swear it.
- Impossible.
- Let me prove it.
- Ask me anything.
Go on.
- Uh...
Alright.
Where were you when John was born?
I was right here, in Station Four, trapped under three feet of snow.
But when I heard the news,
I dug my way out with a latrine bucket, and was there before the midwife handed him back to you.
Oh, Thomas!
It really is you!
Ah...
- Ooh...
- Ooh...
Sir.
Another message for you.
This one couriered over locally.
"Mr. X."
Must be another potential buyer.
Word is spreading, George.
People from all over the world are interested in my Pendrimine.
I'll be inviting them all to a special meeting soon to entertain their official offers.
Sir...
I don't mean to speak out of turn, but... it seems to me that you're not... overly concerned with Mr. Pendrick's murder.
Well, what can we do from here, George?
We know nothing of the circumstances, we have no access to the body, to the police report...
We have little choice but to leave the investigation to the Panamanians.
Yes, I suppose so.
Although, it also surprises me somewhat that you seem... so intent on... selling the Pendrimine.
Only because
I've tried to monetize your inventions in the past, you've always declined.
This one is different, George.
Alone, I could create a few doses of Pendrimine a month.
But someone with sufficient capital could make enough for the entire world!
- So it's not really the money that you're after.
- Not in the least.
The bidding will begin at one hundred million dollars.
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, please.
Consider what's on offer here.
Most would give their entire fortunes in exchange for eternal youth!
And I am not just selling one dose, no.
The formula itself, to one buyer.
The value is limitless.
I await your bids.
Henry, have you noticed something about the Detective is different?
The Detective?
Yes.
He's not himself.
The Detective, not the Inspector?
No, the Inspector seems fine.
He's thirty years younger.
Well that's just because he's taken the Pendrimine.
He still acts like the Inspector.
To me, the Detective is acting like somebody else altogether.
- I don't know what to say to that, George.
- Well,
I've got proof.
Look.
Detective Murdoch told me he didn't know anything about the police investigation in Panama into Pendrick's death.
I found this police report in his files.
- You went through his files?
- Unfortunately, it's in Spanish,
I can't make out a word of it.
You don't speak Spanish, do you?
You stole this from the Detective?
Well he wasn't doing anything with it.
I'm telling you, Detective Murdoch has become a money-hungry madman who's turned his back on the law!
He's still our boss, George.
Now remember,
- this is strictly off the record.
- Si, claro.
How do you know how to speak Spanish, anyway?
Te lo dije: soy castellana!
Crecìa hablando español todos los dias.
Y mi abuela no hablÃ² una palabra de Ingles.
My grandmother is Spanish.
- Ah.
- Come on, vamos a ver.
Panama City police report.
Dr. James Pendrick.
Homicide.
Inyectado con veneno... he was poisoned.
Poisoned with what?
No identificado.
- Unidentified.
- Muy bien.
It says here he had a number of symptoms:
vomiting, convulsions, excessive slavering, and near instant hair loss.
He was believed to be dead within ten to twenty minutes.
My God!
What kind of poison does all that?
The case remains open.
But they were able to trace the man they believe was the murderer back to a ship which fled Panama under the alias...
- "P.D. Lion."
- P.D. Lion?
Oh!
P.D. Lion!
- That's quite clever.
- How so?
Lion in Spanish is Leon.
P.D. Leon.
Ponce de Leon.
Of course.
If you're gonna chase the fountain of youth, you might as well name yourself after the most famous fountain hunter in history.
Don't worry, I won't write anything.
I'll save this one for my memoirs.
No, it's not that, it's just...
I have no idea what I'm going to do with this.
Detective Murdoch lied to me.
- Dr. Ogden.
- Oh, George!
What a pleasant surprise!
What can I help you with?
It's a personal matter.
It's about the Detective.
- Oh?
- Have you noticed that he's been... acting strange lately?
Not particularly.
Perhaps a small shift.
We have recently learned that we'll live forever.
Rather a big revelation in one's life!
Right, it's just he seems very... focused on selling this Pendrimine.
Yes.
To a buyer who can deliver it to the world.
Right, yes, he did say that.
Thank you, Doctor.
Um, while I have you, do you know of a poison that could cause hair loss,
- vomiting, and convulsions?
- Uh...
Oh, and excessive saliva.
I can't say that I do.
- He asked about the symptoms?
- He knows something.
It could be a problem.
If all goes according to plan, it will be over tonight.
Wait!
Toronto Constabulary!
- Sir, are you all right?
- What's going on?
- George?
- Sir?
I was just...
Bloody hell, Crabtree.
You just let James Pendrick's killer get away!
I don't understand.
If you're both the Inspector, then
- who took the Pendrimine?
- No one, George.
This man isn't the Inspector.
The Pendrimine is a ruse.
It doesn't work?
At all?
I'd best start at the beginning.
Everything you heard about what happened in Panama is true.
We caught Ashmi and resumed work on the formulation.
Then there was an attack.
James' work was stolen.
- So he really was killed.
- Poisoned.
I tried to save him.
He died in my arms.
Murdered for a potion that doesn't even work.
So why pretend that it did?
That was my idea.
After the attack,
I thought I'd track the killer down as best I could.
But he fled the country using an alias.
- P.D. Lion.
- Precisely.
I found out that he'd traveled to Toronto, so I followed.
On the boat, I met this actor.
Very good looking young lad.
The best mimic I'd ever heard.
Quinton Prout.
Good to meet you, Constable.
Yes, you as well.
The Inspector's plan was simple.
Pretend that I'd created the key "additive."
And that the formula that the thief stole actually worked.
Pendrimine as a whole would be valuable to everyone.
But the additive alone would only be worth something to the person
- who'd stolen the formula.
- Pendrick's killer.
One of the buyers sent a messenger to tell me that he was intent on seeing the additive in person.
- We were to meet him tonight.
- Ambush him, and when he made a grab for it, we were to arrest him.
And I scared him off.
Hm...
All we can hope for now is that he'll resurface.
I'll find him.
I can track down that motorized bicycle.
I'll do it first thing tomorrow, I swear.
- Hey, George.
- Samuel.
I could use some help.
I could use some myself.
Business has really picked up since we've been in the paper.
Listen, I'm looking for an electric motorized bicycle.
Unusual design.
Thick wheels, brass trimmed battery packs...
Ah, you haven't seen anything like that around here.
But...
I do know a man who knows every motorized bicycle in the city.
- I'll get back to you in an hour?
- I'll be at Station House Four.
Oh, George.
Nina left this for you.
Some of your things, I gather?
How is she?
She's well, as far as I can see.
Right.
Higgins!
The stables are a right mess.
- Get out there!
- Sir, perhaps you've forgotten,
- but I'm a Constable First Class.
- I haven't forgotten a bloody thing, Higgins!
Go!
Sir.
Oh Thomas...
I packed us a lunch.
I thought maybe we could take it to the park for a picnic.
Or perhaps dine in your office.
Draw the blinds...
Well, it's a lovely day for the park, sweetheart.
Detective Murdoch.
My name is Tanner.
Canadian Intelligence.
What can I do for you, Mr. Tanner?
The Prime Minister has heard tell of your invention.
He has sent me to obtain it on behalf of the federal government of Canada.
Well, you are more than welcome to make a bid for it.
Hm.
Think this through, Detective.
Capitalism has its limits.
Even the wealthiest company in the world could not pay your price.
With all due respect, Agent Tanner...
- Hm - ... my formula will change life as we know it.
- No price is too high.
- Oh, I agree.
Can you imagine if, say, the Americans were to live forever?
Their eternal strength would render Canada helpless.
Our nation would be cast into grave peril.
Hm!
Very well, then.
- What's Canada's offer?
- Canada's offer is zero.
We simply hope that you will do the right thing.
It would be a shame if you were to be convicted of... treason.
Good day.
"Nina, you'll be in my heart until the day I die.
Or, if I turn into a mummy, much longer.
Love, George."
- What's all this?
- Uh, what's what?
- The book.
Worth reading?
- Oh, no, it's nothing really.
"By George Crabtree?
!"
George, have you written a novel?
- Well, yes I did actually.
- "The Curse of the Pharaohs."
Sounds marvelous, I'll read it tonight.
No, I really don't think you'd like it.
I mean, it's full of... flights of fancy, which...
- which really is its strength, but...
- Perfect!
I just finished the interminable new Henry James,
- I need something more lively.
- I don't know...
George, do you not want me to read it?
Come on, I won't be mean.
Of course I want you to read it.
I would like to get you a new copy, this is... very worn.
It's...
Fine.
But get it for me soon, will you?
I don't like the idea of spending a night without George Crabtree by my bedside.
I'm not quite sure how to say this, Inspector.
- It's about your wife.
- Margaret?
- Has she figured it out?
- No, sir,
- quite to the contrary.
- How's that?
Well, last night she expected I would be doing the same things you yourself would do upon your return home.
Ah.
The gate needs mending.
Yes, no I've seen to the gate.
But there were other, shall we say, expectations...
She was rather insistent that I resume my... or rather, that I resume your, uh...
Ahem!
- ... husbandly duties.
- Did you?
- No!
- Well then, what's the problem?
Well, she was rather demanding, sir.
A woman has needs, Mr. Prout.
- And Margaret is very much a woman.
- Oh!
I'm not sure I can keep her at bay much longer.
Have an extra whiskey with supper.
Once she's clearing the dishes, go straight to the bedroom and start snoring.
It always works for me!
Sir.
Sirs.
No.
Sir.
We have an address for the motorbike.
Right. then.
Let's get to it.
- Actually, sir, I wasn't sent to fetch you.
- What?
You're to stay in hiding just in case this isn't our man.
We can't risk exposing the ruse.
Mr. Prout.
Ahem!
Bollocks.
Let's hope this is our man.
I don't care much for being accused of treason.
- Sir, it is a hangable offense.
- Thank you, George.
This should be it.
You there!
Stop!
Toronto Constabulary!
Who are you?
Identify yourself.
You!
- Pendrick's assistant.
- The name is Ashmi,
Detective.
When did you last see Mr. Pendrick?
When he found me in Panama.
He and your Inspector reclaimed what I had stolen.
I stayed for a time but could not regain James' trust.
I returned to Canada some weeks ago.
Then why were you after the additive?
And you specifically requested that our Inspector bring it to you.
- Alone.
- But while in Panama
I heard tell of a man.
Another who was after James' work.
I'd hoped to sell it to him.
You believe this man stole the formula?
- That he killed Mr. Pendrick?
- Who is this man?
He came from Asia.
Or possibly the skies themselves.
Some called him a God.
Have you ever heard the name P.D. Lion?
The man of whom I speak had no name.
- Only a letter.
- A letter?
They called him Senor Equis.
George, the card we received.
Mr. X.
He's tried to contact us.
Sir, we have an address.
Mr. X?
Senor Equis?
Gentlemen.
What took you so long?
Terrence Meyers?
The great rocket shook us and blastered throught the atmosphere.
The azure globe shimmering beneath me, vast oceans rolling, entire continents within my view.
I had flown higher than any living thing ever had.
It was the greatest adventure ever known to man.
And then, nothing.
Blackness.
Not only had I touched the face of God...
I became God.
God?
Hm.
I recall nothing of the descent.
All I know is I awoke to the smiling faces of the Murut.
I was now in Sabah, near the village of Nabawan.
And in that village, I was no longer human.
I was Ranying.
Supreme God, fallen from above.
Good Lord!
These people believed you to be God.
I tried to convince them otherwise, but these people had not seen a tin opener, let alone a flying rocket.
I had, after all, descended upon them as if... by magic.
I...
I lived among the Murut for many, many months.
My soul, purified.
My mind, cleared.
My powers... limitless.
My... tumpas, my tattoos, symbols of my status.
Then how did you end up in Panama?
I was en route to America when... word came from the Prime Minister.
Rumours had surfaced about the possible existence of a "Fountain of Youth"
invented by none other than James Pendrick.
But now, thanks to you, Murdoch, eternal life may be Canada's after all.
Mr. Meyers, the Pendrimine doesn't actually do anything.
- You see...
- You see, it's useless unless it is mixed properly.
The Pendrimine has no effect unless it is combined with my additive using specialized equipment, of course.
What equipment?
Chemical synthesizers that can be found in James Pendrick's laboratory, here, in Toronto.
I see.
Well, hand it all over.
The Canadian government insists on it.
I will.
But not yet.
Murdoch, you can't sell it.
My only aim is to find and apprehend
James Pendrick's killer.
After that, the Pendrimine is yours.
Bloody Meyers.
I thought he was dead!
It seems Pendrick's rocket was safer than it appeared to be.
Why did you lie to Mr. Meyers?
Why would you tell him the truth about anything?
- The man is quite strange.
- Oh, those tattoos!
Why write a cryptic note when he could have called on us directly?
Maybe he's not working for the government at all.
Still, it doesn't hurt to have him in step with our goal.
He now believes the only way to get the Pendrimine is to work with us.
It may be our only hope of catching the killer.
Well, let's do it quickly.
I can't keep Margaret in the dark about this much longer.
The woman has needs.
China.
Japan.
Russia.
America.
And of course, the Ottoman Empire.
An international agent from any one of those governments could be your killer.
How exactly do we know that the killer is a spy?
Have you identified the poison that killed him?
No.
Its symptoms are not known to...
Polonium.
Its devastating effects were discovered by the Germans.
Highly radioactive.
Unclear why it's so deadly.
And this poison is only known to the spy community?
- Exactly.
- Mr. Meyers.
I've been looking for you.
Busy doing your job for you, Tanner.
You know you're not supposed to go anywhere without my knowledge.
Dismissed.
Ah!
Detective.
I must warn you that that is not the Terrence Meyers of old.
The man I admired as a trainee was lost somewhere in the Bornean jungle.
But he's returned.
- He asked to be brought back.
- Hm.
Is that what he told you?
The moment Terrence Meyers disappeared into low earth orbit, the government began its search.
Meyers knows far, far too much.
- You were the one who found him.
- Yes.
Eventually.
Only he did not want to be retrieved.
He had become one of the savages.
Meyers cannot be trusted.
Eternal life is at stake, as well you know.
Put your faith where it belongs:
in the capable hands of the Canadian government.
- Mr. Tanner...
- I already know you intend to hand over the Pendrimine as soon as you have caught your killer.
Oh,
I have microphones in Meyers' room.
Of course.
Yes, well, I have confidence that you will find your man.
If you don't trust me, well, you can take it straight to the Prime Minister himself.
So Terrence Meyers is alive.
I never expected to see him again.
I fear the old Terrence Meyers may be gone forever.
Julia, the man is deranged.
Do you believe his theory about Pendrick's killer?
I have no reason to doubt it.
So you'll work with him?
I don't see the harm in it.
So long as I don't allow him to skew our investigation.
Although, truth be told, nothing we've tried thus far has worked.
If the killer is a spy, they may sense a trap.
You may be right.
And if that is the case, we need to make him feel desperate.
We give the Pendrimine to the government of Canada.
Wonderful.
Hand it over.
At least that's what we want the killer to believe.
I see.
If the killer thinks that Canada has the key to eternal youth, he'll be desperate to get it for his country.
Lest his nation be left behind and so on.
And if he's more desperate, he'll be more likely to make a mistake, I see that, but why lie about it?
Just give it to us,
- the result is the same.
- I can't do that until the killer is caught.
And how exactly are we supposed to prove the Canadian government has it?
By giving a second man a dose of Pendrimine.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
Laurier?
All he has to do is stay out of sight for a few days.
Can you contact him?
Or have Agent Tanner do it?
Well, I suppose but how do we find someone who looks exactly like a young Laurier?
Few people have even seen a photograph of Laurier as a young man.
All we have to do is find someone who looks like a Prime Minister.
The newspapers will run wild with the story and soon the whole world will know!
Murdoch.
Your Laurier gambit may have worked.
We've had contact from six foreign diplomats, all desperate to obtain the drug for their country.
Let's hope one of them is the man we're looking for.
Hm.
Sir.
There's no evidence that any of these men are P.D. Lion.
And what of Pendrick's formula?
Their rooms are being searched now.
Sir!
It's the Inspector.
He's been attacked.
Sir.
He's still alive, but unconscious.
It seems he was able to fight off his attacker, and perhaps the entire dose of the poison wasn't administered.
Any symptoms?
The same reportedly suffered by Mr. Pendrick.
He had a bottle of the additive.
Where is it now?
Stolen, it would seem, sir.
Hm...
- When did the attack occur?
- An hour ago, maybe less.
All the diplomats were at Station House Number Four.
If one of them did kill Mr. Pendrick,
I suppose he could have sent someone after the additive.
Indeed.
It would be an excellent opportunity, to strike while establishing an iron-clad alibi.
Sir.
One of Meyers' bracelets?
- Murdoch.
What's going on?
- Sir.
The empty vial.
Terrence Meyers, you are under arrest for the attempted murder of Thomas Brackenreid and for the murder of James Pendrick.
Oh, this is preposterous.
Clearly I was set up.
You had the empty vial of additive in your hand.
Which I found in my room shortly before you arrived.
We also found one of your bracelets at the scene.
I have all my tumpas.
Six on the right.
- Five on the left.
- Yes, precisely!
There isn't one missing, Murdoch.
I am Ranying.
My people festooned me with one ring for every head which I...
It doesn't matter.
The point is whatever it is you found did not belong to me.
Who put it there then?
I assume any one of those so-called "diplomats."
The Turks have especially had it in for me.
- The Turks.
- The culprit is likely spiriting the Pendrimine away to his homeland while you're sitting here wasting your time with me.
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Brackenreid.
They say he should regain consciousness soon.
Did you catch him?
Whoever did this?
We did.
Mrs. Brackenreid!
Stay with him.
I'll return as soon as I'm able, I have...
Oh, did his eyes just open?
I have to tell her!
This has gone on long enough.
Sir, we need to maintain the ruse just a bit longer.
- She was kissing another man!
- One she believes to be you.
- What's your point?
- Well sir, it can hardly be characterized
- as an infidelity if she believes...
- Oh, bloody hell, Murdoch!
I don't care what you characterize it as!
Do you know what it's like seeing your wife kissing another man?
Actually sir, James Pendrick kissed Julia in the days leading up to your departure for Panama...
- Right.
Well then, you know what I'm saying.
- I do, but I was able to subsume those feelings knowing that Julia herself clearly had nothing to do in the matter and obviously has no... feelings for James Pendrick or any other man.
- You've thought this through.
- I have.
- Have you talked with her about it?
- Well, that would imply that it bothers me.
Which it doesn't.
Right.
But...
Why are we wasting time, anyway?
We've arrested Meyers.
Sir, something just doesn't seem right.
Why would Terrance Meyers tell us that he was in Toronto if he intended to steal the additive all along?
The man's out of his mind!
He got a taste for power in Borneo and now he won't stop until he achieves more.
All the same, sir, if we could wait another twenty-four hours.
Just to be sure we have the right man.
Fine.
Another day rotting away in Pendrick's study.
Hello, Constable!
Any good crimes lately?
I'm writing a report on a lady who says her neighbour's horse walks too loudly.
"Nina, you'll be in my heart until the day I die.
Or, if I turn into a mummy, much longer.
Love, George."
Louise!
- Louise, let me just say...
- I'm sorry, George.
I had no intention of going through your things.
I understand why you wouldn't want to give away this copy.
Louise, please...
Look, I didn't intend for any of this.
The man I own the garage with happens to be Nina's brother.
I was there, he gave me some things that she'd left.
I guess she didn't want this anymore.
- Why would you keep that from me?
- I don't know, I...
I...
For a moment, I suppose I felt guilty.
The past came rushing back and I...
And you thought you'd made a mistake.
It would mean the world to me if you'd read my book, Louise.
Then I will.
You have accused Mr. Meyers of murder in the past.
This is different.
Meyers has been in the far east for too long.
What is his story?
Does it seem rational?
He claims that he's been set up.
That a foreign agent has stolen the additive.
But... why bother setting up Meyers?
Why not simply steal the additive and then vanish into thin air?
Well, if you're unswayed by the alternatives, you have to assume you have your killer behind bars.
I suppose.
And what about the Inspector?
Has he told Margaret yet?
Not yet.
Julia, the last time we saw James Pendrick...
Does any of that bother you?
- The kiss?
- Hm.
No!
I haven't thought about it for a moment.
- Does it bother you?
- Of course not.
He was out of his mind.
And now he's dead.
Indeed.
Oh my God.
It's time, Mr. Meyers.
We have to hand you over.
How long have we known each other, Murdoch?
Hm?
Ten years, I suppose.
That sounds about right.
Do you honestly consider me a threat to this country?
To my fellow man?
Come on, you know me.
You know they're gonna consider this treason.
I'll be hanged.
Let me go.
It's not up to me, Mr. Meyers.
Sure it is.
Just open the door, turn your back.
You'll never see me again, I swear.
I'll return to my people.
You would go back to Borneo?
I will never set foot in this country again.
So, what difference does it make if they hang me or... if I simply vanish forever?
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.
Ah!
Thank you, Detective.
All ready, are we, Meyers?
The Prime Minister awaits.
And I assure you he is not in a merciful mood.
Murdoch!
Where's Murdoch?
Murdoch!
- Sir?
- Oh!
No, sir, why are you so old again?
Oh my God, sir, what's happened?
- Just yesterday you were a young man!
- Oh, get off, Crabtree.
- Where's Murdoch?
- Sir?
The place has been ransacked.
All Pendrick's equipment's been stolen.
Of course.
Meyers believed Pendrick's equipment was crucial
- in synthesizing the Pendrimine.
- But I was there.
The place hadn't been robbed yet when Mr. Prout was attacked...
- when Meyers was arrested.
- Who's Mr. Prout?
- Young me!
- But you're young you.
- Oh, shut up, Higgins.
- Then it couldn't be Meyers.
Then who?
Did you tell anyone the lie about the laboratory?
No.
But someone else was listening in on the conversation.
But...
Stop!
Driver, stop!
What's the problem?
What's going on?
Wait a minute...
Agent Tanner, you are under arrest for the murder of James Pendrick
- and the attempted murder...
- Me?
I think not.
We know it was you.
You're P.D. Lion.
What of it?
You can't prove that I killed Pendrick.
You poisoned a man here, in Toronto.
When he recovers, he'll identify you.
So?
If the Inspector survives, what will you charge me with?
Attempted murder?
It's enough to lock you up.
And stop you from taking the Pendrimine back to Ottawa.
Ottawa?
No, no, no.
In the hands of the masses, eternal life would cause an epidemic of overpopulation.
I took it for myself...
well, myself and... a handful of the wealthiest buyers in the world, so... lock me up.
Five years, ten, twenty.
Time matters not in the face of eternal life.
Ah!
Second ever dose of Pendrimine, mixed by my own hand.
Everlasting youth... is mine.
I don't believe we've met.
Inspector Thomas C. Brackenreid.
You've been had.
No...
Margaret.
It's me.
But... but... he's you.
I'm sorry but no.
I'm me, warts and all.
So it was all a lie?
I didn't want to hide it from you.
But I had to.
It was the only way to catch Pendrick's killer.
It had to seem real.
People had to see that you believed it.
Uh, people believed it, because I played the part.
I didn't believe for one second that this young man was you.
- You didn't?
- Of course not!
He was far too considerate, for one.
I assumed you were up to some kind of nonsense and I went along with it.
You had your fun, and I had mine.
Bloody hell!
Margaret, who is this imposter?
Oh, It's all right, Quentin, I think the horse has left the barn on that one.
I'll tell you this, Margaret.
It was no fun for one single second
- being locked away in that laboratory.
- Oh, uncomfortable, was it?
Or did you run out of scotch?
The problem wasn't where I was.
It was where I wasn't.
Kept away from my family.
Kept away from you.
Oh Thomas.
Full reinstatement from Prime Minister Laurier.
Oh, and he sends his thanks for exposing Agent Tanner.
I wasn't sure you'd welcome a return to your old position,
Mr. Meyers.
Well, they do say the trappings make the man.
Once I was back in my old habiliments,
I found I wanted nothing more than to be in the civilized company of the Canadian federal government.
What about the Pendrimine?
I mean, I know it didn't work, but according to the Inspector,
Mr. Pendrick was really getting somewhere with it.
Yes.
We found the stolen formula.
But any further work on his research would be fruitless, I'm afraid.
Perhaps the Detective could do something with it.
I know your additive was a fake, sir, but that's not to say you couldn't make it work if you tried.
I don't know that I could but I suppose do anything, it wouldn't hurt to try.
It's not the research itself that would be fruitless.
It's the Panamanian guarana.
The...
Oh!
Uh, Pendrick's active ingredient.
Hm.
The Americans are building a canal down there.
Our sources tell us that every last trace of Panamanian guarana has been destroyed.
The Americans have ruined any chance the world had at eternal life.
Ah well, there's nothing to say that it would have amounted to anything.
Maybe there is.
Look at this postcard.
Dropped at the front desk.
Unsigned.
"Thanks for saving my life." Sir, whose life did you save?
You tell me.
Is that... ?
Could it really be him?
James bloody Pendrick.
He's still alive.
On an all new Murdoch.
It appears to have originated here.
- Perhaps she triggered it?
- It's a man's world
- where women seek refuge.
- No men allowed!
With explosive consequences.
- We need a man on the inside.
- You mean a woman.
Murdoch Mysteries, next Monday at 8:00 on CBC.
Operation Willoughby is a go.
Our target is Kai Chen.
Wealthy businessman suspected of committing acts of terror to manipulate the stock market.
I don't understand.
What's the catch here?
Reeves will be stuck on a plane with a bunch of guys who want to kill him.
Sitrep.
Reeves and Jintao have entered the plane, along with the pilot.
He's exiting the plane.
Damn it, he knows.
Call the tower.
Tell 'em to give Reeves the abort code.
Get him out of there now!
Chen knows that you're alive and you could be a target, Reeves.
You need to lay low.
Qasim, these conversations you've been listening to, they're about a terrorist we've been tracking for months.
Your work could be the key to stopping him.
You know you're doing great, right?
Thank you.
The doctors managed to stop the bleeding, but Qasim was without oxygen for too long.
Last recording Qasim was supposed to translate.
Why are you giving this to me?
I don't know your reason, but I know you're willing to do anything to get Chen.
So am I.
Want me to freshen that, Gibbs?
I'm good, Elaine.
Yo!
Anytime today will be fine.
Be right there.
Yeah.
Crazy morning.
Darlene called in sick.
I'll get you a cup to go.
No rush.
Take your time.
So your vacation's over?
Sorry it took so long.
Yeah, I ordered wheat bread.
Give me a minute.
You sure you got nothing?
I mean, a half day?
Sorry, pal.
Hey, Bodie.
Man...
No.
I thought you were dead.
No, that's wishful thinking, Bubba.
Wishful thinking.
What's that?
A flower arrangement.
Yeah, see, um... no frou-frou flowers around my desk, thanks.
Relax, Fabio, they're for Bishop.
She had a horrible week.
I mean, the funeral, and then she had to clear out Qasim's apartment.
That's a nice thought.
Put my name on the card, I'll pay for half.
No, they're from me, Nick.
On my way.
I've been summoned to the British embassy.
Another debriefing about Willoughby?
MI6 special-op director's in town on a fact-finding mission.
Hey.
Hey.
You good?
I'm fine.
Are you sure?
Hey, um... any more on Kai Chen?
Gibbs told you not to get involved.
Qasim's flash drive, what'd you do with it?
Nothing yet.
I haven't found a translator I can trust.
How you doing?
I'm fine, really.
These are very pretty.
Yeah, we thought you'd like them.
Really?
Something's up.
Anyone hear from Gibbs?
He was supposed to teach an 8:00 field training class.
He never showed.
It's not like Gibbs to be late for anything.
He's not answering his home phone or his cell.
Yeah, that's... strange.
Find him.
He usually calls if he's gonna be late.
Something's wrong.
Or maybe he's doing something private that's none of our business.
Yeah, exactly.
Well, you know what, we heard the director.
He said we need to find him, so let's find him.
Quinn, Bishop, you guys go to Gibbs' house.
No, I really don't feel comfortable doing that.
Going into his house when he's not there?
Torres, you're with me.
Ooh, I like it when you take charge.
Where we going?
Same place Gibbs goes every morning.
Well, the good news is his truck isn't here.
Wouldn't want to find Gibbs in the basement, a victim of a power-tool accident.
He doesn't use power tools.
Door is never locked when he's home.
I guess it never is.
Gibbs?
It was written at 8:10.
Gibbs has never gotten a parking ticket before in his life.
All right, well, nothing unusual in the basement, besides a boat.
That's not strange.
Bishop, you find anything upstairs?
Well, I found something interesting on the nightstand in his bedroom.
What?
The Sensitive Man's Survival Handbook.
No.
That's probably a paperweight.
There's a bookmark on page 351.
Go figure.
I didn't see that one coming.
This is a waste of time.
We're not gonna find anything.
No.
What?
I accidentally hit this against the faucet.
I'm sure Gibbs has other plates.
No, not like this one.
Looks like his daughter Kelly made it for him.
Ooh.
Gibbs was in a little earlier than usual.
Said he was teaching an 8:00 class.
Did he seem concerned about anything?
No.
As a matter of fact, he was a bit more chatty than usual.
Gibbs?
Leroy Jethro Gibbs?
What was he saying?
I asked him if he wanted me to top off his coffee, and he said, "I'm good."
And that's chatty?
For Gibbs, the bar is low.
He normally responds with a look.
He also told me to take my time with the check.
That's why I was surprised when he disappeared.
Disappeared?
I left him waiting for his coffee to go.
When I brought it, he was gone.
He left a 20 on the table, which is way too much.
And poof.
McGee, you found him.
Gibbs is okay.
Where was he?
Abby, I need you to ping his cell.
So you didn't find him?
Look, just do it, okay?
I'll explain later.
I don't like snooping on Gibbs.
Abby, trust me, you have to do this.
This is against my better judgment.
What are you doing?
That's funny.
What?
What's funny?
Not like funny "ha-ha."
Like funny weird.
Gibbs' phone is across the street from the diner.
Where you going?
McGee, are you gonna tell me what's going on?
Calling Gibbs' cell.
The post office sent over an inspector.
He opened up the mailbox, and there they were.
Yeah, telephone, wallet, badge, and I.D.
Was he robbed?
Hard to tell.
No money in the wallet, but all his credit cards are in there.
Could Gibbs have dumped his stuff in the mailbox?
Maybe he was getting rid of anything that could I.D. him.
Undercover 101.
You want to get rid of anything on you that has your real name on it.
Exactly.
Well, Agent Quinn is gathering surveillance and traffic videos of the area around Gibbs' truck and the mailbox, so we'll see if they can tell us something there.
McGee, unlock his phone and find the last calls in and out.
Director, Gibbs doesn't lock anything.
And I can't believe he still uses a flip phone.
Besides, I already checked.
The last two calls were exchanges with Rebecca Chase.
Who called who?
She called him.
He called her back.
Who is Rebecca Chase?
Gibbs' ex-wife number two.
Actually, she may be number three.
I'm not...
I get confused on the order sometimes there.
When were the calls?
One was late last night, the other early this morning.
All right, let's not dismiss anything.
She might know something.
I'll give her a call.
I'll take this stuff to Abby, see if maybe she can pull a fingerprint or touch DNA from someone that is not Gibbs.
You know there are over 4,200 traffic surveillance cameras in D.C.?
More than any other city in the U.S.
Homeland is streaming me video feed from the traffic camera closest to the diner.
Bishop... why are you looking at Kai Chen's file?
I was deleting it.
Please, for your own sanity, leave tracking Chen to the others.
I will.
Bishop, I've known you since FLETC and I know how persistent you are.
Look, I understand you're in a bad place right now.
I'm better.
We need to focus on Gibbs.
You get the surveillance videos?
I'm just waiting.
Homeland is streaming them to me now.
Kay.
Anything I can do?
Yes, you can get your mind off revenge.
Chen will get his, okay?
You need to stay out of it.
You know he is a very dangerous man.
Don't worry, Alex, I hear you.
Do you?
I'm gonna go see what Abby's come up with on Gibbs.
Hug.
How are you?
I wish everyone would stop asking me that.
I am okay.
Promise.
I just want to get back to work.
I've just been...
I've been so worried about you and now Gibbs.
You find anything in his truck?
No.
And my mind is spinning like a top,
I'm conjuring up all these horrible fates, you know.
It's like he just vanished.
It was...
like that, he was gone.
But then again, maybe he's just doing, like, a Superman thing.
You know, like, there was a, like a damsel in distress, but... but I mean, who knows?
This is what's driving me crazy.
We know nothing.
Abby... he's only been gone a couple hours.
And if anyone can take care of himself, it's Gibbs.
You're right.
I mean, you're...
You're definitely right.
I need to center myself.
I need to focus.
Gibbs is gonna be fine.
Gibbs is gonna be super fine.
Hey, any luck with his things?
Um, the only prints on them are Gibbs'.
I'm testing for DNA now.
Well, Gibbs rushed out of the diner at 7:22.
And then this camera picks him up.
He's looking right into the camera.
He wanted us to see this.
Very interesting.
And here's the other camera at the other end of the block.
Is Gibbs limping or is it me?
I think he is.
McGee, do you recognize this guy?
No.
Quinn, zoom in on the plate.
I can't make it out.
Yeah, it looks like five, something, "E."
Yeah, I can't make it out, either.
I'll shoot the image down to Abby, see if she can enhance it.
All right, I'll go see what she can find.
Hey... what are you doing?
The three Ps.
Positive pyramid power.
We have to get Gibbs back.
Did you have a chance to, look at the license plate?
That was fast.
Um, did you run it?
Okay.
Um, well,
I have all the faith in the three Ps, to bring Gibbs back.
So, when he does come back,
I need a favor.
No.
That's seven years bad luck.
No, I think that's mirrors.
My God.
Quinn!
It's the Kelly plate.
What happened?
It was an accident.
It was this morning.
Gibbs is gonna be heartbroken.
I know, but he-he won't be if he never finds out.
And I heard you are the master at this, so can you fix it?
I can do my best.
Thanks.
Got a name and an address.
Bodie Whitman.
Lives in Baltimore.
Bodie Whitman.
I remember that name.
He spent ten years in a federal prison for his part in an armed robbery.
Was one of Gibb's last undercover cases.
It's before my time.
It was... 2001.
Whitman was a foot soldier in a militant antigovernment militia led by his older brother.
Gibbs infiltrated the group using his backstopped alias,
Leland Robert Spears.
So, you and Torres are right.
Gibbs dumped anything that could identify him, went back undercover.
What the hell was Gibbs thinking?
These guys are psychos.
Ramsay Whitman.
He's Bodie's older brother.
He was behind the hijacking of a Navy truck by an antigovernment militia.
Two Marine Guards were killed.
The truck was transporting spent nuclear fuel rods, radioactive isotopes.
The intent was to make a dirty bomb.
So, Gibbs went undercover as Spears.
A month after the hijacking.
How did he infiltrate the group?
He was backstopped as an ex-con, disgruntled former Marine with antigovernment sentiments.
He was embedded with the group for months.
We had very little contact with him.
Been there.
The object was to find the fuel rods before they could use them.
According to Gibbs, only Ramsay Whitman knew where they were hidden.
Were they ever recovered?
No.
They're still out there.
What were they planning to attack?
D.C. Metro subway.
I remember that op went south when I was in Philly.
We never found out why, but Ramsay got spooked.
The gang scattered, and Gibbs disappeared with the others.
The only one that got arrested was Ramsay's brother, Bodie, but he wasn't connected to the hijacking.
Did Gibbs blow his cover and testify at trial?
No.
Wasn't needed.
Prison record says Bodie got five years for harboring his brother.
Badass that he is, Bodie got some more time for attacking a guard.
So, what happened to the rest of the militia?
Three of them were killed in a standoff with the FBI a year later.
And Ramsay Whitman's still on the wall.
I want you to dig out every file we have on the case.
Locate every agent that worked on it.
Where the hell did Gibbs go with the brother?
I think ten bucks' worth should get us to Baltimore.
Here, here, here.
Why don't you fill 'er up.
Wow.
Look at you, Mr. Leland Spears.
I guess you're doing well.
Let me say this about that, Bubba.
You will be, too.
Okay, well, I'm gonna have to wrap this up.
Excuse me, ma'am?
Ma'am, excuse me, I wonder if you'd help me.
Yes?
I lost my phone, and, need to make a short call to my wife, just tell her I'll be late.
I'm sorry, she's a real worrier, you know?
Don't be long.
I've got to get going myself.
Thank you so much.
Vance caught up with Gibbs' ex-wife.
Yeah?
Yeah.
It wasn't anything...
They were just making plans to go to dinner tonight.
He was gonna have dinner with Rebecca?
Yeah.
- Want to get that?
- Yeah.
Didn't answer.
I'm sorry.
At least I tried?
That's all you can do.
That was weird.
Whoever it was just hung up on me.
I'm gonna call back.
What was that all about?
You know her?
Some lady with phone trouble.
You okay?
Yeah.
I just got a headache.
Hello.
Hi.
Did you just call my number?
No.
A man just borrowed my phone to make a call.
Could you describe him?
Who is this?
This is Special Agent McGee with NCIS, ma'am.
This is crazy.
What did the man look like?
Well... he's 50-something, has silver hair and incredible blue eyes.
Is he with a younger man in an SUV?
Yes.
They're still here.
Did you want me.
No.
No.
To give him the phone?
Do not approach them.
Don't even look in their general direction.
Where are you?
At a gas station off I-95, just north of Savage Park, Maryland.
What do you want me to do?
Nothing.
Nothing.
It's best that you probably leave there.
Thank you.
Gibbs is with Bodie Whitman on the I-95, halfway between here and Baltimore.
According to Bodie's driver's license, that's where he lives.
It was the summer of '96, and we were running surveillance on a chop shop... just me and a couple of hotshot young agents named Gibbs and Vance.
That's Director Vance.
And if I remember, those two hotshots bailed your ass out of one hell of a firefight that night.
Is that the story you've been telling all these years, Leon?
Come here!
It's good to see you.
You, too, Fred.
Well, we both know you didn't pull me off the back nine at National to reminisce, so...
why the hell am I here?
An old case of yours has resurfaced.
Which one?
My undercover I.D.
Damn, I was hoping it wasn't that one.
You remember Deputy Director
Doyle Roden of the Department of Energy.
Special Agent Pettis.
Doyle.
Where's Gibbs?
You mean Spears.
Yeah.
He crossed paths with Bodie Whitman this morning.
Made contact, then went dark.
What do you think Gibbs' intentions are, Director?
I'm not sure, but my guess is he's trying to get a second crack at Ramsay Whitman, who's been on our Most Wanted Wall for the last 15 years.
And that's not the only thing that's gone missing.
Finding those nuclear fuel rods... still my responsibility.
Want to get those back before there's some sort of terrorist catastrophe.
Well, Th-this is great, but I'm retired.
12 years now.
I got three grandchildren.
Two I even like.
Why the hell would I want to risk my ass diving back into that Dumpster fire?
I'm not asking you to, Fred.
I want you two to put your heads together, see if you remember anything that's not in the files.
Okay.
Let's get started.
Engine trouble, McGee?
I'm pushing 70.
Well, I'm just saying, you know, given the situation, you know, you might want to push a tiny bit harder.
Look, I don't like the idea of Gibbs running solo either, but... he'll manage.
This isn't his first rodeo.
Have you ever ridden a bull, McGee?
No.
Actually, that's not true, I did ride a mechanical bull once at the Hoppy Gnome Bar.
Really wasn't my finest hour, though.
What about you?
Have you ridden one?
Only one.
Robert.
The bull was named Robert?
Yeah.
A big bastard, too.
But we locked eyes.
I couldn't back down.
I mounted up, and that, you know, that gate just exploded open.
He was ferocious.
He was whipping me back and forth like I was a ragdoll, and as the seconds ticked by, the crowd coming to life,
"Torres, Torres.
Torres...
Torres."
They kept chanting my name.
Yeah.
Yeah, I got that part.
That day I...
I faced a monster, McGee, and I managed to come out on top.
Why would they name a bull Robert?
Doesn't matter.
What does matter is that I had to face that very same bull two weeks later.
And he was pissed off, man.
And... this time he knew my weakness.
And he tossed me, like, 20 feet.
How did you learn to bull-ride?
I didn't.
And that was part of the problem.
But my analogy still applies.
What analogy?
Working deep undercover is like riding the rodeo, McGee.
You have to trust your instincts.
You got to hang on tight.
I do know one, one rule for survival.
Never battle the same bull twice.
Moral of the story is...
Drive faster.
Thank you.
Tell you something, Bubba.
You're gonna have a hard time getting your security deposit back.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That is...
least of my worries.
Two months behind on the rent.
Okay.
Get this show on the road.
Call Ramsay.
Slow down, Spears.
You know how crazy he gets.
Say the wrong thing, and he flips.
Unbelievable.
What you're telling me is you're still afraid of him.
You know, we've only talked a couple times over the years.
I have no idea where he is.
And that's the way he wants it.
Absolutely.
I get that.
We can't mess with him.
And I got to make sure this buyer of yours is for real, or he will get spooked.
Let me say this about that.
In the car, I thought this was a done deal.
And I am taking your word that Ramsay still has the fuel rods.
What is your problem?
Get him on the phone or I am gone!
I don't just call him.
What does that mean?
Look, we've got this way of contacting each other in an emergency.
I call it the Bat-Signal, and the only time
I've used it since he went underground was to tell him our father died.
I'm waiting.
I post our father's antique watch on this online auction site.
Ramsay's got the exact watch on this wish list, and, you know, he'll get an e-mail when it's posted, and hopefully he responds.
How?
Calls me back.
An untraceable burn phone.
Bubba, come on.
Come on.
Post it.
What the who?
You want this or not?
Yeah.
All right.
Got your phone?
Yeah.
Don't worry.
If he calls, we won't miss it.
It's just around the corner.
We can eat there.
Or if you want, we can bring the food back.
Hey!
I'm sorry.
My bad.
You okay?
Yeah.
Thought maybe that guy grabbed my wallet.
Hey, nice picture, Spears.
Come on.
Takeout's across the street.
Can't believe you're back in D.C.
Since last summer.
I lived in Idaho for a long time.
Yeah, well, I rotted in jail for ten years.
Made me hate the government even more.
Absolutely, Bubba.
Gonna give this country a wake-up call.
Got that right.
I tell you, it's been needing one for a long time.
I'm really impressed with the way you slipped Gibbs that wallet and bug.
The reverse-pickpocket.
You like that?
Little trick I learned back in Ciudad Del Este.
Handy when you want to plant evidence.
Not that I ever done that.
I'm getting hungry.
What time is it?
I practiced on you.
Looks expensive.
It is.
Can't believe you still got that Marine haircut.
It reminds me, every morning when I look in the mirror, just how much I hate how this government controls my life.
Sure doesn't sound like Gibbs.
It's not.
It's Spears.
No caller I.D.
It's got to be him.
Let's hope he's in a good mood.
Hey, big bro.
Yeah, I'm okay.
Got my good days.
And you?
Of course it's important.
You'll never guess who I ran into.
Leland Spears.
He's got a proposition.
He wants to talk to you.
Hey, Bubba.
What are the odds?
Me running into your brother?
Well, yeah.
Yeah, you still got the stuff, I got a buyer.
Yeah.
Yeah, real deep pockets.
He'll make us all rich.
I need an answer.
Pronto.
He said he will let us know.
Well, sounds like we're gonna be here for a little bit.
Hey.
Hey.
How'd it go at the embassy?
- You learn anything from MI6?
- It was informative.
Intel suggests Chen might be on a yacht in the Aegean, off the coast of Greece.
They have a boat under surveillance.
It's hopeful.
If Gibbs finds out you're working on this and I'm helping you, he'll kill us both.
I'm willing to take that chance.
Hey, Quinn.
Hey.
Mission accomplished.
That's fantastic.
How'd you get rid of the crack?
The crack?
What crack?
Night.
Bubba, red queen on black king.
Thanks.
Ramsay?
You sure?
Yeah, yeah, he's still here.
Okay.
I will tell him.
That was quick.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, Ramsay's, gonna set up a meeting.
Bitchin'.
Now you're talkin'.
Where?
He's gonna call back.
Hey.
Put the gun down.
You know, what Ramsay really said is that Leland Spears is a federal agent.
That's good.
That's good.
Where'd he come up with that one?
I don't know.
Well, he's insane.
You know that.
Paranoid.
That's what happened the last time.
Bubba, don't-don't blow this.
This is our chance to get a message to the government.
We will all get rich.
You playing me, Spears?
Or whatever the hell your name is?
He's messin' with you just like he always did.
Shut up!
I am not going back to prison, man!
Of course you're not.
In any event, he is crazy.
Okay.
Okay, o-okay, okay, okay.
S-Say-say that Ramsay...
is right.
I mean, say that I am a fed.
Then what?
What?
You shoot me, and you get the gas chamber.
That what you want,
Bubba?
So far, Bodie, you haven't done anything wrong.
All you've done... is talk to your brother.
No crime in that.
Let's end it right here.
Put the weapon down.
You know what makes quite a statement, too?
Shooting a federal agent.
You're not gonna get away with it.
I'm not alone.
There are other agents outside the door.
They're listening to everything we've said.
Don't take me for a fool.
McGee!
Right here, boss.
Torres!
Put the weapon down.
Gibbs.
Thank God you're okay.
Sure you're ready to be back at work?
It's where I need to be.
How about you?
Well, I'm gonna feel better when we catch.
Ramsay Whitman.
Probably spooked him, he's gonna disappear again.
Where's Quinn?
She just went down to see Abby.
Tell her I'm with Ducky.
He didn't have to die, Duck.
You had no choice.
Don't know if it'll help your autopsy, but he was constantly popping those things.
Tetrabenazine.
It's prescribed for involuntary jerking and writhing movements.
I thought he was strung out.
No.
No.
I just requested his prison medical records.
They show he was diagnosed with Huntington's disease.
Take a look.
It's progressive and debilitating.
I can confirm it with a brain scan.
Hey, Duck.
Well, I have information on the last call Bodie Whitman received.
From his brother?
Yeah.
We traced it to a cell tower in Tazewell County.
You find anything on the phone that made the call?
Well, as suspected, it was a cheap burner phone.
It was purchased six years ago.
There's no record of the buyer.
We did try to ping it and it was turned off.
Ramsay destroyed that phone as soon as he hung up.
Excuse me...
Ramsay's the brother?
Well, I don't know if this will help you, but Huntington's is a rare disease.
And if they were full siblings, there's a 50-50 chance the brother could suffer from the same disorder.
Well, Tazewell County's a small county...
I mean, how many cases of Huntington's disease can there be in the area?
Not many.
It's a lead I can follow.
I'll help you, Ducky.
Leon, you wanted to see me?
Why are you looking at those two?
I think I almost got you killed.
15 years ago, when you went undercover to take down Ramsay Whitman, he somehow found out that the federal government was closing in on him.
He disappeared.
And yesterday, between two phone calls to his brother, he learned that Leland Spears was a federal agent.
When we realized that you were with Bodie Whitman, I called these two in to help, and now we have a leak.
A retired NCIS agent and the deputy director of U.S. Department of Energy.
Yes, Pamela.
Send 'em in.
Jethro, there is someone in Tazewell County who's being treated for Huntington's disease.
Alex.
May I use your computer, Director?
Certainly.
Tazewell County,
Huntington's disease?
Following a lead, Leon.
That's the wrong name, but his age is about right.
He doesn't look anything like the radical skinhead killer I remember.
Get us a warrant, Leon.
See if one of 'em got a call from Tazewell County yesterday.
Once upon a time, there lived a very, very nasty man.
Ramsay Whitman was angry and disgruntled...
Abbs.
And he killed two Marines and vanished into thin air.
Or not.
What do we know about John Manning?
Nothing, till 11 years ago, when he moved to Northwest Virginia.
Married a local woman there, a schoolteacher.
They have two kids together.
Girl's seven, boy's five.
Yeah, residential real estate broker, well liked in the community, member of the Rotary Club, deacon in his church.
He, coaches his daughter's soccer team.
They went eight and two.
They're actually pretty good.
You're sure that these two guys are the same guy?
Yeah.
Salient facial features are a 96% match.
Yeah, I know this guy.
Ramsay Whitman's spooked.
Come on, we got to move fast.
Okay, we're just gonna go to Grandma's, okay?
I have a dentist appointment tomorrow.
Don't worry, I'll call him.
Wait.
See if Ramsay's leaving with the family.
Rather not make the takedown in front of the kids.
Roger that.
You know, half of me is hoping we're wrong about this guy.
When you get to your mother's, wait for my call.
Okay, you're really scaring me, John.
Can't you tell me what's going on?
No.
Not-not now.
Just... get going.
Please.
Okay.
I love you.
I love you, too.
All right, Torres, you're with me.
McGee and Quinn, take the back.
Let's go.
Hey, go inside and be quiet.
I'm unarmed.
I'm going to unlock the door.
Step out.
Leland Spears.
Never thought I'd see you again,
Bubba.
Gibbs.
It's NCIS Special Agent Gibbs.
How'd he explain the tats to his wife?
He said that she knew that he had a past, riding with bikers.
The warrant paid off.
Deputy Director Roden got a call from Ramsay's burn phone yesterday.
Text Gibbs.
I'm willing to tell you anything you want to know.
But I need you to promise me something.
No deals.
You killed two Marines.
I'm just thinking about my wife and kids.
They don't know anything about what happened.
Or who I was.
I don't want them brought into this.
They won't be... if you cooperate.
What do you want to know?
Where are the nuclear fuel rods?
Buried.
About 500 feet from where we hijacked the truck.
I carefully selected the spot because it's near an auto salvage yard.
We unloaded the barrels and the truck drove away.
We tracked that truck halfway across the state.
Figured you would.
Okay, write it all down.
And include how Deputy Director Roden at the Department of Energy tipped you off... both times.
You know.
Yeah.
Write it.
When I'm finished... can I see my brother's body?
It's been almost 15 years since the nuclear fuel rods were stolen.
Gibbs?
Yeah.
Well, came by to tell you that the FBI picked up Deputy Director Roden.
Is he talking?
Yeah, apparently he's always been antigovernment.
He took the job at the DoE just to get on the inside.
And the FBI is now looking at all of his other cases to see how much damage he's done.
Quinn, you could've called me or... told me about that in the morning.
Yeah... there's something else.
I feel so guilty about this.
I was wondering what happened to that.
Well, it was when you were missing.
Bishop and I came here to look for you, and I...
I don't know what happened.
I...
It was an accident...
I just broke the dish in half.
Yeah.
But it's fixed.
You could've just snuck it back in here.
That's not my style.
Don't beat yourself up over that.
I do, I do.
I beat myself up over it, because I-I know how... horrible it is to lose something special.
I...
When I was 16, my mother gave me this bracelet, and it was from my grandmother, and...
I lost it.
It's...
I haven't been able to tell her.
Yeah, well, Kelly made this for her mom and me when she was in third grade.
I guess I used it too much...
It got a crack.
It was hairline at first, but... turned into something bigger.
But look at it now... it's like new.
How'd you do this?
You believe in miracles?
No.
You believe in Abby?
With all my heart.
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Quinn, tell your mom about the bracelet.
Yeah, no.
Long story.
I got time.

Operation Willoughby is a go.
McGEE:
Our target is Kai Chen.
Wealthy businessman suspected of committing acts of terror to manipulate the stock market.
I don't understand.
What's the catch here?
Reeves will be stuck on a plane with a bunch of guys who want to kill him.
Sitrep.
Reeves and Jintao have entered the plane, along with the pilot.
He's exiting the plane.
Damn it, he knows.
Call the tower.
Tell 'em to give Reeves the abort code.
Get him out of there now!
GIBBS:
Chen knows that you're alive and you could be a target, Reeves.
You need to lay low.
Qasim, these conversations you've been listening to, they're about a terrorist we've been tracking for months.
Your work could be the key to stopping him.
You know you're doing great, right?
Thank you.
The doctors managed to stop the bleeding, but Qasim was without oxygen for too long.
Last recording Qasim was supposed to translate.
Why are you giving this to me?
I don't know your reason, but I know you're willing to do anything to get Chen.
So am I.
Want me to freshen that, Gibbs?
Mm.
I'm good, Elaine.

Yo!
Anytime today will be fine.
Be right there.

Yeah.
Crazy morning.

Yeah, I ordered wheat bread.

Nothing yet.
I haven't found a translator I can trust.
How you doing?
I'm fine, really.
These are very pretty.
Yeah, we thought you'd like them.
Really?
Something's up.
Anyone hear from Gibbs?
He was supposed to teach an 8:00 field training class.
He never showed.
Uh, it's not like Gibbs to be late for anything.
He's not answering his home phone or his cell.
Yeah, that's, uh...
strange.
Find him.
Uh, he usually calls if he's gonna be late.
Something's wrong.
Or maybe he's doing something private that's none of our business.
Yeah, exactly.
Well, you know what, we heard the director.
He said we need to find him, so let's find him.
Quinn, Bishop, you guys go to Gibbs' house.
Uh, no, I really don't feel comfortable doing that.
Going into his house when he's not there?
Torres, you're with me.
Ooh, I like it when you take charge.
Where we going?
Same place Gibbs goes every morning.
Well, the good news is his truck isn't here.
Wouldn't want to find Gibbs in the basement, a victim of a power-tool accident.
He doesn't use power tools.
(sighs) (doorbell rings)
Door is never locked when he's home.
I guess it never is.
Gibbs?
It was written at 8:10.
Gibbs has never gotten a parking ticket before in his life.
QUINN:
All right, well, nothing unusual in the basement, besides a boat.
That's not strange.
Bishop, you find anything upstairs?
Well, I found something interesting on the nightstand in his bedroom.
What?
The Sensitive Man's Survival Handbook.
No.
That's probably a paperweight.
Uh-uh.
There's a bookmark on page 351.
Go figure.
I didn't see that one coming.
Mm-hmm.
This is a waste of time.
We're not gonna find anything.
(clang) Oh, no.
What?
I accidentally hit this against the faucet.
I'm sure Gibbs has other plates.
No, not like this one.
Looks like his daughter Kelly made it for him.
Ooh.
(exhales)
Ugh.
Gibbs was in a little earlier than usual.
Said he was teaching an 8:00 class.
Did he seem concerned about anything?
No.
As a matter of fact, he was a bit more chatty than usual.
Gibbs?
Leroy Jethro Gibbs?
Mm-hmm.
What was he saying?
I asked him if he wanted me to top off his coffee, and he said, "I'm good."
And that's chatty?
For Gibbs, the bar is low.
He normally responds with a look.
He also told me to take my time with the check.
That's why I was surprised when he disappeared.
Disappeared?
I left him waiting for his coffee to go.
When I brought it, he was gone.
He left a 20 on the table, which is way too much.
And poof.
(dialing)
(ringing)
Ah.
McGee, you found him.
Gibbs is okay.
Where was he?
Abby, I need you to ping his cell.
So you didn't find him?
Look, just do it, okay?
I'll explain later.
Oh, I don't like snooping on Gibbs.
Abby, trust me, you have to do this.
This is against my better judgment.
What are you doing?
ABBY:
That's funny.
What?
What's funny?
Not like funny "ha-ha."
Like funny weird.
Gibbs' phone is across the street from the diner.
Where you going?
(dialing)
McGee, are you gonna tell me what's going on?
Calling Gibbs' cell.
(phone ringing)
(phone ringing in mailbox)
The post office sent over an inspector.
He opened up the mailbox, and there they were.
Yeah, telephone, wallet, badge, and I.D.
Was he robbed?
Hard to tell.
No money in the wallet, but all his credit cards are in there.
Could Gibbs have dumped his stuff in the mailbox?
Maybe he was getting rid of anything that could I.D. him.
Undercover 101.
You want to get rid of anything on you that has your real name on it.
Exactly.
Well, Agent Quinn is gathering surveillance and traffic videos of the area around Gibbs' truck and the mailbox, so we'll see if they can tell us something there.
McGee, unlock his phone and find the last calls in and out.
Uh, Director, Gibbs doesn't lock anything.
And I can't believe he still uses a flip phone.
Besides, I already checked.
The last two calls were exchanges with Rebecca Chase.
Who called who?
She called him.
He called her back.
Hmm.
Who is Rebecca Chase?
Gibbs' ex-wife number two.
Actually, she may be number three.
I'm not...
I get confused on the order sometimes there.
When were the calls?
One was late last night, the other early this morning.
All right, let's not dismiss anything.
She might know something.
I'll give her a call.
I'll take this stuff to Abby, see if maybe she can pull a fingerprint or touch DNA from someone that is not Gibbs.
You know there are over 4,200 traffic surveillance cameras in D.C.?
More than any other city in the U.S.
Homeland is streaming me video feed from the traffic camera closest to the diner.
Bishop... why are you looking at Kai Chen's file?
I was deleting it.
Please, for your own sanity, leave tracking Chen to the others.
I will.
Bishop, I've known you since FLETC and I know how persistent you are.
Look, I understand you're in a bad place right now.
I'm better.
We need to focus on Gibbs.
You get the surveillance videos?
I'm just waiting.
Homeland is streaming them to me now.
Mm-Kay.
Anything I can do?
Yes, you can get your mind off revenge.
Chen will get his, okay?
You need to stay out of it.
You know he is a very dangerous man.

(sighs) You find anything in his truck?
No.
And my mind is spinning like a top,
I'm conjuring up all these horrible fates, you know.
It's like he just vanished.
It was-- like that, he was gone.
(sighs)
But then again, maybe he's just doing, like, a Superman thing.
You know, like, there was a, uh, like a damsel in distress, but-- but I mean, who knows?
This is what's driving me crazy.
We know nothing.
Abby... he's only been gone a couple hours.
And if anyone can take care of himself, it's Gibbs.
You're right.
I mean, you're-- you're definitely right.
I need to center myself.
I need to focus.
Gibbs is gonna be fine.
Gibbs is gonna be super fine.
Hey, any luck with his things?
Um, the only prints on them are Gibbs'.
I'm testing for DNA now.
QUINN:
Well, Gibbs rushed out of the diner at 7:22.
And then this camera picks him up.
McGEE:
He's looking right into the camera.
He wanted us to see this.
QUINN:
Very interesting.
And here's the other camera at the other end of the block.
Is Gibbs limping or is it me?
McGEE:
I think he is.
McGee, do you recognize this guy?
No.
Quinn, zoom in on the plate.
I can't make it out.
Yeah, it looks like five, something, "E."
Yeah, I can't make it out, either.
I'll shoot the image down to Abby, see if she can enhance it.
All right, I'll go see what she can find.
Hey-- oh, what are you doing?
The three Ps.
Positive pyramid power.
We have to get Gibbs back.
Uh, did you have a chance to, uh, look at the license plate?
That was fast.
Um, did you run it?
Oh, okay.
Um, well,
I have all the faith in the three Ps, uh, to bring Gibbs back.
So, when he does come back,
I need a favor.
(plate clinks)
Oh, no.
That's seven years bad luck.
Uh, no, I think that's mirrors.
Oh, my God.
Quinn!
It's the Kelly plate.
What happened?
(sighs) It was an accident.
It was this morning.
Gibbs is gonna be heartbroken.
I know, but he-he won't be if he never finds out.
And I heard you are the master at this, so can you fix it?
I can do my best.
Thanks.
BISHOP:
Got a name and an address.
Bodie Whitman.
Lives in Baltimore.
VANCE:
Bodie Whitman.
I remember that name.
He spent ten years in a federal prison for his part in an armed robbery.
Was one of Gibb's last undercover cases.
It's before my time.
It was... 2001.
Whitman was a foot soldier in a militant antigovernment militia led by his older brother.
Gibbs infiltrated the group using his backstopped alias,
Leland Robert Spears.
So, you and Torres are right.
Gibbs dumped anything that could identify him, went back undercover.
What the hell was Gibbs thinking?
These guys are psychos.
Ramsay Whitman.
He's Bodie's older brother.
He was behind the hijacking of a Navy truck by an antigovernment militia.
Two Marine Guards were killed.
The truck was transporting spent nuclear fuel rods, radioactive isotopes.
The intent was to make a dirty bomb.
So, Gibbs went undercover as Spears.
A month after the hijacking.
How did he infiltrate the group?
VANCE:
He was backstopped as an ex-con, disgruntled former Marine with antigovernment sentiments.
He was embedded with the group for months.
We had very little contact with him.
Been there.
VANCE:
The object was to find the fuel rods before they could use them.
According to Gibbs, only Ramsay Whitman knew where they were hidden.
Were they ever recovered?
No.
They're still out there.
What were they planning to attack?
D.C. Metro subway.
QUINN:
I remember that op went south when I was in Philly.
We never found out why, but Ramsay got spooked.
The gang scattered, and Gibbs disappeared with the others.
The only one that got arrested was Ramsay's brother, Bodie, but he wasn't connected to the hijacking.
TORRES:
Did Gibbs blow his cover and testify at trial?
No.
Wasn't needed.
Prison record says Bodie got five years for harboring his brother.
Badass that he is, Bodie got some more time for attacking a guard.
So, what happened to the rest of the militia?
Three of them were killed in a standoff with the FBI a year later.
And Ramsay Whitman's still on the wall.
I want you to dig out every file we have on the case.
Locate every agent that worked on it.
BISHOP:
Where the hell did Gibbs go with the brother?
I think ten bucks' worth should get us to Baltimore.
Here, here, here.
Why don't you fill 'er up.
Wow.
Look at you, Mr. Leland Spears.
I guess you're doing well.
Let me say this about that, Bubba.
You will be, too.
(chuckles)
(woman speaking indistinctly)
WOMAN:
Okay, well, I'm gonna have to wrap this up.
Excuse me, ma'am?
Ma'am, excuse me, I wonder if you'd help me.
Yes?
I lost my phone, and, uh, need to make a short call to my wife, just tell her I'll be late.
Uh, I'm sorry, she's a real worrier, you know?
Don't be long.
I've got to get going myself.
Thank you so much.
Vance caught up with Gibbs' ex-wife.
Yeah?
Yeah.
It wasn't anything-- they were just making plans to go to dinner tonight.
He was gonna have dinner with Rebecca?
(phone ringing) Yeah.
(ringing)
- Want to get that?
- Yeah.
Didn't answer.
Oh, I'm sorry.
At least I tried, huh?
That's all you can do.
That was weird.
Hmm?
Whoever it was just hung up on me.
I'm gonna call back.
What was that all about?
You know her?
Some lady with phone trouble.
(phone ringing)
You okay?
Yeah.
I just got a headache.
(phone ringing)
Hello.
Hi.
Did you just call my number?
No.
A man just borrowed my phone to make a call.
Could you describe him?
Who is this?
This is Special Agent McGee with NCIS, ma'am.
This is crazy.
What did the man look like?
Well... he's 50-something, has silver hair and incredible blue eyes.
Is he with a younger man in an SUV?
Yes.
They're still here.
Did you want me
No.
No.
to give him the phone?
Do not approach them.
Don't even look in their general direction.
Where are you?
At a gas station off I-95, just north of Savage Park, Maryland.
What do you want me to do?
Nothing.
Nothing.
It's best that you probably leave there.
Thank you.
Gibbs is with Bodie Whitman on the I-95, halfway between here and Baltimore.
According to Bodie's driver's license, that's where he lives.
MAN:
It was the summer of '96, and we were running surveillance on a chop shop-- just me and a couple of hotshot young agents named Gibbs and Vance.
That's Director Vance.
And if I remember, those two hotshots bailed your ass out of one hell of a firefight that night.
Is that the story you've been telling all these years, Leon?
Come here!
Oh, it's good to see you. (laughing)
You, too, Fred.
Well, we both know you didn't pull me off the back nine at National to reminisce, so...
why the hell am I here?
An old case of yours has resurfaced.
Which one?
My undercover I.D.
Damn, I was hoping it wasn't that one.
You remember Deputy Director
Doyle Roden of the Department of Energy.
Special Agent Pettis.
Doyle.
Uh, where's Gibbs?
You mean Spears.
Yeah.
He crossed paths with Bodie Whitman this morning.
Made contact, then went dark.
What do you think Gibbs' intentions are, Director?
I'm not sure, but my guess is he's trying to get a second crack at Ramsay Whitman, who's been on our Most Wanted Wall for the last 15 years.
And that's not the only thing that's gone missing.
Finding those nuclear fuel rods... still my responsibility.
Want to get those back before there's some sort of terrorist catastrophe.
Well, Th-this is great, but I'm retired.
12 years now.
I got three grandchildren.
Two I even like.
Why the hell would I want to risk my ass diving back into that Dumpster fire?
VANCE:
I'm not asking you to, Fred.
I want you two to put your heads together, see if you remember anything that's not in the files.
Okay.
Let's get started.
TORRES:
Engine trouble, McGee?
I'm pushing 70.
Well, I'm just saying, you know, given the situation, you know, you might want to push a tiny bit harder.
Look, I don't like the idea of Gibbs running solo either, but... he'll manage.
This isn't his first rodeo.
Have you ever ridden a bull, McGee?
No.
Actually, that's not true, I did ride a mechanical bull once at the Hoppy Gnome Bar.
Really wasn't my finest hour, though.
What about you?
Have you ridden one?
Only one.
Robert.
The bull was named Robert?
Yeah.
A big bastard, too.
But we locked eyes.
I couldn't back down.
I mounted up, and that, you know, that gate just exploded open.
Oh, he was ferocious.
He was whipping me back and forth like I was a ragdoll, and as the seconds ticked by, the crowd coming to life,
(imitates chant):
"Torres, Torres.
Torres...
(whispers):
Torres."
They kept chanting my name.
Yeah.
Yeah, I got that part.
That day I...
I faced a monster, McGee, and I managed to come out on top.
Why would they name a bull Robert?
Doesn't matter.
What does matter is that I had to face that very same bull two weeks later.
And he was pissed off, man.
And... this time he knew my weakness.
And he tossed me, like, 20 feet.
How did you learn to bull-ride?
I didn't.
And that was part of the problem.
But my analogy still applies.
What analogy?
Working deep undercover is like riding the rodeo, McGee.
You have to trust your instincts.
You got to hang on tight.
I do know one, uh, one rule for survival.
Never battle the same bull twice.
Moral of the story is...
Drive faster.
Thank you.
(engine humming)
Tell you something, Bubba.
You're gonna have a hard time getting your security deposit back.
(chuckles) Yeah.
Yeah.
That is, uh...
least of my worries.
Two months behind on the rent.
Okay.
Get this show on the road.
Call Ramsay.
Slow down, Spears.
You know how crazy he gets.
Say the wrong thing, and he flips.
Unbelievable.
What you're telling me is you're still afraid of him.
You know, we've only talked a couple times over the years.
I have no idea where he is.
And that's the way he wants it.
Absolutely.
I get that.
We can't mess with him.
And I got to make sure this buyer of yours is for real, or he will get spooked.
Let me say this about that.
In the car, I thought this was a done deal.
And I am taking your word that Ramsay still has the fuel rods.
What is your problem?
Get him on the phone or I am gone!
I don't just call him.
What does that mean?
Look, we've got this way of contacting each other in an emergency.
I call it the Bat-Signal, and the only time
I've used it since he went underground was to tell him our father died.
I'm waiting.
(chuckles)
I post our father's antique watch on this online auction site.
Ramsay's got the exact watch on this wish list, and, you know, he'll get an e-mail when it's posted, and hopefully he responds.
How?
Calls me back.
An untraceable burn phone.
Bubba, come on.
Come on.
Post it.
What the who?
(clears throat)
You want this or not?
Yeah.
All right.
Got your phone?
Yeah.
Don't worry.
If he calls, we won't miss it.
It's just around the corner.
We can eat there.
Or if you want, we can bring the food back.
Hey!
I'm sorry.
My bad.
You okay?
Yeah.
Thought maybe that guy grabbed my wallet.
Hey, nice picture, Spears.
(chuckles)
Come on.
Takeout's across the street.
Can't believe you're back in D.C.
Since last summer.
I lived in Idaho for a long time.
BODIE:
Yeah, well, I rotted in jail for ten years.
Made me hate the government even more.
GIBBS:
Absolutely, Bubba.
Gonna give this country a wake-up call.
Got that right.
I tell you, it's been needing one for a long time.
I'm really impressed with the way you slipped Gibbs that wallet and bug.
The reverse-pickpocket.
You like that?
Little trick I learned back in Ciudad Del Este.
Handy when you want to plant evidence.
Not that I ever done that.
I'm getting hungry.
What time is it?
I practiced on you.
Looks expensive.
It is.
(chuckles softly)
Can't believe you still got that Marine haircut.
It reminds me, every morning when I look in the mirror, just how much I hate how this government controls my life.
Sure doesn't sound like Gibbs.
It's not.
It's Spears.
(phone ringing)
BODIE:
No caller I.D.
It's got to be him.
Let's hope he's in a good mood.
Hey, big bro.
Yeah, I'm okay.
Got my good days.
And you?
Of course it's important.
You'll never guess who I ran into.
Leland Spears.
He's got a proposition.
He wants to talk to you.
Hey, Bubba.
What are the odds, huh?
Me running into your brother?
Well, yeah.
Yeah, you still got the stuff, I got a buyer.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, real deep pockets.
He'll make us all rich.
I need an answer.
Pronto.
He said he will let us know.
Well, sounds like we're gonna be here for a little bit.
(exhales)
Hey.
Hey.
How'd it go at the embassy?
- You learn anything from MI6?
- It was informative.
Intel suggests Chen might be on a yacht in the Aegean, off the coast of Greece.
They have a boat under surveillance.
It's hopeful.
If Gibbs finds out you're working on this and I'm helping you, he'll kill us both.
I'm willing to take that chance.
Hey, Quinn.
Hey.
Mission accomplished.
That's fantastic.
How'd you get rid of the crack?
The crack?
What crack?
Night.
Bubba, red queen on black king.
Huh.
Thanks.
(phone ringing)
Ramsay?
Uh-huh.
You sure?
Yeah, yeah, he's still here.
Okay.
I will tell him.
That was quick.
Everything okay?
BODIE:
Yeah.
Yeah, Ramsay's, uh, gonna set up a meeting.
Bitchin'.
Now you're talkin'.
Where?
Oh, he's gonna call back.
Hey.
Put the gun down.
BODIE:
You know, what Ramsay really said is that Leland Spears is a federal agent.
(laughing)
Oh, that's good.
That's good.
Where'd he come up with that one?
I don't know.
Well, he's insane.
You know that.
Paranoid.
That's what happened the last time.
Bubba, don't-don't blow this.
This is our chance to get a message to the government.
We will all get rich.
You playing me, Spears?
Or whatever the hell your name is?
He's messin' with you just like he always did.
Shut up!
I am not going back to prison, man!
Of course you're not.
In any event, he is crazy.
Okay.
Okay, o-okay, okay, okay.
S-Say-say that Ramsay...
is right.
I mean, say that I am a fed.
Uh-huh.
Then what?
What?
You shoot me, and you get the gas chamber.
That what you want,
Bubba?
So far, Bodie, you haven't done anything wrong.
All you've done... is talk to your brother.
No crime in that.
Let's end it right here.
Put the weapon down.
You know what makes quite a statement, too?
Shooting a federal agent.
You're not gonna get away with it.
I'm not alone.
There are other agents outside the door.
They're listening to everything we've said.
Don't take me for a fool.
McGee!
Right here, boss.
Torres!
(clattering)
Put the weapon down.
(baby crying in distance)
Gibbs.
Thank God you're okay.
Sure you're ready to be back at work?
It's where I need to be.
How about you?
Well, I'm gonna feel better when we catch
Ramsay Whitman.
Probably spooked him, he's gonna disappear again.
Where's Quinn?
Uh, she just went down to see Abby.
Tell her I'm with Ducky.
(door opens)
He didn't have to die, Duck.
You had no choice.
Don't know if it'll help your autopsy, but he was constantly popping those things.
Tetrabenazine.
Uh, it's prescribed for involuntary jerking and writhing movements.
Huh.
I thought he was strung out.
No.
No.
I just requested his prison medical records.
They show he was diagnosed with Huntington's disease.
Take a look.
It's progressive and debilitating.
I can confirm it with a brain scan. (door opens)
Hey, Duck.
Well, I have information on the last call Bodie Whitman received.
From his brother?
Yeah.
Uh, we traced it to a cell tower in Tazewell County.
You find anything on the phone that made the call?
Well, as suspected, it was a cheap burner phone.
It was purchased six years ago.
There's no record of the buyer.
We did try to ping it and it was turned off.
Ramsay destroyed that phone as soon as he hung up.
Excuse me-
- Ramsay's the brother?
Well, I don't know if this will help you, but Huntington's is a rare disease.
And if they were full siblings, there's a 50-50 chance the brother could suffer from the same disorder.
Well, Tazewell County's a small county--
I mean, how many cases of Huntington's disease can there be in the area?
Not many.
It's a lead I can follow.
QUINN:
I'll help you, Ducky.
Leon, you wanted to see me?
Mm-hmm.
Why are you looking at those two?
I think I almost got you killed.
15 years ago, when you went undercover to take down Ramsay Whitman, he somehow found out that the federal government was closing in on him.
He disappeared.
And yesterday, between two phone calls to his brother, he learned that Leland Spears was a federal agent.
When we realized that you were with Bodie Whitman, I called these two in to help, and now we have a leak.
A retired NCIS agent and the deputy director of U.S. Department of Energy.
Mm-hmm.
(phone rings)
Yes, Pamela.
Send 'em in.
(door opens)
Jethro, there is someone in Tazewell County who's being treated for Huntington's disease.
Alex.
Uh, may I use your computer, Director?
Certainly.
Tazewell County,
Huntington's disease?
Following a lead, Leon.
That's the wrong name, but his age is about right.
He doesn't look anything like the radical skinhead killer I remember.
Get us a warrant, Leon.
See if one of 'em got a call from Tazewell County yesterday.
Once upon a time, there lived a very, very nasty man.
Ramsay Whitman was angry and disgruntled...
Abbs.
And he killed two Marines and vanished into thin air.
Or not.
What do we know about John Manning?
Nothing, till 11 years ago, when he moved to Northwest Virginia.
Married a local woman there, a schoolteacher.
They have two kids together.
Girl's seven, boy's five.
TORRES:
Yeah, residential real estate broker, well liked in the community, member of the Rotary Club, deacon in his church.
He, uh, coaches his daughter's soccer team.
They went eight and two.
They're actually pretty good.
You're sure that these two guys are the same guy?
Oh, yeah.
Salient facial features are a 96% match.
Yeah, I know this guy.
Ramsay Whitman's spooked.
Come on, we got to move fast.
Okay, we're just gonna go to Grandma's, okay?
(sighs)
I have a dentist appointment tomorrow.
Don't worry, I'll call him.
Wait.
See if Ramsay's leaving with the family.
Rather not make the takedown in front of the kids.
Roger that.
QUINN:
You know, half of me is hoping we're wrong about this guy.
When you get to your mother's, wait for my call.
Okay, you're really scaring me, John.
Can't you tell me what's going on?
No.
Not-not now.
Just... get going.
Please.
Okay.
I love you.
I love you, too.
(engine starts)
All right, Torres, you're with me.
McGee and Quinn, take the back.
Let's go.
Hey, go inside and be quiet.
(knocking) GIBBS:
NCIS!
RAMSAY:
I'm unarmed.
I'm going to unlock the door.
Step out.
Leland Spears.
Never thought I'd see you again,
Bubba.
Gibbs.
It's NCIS Special Agent Gibbs.
How'd he explain the tats to his wife?
He said that she knew that he had a past, riding with bikers.
The warrant paid off.
Deputy Director Roden got a call from Ramsay's burn phone yesterday.
Text Gibbs.
RAMSAY:
I'm willing to tell you anything you want to know.
But I need you to promise me something.
No deals.
You killed two Marines.
(phone dings)
I'm just thinking about my wife and kids.
They don't know anything about what happened.
Or who I was.
I don't want them brought into this.
They won't be... if you cooperate.
What do you want to know?
Where are the nuclear fuel rods?
Buried.
About 500 feet from where we hijacked the truck.
I carefully selected the spot because it's near an auto salvage yard.
We unloaded the barrels and the truck drove away.
We tracked that truck halfway across the state.
Figured you would.
Okay, write it all down.
And include how Deputy Director Roden at the Department of Energy tipped you off... both times.
(short chuckle)
You know.
Yeah.
Write it.
When I'm finished... can I see my brother's body?
REPORTER:
It's been almost 15 years since the nuclear fuel rods were stolen.
(door opens) QUINN:
Gibbs?
Yeah.
Well, came by to tell you that the FBI picked up Deputy Director Roden.
Is he talking?
Yeah, apparently he's always been antigovernment.
He took the job at the DoE just to get on the inside.
And the FBI is now looking at all of his other cases to see how much damage he's done.
Quinn, you could've called me or... told me about that in the morning.
Yeah, uh... there's something else.
I feel so guilty about this.
I was wondering what happened to that.
Well, it was when you were missing.
Bishop and I came here to look for you, and I...
I don't know what happened.
I...
It was an accident-- I just broke the dish in half.
Yeah.
But it's fixed.
You could've just snuck it back in here.
That's not my style.
Don't beat yourself up over that.
I do, I do.
I beat myself up over it, because I-I know how... horrible it is to lose something special.
I...
When I was 16, my mother gave me this bracelet, and it was from my grandmother, and...
I lost it.
It's...
I haven't been able to tell her.
Yeah, well, Kelly made this for her mom and me when she was in third grade.
I guess I used it too much-- it got a crack.
It was hairline at first, but... turned into something bigger.
But look at it now-- it's like new.
How'd you do this?
You believe in miracles?
No.
You believe in Abby?
With all my heart.
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Quinn, tell your mom about the bracelet.
Yeah, no.
Long story.
I got time.

Operation Willoughby is a go.
Our target is Kai Chen.
Wealthy businessman suspected of committing acts of terror to manipulate the stock market.
I don't understand.
What's the catch here?
Reeves will be stuck on a plane with a bunch of guys who want to kill him.
Sitrep.
Reeves and Jintao have entered the plane, along with the pilot.
He's exiting the plane.
Damn it, he knows.
Call the tower.
Tell 'em to give Reeves the abort code.
Get him out of there now!
Chen knows that you're alive and you could be a target, Reeves.
You need to lay low.
Qasim, these conversations you've been listening to, they're about a terrorist we've been tracking for months.
Your work could be the key to stopping him.
You know you're doing great, right?
Thank you.
The doctors managed to stop the bleeding, but Qasim was without oxygen for too long.
Last recording Qasim was supposed to translate.
Why are you giving this to me?
I don't know your reason, but I know you're willing to do anything to get Chen.
So am I.
Want me to freshen that, Gibbs?
Mm.
I'm good, Elaine.
Yo!
Anytime today will be fine.
Be right there.
Yeah.
Crazy morning.
Darlene called in sick.
I'll get you a cup to go.
No rush.
Take your time.
Ah, so your vacation's over?
Sorry it took so long.
Yeah, I ordered wheat bread.
Give me a minute.
You sure you got nothing?
I mean, a half day?
Sorry, pal.
Hey, Bodie.
Man...
No.
I thought you were dead.
No, that's wishful thinking, Bubba.
Wishful thinking.

What's that?
A flower arrangement.
Oh, yeah, see, um... no frou-frou flowers around my desk, thanks.
Relax, Fabio, they're for Bishop.
She had a horrible week.
I mean, the funeral, and then she had to clear out Qasim's apartment.
That's a nice thought.
Put my name on the card, I'll pay for half.
No, they're from me, Nick.
On my way.
I've been summoned to the British embassy.
Another debriefing about Willoughby?
MI6 special-op director's in town on a fact-finding mission.
Hey.
Hey.
You good?
I'm fine.
Are you sure?
Mm-hmm.
Hey, um... any more on Kai Chen?
Gibbs told you not to get involved.
Qasim's flash drive, what'd you do with it?
Nothing yet.
I haven't found a translator I can trust.
How you doing?
I'm fine, really.
These are very pretty.
Yeah, we thought you'd like them.
Really?
Something's up.
Anyone hear from Gibbs?
He was supposed to teach an 8:00 field training class.
He never showed.
Uh, it's not like Gibbs to be late for anything.
He's not answering his home phone or his cell.
Yeah, that's, uh...
strange.
Find him.
Uh, he usually calls if he's gonna be late.
Something's wrong.
Or maybe he's doing something private that's none of our business.
Yeah, exactly.
Well, you know what, we heard the director.
He said we need to find him, so let's find him.
Quinn, Bishop, you guys go to Gibbs' house.
Uh, no, I really don't feel comfortable doing that.
Going into his house when he's not there?
Torres, you're with me.
Ooh, I like it when you take charge.
Where we going?
Same place Gibbs goes every morning.
Well, the good news is his truck isn't here.
Wouldn't want to find Gibbs in the basement, a victim of a power-tool accident.
He doesn't use power tools.
Door is never locked when he's home.
I guess it never is.
Gibbs?
It was written at 8:10.
Gibbs has never gotten a parking ticket before in his life.
All right, well, nothing unusual in the basement, besides a boat.
That's not strange.
Bishop, you find anything upstairs?
Well, I found something interesting on the nightstand in his bedroom.
What?
The Sensitive Man's Survival Handbook.
No.
That's probably a paperweight.
Uh-uh.
There's a bookmark on page 351.
Go figure.
I didn't see that one coming.
Mm-hmm.
This is a waste of time.
We're not gonna find anything.
Oh, no.
What?
I accidentally hit this against the faucet.
I'm sure Gibbs has other plates.
No, not like this one.
Looks like his daughter Kelly made it for him.
Ooh.
Ugh.
Gibbs was in a little earlier than usual.
Said he was teaching an 8:00 class.
Did he seem concerned about anything?
No.
As a matter of fact, he was a bit more chatty than usual.
Gibbs?
Leroy Jethro Gibbs?
Mm-hmm.
What was he saying?
I asked him if he wanted me to top off his coffee, and he said, "I'm good."
And that's chatty?
For Gibbs, the bar is low.
He normally responds with a look.
He also told me to take my time with the check.
That's why I was surprised when he disappeared.
Disappeared?
I left him waiting for his coffee to go.
When I brought it, he was gone.
He left a 20 on the table, which is way too much.
And poof.
Ah.
McGee, you found him.
Gibbs is okay.
Where was he?
Abby, I need you to ping his cell.
So you didn't find him?
Look, just do it, okay?
I'll explain later.
Oh, I don't like snooping on Gibbs.
Abby, trust me, you have to do this.
This is against my better judgment.
What are you doing?
That's funny.
What?
What's funny?
Not like funny "ha-ha."
Like funny weird.
Gibbs' phone is across the street from the diner.
Where you going?
McGee, are you gonna tell me what's going on?
Calling Gibbs' cell.
The post office sent over an inspector.
He opened up the mailbox, and there they were.
Yeah, telephone, wallet, badge, and I.D.
Was he robbed?
Hard to tell.
No money in the wallet, but all his credit cards are in there.
Could Gibbs have dumped his stuff in the mailbox?
Maybe he was getting rid of anything that could I.D. him.
Undercover 101.
You want to get rid of anything on you that has your real name on it.
Exactly.
Well, Agent Quinn is gathering surveillance and traffic videos of the area around Gibbs' truck and the mailbox, so we'll see if they can tell us something there.
McGee, unlock his phone and find the last calls in and out.
Uh, Director, Gibbs doesn't lock anything.
And I can't believe he still uses a flip phone.
Besides, I already checked.
The last two calls were exchanges with Rebecca Chase.
Who called who?
She called him.
He called her back.
Hmm.
Who is Rebecca Chase?
Gibbs' ex-wife number two.
Actually, she may be number three.
I'm not...
I get confused on the order sometimes there.
When were the calls?
One was late last night, the other early this morning.
All right, let's not dismiss anything.
She might know something.
I'll give her a call.
I'll take this stuff to Abby, see if maybe she can pull a fingerprint or touch DNA from someone that is not Gibbs.
You know there are over 4,200 traffic surveillance cameras in D.C.?
More than any other city in the U.S.
Homeland is streaming me video feed from the traffic camera closest to the diner.
Bishop... why are you looking at Kai Chen's file?
I was deleting it.
Please, for your own sanity, leave tracking Chen to the others.
I will.
Bishop, I've known you since FLETC and I know how persistent you are.
Look, I understand you're in a bad place right now.
I'm better.
We need to focus on Gibbs.
You get the surveillance videos?
I'm just waiting.
Homeland is streaming them to me now.
Mm-Kay.
Anything I can do?
Yes, you can get your mind off revenge.
Chen will get his, okay?
You need to stay out of it.
You know he is a very dangerous man.
Don't worry, Alex, I hear you.
Do you?
Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna go see what Abby's come up with on Gibbs.
Oh.
Hug.
How are you?
I wish everyone would stop asking me that.
I am okay.
Promise.
I just want to get back to work.
I've just been-- I've been so worried about you and now Gibbs.
You find anything in his truck?
No.
And my mind is spinning like a top,
I'm conjuring up all these horrible fates, you know.
It's like he just vanished.
It was-- like that, he was gone.
But then again, maybe he's just doing, like, a Superman thing.
You know, like, there was a, uh, like a damsel in distress, but-- but I mean, who knows?
This is what's driving me crazy.
We know nothing.
Abby... he's only been gone a couple hours.
And if anyone can take care of himself, it's Gibbs.
You're right.
I mean, you're-- you're definitely right.
I need to center myself.
I need to focus.
Gibbs is gonna be fine.
Gibbs is gonna be super fine.
Hey, any luck with his things?
Um, the only prints on them are Gibbs'.
I'm testing for DNA now.
Well, Gibbs rushed out of the diner at 7:22.
And then this camera picks him up.
He's looking right into the camera.
He wanted us to see this.
Very interesting.
And here's the other camera at the other end of the block.
Is Gibbs limping or is it me?
I think he is.
McGee, do you recognize this guy?
No.
Quinn, zoom in on the plate.
I can't make it out.
Yeah, it looks like five, something, "E."
Yeah, I can't make it out, either.
I'll shoot the image down to Abby, see if she can enhance it.
All right, I'll go see what she can find.
Hey-- oh, what are you doing?
The three Ps.
Positive pyramid power.
We have to get Gibbs back.
Uh, did you have a chance to, uh, look at the license plate?
That was fast.
Um, did you run it?
Oh, okay.
Um, well,
I have all the faith in the three Ps, uh, to bring Gibbs back.
So, when he does come back,
I need a favor.
Oh, no.
That's seven years bad luck.
Uh, no, I think that's mirrors.
Oh, my God.
Quinn!
It's the Kelly plate.
What happened?
It was an accident.
It was this morning.
Gibbs is gonna be heartbroken.
I know, but he-he won't be if he never finds out.
And I heard you are the master at this, so can you fix it?
I can do my best.
Thanks.
Got a name and an address.
Bodie Whitman.
Lives in Baltimore.
Bodie Whitman.
I remember that name.
He spent ten years in a federal prison for his part in an armed robbery.
Was one of Gibb's last undercover cases.
It's before my time.
It was... 2001.
Whitman was a foot soldier in a militant antigovernment militia led by his older brother.
Gibbs infiltrated the group using his backstopped alias,
Leland Robert Spears.
So, you and Torres are right.
Gibbs dumped anything that could identify him, went back undercover.
What the hell was Gibbs thinking?
These guys are psychos.
Ramsay Whitman.
He's Bodie's older brother.
He was behind the hijacking of a Navy truck by an antigovernment militia.
Two Marine Guards were killed.
The truck was transporting spent nuclear fuel rods, radioactive isotopes.
The intent was to make a dirty bomb.
So, Gibbs went undercover as Spears.
A month after the hijacking.
How did he infiltrate the group?
He was backstopped as an ex-con, disgruntled former Marine with antigovernment sentiments.
He was embedded with the group for months.
We had very little contact with him.
Been there.
The object was to find the fuel rods before they could use them.
According to Gibbs, only Ramsay Whitman knew where they were hidden.
Were they ever recovered?
No.
They're still out there.
What were they planning to attack?
D.C. Metro subway.
I remember that op went south when I was in Philly.
We never found out why, but Ramsay got spooked.
The gang scattered, and Gibbs disappeared with the others.
The only one that got arrested was Ramsay's brother, Bodie, but he wasn't connected to the hijacking.
Did Gibbs blow his cover and testify at trial?
No.
Wasn't needed.
Prison record says Bodie got five years for harboring his brother.
Badass that he is, Bodie got some more time for attacking a guard.
So, what happened to the rest of the militia?
Three of them were killed in a standoff with the FBI a year later.
And Ramsay Whitman's still on the wall.
I want you to dig out every file we have on the case.
Locate every agent that worked on it.
Where the hell did Gibbs go with the brother?
I think ten bucks' worth should get us to Baltimore.
Here, here, here.
Why don't you fill 'er up.
Wow.
Look at you, Mr. Leland Spears.
I guess you're doing well.
Let me say this about that, Bubba.
You will be, too.
Okay, well, I'm gonna have to wrap this up.
Excuse me, ma'am?
Ma'am, excuse me, I wonder if you'd help me.
Yes?
I lost my phone, and, uh, need to make a short call to my wife, just tell her I'll be late.
Uh, I'm sorry, she's a real worrier, you know?
Don't be long.
I've got to get going myself.
Thank you so much.
Vance caught up with Gibbs' ex-wife.
Yeah?
Yeah.
It wasn't anything-- they were just making plans to go to dinner tonight.
He was gonna have dinner with Rebecca?
Yeah.
- Want to get that?
- Yeah.
Didn't answer.
Oh, I'm sorry.
At least I tried, huh?
That's all you can do.
That was weird.
Hmm?
Whoever it was just hung up on me.
I'm gonna call back.
What was that all about?
You know her?
Some lady with phone trouble.
You okay?
Yeah.
I just got a headache.
Hello.
Hi.
Did you just call my number?
No.
A man just borrowed my phone to make a call.
Could you describe him?
Who is this?
This is Special Agent McGee with NCIS, ma'am.
This is crazy.
What did the man look like?
Well... he's 50-something, has silver hair and incredible blue eyes.
Is he with a younger man in an SUV?
Yes.
They're still here.
Did you want me
No.
No.
to give him the phone?
Do not approach them.
Don't even look in their general direction.
Where are you?
At a gas station off I-95, just north of Savage Park, Maryland.
What do you want me to do?
Nothing.
Nothing.
It's best that you probably leave there.
Thank you.
Gibbs is with Bodie Whitman on the I-95, halfway between here and Baltimore.
According to Bodie's driver's license, that's where he lives.
It was the summer of '96, and we were running surveillance on a chop shop-- just me and a couple of hotshot young agents named Gibbs and Vance.
That's Director Vance.
And if I remember, those two hotshots bailed your ass out of one hell of a firefight that night.
Is that the story you've been telling all these years, Leon?
Come here!
Oh, it's good to see you.
You, too, Fred.
Well, we both know you didn't pull me off the back nine at National to reminisce, so...
why the hell am I here?
An old case of yours has resurfaced.
Which one?
My undercover I.D.
Damn, I was hoping it wasn't that one.
You remember Deputy Director
Doyle Roden of the Department of Energy.
Special Agent Pettis.
Doyle.
Uh, where's Gibbs?
You mean Spears.
Yeah.
He crossed paths with Bodie Whitman this morning.
Made contact, then went dark.
What do you think Gibbs' intentions are, Director?
I'm not sure, but my guess is he's trying to get a second crack at Ramsay Whitman, who's been on our Most Wanted Wall for the last 15 years.
And that's not the only thing that's gone missing.
Finding those nuclear fuel rods... still my responsibility.
Want to get those back before there's some sort of terrorist catastrophe.
Well, Th-this is great, but I'm retired.
12 years now.
I got three grandchildren.
Two I even like.
Why the hell would I want to risk my ass diving back into that Dumpster fire?
I'm not asking you to, Fred.
I want you two to put your heads together, see if you remember anything that's not in the files.
Okay.
Let's get started.
Engine trouble, McGee?
I'm pushing 70.
Well, I'm just saying, you know, given the situation, you know, you might want to push a tiny bit harder.
Look, I don't like the idea of Gibbs running solo either, but... he'll manage.
This isn't his first rodeo.
Have you ever ridden a bull, McGee?
No.
Actually, that's not true, I did ride a mechanical bull once at the Hoppy Gnome Bar.
Really wasn't my finest hour, though.
What about you?
Have you ridden one?
Only one.
Robert.
The bull was named Robert?
Yeah.
A big bastard, too.
But we locked eyes.
I couldn't back down.
I mounted up, and that, you know, that gate just exploded open.
Oh, he was ferocious.
He was whipping me back and forth like I was a ragdoll, and as the seconds ticked by, the crowd coming to life,
"Torres, Torres.
Torres...
Torres."
They kept chanting my name.
Yeah.
Yeah, I got that part.
That day I...
I faced a monster, McGee, and I managed to come out on top.
Why would they name a bull Robert?
Doesn't matter.
What does matter is that I had to face that very same bull two weeks later.
And he was pissed off, man.
And... this time he knew my weakness.
And he tossed me, like, 20 feet.
How did you learn to bull-ride?
I didn't.
And that was part of the problem.
But my analogy still applies.
What analogy?
Working deep undercover is like riding the rodeo, McGee.
You have to trust your instincts.
You got to hang on tight.
I do know one, uh, one rule for survival.
Never battle the same bull twice.
Moral of the story is...
Drive faster.
Thank you.
Tell you something, Bubba.
You're gonna have a hard time getting your security deposit back.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That is, uh...
least of my worries.
Two months behind on the rent.
Okay.
Get this show on the road.
Call Ramsay.
Slow down, Spears.
You know how crazy he gets.
Say the wrong thing, and he flips.
Unbelievable.
What you're telling me is you're still afraid of him.
You know, we've only talked a couple times over the years.
I have no idea where he is.
And that's the way he wants it.
Absolutely.
I get that.
We can't mess with him.
And I got to make sure this buyer of yours is for real, or he will get spooked.
Let me say this about that.
In the car, I thought this was a done deal.
And I am taking your word that Ramsay still has the fuel rods.
What is your problem?
Get him on the phone or I am gone!
I don't just call him.
What does that mean?
Look, we've got this way of contacting each other in an emergency.
I call it the Bat-Signal, and the only time
I've used it since he went underground was to tell him our father died.
I'm waiting.
I post our father's antique watch on this online auction site.
Ramsay's got the exact watch on this wish list, and, you know, he'll get an e-mail when it's posted, and hopefully he responds.
How?
Calls me back.
An untraceable burn phone.
Bubba, come on.
Come on.
Post it.
What the who?
You want this or not?
Yeah.
All right.
Got your phone?
Yeah.
Don't worry.
If he calls, we won't miss it.
It's just around the corner.
We can eat there.
Or if you want, we can bring the food back.
Hey!
I'm sorry.
My bad.
You okay?
Yeah.
Thought maybe that guy grabbed my wallet.
Hey, nice picture, Spears.
Come on.
Takeout's across the street.
Can't believe you're back in D.C.
Since last summer.
I lived in Idaho for a long time.
Yeah, well, I rotted in jail for ten years.
Made me hate the government even more.
Absolutely, Bubba.
Gonna give this country a wake-up call.
Got that right.
I tell you, it's been needing one for a long time.
I'm really impressed with the way you slipped Gibbs that wallet and bug.
The reverse-pickpocket.
You like that?
Little trick I learned back in Ciudad Del Este.
Handy when you want to plant evidence.
Not that I ever done that.
I'm getting hungry.
What time is it?
I practiced on you.
Looks expensive.
It is.
Can't believe you still got that Marine haircut.
It reminds me, every morning when I look in the mirror, just how much I hate how this government controls my life.
Sure doesn't sound like Gibbs.
It's not.
It's Spears.
No caller I.D.
It's got to be him.
Let's hope he's in a good mood.
Hey, big bro.
Yeah, I'm okay.
Got my good days.
And you?
Of course it's important.
You'll never guess who I ran into.
Leland Spears.
He's got a proposition.
He wants to talk to you.
Hey, Bubba.
What are the odds, huh?
Me running into your brother?
Well, yeah.
Yeah, you still got the stuff, I got a buyer.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, real deep pockets.
He'll make us all rich.
I need an answer.
Pronto.
He said he will let us know.
Well, sounds like we're gonna be here for a little bit.
Hey.
Hey.
How'd it go at the embassy?
- You learn anything from MI6?
- It was informative.
Intel suggests Chen might be on a yacht in the Aegean, off the coast of Greece.
They have a boat under surveillance.
It's hopeful.
If Gibbs finds out you're working on this and I'm helping you, he'll kill us both.
I'm willing to take that chance.
Hey, Quinn.
Hey.
Mission accomplished.
That's fantastic.
How'd you get rid of the crack?
The crack?
What crack?
Night.
Bubba, red queen on black king.
Huh.
Thanks.
Ramsay?
Uh-huh.
You sure?
Yeah, yeah, he's still here.
Okay.
I will tell him.
That was quick.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, Ramsay's, uh, gonna set up a meeting.
Bitchin'.
Now you're talkin'.
Where?
Oh, he's gonna call back.
Hey.
Put the gun down.
You know, what Ramsay really said is that Leland Spears is a federal agent.
Oh, that's good.
That's good.
Where'd he come up with that one?
I don't know.
Well, he's insane.
You know that.
Paranoid.
That's what happened the last time.
Bubba, don't-don't blow this.
This is our chance to get a message to the government.
We will all get rich.
You playing me, Spears?
Or whatever the hell your name is?
He's messin' with you just like he always did.
Shut up!
I am not going back to prison, man!
Of course you're not.
In any event, he is crazy.
Okay.
Okay, o-okay, okay, okay.
S-Say-say that Ramsay...
is right.
I mean, say that I am a fed.
Uh-huh.
Then what?
What?
You shoot me, and you get the gas chamber.
That what you want,
Bubba?
So far, Bodie, you haven't done anything wrong.
All you've done... is talk to your brother.
No crime in that.
Let's end it right here.
Put the weapon down.
You know what makes quite a statement, too?
Shooting a federal agent.
You're not gonna get away with it.
I'm not alone.
There are other agents outside the door.
They're listening to everything we've said.
Don't take me for a fool.
McGee!
Right here, boss.
Torres!
Put the weapon down.
Gibbs.
Thank God you're okay.
Sure you're ready to be back at work?
It's where I need to be.
How about you?
Well, I'm gonna feel better when we catch
Ramsay Whitman.
Probably spooked him, he's gonna disappear again.
Where's Quinn?
Uh, she just went down to see Abby.
Tell her I'm with Ducky.
He didn't have to die, Duck.
You had no choice.
Don't know if it'll help your autopsy, but he was constantly popping those things.
Tetrabenazine.
Uh, it's prescribed for involuntary jerking and writhing movements.
Huh.
I thought he was strung out.
No.
No.
I just requested his prison medical records.
They show he was diagnosed with Huntington's disease.
Take a look.
It's progressive and debilitating.
I can confirm it with a brain scan.
Hey, Duck.
Well, I have information on the last call Bodie Whitman received.
From his brother?
Yeah.
Uh, we traced it to a cell tower in Tazewell County.
You find anything on the phone that made the call?
Well, as suspected, it was a cheap burner phone.
It was purchased six years ago.
There's no record of the buyer.
We did try to ping it and it was turned off.
Ramsay destroyed that phone as soon as he hung up.
Excuse me-
- Ramsay's the brother?
Well, I don't know if this will help you, but Huntington's is a rare disease.
And if they were full siblings, there's a 50-50 chance the brother could suffer from the same disorder.
Well, Tazewell County's a small county--
I mean, how many cases of Huntington's disease can there be in the area?
Not many.
It's a lead I can follow.
I'll help you, Ducky.
Leon, you wanted to see me?
Mm-hmm.
Why are you looking at those two?
I think I almost got you killed.
15 years ago, when you went undercover to take down Ramsay Whitman, he somehow found out that the federal government was closing in on him.
He disappeared.
And yesterday, between two phone calls to his brother, he learned that Leland Spears was a federal agent.
When we realized that you were with Bodie Whitman, I called these two in to help, and now we have a leak.
A retired NCIS agent and the deputy director of U.S. Department of Energy.
Mm-hmm.
Yes, Pamela.
Send 'em in.
Jethro, there is someone in Tazewell County who's being treated for Huntington's disease.
Alex.
Uh, may I use your computer, Director?
Certainly.
Tazewell County,
Huntington's disease?
Following a lead, Leon.
That's the wrong name, but his age is about right.
He doesn't look anything like the radical skinhead killer I remember.
Get us a warrant, Leon.
See if one of 'em got a call from Tazewell County yesterday.
Once upon a time, there lived a very, very nasty man.
Ramsay Whitman was angry and disgruntled...
Abbs.
And he killed two Marines and vanished into thin air.
Or not.
What do we know about John Manning?
Nothing, till 11 years ago, when he moved to Northwest Virginia.
Married a local woman there, a schoolteacher.
They have two kids together.
Girl's seven, boy's five.
Yeah, residential real estate broker, well liked in the community, member of the Rotary Club, deacon in his church.
He, uh, coaches his daughter's soccer team.
They went eight and two.
They're actually pretty good.
You're sure that these two guys are the same guy?
Oh, yeah.
Salient facial features are a 96% match.
Yeah, I know this guy.
Ramsay Whitman's spooked.
Come on, we got to move fast.
Okay, we're just gonna go to Grandma's, okay?
I have a dentist appointment tomorrow.
Don't worry, I'll call him.
Wait.
See if Ramsay's leaving with the family.
Rather not make the takedown in front of the kids.
Roger that.
You know, half of me is hoping we're wrong about this guy.
When you get to your mother's, wait for my call.
Okay, you're really scaring me, John.
Can't you tell me what's going on?
No.
Not-not now.
Just... get going.
Please.
Okay.
I love you.
I love you, too.
All right, Torres, you're with me.
McGee and Quinn, take the back.
Let's go.
Hey, go inside and be quiet.
NCIS!
I'm unarmed.
I'm going to unlock the door.
Step out.
Leland Spears.
Never thought I'd see you again,
Bubba.
Gibbs.
It's NCIS Special Agent Gibbs.
How'd he explain the tats to his wife?
He said that she knew that he had a past, riding with bikers.
The warrant paid off.
Deputy Director Roden got a call from Ramsay's burn phone yesterday.
Text Gibbs.
I'm willing to tell you anything you want to know.
But I need you to promise me something.
No deals.
You killed two Marines.
I'm just thinking about my wife and kids.
They don't know anything about what happened.
Or who I was.
I don't want them brought into this.
They won't be... if you cooperate.
What do you want to know?
Where are the nuclear fuel rods?
Buried.
About 500 feet from where we hijacked the truck.
I carefully selected the spot because it's near an auto salvage yard.
We unloaded the barrels and the truck drove away.
We tracked that truck halfway across the state.
Figured you would.
Okay, write it all down.
And include how Deputy Director Roden at the Department of Energy tipped you off... both times.
You know.
Yeah.
Write it.
When I'm finished... can I see my brother's body?
It's been almost 15 years since the nuclear fuel rods were stolen.
Gibbs?
Yeah.
Well, came by to tell you that the FBI picked up Deputy Director Roden.
Is he talking?
Yeah, apparently he's always been antigovernment.
He took the job at the DoE just to get on the inside.
And the FBI is now looking at all of his other cases to see how much damage he's done.
Quinn, you could've called me or... told me about that in the morning.
Yeah, uh... there's something else.
I feel so guilty about this.
I was wondering what happened to that.
Well, it was when you were missing.
Bishop and I came here to look for you, and I...
I don't know what happened.
I...
It was an accident-- I just broke the dish in half.
Yeah.
But it's fixed.
You could've just snuck it back in here.
That's not my style.
Don't beat yourself up over that.
I do, I do.
I beat myself up over it, because I-I know how... horrible it is to lose something special.
I...
When I was 16, my mother gave me this bracelet, and it was from my grandmother, and...
I lost it.
It's...
I haven't been able to tell her.
Yeah, well, Kelly made this for her mom and me when she was in third grade.
I guess I used it too much-- it got a crack.
It was hairline at first, but... turned into something bigger.
But look at it now-- it's like new.
How'd you do this?
You believe in miracles?
No.
You believe in Abby?
With all my heart.
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Quinn, tell your mom about the bracelet.
Yeah, no.
Long story.
I got time.

Previously, on "Casual"...
- Got an interview.
- Ooh.
Some new company in digital branding.
And, as Chief Technology Officer, I would, what?
- Head up the development team?
- The CTO is more of, um,
- an IT professional.
- Yeah.
You want me to be the guy who tells you how to restart your computer?
Hey, there.
Got a minute to stick it to the oligarchy?
You don't think maybe the people backing this initiative have a less than philanthropic agenda?
The Clean Renewables Institute?
It's a group of rich old men who want to sell natural gas.
I'm always looking for interns.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Jack Briggs.
He can sustain a relationship about as long as he could probably hold a boom box over his head.
I just don't wanna see you get hurt.
- Do you find me attractive?
- I do.
Do you think you can have sex with someone you find attractive, no strings attached?
- Hey, could you pass the milk?
- Yeah.
All right.
Did you know you have three cartons of eggs, and the oldest carton is, like, four months old, and there's only one egg in it?
Eggs don't spoil.
So do I ask why you're in costume, or do you just tell me?
Yeah, it's my alter ego, Tybalt, a medieval
Scandinavian sorcerer.
Right.
Of course.
Oh, wait, shit, it's your first day.
- Yep.
- Are you nervous?
- I'd be nervous.
- Nervous?
No.
I'm so fucking nervous.
I haven't been a wage slave since my 20s.
Do you think they'll haze me?
No, I'm sure they'll just stick to pre-formed social groups and subtly isolate you.
Thank you, that's helpful.
- Yeah.
- What do we have here?
Ah, "Magic:
The Gathering."
Bunch of friends are coming over to play cards.
And you wear costumes for this game?
No, I just love costumes.
Bah!
Oh, will you grab that?
Tybalt here?
Aha!
Good morning.
Leon, you're not gonna believe this, but I need your help.
What seems to be the problem?
You sounds weird.
Why do you sound weird?
Are you happy?
Of course not.
Oh, okay, do you think you could watch my house
- for the day?
- Why?
Rae is hosting a costume party.
There are multiple strangers with foam weaponry tramping around my living room.
Fireball, fireball, fireball, fireball!
They're chanting.
Mm.
Here, that still needs to be canvassed.
So I'm going to have you do this.
And Jim made copies of all the names, and then we'll just...
Laura?
Casey warned us.
Said she poached you from the bowels of corporate corruption?
Yeah, cut the golden parachute right off my back.
Well, come on.
I'll show you around.
No, that can't work.
Hey.
- Hi.
- Welcome.
She's been working the phones since 6:00.
It's unclear whether she eats or sleeps or just absorbs energy from the lies of elected officials.
I'm Todd, by the way.
Everyone calls me Harvard.
- You call yourself Harvard.
- All right, Katrina.
All right, Laura, field team.
Field team, Laura.
- Hey.
- Hi.
So how much did Casey tell you?
Not much, but I'm a quick study.
Cool, we're canvassing on West Adams.
There's a big community meeting tonight.
Signatures?
- What?
- Nothing.
Let's do it.
I've given up beer and liquor and caffeine for this baby.
I'm not giving up Equinox.
You really want to die on this sword?
This is where you're gonna take a stand?
- Alyssa, I think we...
- What stand?
Exercise is a basic human right.
He's not taking any of this seriously.
It's like I'm just this overactive, hormonal baby capsule that hasn't had sex in 12 days.
Maybe if I got to work out, I'd feel better about myself.
- Oh.
- And then, by extension, be more likely to have sex with you.
Fine, go to fucking Equinox.
What was that howling?
Are you fucking a barista named Theo?
His name is Theo?
Mm-hmm, and his girlfriend is not happy about it.
Girlfriend?
Ah, shit.
She seemed like a real nut case.
I thought I was gonna have to take my rings off and thrown down, but she took off before shit got real.
Uh, have you ever actually been in a real fistfight?
Multiple, I am 25% white trash on my father's side.
Jesus, Leia.
Hey, is everything okay?
I heard some screaming in here.
Oh, yeah, Val just has a lady stalker.
Yeah, apparently I'm fucking her boyfriend.
Whoa, clearly we have some catching up to do.
Do you want to get a drink later?
Hell yeah, I do.
- Great.
- I'm done at 5:30, okay?
- Okay.
- I love those boots.
Thank you.
She loves the boots.
You're doing a noble thing.
Your pen is mighty, sir.
We'll see you at 7:00.
- Yeah, 0%.
- 0%?
40%....35%?
That guy would've signed up for ballet class if it got us off his stoop.
There's no way he shows.
Erin Brockovich over here.
You can't force people to care.
About the environment?
No, most things.
Definitely not the environment.
I'm killing your philanthropy buzz,
- aren't I?
- Oh, come on, we're on a signature beat.
My buzz is real weak.
Well, look at it like this...
it's something
- for your college apps.
- If I even want to go to college.
Ooh, rebel, rebel.
Yep, I've even got a bad tattoo.
I love a bad tattoo.
All right 2267 is next.
How many more of these do we have?
81.
Sigh, heavy sigh.
Saya, call Nat about L'Oreal.
She's contracted with them before.
She can get you the numbers.
Oh, and Beckett, I need to see the Chance deal before it's signed off.
Oh, oh, my God, perfect.
Everyone, meet Alex Cole, new CTO.
- Hello.
- Let's give him a warm welcome.
Thank you, thank you, glad to be a part of the team.
Well, you have big shoes to fill, but I have faith.
Our last IT guy, Erik, was like family to us.
It's been hard.
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.
Did he die?
He went to Google.
- Ah.
- He's doing really great.
He's leading a team of 12, and he's really, really happy and fulfilled.
Aww.
- Cool.
- And he sent cookies.
- Oh, he is so sweet.
- Erik.
There's a gluten-free, dairy-free one for you.
Erik wasn't sure if you had any dietary restrictions.
Wow, how considerate.
Anyway, um, if you don't mind hitting the ground running,
Saya, you're having issues with your computer, yeah?
It's got that spin-y wheel of death, and I can't get online.
Right, this is probably a minimum speed issue, and I will go take a look.
Okay, let's try something else.
Oh, wow, that's pretty.
Is that Hawaii?
Yeah, Oahu.
"The Gathering Place," that's what Oahu means in Hawaiian.
I know.
Both my parents were born there.
So what do you think's wrong?
Um, still in the diagnostic phase.
Erik maintained a minimum upload speed of 248 megs per second on our servers, so I know it's not that.
Oh, wait, I have an idea.
Wait, don't...
Ugh, yeah, that takes 20 minutes to reload.
A bad idea.
Hmm.
I need to get that.
Can you do this from your desk?
Oh, yeah, um, yeah, I need to get a part anyway...
A part?
Getting a real Buffalo Bill vibe here.
Fuck, is it hot.
Here.
Thank you.
- I want coffee.
- Me too.
What's nearby?
My place.
Bad teacher.
What about the other houses?
I do like coffee.
How was that for timing?
- Honestly, it's inspiring.
- Totally.
To just pick up and start fresh like that?
We'll probably work for him someday.
- As soon as he asks, I'm there.
- To Erik.
The fucking best of us.
Sorry, sorry, hold on.
- Hello?
- Leon, what's happening?
Are those wizards behaving?
I'm, uh, keeping them in line.
You're a lifesaver, you know that?
You're a true friend.
- Any time.
- Leon!
Cunning Breezedancer up in yo' shit!
Equipped and breathing fire.
What is that?
Gotta run.
- Hi.
- Hey.
I'm Judy.
Sorry we didn't get to meet this morning.
Alex.
Can you join me in my office for a minute?
We are a relatively new company.
And we're still figuring things out.
For instance, I'm the COO, but for some reason, now I have to deal with HR complaints.
- I'm sorry?
- It's fine.
It's your first day... a little culture shock it normal.
Digital branding, not ISIS.
Hm.
Did you "huff away angrily"
when a coworker questioned your competence?
No.
I stepped away to do some troubleshooting.
Is this about that Oahu thing?
'Cause I was just trying to be nice.
Also, is it offensive to not know where someone's parents are from?
Is that, like, a micro-aggression?
'Cause I certainly didn't mean it that way.
She didn't mention the Oahu thing.
Please just try to be patient and positive, okay?
I hear your note.
And I note it.
Thank you.
And hey, don't drive yourself crazy.
No one expects you to replace Erik on day one.
Okay?
Thank you.
Oh, God, no, I really should have called you.
If I had known what I was missing...
I mean, look at you.
You feel so...
loose and just good.
Well, these are the perks of an identity crisis.
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.
I want an identity crisis.
Have you tried killing your father and then finding out that your father's not your real father?
No, no, but I did almost cut my bangs.
- What?
- I know!
Okay, you're gonna wanna sleep on that.
Um, are we do for another bottle?
I-I would.
Just I'm sort of training for a marathon.
- You're sort of training?
- God.
That was so obnoxious.
I'm definitely training for a marathon.
Penance for my privilege.
Uh, okay, that's fine.
I'll just...
Keep my dignity and continue drinking in my bathtub.
- Good for you.
- Oh, my God.
You're so old.
From afar, I was like, okay, she's cute.
But up close?
You don't have crow's feet.
You have crow's face.
- Who is this?
- I, um...
I think this is the girlfriend.
Yeah, I'm the girlfriend, bitch.
- Whoa, okay.
- No one's talking to you.
What happened to girl code?
Girl code?
Okay.
He didn't tell me he had a girlfriend, so.
- I think that's on him, right?
- That's totally on him.
Yeah, I guess it explains why we fucked in the car.
- Fucking look at me!
- Stop yelling.
Okay, go yell at your boyfriend, not me.
I don't know you.
We don't know each other.
Also, girl code?
Really?
Did you see who we elected as president?
The code is cracked.
Enigma has fallen.
You have no clue what I'm talking about, do you?
Wow.
Um...
Hi, yes, no, we'll definitely need another bottle, please.
Look at you.
Not much of a turnout.
We did what we could.
But hey, you should come by later.
I'll make espresso.
Well, this is an unmitigated fucking disaster.
- It was rough out there.
- I mean, six people?
I thought we were making inroads.
It's summer.
A lot of people are out of town.
God, José Malick and Peg Danow didn't even sign?
Did they say why?
I don't think so.
I can't remember.
Can you?
No, no.
It's just too many people to keep straight.
Todd, let's talk.
- Boo!
Mm-mm.
- What?
- Thumbs down!
- No, no, no, no!
- Thumbs way up!
- No.
Men should not wax down there.
Are you kidding?
- Uh, no.
- There's just too many flaps.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you fucking Aquaman?
- Flaps?
- Not flaps.
Folds.
I feel like I'm looking at a naked old fisherman
- with a little beanie.
- Oh, my God!
Oh, the image!
Oh, I can't unsee it.
Oh, my God.
Did I tell you I fucking miss you?
- Aww.
- I'm saying fucking so much.
I think I am officially drunk.
I do, I fucking miss you.
- I fucking miss you too.
- You know what we need to do?
- What?
- Is another dinner party.
- A game night, something.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes?
- Anything.
Okay, great, we will...
I'll replace Jack.
Oh, come on.
Are you kidding?
I'd be fine.
I'm not worried about you.
- You're not worried about me?
- Oh.
I find that kinda hard to believe.
Okay...
- What.
- Mm.
- What?
- Sorry, I'm trying to decide how discerning I should be about this, but apparently just not at all.
Jack is a sex addict.
And he is in recovery, or on the wagon, or whatever.
- But that's the fact.
- Whoa.
That's why I tried to warn you off of him in the first place.
No, I get it.
I...
Get it, yeah.
- Thank you.
- Fuck it.
- I mean, you're an adult.
- Mm-hmm.
- He's an adult.
- I am an adult.
You're an adult, and you're really good at gaming.
- I am.
So game night.
- Game night.
- We shall play.
- Yes!
I want to play this game night.
I want to order French fries.
Hey, are you okay?
I just got fired.
For missing a few houses?
For fucking you.
Do you think I need protection?
- Sorry.
- We're adults.
If you're gonna fire him, then fire me too.
Todd was your direct supervisor.
He removed you from your post and took advantage of you.
Oh, my God, I feel like I'm in a bad Lifetime rape movie.
He did not take advantage of me.
I wanted something, and he gave it to me.
An older guy, an adult, in a position of power.
I mean, that's predatory.
- If you can't see that...
- Whatever.
Yeah, I guess I'll just find somewhere else to do free work.
Hey, sorry.
Kinda turned into a bender.
It's fine.
Gonna go eat this pizza and think about obsolescence.
- That bad, huh?
- You know, I can't even fix a VPN.
It's fucking embarrassing.
- Who's your provider?
- Nord.
- Open or PPTP?
- PPTP.
Oh, there's your problem.
PPTP sucks.
Download Viscosity and go Open.
Rain's an IT wizard.
Like, literally.
Doomslayer too.
- Where do you work?
- Enframe.
Oh, snap.
You replaced Erik Tripplethorpe?
Fucking Google, man.
You gotta download his book, man.
- "Insight" is amazing.
- Of course he's got a book.
- Series of e-readers...
- Shhh.
_
- You think this will do it?
- I think it will, yes.
I've got, like, 13 contracts that need entering.
- Big contracts.
- I know that, I understand.
And I'm doing everything I can to get you there.
It's just, it's taking an awfully long time.
Okay, Saya, that's, unfortunately, not something I can control.
The bar has literally stopped moving.
- It's frozen.
- God damn it.
God fucking damn it.
How did you even get this job?
Are you someone's retarded cousin?
Oh, I just said the R-word.
Maybe I should just call Erik.
Fine!
Call him.
Call him.
Call Erik.
See if I fucking care.
I'm just the IT guy, right?
It's not like I have feelings.
Or pride or anything resembling human emotion.
God!
It's working now.
See?
I fixed it.
I like the...
I like the stubble beard thing.
- Oh, yeah, thanks.
- Cool.
You know, I wanted to reach out to you too, actually.
- To apologize.
- Oh, don't worry about it.
No, no, the birthday party was... that was...
- Oh.
- And your dad.
- I-I should apologize.
- No, really, it's...
I...
- I should be apologizing to you.
- For what?
Well, I didn't know what you were going through.
And I guess I just thought...
I don't know what I thought.
About what?
Well, your... sex addition.
Well, that... is not what I expected.
And I don't really like being defined by that label, but okay.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I just...
Are you not an addict?
There are times in my life when sex plays a bigger role than it probably should, and when that happens,
I scale back or abstain.
That's...
That's all.
Are you abstaining now?
- I am.
- Mm.
For how long?
Since you.
- Should we order?
- Uh-huh.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How 'bout that espresso?
Hey.
So you had lunch with Jack.
Yeah.
And you told him what I told you?
I guess I did.
He's my friend, Val.
He's pissed.
What the fuck?
I just got...
I'm so sorry.
I just...
I-I didn't think it was that big a deal, and then...
It just slipped out.
How does something like that just slip out?
It just did.
Just...
I, um... we were having lunch.
It was really awkward.
Um...
You know what?
It's fine.
It was my fault.
Hey, can we just shift and...
No.
Don't move.
Don't move.
- What the fuck?
- I don't like it like that.
Well, you didn't seem to mind before.
Well, now I do.
IT guy, right?
It's not like I have feelings.
Or pride, or anything resembling a human emotion!
God!
God!
That's excessive.
And well edited.
- You are not good at this job.
- I'm really not.
What are you doing here?
I have friends who use Snooger.
It's a great app.
Nobody leaves that to work IT.
Look, I'm 36 years old.
I'm out of money.
I'm keeping a horrible secret from my sister.
I'm living alone.
Actually, that's not true.
I have a cosplaying roommate who's been here for two weeks and already has more friends than me.
You know, it's funny.
When things are going well, you never think about it.
It's just normal.
But when things are bad, it's, like, every minute you spend thinking about how things used to be, and how you wish you'd appreciated it more.
I'm sorry.
That was sentimental and embarrassing.
It's okay.
I totally get it.
Nobody's perfect.
Except, apparently, for Erik.
Oh, I couldn't stand Erik.
He signed his emails, "Have a blessed day."
No.
Gross.
And I can't prove it, though, I firmly believe he was hosting gigabytes... gigabytes of anime porn torrents on our server.
You're blowing my mind right now.
Look, I can't go through the process of hiring another IT guy.
Interviewing those freaks was insufferable.
So.
Please.
Take a class or something and learn how to do this job.
And no more temper tantrums at work.
I have a nine-year-old at home.
I get enough of that shit already.
Understood.
Oh.
Have a blessed day.
Get out.

Hey, finally.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.

- Turn those over.
- I see your fox.
- And I raise you a lord...
- No, you're not.
You don't know what you're doing yet.
- So just wait.
- All right.
Previously, on "Casual"...
- Got an interview.
- Ooh.
Some new company in digital branding.
And, as Chief Technology Officer, I would, what?
- Head up the development team?
- The CTO is more of, um,
- an IT professional.
- Yeah.
You want me to be the guy who tells you how to restart your computer?
Hey, there.
Got a minute to stick it to the oligarchy?
You don't think maybe the people backing this initiative have a less than philanthropic agenda?
The Clean Renewables Institute?
It's a group of rich old men who want to sell natural gas.
I'm always looking for interns.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Jack Briggs.
He can sustain a relationship about as long as he could probably hold a boom box over his head.
I just don't wanna see you get hurt.
- Do you find me attractive?
- I do.
Do you think you can have sex with someone you find attractive, no strings attached?

All right.
Did you know you have three cartons of eggs, and the oldest carton is, like, four months old, and there's only one egg in it?
Eggs don't spoil.
So do I ask why you're in costume, or do you just tell me?
Yeah, it's my alter ego, Tybalt, a medieval

No.
I'm so fucking nervous.
I haven't been a wage slave since my 20s.
Do you think they'll haze me?
No, I'm sure they'll just stick to pre-formed social groups and subtly isolate you.
Thank you, that's helpful.

Ah, "Magic:

Yeah, cut the golden parachute right off my back.

You have no clue what I'm talking about, do you?
[Jennifer laughs] [laughter]
Wow.
Um...
Hi, yes, no, we'll definitely need another bottle, please.
- Look at you.
- [laughing]
Not much of a turnout.
We did what we could.
But hey, you should come by later.
I'll make espresso.
Well, this is an unmitigated fucking disaster.
- It was rough out there.
- I mean, six people?
I thought we were making inroads.
It's summer.
A lot of people are out of town.
God, José Malick and Peg Danow didn't even sign?
Did they say why?
I don't think so.
I can't remember.
Can you?
No, no.
It's just too many people to keep straight.
Todd, let's talk.
- Boo!
Mm-mm.
- What?
- Thumbs down!
- No, no, no, no!
- Thumbs way up!
- No.
Men should not wax down there.
Are you kidding?
- Uh, no.
- There's just too many flaps.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you fucking Aquaman?
- Flaps?
- Not flaps.
Folds.
I feel like I'm looking at a naked old fisherman
- with a little beanie.
- Oh, my God!
Oh, the image!
Oh, I can't unsee it.
Oh, my God.
Did I tell you I fucking miss you?
- Aww.
- I'm saying fucking so much.
I think I am officially drunk.
I do, I fucking miss you.
- I fucking miss you too.
- You know what we need to do?
- What?
- Is another dinner party.
- A game night, something.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes?
- Anything.
Okay, great, we will...
I'll replace Jack.
Oh, come on.
Are you kidding?
I'd be fine.
I'm not worried about you.
- You're not worried about me?
- Oh.
I find that kinda hard to believe.
Okay...
- What.
- Mm.
- What?
- Sorry, I'm trying to decide how discerning I should be about this, but apparently just not at all.
Jack is a sex addict.
And he is in recovery, or on the wagon, or whatever.
- But that's the fact.
- Whoa.
That's why I tried to warn you off of him in the first place.
No, I get it.
I...
Get it, yeah.
- Thank you.
- Fuck it.
- I mean, you're an adult.
- Mm-hmm.
- He's an adult.
- I am an adult.
You're an adult, and you're really good at gaming.
- I am.
So game night.
- Game night.
- We shall play.
- Yes!
I want to play this game night.
I want to order French fries.
[quirky music]
Hey, are you okay?
I just got fired.
For missing a few houses?
For fucking you.
Do you think I need protection?
- Sorry.
- We're adults.
If you're gonna fire him, then fire me too.
Todd was your direct supervisor.
He removed you from your post and took advantage of you.
Oh, my God, I feel like I'm in a bad Lifetime rape movie.
He did not take advantage of me.
I wanted something, and he gave it to me.
An older guy, an adult, in a position of power.
I mean, that's predatory.
- If you can't see that...
- Whatever.
Yeah, I guess I'll just find somewhere else to do free work.
[laughter]
Hey, sorry.
Kinda turned into a bender.
It's fine.
Gonna go eat this pizza and think about obsolescence.
- That bad, huh?
- You know, I can't even fix a VPN.
It's fucking embarrassing.
- Who's your provider?
- Nord.

- PPTP.
Oh, there's your problem.
PPTP sucks.

Spirits, if you be there, make yourselves known unto us.
We particularly hope to make contact with Elizabeth Sutton.
Are you there, Elizabeth?
She was known as Beth.
Beth Sutton, are you there?
There is one here your husband John yearns to speak with you.
Please come speak with us if you...
SHE GASPS
I felt a touch upon me.
Anyone else feel that?
I saw a face in the dark for a moment.
A kind face.
The kind face of a beautiful young woman.
Was your wife beautiful?
She was, yes.
With black hair?
A beautiful young woman with black hair?
Brown.
Dark.
Dark brown.
Yes.
It's her I see.
I feel she's here with us in the room now.
Please, Beth, if it is you, make yourself known.
Is that you, Beth?
Ow!
You just kicked me!
What?
Under the table.
No, no, no.
It must have been the spirit of Beth.
Perhaps she doesn't like you interrupting.
Was that you, Beth?
Did you kick one of us under the table?
Make yourself known.
Is it her?
'Tis I, John.
I miss you so.
I miss you so.
Is she happy?
Is she in pain?
I feel no pain, but the pain of missing you.
Tell her I didn't mean to kill her.
I live with that every day.
This is ridiculous!
Come on.
We should go.
This woman can't talk to dead people any more than I can make decent meringues.
Come on.
Sorry about her.
I know it's probably bogus, but...
Probably?
Part of me enjoys it.
I like believing I might be able to talk to Beth again.
John, perhaps it's time you moved your feelings on from Beth.
It has been four years.
I know, but I don't want to.
Don't you have feelings for Nicola, who works in the apothecary with her father?
My main feeling about her is that her father rips me off.
Well, you often mention Miss Bell...
after her father's ripped you off.
In fact, last week in the public house, you said you bet she had a muff like a silk purse.
Come on, you shouldn't visit that pub.
It's full of unsavoury people who are not appropriate company.
Come.
Dear William.
Miss Mina.
I have you brought you some flowers and a box of cream buttons.
Thank you.
I sincerely hope that your stone is now smashed and that your gentleman's part is not damaged.
I have been so worried about you.
Perhaps you will soon be up and we can visit a funfair again, like we did when we were young and in love.
Mina, it is very kind of you to visit and bring me cream buttons, but I think you should know that although I am pleased to see you, it has been 20 years since we last knew each other
and my feelings for your do not go beyond...friendship.
Don't you respect me?
Of course I do!
Friendship and respect!
Isn't that a wonderful place from which to build a marriage?
What happened?
The bishop was delivering a sermon on the importance of abstinence when he collapsed with abdominal pain.
Does this hurt?
HE MOANS
Your Grace, this is appendicitis.
I must operate at once.
It is simply wind!
I will not be touched by surgeons!
Why not?
Five of my family have died under the knife!
None of them had surgery by me.
You know as well as I that most patients who have an appendicectomy do not survive it.
Your Grace, you're right.
The surgery is in its infancy and it's dangerous.
For most surgeons.
But with me, it's 50/50.
But everybody who leaves an inflamed appendix dies when it bursts inside them.
I will no allow it.
It is farts!
Your Grace, I understand your fears of surgery, but I can use drugs...
No drugs!
I will not allow them near my lips!
Drugs are Satan's decoy!
The bishop must have this surgery or he will die.
Don't tell me, tell him!
If he dies, he'll stop paying for the nurses at this hospital.
You're paid.
I always forget that.
And the hospital will close.
Well, you heard the man, the bishop's an idiot!
Well, you'll think of something.
You're London's finest surgeon, are you not?
How long have you been treating Brewer with your moral therapies?
Six months.
And in that time have you noticed any discernible improvement in his condition?
Hidden in the tone of my question is a clue as to my view on the subject.
I have great hope for him yet.
Last week, he knitted me a bobble hat.
In July?
He's looking ahead.
And yesterday, I hear you again insisted on taking some of the patients painting in the park.
I think it's important that they have the opportunity to express themselves outside the confines of their cell.
One of them expressed himself by defecating in front of the Salvation Army band.
Not all these therapeutic approaches work, I grant you, Doctor, but I passionately believe that if we can guide our lunatics towards useful labour and crafts...
But you've been treating Brewer that way for six months and he still head-butts the wall and shits on the lawn!
You have made no diagnosis!
You have no cure!
Dr Hendrick is threatening to turn this wing of the hospital over to some new...function and, meanwhile, I hear you're planning a nutter's production of the Knights Of The Round Table!
I take it you don't want a ticket, then?
Hendrick wants to turn the asylum into a wine-cellar and cheese store for the Royal Society of Physicians.
That's quite a good idea.
I need some successes, or the whole asylum is in threat!
Why don't you fake some results?
That's an outrageous idea!
Is it?
You must have done it.
No, but only because it's hard to fake results in surgery.
If I claim to have successfully removed someone's leg, it is easily disproved if the leg is still attached to the body.
But he's looking for someone who's mad and seen to be cured by one of his treatments.
I'm not doing this!
It's a disgraceful suggestion!
Go on.
Hmm.
Well, it's hard to fake a leg break or a tumour, but relatively easy to fake madness, is it not?
Yes, I mean, you just need someone to go like this... ..and then you treat them with your... whatever it is you do, and then they stop going... ..and then you'd have cured them.
What you're suggesting is completely wrong.
W-Who would I even get to pretend to be mad for a day or so?
Hello, doctors.
Got any new disgusting medical stories I'd enjoy?
Any tumours that could talk?
Mr Hubble, do you know anyone who could convincingly pretend to be mad for a couple of days?
And I'd pay them £2.
Do you know the Bishop of Lambeth?
The Bish?
The big Bish-Bash?
He owns all the mop-houses in Covent Garden.
He's a good chap, ain't he?
By good chap you mean a mad, fat pig, then yes.
He needs an appendicectomy, and I've got to do it without him noticing.
Precisely.
When he's next in one of his mop-houses, will you help me drug him?
You're more and more persuaded to use drugs?
When the circumstances are right.
For instance, you've got a mad, rich bishop who thinks he can fart out his appendix.
Good day, Fitz.
This is a new patient I'd like to have admitted, please.
What's his madness?
What a stupid question, you pudding-faced turd!
I hate you!
He has a violent, uncontrollable rage.
Name?
Isn't it obvious what my name is, you hairy idiot?
Look at your stupid hat!
Yes, it's Paul.
Paul Hubble.
There you are, Mr Clarkson.
That's for your glandular swelling.
Right.
And that's for your face sore.
Thank you.
Mr Sutton!
What can we furnish you with today?
How was Father's last poultice?
Terrific.
I distilled the morphine out of it, drank it and now I can't remember the last three days.
It was intended to be rubbed on inflammations, not distilled and drunk.
Was it?
Oh.
Silly me.
Any interesting new herbs, tinctures or boogies in?
Father's made a new nostrum to cure impure blood.
Got all sorts of gubbins in it, he said.
Um, well, let me have a little of that, then, please.
And since I'm here, I could use another three bottle of laudanum.
Large.
Very well.
And here's the new nostrum.
Mr Bell's Blood Mixture.
Permanent cure for all blood diseases, plus increased vitality.
You tried it yourself?
You know I'm not permitted to try the store's products!
Would you like to try some, with me, this afternoon?
Perhaps after a walk in the park?
Father will say no.
So let's not ask him.
What do you want now, you massive bawbag?
Tuck your shirt in!
HE MOUTHS
As you can see, he has uncontrollable abstract rages that make him a danger to himself and others.
I suspect it was brought on by the solitary vice.
I'm confident that if I can spend a little time with him doing calming activities, I may be able to divert this irrational anger towards something more purposeful.
Wouldn't his anger be just as easily diverted by a cold bath?
Or bleed him?
I don't want to bleed him.
Bleeding always calms 'em.
Yes.
We could bleed him.
Well done, Fitz.
I think this man can be encouraged back to gentleness.
Let me prove to you that my methods here can bring results.
Very well.
Till Friday, at three o'clock.
If he's still shouty and silly, then we'll progress to the cold bath and the rotating chair.
By all means.
Darling, I need to talk to you about this book.
Which book?
Leave us for a moment, please.
The Lustful Turk.
It's about an Englishwoman and what she gets up to on her holiday.
I have never read such a degrading torrent of uncontrolled passions.
Oh.
Page after page after page after page after... page of it!
One of the maids caught me reading it.
I was so ashamed to think that my wife might be thought to be reading such material, I had to pretend it was my book!
Does Polly now think you have a taste for stories about Turkish men?
Turkish men performing...
unspeakable acts in a tent!
You didn't like that bit?
Despite my endless entreaties, you continue to embarrass me with your behaviour.
Reading such material in public!
Persisting in attending anatomy classes.
Yes.
I intend to become a doctor.
But that is never going to happen, so give it up!
You loved me for my ambition once.
That wasn't medical ambition then, was it?
It was just... general enthusiasm for different things.
Oh...
All I need you to do is run this household properly.
That's all.
Like a million other normal women.
Yes, but I don't want to do that!
I hate this house!
And I hate being stuck in here with all these things!
Don't turn this into a Greek wedding!
I will!
Ah!
Not Mother's Royal Wedding milk jug!
Miss Bell.
You look...beautiful.
Thank you, Mr Sutton.
John, please.
What would you care to do today?
Would you like to visit the boating lake?
Or perhaps play a game of croquet in the park?
Yes, we could, or there's some bare-knuckle boxing round the corner.
Get off the floor!
Hit him!
Yes!
Yes!
Stand up!
Get up!
When my father died, I sold his shop in Banstead and used the money to train as a dentist, and have a year in Italy.
Oh, I'd love to go to Italy sometime!
I'll never take you.
It's an appalling place.
Is it?
Where were you?
Florence, which is a shithole.
Dark, nasty, smelly, corrupt...
Not bad food, though.
What's this, then, Senor?
This is spaghetti.
It's made of wheat.
I've put lard with it and... ..cheese on top.
It's yellow.
I serve it with red wine, gin, beer, hashish, and a tomato salad.
Fancy.
Buon appetito.
What you looking at, mister?
I'm looking at you, miss.
Oh!
Let's have some coca leaves and ether!
I think I might be in real trouble with you, Miss Bell.
Will your father not be missing you today?
We could send him a message, saying I'm staying with Mother in Derbyshire.
Will you take me to Italy one day?
I would love to do that.
And we could break into the Coliseum at night and have sex on the sand in the arena.
Well, hurry up and do it soon.
I'm going to end up having to marry that Lord Thornycroft.
Sorry?
She's kind, thoughtful, amusing...
unbelievable in the sack.
I may be in love...
for the first time in years.
That's wonderful, John.
If you do have real feelings for her, might I suggest you resist writing her one of your poems?
She's got such passion.
We spent the whole day in bed.
I can barely walk!
I'm going to stop visiting prostitutes now I've met her.
High praise indeed.
Now it's only you who hasn't found a woman.
Can we meet her?
Of course not.
I really like her.
The only problem is, her father wants her to marry Lord Thornycroft.
Who's Lord Thornycroft?
Some fat old lord.
Nicola has no feelings for him.
Now she's met me,
I'm sure she'll persuade her father to change his mind.
Won't she?
I'm sure she will.
No-one wants to be in an unhappy marriage, do they?
Does Nicola know about Beth?
Not yet.
Does she know about your prostitute habit?
I will tell her...
when the time's right.
About Beth, not the whores.
I did all I could for Beth.
We know.
She was terribly ill, John.
I gave her the overdose.
You were trying to cure her.
I'm not going to have a second woman I love taken away from me.
Nicola loves me, and I love her.
We'll run away to...
Wales together if we have to.
I'm sure it won't come to that!
Mother!
I came as quickly as I could.
How is he?
He has recovered.
What happened?
Dr Alexander said he went suddenly berserk.
He attacked one of the nurses, had her hanging out of the window, then he tried to flush himself down his own toilet.
He'd never been violent like this before!
Can we see him?
Yes.
He's sleeping now.
He seems so peaceful.
But this is a worrying development, is it not, if he's moving from lunacy to dementia?
Yes.
They tell me our payments are in arrears?
Yes, I'm afraid so.
It's been costing tens and tens of pounds to keep him here.
We've run out of money.
Well, then, we must sell some land.
The lower fields, down to the river, and both sides of the valley.
My dear, we haven't told this, but that land was all sold long ago.
When your father was first ill, he was tricked by a man posing as a Tory MP into making an investment into a banana plantation that turned out not to exist.
In fact, it transpires San Trinibados isn't even a real Caribbean island!
No!
Also, he spent... ..£1,000 on a mid-period Rubens painting that turned out to be fake.
Mother!
Why had you not told me this?
We were too ashamed.
He wasn't himself, and I never understood paintings... or bananas.
But we can't have Father in a public asylum.
He would not survive it.
Don't worry for now.
Miss Mina has agreed to clear our current debts.
Miss Mina, you are here.
Dear William.
Your mother told me of your current situation.
I came at once.
I have been delighted to pay the monies that are in arrears, and for next month's care.
Oh, the dear woman!
That is most kind of you.
If you are visited with your father long enough, perhaps you'd care to join me for tea?
Ooh, we'd be delighted to!
I was talking only to William.
Oh.
I'd love to but, sadly, I must return urgently to London, where a patient of mine is due for assessment.
Some other time, then.
There's an exhibition of medieval encaustic ceramics in Cirencester that I'd love to visit.
I'd love to do that, too.
Oh!
Sorry to disturb!
Ah, you must be Miss Bell.
Afternoon.
Lovely to meet you.
Heard so much.
I've just been told that the Bishop of Lambeth is at your brothel.
Not YOUR brothel - the one you visit.
You don't visit it, I do.
I don't visit it.
But...
I've heard of this one in Covent Garden.
The bishop is there now, so I thought if we went together, we could slip some drugs into his wine and then I could perform the operation he doesn't want.
You want to drug a bishop against his will?
I'd use an opiate.
He won't taste it in wine, and it'll knock him out nice and proper.
Nicola works at the apothecary.
Of course.
What a lovely couple you make.
In fact, I'll need a nurse, Miss Bell, if you fancy coming along?
Yes!
Pop your clothes on!
I'm here to see the Bishop of Lambeth on urgent medical business.
Where is he?
Upstairs.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
A rising trot!
A rising trot!
The very picture of ecclesiastic dignity and grace.
Ride!
Ooh.
He is big and fat, isn't he?
Fly!
Fly!
Good.
Now, Miss Bell, would you go and give the bishop his wine, on the house?
He'll assume you work here.
Do I look like a prostitute to you?
Yes.
So, go.
Oh!
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, thank you, my angel!
We're going to need some water and several towels, please.
Hello, John, love.
Nice to see you.
You in for a session?
No.
I've never been here before.
You must be mistaking me for someone else.
Oh, yes, of course.
Someone else who looks like you - a cousin perhaps.
Yes, my naughty cousin.
Do you know these women?
No.
Which ones?
I'll keep him asleep with chloroform.
Going to make an incision now.
I need you to soak up the blood as best possible.
Oh!
Ohhhh...
Oh, you bloody fat man!
Ugh!
Pull his fat back.
That's it.
That's it, go on.
Don't be shy.
Get your hands in.
Pull it back.
He's asleep.
You don't need to rush.
Oh, hello, John, love.
Are you in for one of your all-night foursomes later?
I'm sure Gwen and the twins will be in this afternoon.
It's true that I have visited this place occasionally, but I'm giving up all these prostitutes now that I've met you.
It's true, he is.
He can't stop talking about you.
Ugh, that is his small intestine.
I'm going to feel round the bowel.
The appendix!
Ah!
Silks, please.
Thank you, Miss Bell.
We tie around his nose... and we tie around his toes.
Ready for the snipping.
Thank you.
There!
Ahhh...
There's the dirty devil!
Time to sew up the beast.
Once you've finished that, I've got some socks that need darning.
No!
No!
No!
It's for your own good!
Get off!
You don't understand!
The doctor asked me to be mad!
This is all an act!
He's more insane than I originally realised.
Put him in the cold water!
Sorry I'm late!
He's the person responsible!
He's paying me to pretend to be mad!
Tell him!
He is completely mad.
He's lying!
No, I'm not.
Put him in the cold water.
No!
Finally, some sense!
No!
Shall I get the rotating chair, sir?
Oh, yes.
Yes, please.
William, I'm heading back across town if you'd like to share a carriage?
How are you?
Strange day.
My mother is trying to make me marry Miss Mina Hickley.
Miss Hickley?
Do you want to marry her?
No.
Oh, my dear William.
Poor you.
Let me kiss you, too.
We mustn't.
Oh, William!
Oh!
My dear Caroline!
Kiss it more!
We must control our passions or we will all be ruined.
Oh, there you are.
I'm nearly finished.
Come and help me attach the foresail.
I'm going to bed.
You're closing early.
John, love.
I wasn't expecting you this evening.
You're all dressed up.
I came to see if you fancied a night in.
Get your bonnet off!
John, love, sorry.
I can't tonight.
I was going to come and tell you tomorrow,
I'm marrying Lord Thornycroft.
No.
He proposed this morning at breakfast, in front of Father, and I said yes.
Don't marry someone who doesn't love you.
No, it's the other way around.
He does love me.
I don't love him.
Don't marry someone you don't love.
I'm writing you a poem.
Bet you this lord won't write you a poem.
No, thankfully!
So what's he offer you, then?
What's he got?
Two houses?
Four.
Four.
Four.
Where, London?
Hampshire?
Yorkshire.
And a villa overlooking Frattamaggiore, just outside Naples!
Italy's awful.
I told you.
And I'll never have to work again.
I can move out the apothecary.
You like your job, and you're good at it.
And running those big houses, with all that staff, that can be...testing.
I know.
These past few days have been such fun, but this is the right decision for me.
Take care, John Sutton.
Previousy on Switched at Birth...
Our girls are home!
I'm gonna take a couple of pre-med classes
My plan is to find a place to live.
What about the apartment above the Cracked Mug, isn't that empty?
- You're mad.
- _
Nothing is gonna change between us.
You're... breaking up with me.
- My daughters are back
- I knew it.
Please don't make this harder than it has to be.
I'm just making a buck off girls' stupidity.
You are an arrogant, sexist, bottom-feeding thief.
- Rumor has it that you are the new RA.
- It's true.
Oh, hey, we're having a party tonight.
Come dressed as your favorite singer.
Young money, baby!
Oh, my God!
That's totally insulting, you know that, right?
You don't like Lil Wayne?
Whatever.
I'll see you later.
Good morning.
I had no idea that being "just friends"
was gonna be so uncomfortable.
Hey, I offered to take the floor, but you insisted that Lil Wayne was a gentleman.
Truer words have never been spoken.
What?
What's wrong?
A picture of us from the party last night.
Someone posted it on Chat Bandit.
Seriously?
Why?
To tell me what a racist ass I am,
- apparently.
- What?
Mine's blowing up, too.
This is the photo I posted on Instagram.
I dressed up as Lil Wayne.
You'd think I went as a KKK member.
"Just another brainless white girl, coasting on her white privilege."
What?
Oh my God...
Ouch.
People hate us.
My pitcher's injured, I need someone to replace him immediately.
What about Travis?
You have him back now.
Yeah, but he needs some serious conditioning.
He wasn't playing in China.
He was coaching.
Well, what's your Plan "B" then, John?
I found this kid pitching for Michigan.
He apparently has some family issues, needs to transfer closer to home.
And home is Kansas City?
- Yes.
- That's great.
I'll get right on it.
What's his name?
Chris Walker.
90-mile-an-hour fastball, killer slider, and check this out... he's batting .325.
I love it.
We will travel him down here.
No need to.
He's already here.
- Really?
- Talking to other schools.
We'll have him over for dinner.
Once he gets a peek at your Royals stuff, it'll knock his socks off.
- Hey.
- Well, hello.
I thought you and Daphne had moved out.
Yes, we did, but there's a significant lack of groceries at our pad.
You do know where to obtain groceries out there in the real world?
Hmm, yeah, but I wanted to see you guys!
Ohhh, there's some lasagna in the fridge.
Thank you!
I... will grab it for Daphne.
I'm having dinner with Travis tonight.
Dinners out, apartments... sounds like all you're missing is...
A job?
I will have one, very soon.
As a tattoo artist.
There is this studio in town, it's run by this amazing woman named Noelle.
She is truly an original artist.
She did a full triptych on Tove Lo's back, and it landed her the cover of Rolling Stone.
People come from all over just for her designs.
So you have an interview with her.
Not exactly, but, I did this for months in Beijing.
I've got a killer portfolio, and what I know is, in order to be doing cutting edge work, you've gotta be at a great studio.
So no worries.
I got this job in the bag.
- Sounds good.
- Thanks, 'rents!
Hey there, Bender.
Huh?
Bender.
Judd Nelson?
Breakfast Club.
God, you're young.
I knew the age thing was the reason you ended this.
I told you, my daughters are home,
I need to focus on family, that's all.
Okay... so if age isn't the hangup, let's talk numbers.
You don't have to say it out loud,
I'll just start counting, and you could blink when I get to the right number.
35.
36.
37.
38.
39?
40.
Oh, good for me.
You Regina and Luca?
Yeah.
Great.
The mom and the jarhead.
- Excuse me?
- What did you say?
Professor Evers put us together for the group challenge.
I assumed you guys already saw the list.
Of course.
I was just telling Luca, that I own a cafe in East Riverside, and we can use that for the project.
Fine.
I'll go let Evers know.
How did that happen?
Maybe the professor thinks we're a good fit.
I just...
I don't get it, when did dressing up like a hip hop artist become a racist thing?
Right?
And who made up that rule?
You can only dress like a celebrity you love if they're the same ethnicity?
And I love Lil Wayne!
I wasn't trying to make fun of him.
I have a Chinese lotus tattoo on my neck, but I'm not Chinese.
Is that appropriating Asian culture?
You know what?
It's Chat Bandit.
By lunch, everyone's gonna be talking about some football player who's taking steroids.
We just have to wait it out.
I just don't get how it blew up so fast.
There were a bunch of kids at the party, including a lot of black kids, and no one seemed to care last night.
Actually, Iris was pretty upset.
Right.
Do you think we should talk with her?
I'll do it.
This will all blow over.
It'll be fine.
Hey, are you Noelle?
Excuse me.
I'm booked up for the next two weeks.
Call back after hours, or go to my site, you can schedule online.
Actually, I'm an artist looking for a chair.
I've been working in Beijing for the last year.
I brought my book if you want to see my stuff.
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hm.
Look.
I don't hire people without references I trust, and... do you even have any ink?
I have... some.
Sorry.
Not hiring.
Hi.
Excuse me.
What time do you think we'll be out of here?
It takes how long it takes.
You made an appointment for two people, not half your sorority house.
Sorry.
When word got out, our ranks kind of swelled.
We just have a function later we have to get to.
So, make another appointment.
This isn't a drive-through.
We're taking our sorority photo this evening, and we all really want them in time for that.
Is there any way you can do us all?
- We'll pay extra.
- Let me help you out.
I can get them all stenciled while you do the inking.
- It'll take you half the time.
- I don't even know you.
Oh, trust me, I can ink a wicked fire dragon with a seven-color fade.
I promise you, I can lay up a stencil of three Greek letters.
Look, it's just a stencil.
If you don't like my work, you can always wash it off.
- Stencil paper is in the third drawer down.
- Yes!
One other thing...
don't ever distract me while I'm working with a customer again.
Got it?
Got it.
I'm so sorry.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Um, can I ask you a question?
Did you post that photo of me and Mingo on Chat Bandit?
No, but I'm not surprised someone did.
It was really offensive.
Iris, it was a costume party.
Everyone was dressed up.
Mingo was mocking black culture.
He was dressed like Lil Wayne.
That's not exactly black culture.
So, you're the expert on black culture?
Of course not.
I just don't get why you're acting like he wore blackface?
He may as well have.
He was running around with a grill, Daphne.
Because Lil Wayne wears a grill.
Yeah, and it's a complete racial stereotype, one that Mingo reinforced for the entire dorm when he put on baggy pants and threw up westside gang symbols.
Is this even about last night?
You've never liked Mingo.
I'm clearly not the only one upset that he turned "ghetto black person" into a costume for the dorm's entertainment.
I hate that we're fighting.
I know.
We need to catch up.
Are you free for lunch?
No, I'm meeting my friend Adina, and a few other people.
Nice.
Is she part of your sorority?
Black student union.
Oh.
I didn't know you hung out with them.
Well, a lot's happened in the last 10 months.
Like what?
I gotta run.
I'll see you later, okay?
- Bye.
- Bye.
You know, let me kick you down something for the effort.
Uh, I appreciate that, but honestly, what I'm really looking for is a job.
I told you, I'm not hiring.
But you could use the help.
I mean, think how much your business would grow.
I like my studio the way it is.
But clearly you have some experience.
There are other studios in town.
Yeah, places where I'll spend all day inking Popeyes or zodiac tramp stamps.
But your designs are incredible.
And I want to be working with the best.
Maybe I could use some help.
Thank you!
Oh, I will kill it for you, I promise.
No, no, no, that's not what I mean.
What I'm offering you is an apprentice job... phones, cleaning, helping with supplies.
That's it.
Or there's always the zodiac tramp stamps.
Hey!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I have a good reason for being late.
I got a job!
_
Come on, we can rally.
Uh, YJ's is open late, let's go?
It'll be just like our midnight noodle runs back in Beijing.
_
Uh, well...
I'll wait.
We can go later.
_
_
_
I'll talk to him.
_
_
Look, I'll make it up to you.
Okay?
I promise.
_
_
Thanks.
It's not exactly a tattoo artist job.
It's more like a tattoo apprentice.
_
It's a little harder than I was expecting to get a chair out here.
Apparently people want references in English.
_
_
Daphne.
Hey, Sharee!
How are you?
How is everything?
Bomb.
I got a job in the athletic department, and it looks like I'll make the Dean's list this quarter.
Awesome.
But how about you, world traveler?
How's being back from China?
It's okay.
I went to a party with my ex-boyfriend last night.
Oh, that.
Yeah, I saw.
You saw the picture?
I think everyone on campus did.
Were you offended?
Not really.
I get why people are upset, but I don't let stuff like that get to me.
I wish everyone felt that way.
Some kid acting like a fool is not worth my time.
I gotta do something.
I can't just sit around and watch people say these awful things about me and Mingo as if they know us.
Look, I'm not sweating it, but some people are.
Being a black kid at UMKC can be... complicated.
As a friend, I'm telling you... the best thing you can do is try to stay out of it.
Bottom of the ninth, one out.
Saberhagen throws a cutter, and the ball gets hit into the hole at third.
Routine ground ball, no problem.
But the ball takes a bad hop over the shortstop's glove.
- No!
- And in that moment,
I am thinking what every single person in that stadium is thinking,
"There goes our no-hitter."
So what happened?
So I dive to my left, stab the ball in the hop, sitting on my ass in the dirt, turn the double play, game over, we win.
- Wow.
- True story, I was there.
I don't think I bought myself a beer for the entire rest of the season.
That's unbelievable.
You know what?
I do believe I have that game ball in my office.
Signed by the entire '85 Royals team.
Let me see if I can find it.
Chris, thanks for sitting down with us.
I can tell that John's becoming a big fan.
He seems really cool.
I just...
I just want to make the right decision with this move, you know?
I'm really sorry to hear that your aunt is not doing well.
John tells me that she raised you?
Yeah.
Yeah, she did, me and my little brother both.
Well, I want you to know that you have my promise that I will do everything in my power to make sure you can be there for her.
Whatever you need.
I'm really glad to hear that.
Because if I'm gonna make this move to UMKC, you know, I'm gonna need some things.
The main thing being a car.
Uh, okay.
That's understandable, but you do know that it is not possible for us to buy you a car?
It is in clear violation of NCAA rules.
Really?
You know, because the school I visited yesterday is offering up a Mustang.
I just gotta be able to get back and forth, you know, on account of my auntie.
Well, we will absolutely take care of your transportation needs.
I will make sure that you have access to shuttles or volunteer drivers...
whatever you need.
Yeah, I don't think you get what I'm saying.
I want a car.
I put together some numbers for you guys to look at.
We have to raise the Cracked Mug's daily revenue by 10% to pass the project.
- This place does solid business.
- Mm-hmm.
Did you lose your vision in Afghanistan?
It's only 8:00 and this place is like a graveyard.
So we'll recruit fresh customers.
We could do a UMKC night, hand out door prizes, do reward cards.
We have to up profits by 10%.
Hosting a study session isn't gonna bring in that kind of cash flow.
I wish we were near a military base.
I downed five espressos a night when I was in active duty.
So do gamers.
That could work.
We could do a video game night.
Get some machines in here, charge a small fee for a tournament.
- I love that idea.
- I can get some people in the door, make sure we're drawing in the right kind of crowd.
Then I'll handle the special event permit.
Great.
Let's do it.
And these kids, they're on... what is it?
- Chat Bandit.
- Yes!
Okay, they're exactly what's wrong with this whole PC culture.
Let me tell you something.
The real world our there is a lot more offensive than some kid dressed up like... whoever that is.
Excuse me, you go here?
Sign our petition?
- _
- Greg Shimingo is an RA in Hanes Dorm.
Apparently, he's got a long history of bigotry.
What?
That's not true.
I lived there.
I know him.
Did you see what he wore the other night?
Yeah, and I don't see what the problem is.
It was a costume party.
Well, with or without your help, we're getting rid of this guy.
"I spent the last eight months in Asia and I can tell you from personal experience that the right to individual expression remains the most fundamental part of who we are as Americans."
Wow.
It's bold.
Last year during the whole Tank thing,
I was the angry mass' favorite topic of conversation on Chat Bandit.
All I wanted to do was get facial reconstructive surgery and change my name.
Are you sure that you wanna step into the spotlight?
Yeah, I have to.
I don't think that people understand what they're asking for.
If Mingo loses his RA job, we're basically giving permission to administration to tell us how to dress.
We're volunteering to lose our right to free speech.
Daphne Vasquez, future doctor, current journalist.
I like it.
I'm just glad the UMKC Sentinel agreed to let me write an op-ed.
The editor hinted that if it was good enough, he would lead with it.
Look at us!
Beijing sisters, we are back, and we are ready to take KC by storm.
Kathryn, I cannot lose this kid.
He is a sure-fire solution to my pitching problems.
Buying him a car?
I mean, really, John?
That was out of line.
Oh, welcome to the modern world.
Please.
Honestly, I do not understand why these kids aren't paid in the first place.
They play for four years, they make us millions of dollars, and most of them never ever get to the pros.
They get nothing.
They get an education, John.
Kathryn, please, I've heard that a million times.
Okay, I don't like it any more than you do, but those are the rules.
And unless you have a way around the National Collegiate Athletic Association, we are stuck here.
Do you remember...
Richie Sutter?
Pitcher for the Cards, yeah.
Richie's got a couple of car dealerships.
- I thought I'd give him a call.
- John!
He's a big UMKC fan.
He just wants to help.
Richie is willing to give Chris a loaner car.
No money changes hands, there is no paper trail.
When Chris is done with school, he gives the loaner car back.
Chris gets to see his sick aunt, we get our new star pitcher, and no one is the wiser.
- That's really clever.
- Yeah.
But it's still cheating.
We can't do it.
You heard that that kid said.
We wouldn't be the only ones doing this.
Are you seriously gonna roll out that argument with me?
That's what you said when we got into our tax trouble, and look where that got us.
Kathryn, I am on the verge here, okay?
I can feel it.
We're not gonna lie and cheat like those other people.
Tuesday, ah, yes.
Noelle can see you then.
All right, cool.
Bye.
Is Noelle around?
Uh, she'll be back later this afternoon.
Can I help you with anything?
Yeah, I was looking for a specific image, but I don't see anything like it in this book.
She can always draw something up for you.
- What were you thinking of?
- An owl.
Aww, I love that.
Well, you can always go traditional or maybe more cartoony.
It totally just depends on the vibe you're going for.
Here, check this out.
Now, it's not an owl, but it is a high-contrast black and gray technique.
An owl would look great done like this.
Wait, is this your book?
Uh, yeah.
I want you to do my tattoo.
You should really come back and discuss all of this with Noelle, really.
I've seen her work.
I like yours better.
Don't you want to do it?
Well, yeah, but...
Then?
Let's do this.
Okay, take a seat.
Straight back.
Thank you so much.
What is that?
Is there a problem?
Yeah.
It's not 1982.
I think when we said video games,
Aidan was probably thinking Xbox or PlayStation.
Oh, of course.
I knew I'd get screwed when Evers paired me with the old person.
Watch it.
You know what?
Aidan's right.
I messed up.
Let me call the vendor.
Maybe he can swap the machines out.
No!
No, keep the games.
We'll bring in some '80s music.
Do a throwback arcade night.
It'll be cool.
Are you willing to bet your grade on it?
'Cause I'm not.
Fine.
Let's do both.
It'll be sort of an old-school-meets-new-school vibe.
Whatever.
I'll call around for some game consoles and try to save our asses.
Don't listen to him.
It's gonna be fine.
Okay.
That's absurd.
The university has no right to tell us what to wear.
I mean, if we start by censoring students' wardrobe, what's next?
Burning books?
We may as well live in Soviet Russia.
So we're just supposed to let some racist idiot keep his job in the dorm with students of color because, what, he's got the right to free speech?
This is America.
We can't infringe upon someone's first amendment rights
- whenever our feelings are hurt.
- Exactly.
There are plenty of legal limits to free speech in the US.
You wanna know what's a crime?
Shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, making rude suggestions to women, and threatening someone using racial slurs.
No, I wasn't talking about sexual harassment or threats.
Wait, you're Daphne Vasquez?
Are you even Latina?
I'm Puerto Rican.
I grew up in East Riverside.
I know who you are now.
Your dad's that Royals player.
That white Royals player.
Uh, her skin color is totally irrelevant, okay?
We're talking about free speech, not racism.
- See, that's so easy for you to say.
- Don't be naive.
This is so
- clearly a racism issue.
- You think I don't understand discrimination?
- I don't know?
- Are you kidding me?
- Wait, wait, stop.
- You will never understand...
And who gave you permission to own the struggle anyway?
- That's right!
- You sound so racist.
How can you even say that?
Okay, okay, enough!
Everybody settle down.
As fascinating as all this is, we've still got Kant to wrestle with today.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I believe the phrase is "hiding like a coward."
Mingo.
Everywhere I went today, people were just looking at me like I was some kind of serial killer.
They can't stay mad forever.
It gets worse.
I have to meet with the RA board in an hour to fight for my job.
This whole thing is just a nightmare.
They can't fire you over this.
Sure they can.
According to Chat Bandit, I'm the worst RA alive.
If they fire you over a costume, the university is essentially declaring that they can censor us.
We have the right to offend people.
That's what makes us Americans.
If we let them tell us how to dress, what's next?
What books we can read?
What websites we can visit?
Hey.
Hey.
You can do this.
I know you can.
Just talk to them.
Yeah.
You're right.
I got this.
But just in case, though, do you think you could... you could text me some of that stuff you just said?
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.
What's all this?
Apparently it's what the kids do for fun these days.
You okay?
That seemed pretty intense over there.
- Did you read my article?
- Of course.
And I heard a lot of kids talk about it today.
You made quite an impact.
Yeah.
Mexican hot chocolate coming right up.
Talk to me.
I thought I could use the article to show everyone how crazy this whole thing is, but I feel like I just made things worse.
Well, Mingo made a pretty clueless decision to dress up like that.
You defended him.
You think his outfit was racist?
Of course.
How would you feel if someone showed up at a party wearing a sombrero and pushing a lawnmower and said they were Latino?
I'd be offended.
- See?
- But I'd still defend his right to wear whatever he wanted.
Just like I have the freedom to call him an ass.
Do you think that writing the op-ed was a mistake?
I may not agree with your point of view, but I raised you to fight for what you believe in.
And you're doing that.
Thanks.
Hi.
I got you your latte...
What the hell is this?
An owl?
I was just trying to make the customer happy.
She was looking for a very specific piece, and I happened to have something like it in my book, and I made the sale!
You can check the money in the register.
You showed a customer your book?
Um...
Because I had what she wanted.
I'm so sorry.
I promise it won't happen again.
I know it won't, because you're fired.
I think I really like it here at UMKC.
That's great.
Well, we really want to make this work.
Good.
So, let's get down to business.
Actually, there's not gonna be any business, or car, or anything like that.
I mean, I really don't know what other schools are offering you, but what I have beats the hell out of a car or a little bit of flash money.
You see, John Kennish is an incredible coach, and he cares about every one of his players.
And make no mistake about it, he is going to take this team to the regionals, and then to the College World Series.
Chris, if you decide to come here,
Coach Kennish is going to make sure that you get a long look from the pros.
And he can do that, because he was in the majors.
And one more thing.
I will make sure that you get a first-class education and graduate with a degree.
So think long and hard about this, because what I have to offer you is a future.
And compared to that, a car is chump change.
No offense, but that's easy for you to say sitting in that big house in Mission Hills.
But me?
I gotta get paid.
_
I got fired.
_
Can we just get out of here?
_
Why?
_
_
I cannot believe this.
This city is a jinx.
It's like there's a full-on conspiracy to keep us apart.
_
No.
No, you're right.
You can't do that.
Sometimes I wish we never came back home.
Back there it was just me and you and Daphne, and there were no parents, no old boyfriends, no bosses to get in the way.
Come on.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You don't have to play this dinosaur on my account.
Oh, I'm not.
I love these games.
Plus, I spent three years in Afghanistan.
Make-believe violence doesn't really interest me.
And I won't give that douche the satisfaction.
- Hey, Regina?
- Yes?
Hook me up with a latte?
What the hell?
- Oh, no!
- What is going on?
- Is there a problem?
- Your wi-fi crapped out.
I was about to hit Onyx.
Okay, I'll go check the router, it'll be back up in two seconds.
Doesn't matter.
I'll have to start the whole game over.
This blows.
I'm out of here.
If they leave now, we're screwed.
We still have the other games.
Okay, hey, wait, wait, wait!
If you guys stay and play the arcade games, first round on the house.
Ms. Pac-Man?
No thanks.
Why not?
Are you afraid you can't beat the 1985 Kansas City Ms. Pac-Man champion?
Winner takes home tonight's tips.
You're on.
This way, my friend.
Red!
Sorry, guys.
Hey.
What happened?
The RA board voted to keep me.
What?
Ugh.
I used all that free speech stuff that you wrote for me in my meeting.
I knew they'd get it.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Hey, I ordered an extra-large vegetarian pizza for us to celebrate.
All I want to do is just pig out, watch TV, and forget this ever even happened.
- It sounds perfect.
- Great.
Um, actually, I'll meet you in your room, okay?
Okay, fair warning, you take too long, you're gonna be eating vegetarian crusts for dinner.
I'll hurry.
_
_
_
_
10,000 more points and you will beat his high score.
You got this, Vasquez.
Shh!
You're distracting me.
A true Ms. Pac-Man champion plays with all her senses.
- Oh, yes!
- She won!
She won!
That was sick.
You got some skills.
Thanks, kid.
Looks like you saved the night.
Mmm.
You beat Ms. Pac-Man, we're still 200 bucks short of the goal.
Evers is gonna fail us.
We'd have been fine if your ghetto Internet hadn't gone out.
- Excuse me?
- Hey, you're wrong.
Did you see how many people stayed to watch
Regina kick some nerd boy ass?
People love the old arcade games.
The games!
Ah!
Yes!
If the other machines have half this many quarters, we'll easily have 200 bucks.
That one'll take about four hours.
Excuse me.
What do you want?
Uh, I left my portfolio.
I'm with a customer.
You can wait.
Hey, I need to talk to you.
I'll get your book.
Hold on.
Look, I really need to talk to you, like, now!
Seriously?
Wha... what the hell was that?
Those guys were talking about robbing you!
What, you want a thank you?
I can handle myself.
So can I.
There's a lot of things you don't know about me.
I speak Mandarin, I know ASL, and I'm a great tattoo artist, which you would know if you bothered to look at my work.
Can I please just have my portfolio back?
Thank you.
Look, um...
I know what I did was wrong.
I was just trying to impress you, and I guess I went about it in a really stupid way.
Hold up.
You think I fired you because I'm some kind of a hard-ass, don't you?
What you don't get is that when you did that tattoo, you put my whole business at risk.
You don't have a health permit.
You're not licensed.
You could have gotten me shut down.
I could have lost everything.
I get that.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
Let me see that portfolio.
That's rad.
Your design or the client's?
Mine.
Nice.
I like the sword.
So, what were you doing in China?
It's a long story.
Yeah.
I bet it is.
$584.
Not bad.
It's a good thing you didn't return the games.
We'd have been sunk.
You know, it's funny.
When I checked the office earlier,
I saw that someone had unplugged the router.
You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
Luca!
I can't believe you did that!
- What if everybody had left?
- They weren't going to.
Your arcade idea was good.
That weasel was just too pompous to admit it.
But still!
You took a big chance.
Because I believed in you.
Thank you.
The 1985 Ms. Pac-Man champ, huh?
Heh.
That must make you at least...
Stop it.
You're not getting it, Vasquez.
I don't care.
Your age has never mattered to me.
I like you.
And you like me.
I do.
There must be some other prospects.
I made a thousand calls.
It's just hard mid-season, you know?
The situation with Chris was really unique.
I'm really sorry.
With that kid's attitude, what are you gonna do?
But you know what?
You've been great.
I'll figure something out.
I hope it's okay that I came by so late.
Just wanted to give you this.
Your signed letter of intent.
We are thrilled.
You made the right decision, son.
Turns out it was my only decision.
The NCAA found out the other school was offering me a car, and well, they rescinded their offer this afternoon.
Oh, no.
Well, I can't say I'm sorry to hear that.
I got big plans for you, Chris.
You're gonna be happy here.
I'll see to it.
Absolutely.
I hope so.
'Cause I need this.
I can't believe it.
Do you know how lucky we are?
Luck had nothing to do with it.
You made that phone call?
Oh.
I am really enjoying your fierce sense of morality right now.
What is all of this?
_
Iris, are you okay?
I've been texting you.
I know.
Hang on, are you mad at me?
- Are you kidding?
- Hold on.
Talk to me.
I don't want to talk to you.
I read your article.
Then why are you acting like this?
I defended you.
You basically said Mingo's right to free speech trumps my need to have a safe space on campus.
Come on, college isn't supposed to be a safe space.
The whole reason we're here is to be challenged intellectually.
I'm not talking about intellectual safety, Daphne.
For you this is all just some fun academic debate, but I'm talking about my emotional safety.
What do you mean?
Everywhere I go on campus, I have to be on guard.
I have to put on this...
like, this armor to protect me from stuff you don't see.
Like what?
Like when I woke up to find a little tiny drawing of the confederate flag on my door.
Like when a frat guy told us their party was for "hot girls only,"
but they really meant white girls.
Like when my Geology professor made a joke about "savages"
- and looked right at me.
- Oh my god.
Or, like the other night, when I got home and my RA was making fun of black people.
- Iris...
- The dorm is my home.
It's where I sleep.
It's the place I'm supposed to be able to take off that armor.
But you're moving out because one guy wore something that upset you?
No.
I'm moving out because that guy was my RA, the person who's supposed to protect me, and there's nothing I can do about it.
I'm tired of not having a voice.
And I can't live in a place that doesn't even ask black kids how they feel when there's a race issue on the table.
I had no idea.
Well, now you do.
Previousy on Switched at Birth...
Our girls are home!
I'm gonna take a couple of pre-med classes
My plan is to find a place to live.
What about the apartment above the Cracked Mug, isn't that empty?
- You're mad.
- _
Nothing is gonna change between us.
You're... breaking up with me.
- My daughters are back
- I knew it.
Please don't make this harder than it has to be.
I'm just making a buck off girls' stupidity.
You are an arrogant, sexist, bottom-feeding thief.
- Rumor has it that you are the new RA.
- It's true.
Oh, hey, we're having a party tonight.
Come dressed as your favorite singer.
Young money, baby!
Oh, my God!
That's totally insulting, you know that, right?
You don't like Lil Wayne?
Whatever.
I'll see you later.
Good morning.
I had no idea that being "just friends"
was gonna be so uncomfortable.
Hey, I offered to take the floor, but you insisted that Lil Wayne was a gentleman.
Truer words have never been spoken.
(cell phone beeps)
What?
What's wrong?
A picture of us from the party last night.
Someone posted it on Chat Bandit.
Seriously?
Why?
To tell me what a racist ass I am,
- apparently.
- What?
Mine's blowing up, too.
This is the photo I posted on Instagram.
I dressed up as Lil Wayne.
You'd think I went as a KKK member.
"Just another brainless white girl, coasting on her white privilege."
What?
Oh my God...
Ouch.
People hate us.
(theme music playing)
John:
My pitcher's injured, I need someone to replace him immediately.
What about Travis?
You have him back now.
Yeah, but he needs some serious conditioning.
He wasn't playing in China.
He was coaching.
Well, what's your Plan "B" then, John?
I found this kid pitching for Michigan.
He apparently has some family issues, needs to transfer closer to home.
And home is Kansas City?
- Yes.
- That's great.
I'll get right on it.
What's his name?
Chris Walker.
90-mile-an-hour fastball, killer slider, and check this out... he's batting .325.
I love it.
We will travel him down here.
No need to.
He's already here.
- Really?
- Talking to other schools.
We'll have him over for dinner.
Once he gets a peek at your Royals stuff, it'll knock his socks off.
- Hey.
- Well, hello.
I thought you and Daphne had moved out.
Yes, we did, but there's a significant lack of groceries at our pad.
You do know where to obtain groceries out there in the real world?
Hmm, yeah, but I wanted to see you guys!
Ohhh, there's some lasagna in the fridge.
Thank you!
I... will grab it for Daphne.
I'm having dinner with Travis tonight.
Dinners out, apartments... sounds like all you're missing is...
A job?
I will have one, very soon.
As a tattoo artist.
There is this studio in town, it's run by this amazing woman named Noelle.
She is truly an original artist.
She did a full triptych on Tove Lo's back, and it landed her the cover of Rolling Stone.
People come from all over just for her designs.
So you have an interview with her.
Not exactly, but, I did this for months in Beijing.
I've got a killer portfolio, and what I know is, in order to be doing cutting edge work, you've gotta be at a great studio.
So no worries.
I got this job in the bag.
- Sounds good.
- Thanks, 'rents!
Hey there, Bender.
Huh?
Bender.
Judd Nelson?
Breakfast Club.
God, you're young.
I knew the age thing was the reason you ended this.
I told you, my daughters are home,
I need to focus on family, that's all.
Okay... so if age isn't the hangup, let's talk numbers.
You don't have to say it out loud,
I'll just start counting, and you could blink when I get to the right number.
35.
36.
37.
38.
39?
40.
Oh, good for me.
You Regina and Luca?
Yeah.
Great.
The mom and the jarhead.
- Excuse me?
- What did you say?
Professor Evers put us together for the group challenge.
I assumed you guys already saw the list.
Of course.
I was just telling Luca, that I own a cafe in East Riverside, and we can use that for the project.
Fine.
I'll go let Evers know.
(whispers) How did that happen?
(whispers) Maybe the professor thinks we're a good fit.
I just...
I don't get it, when did dressing up like a hip hop artist become a racist thing?
Right?
And who made up that rule?
You can only dress like a celebrity you love if they're the same ethnicity?
And I love Lil Wayne!
I wasn't trying to make fun of him.
I have a Chinese lotus tattoo on my neck, but I'm not Chinese.
Is that appropriating Asian culture?
You know what?
It's Chat Bandit.
By lunch, everyone's gonna be talking about some football player who's taking steroids.
We just have to wait it out.
I just don't get how it blew up so fast.
There were a bunch of kids at the party, including a lot of black kids, and no one seemed to care last night.
Actually, Iris was pretty upset.
Right.
Do you think we should talk with her?
I'll do it.
This will all blow over.
It'll be fine.

Hey, are you Noelle?
Excuse me.
I'm booked up for the next two weeks.
Call back after hours, or go to my site, you can schedule online.
Actually, I'm an artist looking for a chair.
I've been working in Beijing for the last year.
I brought my book if you want to see my stuff.
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hm.
Look.
I don't hire people without references I trust, and... do you even have any ink?
I have... some.
Sorry.
Not hiring.
Hi.
Excuse me.
What time do you think we'll be out of here?
It takes how long it takes.
You made an appointment for two people, not half your sorority house.
Sorry.
When word got out, our ranks kind of swelled.
We just have a function later we have to get to.
So, make another appointment.
This isn't a drive-through.
We're taking our sorority photo this evening, and we all really want them in time for that.
Is there any way you can do us all?
- We'll pay extra.
- Let me help you out.
I can get them all stenciled while you do the inking.
- It'll take you half the time.
- I don't even know you.
Oh, trust me, I can ink a wicked fire dragon with a seven-color fade.
I promise you, I can lay up a stencil of three Greek letters.
Look, it's just a stencil.
If you don't like my work, you can always wash it off.
- Stencil paper is in the third drawer down.
- (softly) Yes!
One other thing...
don't ever distract me while I'm working with a customer again.
Got it?
Got it.

I'm so sorry.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Um, can I ask you a question?
Did you post that photo of me and Mingo on Chat Bandit?
No, but I'm not surprised someone did.
It was really offensive.
Iris, it was a costume party.
Everyone was dressed up.
Mingo was mocking black culture.
He was dressed like Lil Wayne.
That's not exactly black culture.
So, you're the expert on black culture?
Of course not.
I just don't get why you're acting like he wore blackface?
He may as well have.
He was running around with a grill, Daphne.
Because Lil Wayne wears a grill.
Yeah, and it's a complete racial stereotype, one that Mingo reinforced for the entire dorm when he put on baggy pants and threw up westside gang symbols.
Is this even about last night?
You've never liked Mingo.
I'm clearly not the only one upset that he turned "ghetto black person" into a costume for the dorm's entertainment.
(sighs)
I hate that we're fighting.
I know.
We need to catch up.
Are you free for lunch?
No, I'm meeting my friend Adina, and a few other people.
Nice.
Is she part of your sorority?
Black student union.
Oh.
I didn't know you hung out with them.
Well, a lot's happened in the last 10 months.
Like what?
I gotta run.
I'll see you later, okay?
- Bye.
- Bye.
(chuckling)
You know, let me kick you down something for the effort.
Uh, I appreciate that, but honestly, what I'm really looking for is a job.
I told you, I'm not hiring.
But you could use the help.
I mean, think how much your business would grow.
I like my studio the way it is.
But clearly you have some experience.
There are other studios in town.
Yeah, places where I'll spend all day inking Popeyes or zodiac tramp stamps.
But your designs are incredible.
And I want to be working with the best.
Maybe I could use some help.
Thank you!
Oh, I will kill it for you, I promise.
No, no, no, that's not what I mean.
What I'm offering you is an apprentice job... phones, cleaning, helping with supplies.
That's it.
Or there's always the zodiac tramp stamps.

Hey!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I have a good reason for being late.
I got a job!

Come on, we can rally.
Uh, YJ's is open late, let's go?
It'll be just like our midnight noodle runs back in Beijing.
_
Uh, well...
I'll wait.
We can go later.
_
_
_
I'll talk to him.
_
_
Look, I'll make it up to you.
Okay?
I promise.
_
_
Thanks.
It's not exactly a tattoo artist job.
It's more like a tattoo apprentice.
_
It's a little harder than I was expecting to get a chair out here.
Apparently people want references in English.
_
_
Daphne.
Hey, Sharee!
How are you?
How is everything?
Bomb.
I got a job in the athletic department, and it looks like I'll make the Dean's list this quarter.
Awesome.
But how about you, world traveler?
How's being back from China?
It's okay.
I went to a party with my ex-boyfriend last night.
Oh, that.
Yeah, I saw.
You saw the picture?
I think everyone on campus did.
Were you offended?
Not really.
I get why people are upset, but I don't let stuff like that get to me.
I wish everyone felt that way.
Some kid acting like a fool is not worth my time.
I gotta do something.
I can't just sit around and watch people say these awful things about me and Mingo as if they know us.
Look, I'm not sweating it, but some people are.
Being a black kid at UMKC can be... complicated.
As a friend, I'm telling you... the best thing you can do is try to stay out of it.
Bottom of the ninth, one out.
Saberhagen throws a cutter, and the ball gets hit into the hole at third.
Routine ground ball, no problem.
But the ball takes a bad hop over the shortstop's glove.
- No!
- And in that moment,
I am thinking what every single person in that stadium is thinking,
"There goes our no-hitter."
So what happened?
So I dive to my left, stab the ball in the hop, sitting on my ass in the dirt, turn the double play, game over, we win.
- Wow.
- True story, I was there.
(laughing)
I don't think I bought myself a beer for the entire rest of the season.
That's unbelievable.
You know what?
I do believe I have that game ball in my office.
Signed by the entire '85 Royals team.
Let me see if I can find it.
Chris, thanks for sitting down with us.
I can tell that John's becoming a big fan.
He seems really cool.
I just...
I just want to make the right decision with this move, you know?
I'm really sorry to hear that your aunt is not doing well.
John tells me that she raised you?
Yeah.
Yeah, she did, me and my little brother both.
Well, I want you to know that you have my promise that I will do everything in my power to make sure you can be there for her.
Whatever you need.
I'm really glad to hear that.
Because if I'm gonna make this move to UMKC, you know, I'm gonna need some things.
The main thing being a car.
Uh, okay.
That's understandable, but you do know that it is not possible for us to buy you a car?
It is in clear violation of NCAA rules.
Really?
You know, because the school I visited yesterday is offering up a Mustang.
I just gotta be able to get back and forth, you know, on account of my auntie.
Well, we will absolutely take care of your transportation needs.
I will make sure that you have access to shuttles or volunteer drivers...
whatever you need.
Yeah, I don't think you get what I'm saying.
I want a car.
I put together some numbers for you guys to look at.
We have to raise the Cracked Mug's daily revenue by 10% to pass the project.
- This place does solid business.
- Mm-hmm.
Did you lose your vision in Afghanistan?
It's only 8:00 and this place is like a graveyard.
So we'll recruit fresh customers.
We could do a UMKC night, hand out door prizes, do reward cards.
We have to up profits by 10%.
Hosting a study session isn't gonna bring in that kind of cash flow.
I wish we were near a military base.
I downed five espressos a night when I was in active duty.
So do gamers.
That could work.
We could do a video game night.
Get some machines in here, charge a small fee for a tournament.
- I love that idea.
- I can get some people in the door, make sure we're drawing in the right kind of crowd.
Then I'll handle the special event permit.
Great.
Let's do it.
And these kids, they're on... what is it?
- Chat Bandit.
- Yes!
Okay, they're exactly what's wrong with this whole PC culture.
Let me tell you something.
The real world our there is a lot more offensive than some kid dressed up like... whoever that is.
Excuse me, you go here?
Sign our petition?
- _
- Greg Shimingo is an RA in Hanes Dorm.
Apparently, he's got a long history of bigotry.
What?
That's not true.
I lived there.
I know him.
Did you see what he wore the other night?
Yeah, and I don't see what the problem is.
It was a costume party.
Well, with or without your help, we're getting rid of this guy.
"I spent the last eight months in Asia and I can tell you from personal experience that the right to individual expression remains the most fundamental part of who we are as Americans."
Wow.
It's bold.
Last year during the whole Tank thing,
I was the angry mass' favorite topic of conversation on Chat Bandit.
All I wanted to do was get facial reconstructive surgery and change my name.
Are you sure that you wanna step into the spotlight?
Yeah, I have to.
I don't think that people understand what they're asking for.
If Mingo loses his RA job, we're basically giving permission to administration to tell us how to dress.
We're volunteering to lose our right to free speech.
Daphne Vasquez, future doctor, current journalist.
I like it.
I'm just glad the UMKC Sentinel agreed to let me write an op-ed.
The editor hinted that if it was good enough, he would lead with it.
Look at us!
Beijing sisters, we are back, and we are ready to take KC by storm.
Kathryn, I cannot lose this kid.
He is a sure-fire solution to my pitching problems.
Buying him a car?
I mean, really, John?
That was out of line.
Oh, welcome to the modern world.
Please.
Honestly, I do not understand why these kids aren't paid in the first place.
They play for four years, they make us millions of dollars, and most of them never ever get to the pros.
They get nothing.
They get an education, John.
Kathryn, please, I've heard that a million times.
Okay, I don't like it any more than you do, but those are the rules.
And unless you have a way around the National Collegiate Athletic Association, we are stuck here.
Do you remember...
Richie Sutter?
Pitcher for the Cards, yeah.
Richie's got a couple of car dealerships.
- I thought I'd give him a call.
- John!
He's a big UMKC fan.
He just wants to help.
Richie is willing to give Chris a loaner car.
No money changes hands, there is no paper trail.
When Chris is done with school, he gives the loaner car back.
Chris gets to see his sick aunt, we get our new star pitcher, and no one is the wiser.
- That's really clever.
- Yeah.
But it's still cheating.
We can't do it.
You heard that that kid said.
We wouldn't be the only ones doing this.
Are you seriously gonna roll out that argument with me?
That's what you said when we got into our tax trouble, and look where that got us.
Kathryn, I am on the verge here, okay?
I can feel it.
We're not gonna lie and cheat like those other people.
Tuesday, ah, yes.
Noelle can see you then.
All right, cool.
Bye.
Is Noelle around?
Uh, she'll be back later this afternoon.
Can I help you with anything?
Yeah, I was looking for a specific image, but I don't see anything like it in this book.
She can always draw something up for you.
- What were you thinking of?
- An owl.
Aww, I love that.
Well, you can always go traditional or maybe more cartoony.
It totally just depends on the vibe you're going for.
Here, check this out.
Now, it's not an owl, but it is a high-contrast black and gray technique.
An owl would look great done like this.
Wait, is this your book?
Uh, yeah.
I want you to do my tattoo.
You should really come back and discuss all of this with Noelle, really.
I've seen her work.
I like yours better.
Don't you want to do it?
Well, yeah, but...
Then?
Let's do this.
Okay, take a seat.
Straight back.
Thank you so much.
What is that?
Is there a problem?
Yeah.
It's not 1982.
I think when we said video games,
Aidan was probably thinking Xbox or PlayStation.
Oh, of course.
I knew I'd get screwed when Evers paired me with the old person.
Watch it.
You know what?
Aidan's right.
I messed up.
Let me call the vendor.
Maybe he can swap the machines out.
No!
No, keep the games.
We'll bring in some '80s music.
Do a throwback arcade night.
It'll be cool.
Are you willing to bet your grade on it?
'Cause I'm not.
Fine.
Let's do both.
It'll be sort of an old-school-meets-new-school vibe.
Whatever.
I'll call around for some game consoles and try to save our asses.
Don't listen to him.
It's gonna be fine.
Okay.
That's absurd.
The university has no right to tell us what to wear.
I mean, if we start by censoring students' wardrobe, what's next?
Burning books?
We may as well live in Soviet Russia.
So we're just supposed to let some racist idiot keep his job in the dorm with students of color because, what, he's got the right to free speech?
This is America.
We can't infringe upon someone's first amendment rights
- whenever our feelings are hurt.
- Exactly.
There are plenty of legal limits to free speech in the US.
You wanna know what's a crime?
Shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, making rude suggestions to women, and threatening someone using racial slurs.
No, I wasn't talking about sexual harassment or threats.
Wait, you're Daphne Vasquez?
Are you even Latina?
I'm Puerto Rican.
I grew up in East Riverside.
I know who you are now.
Your dad's that Royals player.
That white Royals player.
Uh, her skin color is totally irrelevant, okay?
We're talking about free speech, not racism.
- See, that's so easy for you to say.
- Don't be naive.
This is so
- clearly a racism issue.
- You think I don't understand discrimination?
- I don't know?
- Are you kidding me?
- Wait, wait, stop.
- You will never understand...
And who gave you permission to own the struggle anyway?
- That's right!
- You sound so racist.
How can you even say that?
(all arguing)
Okay, okay, enough!
Everybody settle down.
As fascinating as all this is, we've still got Kant to wrestle with today.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I believe the phrase is "hiding like a coward."
Mingo.
Everywhere I went today, people were just looking at me like I was some kind of serial killer.
They can't stay mad forever.
It gets worse.
I have to meet with the RA board in an hour to fight for my job.
This whole thing is just a nightmare.
They can't fire you over this.
Sure they can.
According to Chat Bandit, I'm the worst RA alive.
If they fire you over a costume, the university is essentially declaring that they can censor us.
We have the right to offend people.
That's what makes us Americans.
If we let them tell us how to dress, what's next?
What books we can read?
What websites we can visit?
Hey.
Hey.
You can do this.
I know you can.
Just talk to them.
Yeah.
You're right.
I got this.
But just in case, though, do you think you could... you could text me some of that stuff you just said?
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.
What's all this?
Apparently it's what the kids do for fun these days.
You okay?
That seemed pretty intense over there.
- Did you read my article?
- Of course.
(clears throat) And I heard a lot of kids talk about it today.
You made quite an impact.
Yeah.
Mexican hot chocolate coming right up.
Talk to me.
I thought I could use the article to show everyone how crazy this whole thing is, but I feel like I just made things worse.
Well, Mingo made a pretty clueless decision to dress up like that.
You defended him.
You think his outfit was racist?
Of course.
How would you feel if someone showed up at a party wearing a sombrero and pushing a lawnmower and said they were Latino?
I'd be offended.
- See?
- But I'd still defend his right to wear whatever he wanted.
Just like I have the freedom to call him an ass.
Do you think that writing the op-ed was a mistake?
I may not agree with your point of view, but I raised you to fight for what you believe in.
And you're doing that.
Thanks.
Hi.
I got you your latte...
What the hell is this?
An owl?
I was just trying to make the customer happy.
She was looking for a very specific piece, and I happened to have something like it in my book, and I made the sale!
You can check the money in the register.
You showed a customer your book?
Um...
Because I had what she wanted.
I'm so sorry.
I promise it won't happen again.
I know it won't, because you're fired.
Chris:
I think I really like it here at UMKC.
That's great.
Well, we really want to make this work.
Good.
So, let's get down to business.
Actually, there's not gonna be any business, or car, or anything like that.
I mean, I really don't know what other schools are offering you, but what I have beats the hell out of a car or a little bit of flash money.
You see, John Kennish is an incredible coach, and he cares about every one of his players.
And make no mistake about it, he is going to take this team to the regionals, and then to the College World Series.
Chris, if you decide to come here,
Coach Kennish is going to make sure that you get a long look from the pros.
And he can do that, because he was in the majors.
And one more thing.
I will make sure that you get a first-class education and graduate with a degree.
So think long and hard about this, because what I have to offer you is a future.
And compared to that, a car is chump change.
No offense, but that's easy for you to say sitting in that big house in Mission Hills.
But me?
I gotta get paid.
(sighs)
_
I got fired.
_
Can we just get out of here?
_
Why?
_
_
I cannot believe this.
This city is a jinx.
It's like there's a full-on conspiracy to keep us apart.
_
No.
No, you're right.
You can't do that.
Sometimes I wish we never came back home.
Back there it was just me and you and Daphne, and there were no parents, no old boyfriends, no bosses to get in the way.
(sighs)

('80s music playing)
Come on.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You don't have to play this dinosaur on my account.
Oh, I'm not.
I love these games.
Plus, I spent three years in Afghanistan.
Make-believe violence doesn't really interest me.
And I won't give that douche the satisfaction.
- Hey, Regina?
- Yes?
Hook me up with a latte?
What the hell?
- Oh, no!
- What is going on?
- Is there a problem?
- Your wi-fi crapped out.
I was about to hit Onyx.
Okay, I'll go check the router, it'll be back up in two seconds.
Doesn't matter.
I'll have to start the whole game over.
This blows.
I'm out of here.
If they leave now, we're screwed.
We still have the other games.
Okay, hey, wait, wait, wait!
If you guys stay and play the arcade games, first round on the house.
Ms. Pac-Man?
No thanks.
Why not?
Are you afraid you can't beat the 1985 Kansas City Ms. Pac-Man champion?
Winner takes home tonight's tips.
You're on.
This way, my friend.
Red!
Sorry, guys.
Hey.
What happened?
The RA board voted to keep me.
What?
Ugh.
I used all that free speech stuff that you wrote for me in my meeting.
I knew they'd get it.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Hey, I ordered an extra-large vegetarian pizza for us to celebrate.
All I want to do is just pig out, watch TV, and forget this ever even happened.
- It sounds perfect.
- Great.
Um, actually, I'll meet you in your room, okay?
Okay, fair warning, you take too long, you're gonna be eating vegetarian crusts for dinner.
I'll hurry.
(knocking)

Luca: 10,000 more points and you will beat his high score.
You got this, Vasquez.
Shh!
You're distracting me.
A true Ms. Pac-Man champion plays with all her senses.
(machine beeping)
- Oh, yes!
- She won!
- She won!
- (cheering)
That was sick.
You got some skills.
Thanks, kid.
Looks like you saved the night.
Aidan:
Mmm.
You beat Ms. Pac-Man, we're still 200 bucks short of the goal.
Evers is gonna fail us.
We'd have been fine if your ghetto Internet hadn't gone out.
- Excuse me?
- Hey, you're wrong.
Did you see how many people stayed to watch
Regina kick some nerd boy ass?
People love the old arcade games.
The games!
Ah!
Yes!
If the other machines have half this many quarters, we'll easily have 200 bucks.
That one'll take about four hours.
Excuse me.
What do you want?
Uh, I left my portfolio.
I'm with a customer.
You can wait.
(conversing in Chinese)
Hey, I need to talk to you.
I'll get your book.
Hold on.
(Chinese conversation continues)
Look, I really need to talk to you, like, now!
Seriously?
(shouting in Chinese)
Wha... what the hell was that?
Those guys were talking about robbing you!
What, you want a thank you?
I can handle myself.
So can I.
There's a lot of things you don't know about me.
I speak Mandarin, I know ASL, and I'm a great tattoo artist, which you would know if you bothered to look at my work.
Can I please just have my portfolio back?
Thank you.
Look, um...
I know what I did was wrong.
I was just trying to impress you, and I guess I went about it in a really stupid way.
Hold up.
You think I fired you because I'm some kind of a hard-ass, don't you?
What you don't get is that when you did that tattoo, you put my whole business at risk.
You don't have a health permit.
You're not licensed.
You could have gotten me shut down.
I could have lost everything.
I get that.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
Let me see that portfolio.
That's rad.
Your design or the client's?
Mine.
Nice.
I like the sword.
So, what were you doing in China?
It's a long story.
Yeah.
I bet it is.
(calculator beeping)
$584.
Not bad.
It's a good thing you didn't return the games.
We'd have been sunk.
You know, it's funny.
When I checked the office earlier,
I saw that someone had unplugged the router.
You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
Luca!
I can't believe you did that!
- What if everybody had left?
- They weren't going to.
Your arcade idea was good.
That weasel was just too pompous to admit it.
But still!
You took a big chance.
Because I believed in you.
Thank you.
The 1985 Ms. Pac-Man champ, huh?
Heh.
That must make you at least...
Stop it.
You're not getting it, Vasquez.
I don't care.
Your age has never mattered to me.
I like you.
(whispers) And you like me.
I do.
There must be some other prospects.
I made a thousand calls.
It's just hard mid-season, you know?
The situation with Chris was really unique.
I'm really sorry.
With that kid's attitude, what are you gonna do?
But you know what?
You've been great.
I'll figure something out.
(doorbell rings)
I hope it's okay that I came by so late.
Just wanted to give you this.
Your signed letter of intent.
We are thrilled.
You made the right decision, son.
Turns out it was my only decision.
The NCAA found out the other school was offering me a car, and well, they rescinded their offer this afternoon.
Oh, no.
Well, I can't say I'm sorry to hear that.
I got big plans for you, Chris.
You're gonna be happy here.
I'll see to it.
Absolutely.
I hope so.
'Cause I need this.
I can't believe it.
Do you know how lucky we are?
Luck had nothing to do with it.
You made that phone call?
Oh.
I am really enjoying your fierce sense of morality right now.

Iris, are you okay?
I've been texting you.
I know.
Hang on, are you mad at me?
- Are you kidding?
- Hold on.
Talk to me.
I don't want to talk to you.
I read your article.
Then why are you acting like this?
I defended you.
You basically said Mingo's right to free speech trumps my need to have a safe space on campus.
Come on, college isn't supposed to be a safe space.
The whole reason we're here is to be challenged intellectually.
I'm not talking about intellectual safety, Daphne.
For you this is all just some fun academic debate, but I'm talking about my emotional safety.
What do you mean?
Everywhere I go on campus, I have to be on guard.
I have to put on this...
like, this armor to protect me from stuff you don't see.
Like what?
Like when I woke up to find a little tiny drawing of the confederate flag on my door.
Like when a frat guy told us their party was for "hot girls only,"
but they really meant white girls.
Like when my Geology professor made a joke about "savages"
- and looked right at me.
- Oh my god.
Or, like the other night, when I got home and my RA was making fun of black people.
- Iris...
- The dorm is my home.
It's where I sleep.
It's the place I'm supposed to be able to take off that armor.
But you're moving out because one guy wore something that upset you?
No.
I'm moving out because that guy was my RA, the person who's supposed to protect me, and there's nothing I can do about it.
I'm tired of not having a voice.
And I can't live in a place that doesn't even ask black kids how they feel when there's a race issue on the table.
I had no idea.
Well, now you do.
APPLAUSE
Good evening, welcome to Have I Got News For You,
I'm Frankie Boyle.
In the news this week, in central London,
BBC arts editor Will Gompertz struggles with the weight of his massive frontal lobe.
In Durham, Mike Ashley regrets getting a zero-hours worker from Sports Direct to set up his water slide.
And, having been home for almost a year, there are signs that astronaut Tim Peake is still struggling to adapt to normal life.
On Ian's team tonight is an actress and comedian who performs in a Radio Wales sketch show,
Die Laughing...is the name of the producer.
Please welcome Cariad Lloyd.
And with Paul tonight is Gyles Brandreth, a friend of Prince Philip.
Philip says the friendship has helped him to welcome old age, as he's looking forward to forgetting who Gyles is.
Please welcome Gyles Brandreth.
And we start with the bigger stories of the week.
Ian and Cariad, take a look at this.
Tim Farron, the manifesto.
Theresa May, another manifesto.
Corbyn, that's dead.
That's the last Labour voter he's talking to.
- Everyone's released their manifestos.
- It's manifestos week - like Fashion Week but less interesting.
At least the manifestos have come out, cos they were dripping out one boring policy a day.
Like a kind of diabetic advent calendar.
You see things in such positive terms.
That is one of my more positive jokes.
Theresa May, with that fake photo they had, the bus, a huge crowd of people, there was actually about 30 people, outside the bus that was used on the Remain campaign it's got the same number plate.
Did you know that?
- Well, excellent.
Recycling!
She's got the Ukip vote, she's got the Labour vote, she's got the Green vote, now!
- I'll give her that.
- Do manifestos have much point?
British people generally vote for leaders, don't they?
At the moment, they're going,
"Who would lead us if we are all stranded on a desert island?"
and they know that Theresa May would have us eating the wounded by nightfall.
And Corbyn would be hosting a two-hour meeting about whether coconuts have feelings.
Isn't the argument a lot of Theresa May's policies are Ed Miliband's old policies?
Theresa Miliband.
Who is this appalling Marxist?
- Chairman May.
- Chairman May!
I've stood in two elections.
Really, Gyles...?
I have to tell you, I've not met a member of the voting public who has ever read a manifesto.
I certainly didn't trouble myself.
Feeling that the broad-brush approach is what we need, and I think that's really, if I were Theresa May,
I would not have bothered with this.
She's got a very good "strong and stable government", lovely line, nobody out there ever reads the manifesto.
Gyles, you went round a few doors, knocked on them, and, quite rightly, the people pretended not to be in.
Including, sadly, your own house.
I would put it to you, Gyles, saying "strong and stable" over and over again isn't a strong and stable thing to do.
So, you know...
APPLAUSE
I'm sure you watched the build-up to the Anthony Joshua-Klitschko fight.
Watched it?
I lived it!
He was in one of the supporting bouts.
They were incredibly eloquent in the build-up to that fight.
It wasn't like a normal fight, they didn't trash talk each other, they were both very articulate guys.
That's a better quality of debate than we've had in the election.
This is why, really, a manifesto is not necessary, because the odds seem to be in Mrs May's favour.
She also has that lovely husband.
So they're a marvellous double act.
She has a lovely husband?
So why does she keep bringing out this one, then?
Why is she doing so well, May?
Have you seen the opposition, Frankie?
I don't think anybody has.
Theresa May looks like if the colour grey didn't care if you lived or died.
APPLAUSE
Again, I think she's trying to extend her appeal beyond... you.
There was bad news and good news for the elderly needing care
- in their own home.
- Oh, yeah.
- What was it?
- CARIAD:
- The value of your house will now be taken into account.
- GYLES:
- The essence of it is social care will be paid somehow, and it's going to be paid for by your house, in the long term.
You and your partner can live in the house while you're alive, but the moment you are dead, out, out!
And let's sell the house and bring the money in, that's the essence of it.
Is it another of those policies that presumably are going to really worry some of the papers who like to support Mrs May, it's an attack on old, rich people.
Sensible candidates spend a lot of time in the old-folks home, because there the people are, waiting to meet you, lined up against the wall, gazing in the same direction...
LAUGHTER
And you come with a local photographer, you come after lunch, they're dozing fitfully, you position yourself halfway down the line.
When the photographer is ready, you go...
They wake up, eyes open.
Photograph is taken.
There you are, you've visited the old people.
Broad brush.
Strong and stable government.
Fingers on buzzers.
Let's see if you can tell me what revealing answers Theresa May gave to a series of quickfire questions put to her by the Sunday Times.
Question was Sherlock or Midsomer Murders?
- BELL
- She likes both.
"I've watched both."
She's not stupid, you know.
Broadchurch or Line of Duty?
BELL
Both.
Neither.
"I haven't watched either." Merkel or Macron?
BELL
Both, "I'm looking forward to working with them."
Almost exactly that.
I could be a politician, it's incredibly easy.
I mean, even Gyles did it...
The Daily Telegraph made a similar attempt to make her appear human and normal, by asking her which Harry Potter character she most resembled.
BUZZER
She has read, she claims, all the Harry Potter books.
I don't know if she's seen the movies, but she wouldn't be drawn on which one she wanted to be...
- CARIAD:
- She's Malfoy and she knows it.
She's not Malfoy.
Those are the posh boys she's just replaced.
She's maybe Thatcher's final horcrux.
- I'd watch that.
- What she replied was...
Unite boss Len McCluskey had some encouraging words for Jeremy Corbyn, what were they?
BUZZER
He said, we haven't got a chance.
He said, we have 200 seats left, that'll be it, we won't win, we've got no chance at all.
He said 200 seats would be Labour's worst result since 1935, and that would be regarded as a success for Jeremy Corbyn.
This is the mistake, you see, politicians make - saying anything at all.
You seem to be saying "don't say anything" at incredible length.
APPLAUSE
What was wrong with the design of Labour candidate Roger Godsiff's campaign leaflet?
Did he misspell the constituency, or his own name?
- It was beyond that.
- Beyond that?
- Shall we have a wee look?
"Unwanted, unnecessary and opportunistic."
You asked for honesty from your politicians.
Anything else catch your eye in the various manifestos?
They're full of good ideas - unlike Gyles,
I thought they were terrific.
They're a lot of the same ideas.
This is cos we're all now broadly speaking in the middle ground.
Little Tim Farron, looking like Daddy Woodentop.
He's allowing us to get high on the weed, that's lovely.
- CARIAD:
- Somebody make a gif of that immediately -
Gyles Brandreth going "high on the weed."
I've kind of got addicted to watching Tim Farron.
- He's incredible.
- He's like a sort of trendy vicar.
"OK, we're having a meeting at the youth club tomorrow,
"we're gonna have a workshop on how to act normal around gays."
Did anyone see the BBC's Ben Brown cup a woman's breast while talking to Norman Smith on Tuesday?
- No.
- Let's have a look.
Already, there's some uncertainty about what he was saying on benefits.
- WOMAN:
- Absolutely fantastic.
Just give us a second.
Jeremy Corbyn was asked whether he would end the freeze...
And the BBC has spent years trying to get away from this kind of thing.
- This is the...
- Can I say, this is...
- No.
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
This is the ongoing election campaign.
Revealing that she's a diabetic,
Theresa May has admitted she injects five times a day.
She really is going for that Scottish vote, isn't she?
As a father, I'll tell you what's a vote winner - cutting paternity leave.
Paul and Gyles, take a look at this, please.
Yes, this is a hospital...
The computer's going down, he's very angry about it.
There is the evil villain that's been making it all happen, somebody who can't afford their electricity bill.
- So, hackers.
Anonymous hackers.
- It's the hackers.
- Are they anonymous?
- I don't know where they're from.
- We do know where they're from.
They are from North Korea.
- It turns out.
- Has that been proven?
- Not totally proven.
But they're not going to sue me, so...
I think it probably is North Korea, there is something...
LAUGHTER
Something in the code, when it was un-hacked, indicated it might have been from North Korea.
- CARIAD:
- Gyles, you know way too much about this.
I think you were involved.
- GYLES:
- Only because I did chair the Cyber Security Awards, quite recently.
I can't tell you where, or when...
Is that security or Alzheimer's?
Do you know what the virus was called?
It was called WannaCry, demands money before you can get your computer files back.
It was all in BRIT-coins as well.
- Bitcoins?
- Bitcoins.
No, no, we've left the European market.
Britcoins!
There's been a sort of failure of the government, here, hasn't there?
They were warned at least three years ago that XP needed updating.
But the trouble with the NHS, it spent a lot of money on IT already - about 12 billion - for a system that didn't work, so essentially it doesn't have any money left, so they didn't pay for the update.
We've not upgraded the security properly, we've been running the NHS on Windows XP so people have probably been told that they're dying by a helpful paperclip.
I like the idea that as a hacker, you would target, for a ransom, the NHS.
One of the few world organisations you know doesn't have any money.
Probably given Jeremy Hunt some ideas about how to get money out of it!
What must it be like being Jeremy Hunt at the moment?
Imagine he goes into hospital, he'd be the first person to have a sprained wrist treated anally.
"Sorry, Mr Hunt, this is going to involve a bit of a run-up."
"Luckily, our computers are down,
"so there's no record of what's about to happen to you."
This bit of malware was stolen from the American National Security Association.
Which is a misnomer!
I think President Trump gave it away.
Does anyone know what the Russians have said about it?
CARIAD SPEAKS RUSSIAN-SOUNDING GIBBERISH
Exactly that.
They're claiming it's not them cos the Russian Interior Ministry was targeted.
- GYLES:
- That was the decoy.
You're so clever, Gyles.
These are just things I picked up at the Cyber Security Conference.
The Russians have said...
Who else has been hacked this week?
- The Europeans...
- Everyone's been hacked - virtually everybody outside of North Korea has been hacked.
Renault.
One of the big stories is they hacked Disney.
They've demanded a ransom.
Disney have said...
..said the makers of Pirates Of The Caribbean 5.
This is the NHS computer-hacking crisis.
It's the biggest failure for the NHS since records began... at three o'clock yesterday.
Nine NHS trusts were affected.
Records were lost and people may have to wait six weeks to see a doctor.
Amber Rudd said...
And so to Round 2 and a welcome return to the Jigsaw of News.
Fingers on the buzzer, teams.
BUZZER
Is this President, soon-to-be-Mr Trump?
Once again, every time he does something, he just makes things worse for himself.
They're relieved he's going abroad for a couple of weeks, just to take the pressure off him being a fucking idiot.
APPLAUSE
If, as a result of his presidency, the world does indeed end, won't it be marvellous to think it happened in our time?
He might change what the word "presidential" means.
Like, in a few years, you'll be going,
"My uncle fell over and banged his head on a curb.
"He's been rendered completely presidential."
He dismissed the head of the FBI this week.
- CARIAD:
- James Comey?
- GYLES:
- Mr Comey was dismissed.
- Comey over.
- Because he was...
- CARIAD:
- Investigating his connections with Russia.
And now there's an enquiry, who's been put in charge of the enquiry?
- They've got a special prosecutor.
- A former head of the FBI.
When you open up that special prosecutor, there'll be another little special prosecutor, there'll be another...
Eventually there will be a little bloke saying, "Did you do it?"
- CARIAD:
- Robert Mueller?
Robert Mueller who was a former FBI director.
James Comey's done something to get his revenge on Trump.
- Any ideas?
- He has produced his memo.
He kept a memorandum.
After Trump tweeted that he had kept or suggest he might have kept a recording of the dinner that took place in February.
Comey then came back to say, "I kept a memorandum."
And he said, "Will you drop the Russian stuff?"
So, basically, he accused him of literally trying to interfere in the process of justice.
The Americans don't like that very much.
So it's all going wrong.
- CARIAD:
- The best bit was Putin.
"If you want the transcript, we've got one."
How did Trump's administration respond to Comey's leak?
With confusion.
With incredible confusion.
According to the online news website Daily Beast one official said...
While another senior official said...
What else did Donald Trump do this week?
He decided literally in the middle of a meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister that he would read some stuff given to him by some people, came from the Israelis apparently, he just passed it on.
That's to the Russians!
And then he goes around saying,
"Why did people accuse me of being too close to the Russians?"
I don't know, Donald, I can't imagine!
Trump defended his actions by making this speech.
Look at the way I've been treated lately.
Especially by the media.
No politician in history... ..and I say this with great surety, was treated worse or more unfairly.
You can't let them get you down.
- Oh, God!
- When he says no-one's been treated this badly, does he mean psychiatrically?
Did he use the word "surety?"
Yes.
It is terrifying, isn't it?
Surely if you were recruiting a spy,
Trump would be underneath Hulk Hogan.
I wouldn't believe any conspiracy theory at all.
I think he is exactly what he is revealing himself to be.
You just told us North Korea attacked the NHS!
Oh, no!
Don't reintroduce the subject!
- That is that.
- Please be quiet.
- He also...
- How did...
- Excuse me.
No.
He also...
Gyles.
Gyles, when people hear your name, they often think, "Jumpers,"
but I'm sure people who meet you must take their lives in other ways as well.
LAUGHTER
This is the news that Donald Trump is now at war with intelligence in two ways.
Donald Trump said recently that every time he picks a phone up, he feels like someone is listening.
That's what a phone is, Donald!
APPLAUSE
Donald Trump is increasingly unpopular with the CIA, where his Secret Service codename is JFK 2.
Fingers on buzzers, teams.
- BELL
- Football.
LAUGHTER
- Who are they?
- CARIAD:
- They're men.
They're men with a cup.
- They have done something well.
- They're a very special type
- of new football club.
GYLES:
- They're wearing green costumes?
- CARIAD:
- Costumes!
He's worse than me!
- The green's a clue.
GYLES:
- The green IS a clue.
It's an environmentally friendly football club.
Yes!
Yes indeed.
- This is the news...
- Forest Green Rovers or whatever?
Forest Green Rovers?
The first vegan football club.
- Vegan?
- They were promoted on Sunday for the first time in their history.
Here's how the radio commentator described it.
'Let me tell you this, Cheltenham, Swindon, Newport, 'you're going to eat humus at the new lawn next season, 'because Forest Green Rovers are in the Football League!
'
Since going vegan, the players have had zero injuries, but how were some of the players and staff caught out last year?
Eating pork scratchings after hours?
Very close.
Here they are!
The staff at Greggs didn't help the situation by telling the local paper...
This is Forest Green Rovers, the first vegan football club.
Thanks to their eco-friendly chairman, Dale Vince, according to the BBC, the club has...
In fact, if they put any more shit on the pitch, they'll qualify for the Scottish Premiership.
As a vegan team, Forest Green Rovers are looking forward to their derby with archrivals KFC.
Time now for the odd one out round.
Your four are... a quilted jacket in old gold, the Da Vinci Code,
Stork margarine, and Ivanka Trump's fashion brand.
OK, the jacket is old gold coloured,
Dan Brown, the Da Vinci Code, I don't know much about that.
Other than it was a film and a book, obviously.
Stork might have changed its colour due to some sort of manufacturing process.
Any idea about this, Gyles?
Well, colour clearly is involved, orange possibly is the colour because Orange is the colour of Ivanka and of the quilted jacket.
Is it something to do with not being stocked, cos Ivanka's fashion line was dropped?
And it was one of the few things that Trump was genuinely exercised about - his daughter's fashion line was dropped by one of the big department stores.
Yes, it's much more to do with that.
LAUGHTER
Stork is no longer on the market, and the other three are.
No.
And this old gold jacket...
- CARIAD:
- Has been dropped by...
Not been dropped by anyone.
Thus the odd one out.
- It is the odd one out.
- Hey!
APPLAUSE
The answer is no-one wants to buy them apart from a quilted jacket in old gold, which proved to be overwhelmingly popular this week.
Ria Hattam wore one to the Badminton Horse Trials only to spot at least 16 others.
She took some photos.
Let's have a look at Ria and the matching jackets.
Oh, yes!
I'm laughing, but I'm going to go and throw mine away!
This isn't the only time someone has turned up to find everyone else in the same outfit.
Did anyone see how Australian news anchor
Amber Sherlock dealt with it?
Wearing the same as the breakfast person on Norwegian television.
I don't really know what that means.
Let's have a wee look at the clip.
I need Julie to put a jacket on cos we're all in white.
I asked her before we came on.
You need to put a jacket on.
I haven't had time.
Is there someone...
Come on, I told you two hours ago!
Amber, I'm sorry, I've been flat out.
Well, I'll call wardrobe and we'll get something.
I made this clear two and a half hours ago.
Amber, if it's an issue, I can get on out of here.
It is an issue, go and grab a jacket.
Time now to head into the chatroom.
Joining me today is psychologist Sandy Ray in Melbourne and Julie Snook in Sydney.
Why didn't she complain about the one on the right having the same hair as her in the middle?
Perhaps it's like one of those fruit machines.
You pull a handle and three images are going across.
Due to poor sales, Ivanka Trump's clothing line is being re-branded and sold at discount stores.
What has the fashion label Chanel been criticised for this week?
Oh, the boomerang.
- Yes.
- They've made a bejewelled boomerang, or something?
- They've made a boomerang that costs £1,130.
- Wow.
Let's have a wee look at it.
Why is it dipped in chocolate?
I wonder what the returns policy is.
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
Oxfam is begging people not to take any more copies of
Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code to its charity shops as it can't shift the many copies it already has.
Here's how one Oxfam shop in Swansea illustrated the problem.
This is the sign in the window, which said,
"You could give us another Da Vinci Code
"but we would rather have your vinyl."
How did Stephen Fry describe the novel?
He said it was...
Some religious conspiracy theorists have pointed out that if you read the Da Vinci Code backwards, it's actually a bit better.
Sales of Stork margarine are decreasing as people prefer to spread butter on their toast, as you said, people think it is healthier.
According to the Guardian...
That's the last community you want to make a joke about!
SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE
Well, someone's applauding!
Time now for the missing words round which this week features as its guest publication...
Essexbirding, the journal of the Essex bird-watching society.
Many people in Essex are twitchers, but that's mainly due to cocaine.
And we start with...
- GYLES:
- Lover?
Just to help out when Philip retires?
- CARIAD:
- Are you offering, Gyles?
I don't think that's what he's retiring from.
The Queen has a top-secret Facebook account.
- CARIAD:
- No way!
One reason the Queen gets a lot of Facebook messages, is because she has two birthdays a year.
One each for her human and lizard forms.
- You and David Icke, then!
- Next...
"..felt my hands around his scrawny neck
"as I choked the living daylights out of him!"
- CARIAD:
- "..and the old editor said I could and that was fine."
Pretty much.
The answer...
In fact, the only time any editor has said yes quicker is when Kelvin MacKenzie asked, "Shall I offer my resig...?"
I don't think he offered his resignation!
Next...
- GYLES:
- "Gran accidentally dies after taking birdseed instead of aspirin?"
The answer is...
This is Valerie Johnson who accidentally drove 300 miles from England to Lanarkshire when she missed a turn-off.
She thought she was following the right motorway on the map, but it turned out to be a varicose vein.
And finally...
"..conjures up the spirit of Beelzebub and ruins reception."
"..accidentally photographs wrong couple."
Yes!
Oh, no!
Jacob Peters made an expensive mistake last weekend when he accidentally photographed the wrong couple's proposal.
Also this week, a groom got into trouble after a bee disrupted his wedding.
Let's have a look.
And to be your companion and your friend.
On this journey that we make together.
On this journey that we make together.
Oh!
There was a bee.
Straight after that she pretended to see a wasp near his balls.
So, the final scores are -
Paul and Gyles have eight points and Ian and Cariad have six!
Well done.
Blew it.
APPLAUSE
On which note, we say thank you to our panellists,
Ian Hislop, Cariad Lloyd, Paul Merton and Gyles Brandreth.
And I leave you with news that, as Labour's election campaign continues, party workers are concerned that some members may have misunderstood the phrase "touch base with the public."
After pledging that, if elected Prime Minister, he would legalise cannabis, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron denies trying out the drug for himself.
And, at a Moscow press conference, one journalist tries his luck asking Donald Trump who's America's top spy in Russia.
Goodnight.
APPLAUSE
This programme contains some strong language.
Good evening, welcome to Have I Got News For You.
I'm Frankie Boyle.
In the news this week, in central London,
BBC arts editor Will Gompertz struggles with the weight of his massive frontal lobe.
In Durham, Mike Ashley regrets getting a zero-hours worker from Sports Direct to set up his water slide.
And, having been home for almost a year, there are signs that astronaut Tim Peake is still struggling to adapt to normal life.
On Ian's team tonight is an actress and comedian who performs in a Radio Wales sketch show,
Die Laughing...is the name of the producer.
Please welcome Cariad Lloyd.
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING
APPLAUSE DROWNS SPEECH
And with Paul tonight is Gyles Brandreth, a friend of Prince Philip.
Philip says the friendship has helped him to welcome old age, as he's looking forward to forgetting who Gyles is.
Please welcome Gyles Brandreth.
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING
And we start with the biggest stories of the week.
Ian and Cariad, take a look at this.
Tim Farron, it's the manifesto.
Theresa May, that's another manifesto.
Corbyn, that's dead.
That's the last Labour voter he's talking to.
- Everyone's released their manifestos.
- It's manifesto week - like Fashion Week but less interesting.
At least the manifestos have come out, cos they were dripping out one boring policy a day.
Like a kind of diabetic advent calendar.
You see things in such positive terms, Frankie.
That is one of my more positive jokes.
Theresa May, with that fake photo that they had, the bus, a huge crowd of people, there was actually about 30 people, outside the bus that was used on the Remain campaign it's got the same number plate.
Did you know that?
- Well, excellent.
Recycling!
She's got the Ukip vote, she's got the Labour vote, she's got the Green vote, now!
- I'll give her that.
- Do manifestos have much point?
British people generally vote for leaders, don't they?
At the moment, they're going,
"Who would lead us if we are all stranded on a desert island?"
and they know that Theresa May would have us eating the wounded by nightfall.
And Corbyn would be hosting a two-hour meeting about whether or not coconuts have feelings.
Isn't the argument that a lot of Theresa May's policies are Ed Miliband's old policies?
Theresa Miliband.
Who is this appalling Marxist?
- Chairman May.
- Chairman May!
I've stood in two elections.
And...
Really, Gyles...?
I have to tell you, I've not met a member of the voting public who has ever read a manifesto.
I certainly didn't trouble myself.
Feeling that the broad brush approach is what we need, and I think that's really...
If I were Theresa May,
I would not have bothered with this.
She's got a very good "strong and stable government", lovely line, nobody out there ever reads the manifesto.
Gyles, you went round a few doors, knocked on them, and, quite rightly, the people pretended not to be in.
Including, sadly, your own house.
I would put it to you, Gyles, saying "strong and stable" over and over again isn't a strong and stable thing to do.
So, you know...
APPLAUSE
I'm sure you watched the build-up to the Anthony Joshua-Klitschko fight.
Watched it?
I lived it!
He was in one of the supporting bouts.
They were incredibly eloquent in the build-up to that fight.
It wasn't like a normal fight, they didn't trash talk each other, they were both very articulate guys.
That's a better quality of debate than we've had in the election.
I mean, you, then, obviously, would have enjoyed the election when we had the Deputy Prime Minister hitting people in the street?
That's your kind of election, do you remember?
Remember when Labour could win an election after one of them punched a member of the public?
!
LAUGHTER
This is why, really, a manifesto is not necessary, because the odds seem to be in Mrs May's favour.
She also has that lovely husband.
So they're a marvellous double act.
She has a lovely husband?
So why does she keep bringing out this one, then?
Why is she doing so well, May?
Have you seen the opposition, Frankie?
I don't think anybody has.
Theresa May looks like if the colour grey didn't care if you lived or died.
APPLAUSE
Again, I think she's trying to extend her appeal beyond... you.
OK, there was bad news and good news for the elderly needing care
- in their own home.
- Oh, yeah.
- What was it?
- CARIAD:
- The value of your house will now be taken into account... when it comes to working out whether you deserve... whether you can be eligible for social care.
- GYLES:
- You can keep £100,000 worth of your house.
What house is worth...
Especially in London, literally, that is a shed.
Like...
This programme goes out to other regions.
- GYLES:
- The essence of it is social care will be paid somehow, and it's going to be paid for by your house, in the long term.
You and your partner can live in the house while you're alive, but the moment you are dead, out, out!
And let's sell the house and bring the money in, that's the essence of it.
Is it another of those policies that presumably are going to really worry some of the papers who'd like to support Mrs May, it's an attack on old, rich people.
Which, on the whole...
This is why we should have stuck with strong and stable.
..they vote Conservative.
Sorry, Gyles, we can't both talk together.
No, no...
It's a coalition of chaos.
- I'm simply trying to talk over you.
- Oh.
Right!
Sensible candidates spend a lot of time in the old folks home, because there the people are, waiting to meet you, lined up against the wall, gazing in the same direction...
LAUGHTER
And you come with a local photographer, you come after lunch, they're dozing fitfully, you position yourself halfway down the line.
When the photographer is ready, you go...
They wake up, eyes open.
Photograph is taken.
There you are, you've visited the old people.
Broad brush.
Strong and stable government.
Fingers on buzzers.
Let's see if you can tell me what revealing answers Theresa May gave to a series of quickfire questions put to her by the Sunday Times.
Question was Sherlock or Midsomer Murders?
- BELL
- She likes both.
"I've watched both."
She's not stupid, you know.
Broadchurch or Line Of Duty?
BELL
Both.
Neither.
"I haven't watched either." Merkel or Macron?
BELL
Both, "I'm looking forward to working with them."
Almost exactly that.
I could be a politician, it's incredibly easy.
I mean, even Gyles did it...
The Daily Telegraph made a similar attempt to make her appear human and normal, by asking her which Harry Potter character she most resembled.
BUZZER
She has read, she claims, all the Harry Potter books.
I don't know if she's seen the movies, but she wouldn't be drawn on which one she wanted to be...
- CARIAD:
- She's Malfoy and she knows it.
She's not Malfoy.
Those are the posh boys she's just replaced.
She's maybe Thatcher's final horcrux.
- I'd watch that.
- What she replied was...
I'm sure she does read them - over a Tannoy into a dungeon.
Theresa May is sticking to her pledge to reduce immigration to below 100,000.
Why is this surprising?
BUZZER
It's surprising because the pledge has been made twice before and has been not successful before.
And it's almost impossible to achieve and do we really want to achieve it anyway, because the country would grind to a halt if we didn't have people from overseas to do all the jobs we don't want to do.
You really HAVEN'T read the Tory manifesto!
It's tens of thousands, it's meant to be down to.
- CARIAD:
- Which isn't possible.
- Not hundreds.
Below 100,000 was her target she failed to meet six times when she was Home Secretary.
The Evening Standard described her decision as...
That's pretty good, coming from Osborne!
How did Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry liven up the Andrew Marr Show?
BELL Let's have a look.
There's an election on and people need to make decisions...
You received them...
You've just said, for example, that I want to negotiate the future of the Falklands.
That is bollocks.
It was like the way Les Dawson used to do it.
"Bollocks."
Unite boss Len McCluskey had some encouraging words for Jeremy Corbyn, what were they?
BUZZER
He said, we haven't got a chance.
He said, we have 200 seats left, that'll be it, we won't win, we've got no chance at all.
He said 200 seats would be Labour's worst result since 1935, and that would be regarded as a success for Jeremy Corbyn.
But then he said he had changed his mind and became much more optimistic now that he had seen the manifesto.
Although it turns out the previous conversation happened after the manifesto had been published.
This is the mistake, you see, politicians make - saying anything at all.
You seem to be saying "don't say anything" at incredible length.
APPLAUSE
There is a reason for that...
There is a reason for that.
The last time I appeared on the show,
I didn't actually appear in the 30-minute version at all.
So I thought this time, I would chip in now and again and hope...
Every time it cut to Gyles, they would just show a picture of tropical fish.
What did Diane Abbott opt to do when the time came for her weekly display of incompetence?
BUZZER
- Is this when she walked into the wall?
- Yes, she did.
After concluding her speech at the Police Federation's annual conference, she made her exit while we look here.
Diane Abbott.
Thank you very much indeed.
LAUGHTER
- GYLES:
- Aw.
I have...a genuine sympathy with her.
She is my sort of politician.
She can't remember numbers...
- What, you mean...?
- ..she walks into brick walls...
It is slightly unfair, isn't it?
Diane Abbott makes a mistake about police numbers, completely hopeless, can't remember it, meant to be Shadow Home Secretary.
Theresa May was Home Secretary, said she would bring immigration down to the tens of thousands and never did, for years.
And now it's 300,000.
I mean, that's 300,000 as opposed to 10,000.
It's a pretty major mess-up with figures.
And she has now said, I may have never done before, but now, I am going to do it.
The aspiration continues.
- Yes, believe me.
- Absolutely.
This is why these manifestos...
We are just proving it, time and again.
Don't get bogged down in the figures.
Broad brush, that's what we want.
What was wrong with the design of Labour candidate Roger Godsiff's campaign leaflet?
Did he misspell the constituency, or his own name?
- It was beyond that.
- Beyond that?
- Shall we have a wee look?
"Unwanted, unnecessary and opportunistic."
You asked for honesty from your politicians.
Anything else catch your eye in the various manifestos?
They're full of good ideas - unlike Gyles, I thought they were terrific.
They're a lot of the same ideas.
This is cos we're all now, broadly speaking, in the middle ground.
Little Tim Farron, looking like Daddy Woodentop.
He's allowing us to get high on the weed, that's lovely.
- CARIAD:
- Somebody make a gif of that immediately -
Gyles Brandreth going "high on the weed."
I've kind of got addicted to watching Tim Farron.
He's incredible.
He's like a sort of trendy vicar.
"OK, we're having a meeting at the youth club tomorrow,
"we're going to have a workshop on how to act normal around gays."
Did anyone see the BBC's Ben Brown cup a woman's breast while talking to Norman Smith on Tuesday?
- No.
- Let's have a look.
Already, there's some uncertainty about what he was saying on benefits.
- WOMAN:
- Absolutely fantastic.
Just give us one second.
Jeremy Corbyn was asked whether he would end the freeze...
And the BBC has spent years trying to get away from this kind of thing.
- This is the...
- Can I say, this is...?
- No.
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
This is the ongoing election campaign.
Revealing that she's a diabetic,
Theresa May has admitted she injects five times a day.
She really is going for that Scottish vote, isn't she?
As a father, I'll tell you what's a vote winner - cutting paternity leave.
Paul and Gyles, take a look at this, please.
Yes, this is a hospital...
The computer's going down, he's very angry about it.
There is the evil villain that's been making it all happen, somebody who can't afford their electricity bill.
- So, hackers.
Anonymous hackers.
- It's the hackers.
- Are they anonymous?
I don't know where they're from.
We do know where they're from.
They are from North Korea.
- It turns out.
- Has that been proven?
- Not totally proven.
But they're not going to sue me, so...
I think it probably is North Korea, there is something...
LAUGHTER
Something in the code, when it was un-hacked, indicated it might have been from North Korea.
- CARIAD:
- Gyles, you know way too much about this.
I think you were involved.
- GYLES:
- Only because I did chair the Cyber Security Awards, quite recently.
I can't tell you where, or when...
Is that security or Alzheimer's?
Do you know what the virus was called?
It was called WannaCry.
It demands money before you can get your computer files back.
It was all in BRIT-coins as well.
- Bitcoins.
- Bitcoins.
No, no, we've left the European market.
Britcoins!
There's been a sort of failure of the government, here, hasn't there?
They were warned at least three years ago that XP needed updating.
But the trouble with the NHS, it spent a lot of money on IT already - about 12 billion - for a system that didn't work, so essentially it doesn't have any money left, so they didn't pay for the update.
This, what happened to the NHS computers, happened in lots of countries to many, computer systems.
But didn't it only happen because we've not upgraded the security properly, we've been running the NHS on Windows XP so people have probably been told that they're dying by a helpful paperclip.
I like the idea that as a hacker, you would target, for a ransom, the NHS.
One of the few world organisations you know doesn't have any money.
Probably given Jeremy Hunt some ideas about how to get money out of it!
What must it be like being Jeremy Hunt at the moment?
Imagine he goes into hospital, he'd be the first person to have a sprained wrist treated anally.
"Sorry, Mr Hunt, this is going to involve a bit of a run-up."
"Luckily, our computers are down,
"so there's no record of what's about to happen to you."
This bit of malware was stolen from the American National Security Association.
Which is a misnomer!
I think President Trump gave it away.
As a gesture of goodwill towards the...
- Russians.
- ..
North Koreans.
But a young man, a 20-year-old, managed to solve it all by chance.
Yes.
Do you know who he was and what happened?
I do, but I'm not able to divulge that to you.
Well, he is a 22-year-old reclusive IT consultant called Marcus, who lives in Devon.
Do you know how he managed to disarm the sophisticated...?
Yes, he bought something using his own computer, actually, from Amazon, for £25, and inserted this programme and somehow by chance, it solved everything.
Which is perhaps worrying, because as a result of this, the North Korean rockets may take off...
And the world may come to an end.
So I'm really quite worried about this story.
We have become too reliant on these computers.
It's rather frightening.
If you are in an aeroplane and suddenly the computer is hacked, it might fall out of the sky.
You would be disappointed, wouldn't you?
Very!
Depends how far you have to walk to the airport.
Marcus Hutchins, the 22-year-old IT expert who still lives with his mum, has said he fears retribution and is...
What life?
Does anyone know what the Russians have said about it?
CARIAD SPEAKS RUSSIAN-SOUNDING GIBBERISH
Exactly that.
They're claiming it's not them cos the Russian Interior Ministry was targeted.
- GYLES:
- That was the decoy.
You're so clever, Gyles.
These are just things I picked up at the Cyber Security Conference.
The Russians have said...
Who else has been hacked this week?
- The Europeans...
- Everyone's been hacked - virtually everybody outside of North Korea has been hacked.
Renault.
One of the big stories is they hacked Disney.
They've demanded a ransom.
Disney have said...
..said the makers of Pirates Of The Caribbean 5.
Some technical people have a conspiracy theory idea about who might be behind the attack.
- CARIAD:
- Is it North Korea, Gyles?
- GYLES:
- It is North Korea.
No, get this.
Cyber security firms.
- CARIAD:
- Uh-oh!
- What, in order to make people upgrade their systems?
- Yes, yes.
Several global companies that provide internet security to large clients have seen their shares rocket in the last few days, some by as much as 8%.
This may explain why I was paid in bitcoins.
This is the NHS computer-hacking crisis.
It's the biggest failure for the NHS since records began... at three o'clock yesterday.
Nine NHS trusts were affected.
Records were lost and people may have to wait six weeks to see a doctor.
Amber Rudd said...
So, at the end of round, two points each!
And so to Round 2 and a welcome return to the Jigsaw of News.
Fingers on the buzzer, teams.
BUZZER
Is it, instead of her trying to understand the dog, is the dog understanding her?
Is that what's going on?
This is the news that a Hungarian university has proved that humans can understand what dogs are saying.
- CARIAD:
- Yes.
It's well known, we have always been able to understand what dogs say.
That is why they are our best friend.
Well, some people got a grant and they proved it.
We can find out by seeing if we can identify some dog emotions.
Shall we have a quick go?
- Woof-woof?
- How do you think...?
How do you think this dog is feeling?
DEEP GROWL
That's a motorbike!
Sounds aggressive.
- GYLES:
- I think it's hungry.
- CARIAD:
- I think it's hungry.
- I think it is snoring.
- Or it has got acid reflux?
I'm going to give Gyles a point, because it is a dog protecting his food.
Oh!
- Mm!
- The next one - this is a dog called Bruce.
GROWLING
That's playing.
- Oh!
- That's like, "Have a game.
"Come on." Or, "Give me back that ball."
He's moving from SNP to Labour.
- He's not playing
- Bruce is angry...
CARIAD:
- Oh, no!
..and you've just invited him to play with your face.
In other news, what's so special...
- "In other news"?
!
- Well...
It's be a desperate week where that qualified as news.
Moving on...!
- Yeah, sorry.
- Moving on to even more important animal-related news...
- Excellent.
- Great, animal news!
What's so special about Omar the cat?
Biggest cat in the world.
Longest, tallest.
- Oh, yeah!
- He's the longest!
- He's the world's longest cat, measuring 3' 11".
- There we are.
- CARIAD:
- Bloody hell.
- GYLES:
- Literally pussy galore.
And lastly, this is Jack.
Jack the cat.
What's wrong with him?
- GYLES:
- I remember this, but I don't.
- Ah.
- CARIAD:
- I think that's called not remembering, Gyles.
That'd be a great title for an autobiography.
The answer is, he has an incredibly deep voice.
- Oh!
- Have a listen.
DEEP MEWING
It's real!
- No way.
- This is the news that humans can understand what dogs are saying.
If your dog gives a low, insistent growl, that means it needs some attention - or, if you're in Korea, it needs another half hour at gas mark six.
All dogs want is balls to chase, balls to lick and bums to smell.
They're the animal equivalent of John Terry.
Fingers on the buzzers, teams.
BUZZER
Is this President, soon-to-be-Mr, Trump?
Once again, every time he does something, he just makes things worse for himself.
They're now relieved he's going abroad for a couple of weeks, just to take the pressure off him being a fucking idiot.
APPLAUSE
- What do you think, Gyles?
- Well...
At first, I loved him
- I thought the idea...
- What did you love about him?
- I loved the idea that Donald Duck and Woody Woodpecker had a lovechild...
Don't tell me - you liked his manifesto, did you?
Broad brush
- I liked...
Well, he WAS broad brush, and he got in, didn't he?
If, as a result of his presidency, the world does indeed end, won't it be marvellous to think it happened in our time?
Are they even giving him intelligence briefings any more, or are they just reading out episodes of Homeland or something?
By all accounts, he has a very short attention span, so, in each paragraph, they actually put his name in order to arrest his eye...
- CARIAD:
- Yeah.
In every paragraph of the briefing, they say, "..and Mr Trump," or, "President Trump,"
and he goes, "Oh, what are they saying about me now?"
So, he's sort of following what they...
He seems to be obsessed with himself.
- Like a budgerigar pecking a mirror.
- Yeah.
He might change what the word "presidential" means.
Like, in a few years, you'll be going,
"My uncle fell over and banged his head on a kerb.
"He's been rendered completely presidential."
He dismissed the head of the FBI this week.
- CARIAD:
- James Comey?
- GYLES:
- Mr Comey was dismissed.
- Comey over.
- Because he was...
Investigating his connections with Russia.
And now there's an enquiry - who's been put in charge of the enquiry?
- They've got a special prosecutor.
- A former head of the FBI.
When you open up that special prosecutor, there'll be another little special prosecutor, there'll be another...
Eventually there will be a little bloke saying, "Did you do it?"
- CARIAD:
- Robert Mueller?
Robert Mueller who was a former FBI director.
James Comey's done something to get his revenge on Trump.
- Any ideas?
- He has produced his memo.
- He kept a memorandum.
- Yes, he took notes, didn't he?
After Trump tweeted that he had kept - or suggested he might have kept a recording of the dinner that took place in February.
Comey then came back to say, "Well, I kept a memorandum."
And he said, "Will you drop the Russian stuff?"
So, basically, he accused him of literally trying to interfere in the process of justice - and the Americans don't like that very much.
So, it's all going wrong.
- CARIAD:
- The best bit was Putin, who was like, "If you want the transcript, we've got one."
Two weeks before this leaked memo was written, what had Trump asked James Comey to do, at a dinner?
- Was it stop investigating?
- Just drop the investigation.
He asked Comey to...
- Oh!
- Like an actual mafia boss.
Trump has denied this, and threatened Comey in a tweet, which said...
How did Trump's administration respond to Comey's leak?
With confusion.
With incredible confusion.
According to the online news website Daily Beast, one official said...
While another senior official said...
What else did Donald Trump do this week?
He decided, literally in the middle of a meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister, that he would...
He'd seen some stuff that had been given to him by some people, came from the Israelis, apparently - he just passed it on.
That's to the Russians!
And then he goes around saying,
"Why did people accuse me of being too close to the Russians?"
I don't know, Donald, I can't imagine!
Trump defended his actions by making this speech.
Look at the way I've been treated lately.
Especially by the media.
No politician in history... ..and I say this with great surety, has been treated worse or more unfairly.
You can't let them get you down.
- Oh, God!
- When he says no-one's been treated this badly, does he mean psychiatrically?
Did he use the word "surety?"
Yes.
"With surety, with surety."
It is terrifying, isn't it?
- CARIAD:
- I thought he was brilliant, a minute ago!
- GYLES:
- You thought he was brilliant?
- CARIAD:
- No, you said that, Gyles!
I never said he was brilliant!
I think the man is totally terrifying.
I thought it was amusing, cos I'm a little bit of an anarchist,
I thought...
I-I-I was quite amused by the thought of the world ending, but now, to end at the hands of this fool, would be ghastly.
- You've revised your opinion.
- I've revised my opinion.
Surely if you were recruiting a spy,
Trump would be underneath Hulk Hogan.
I wouldn't believe any conspiracy theory at all.
I think he is exactly what he is revealing himself to be.
You just told us North Korea had hacked the NHS!
Oh, no!
Don't reintroduce the subject!
- There is that.
- Please be quiet.
- He also...
- How did...?
- Excuse me.
- No.
No.
- He also...
Gyles.
Gyles, when people hear your name, they often think, "Jumpers"...
- Ah!
- ..but I'm sure people who meet you must take their lives in other ways, as well.
LAUGHTER
This is the news that Donald Trump is now at war with intelligence in two ways.
Mr Trump met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
At the end of the meeting, he said he had to get back to running the country, but thanked Trump for coming along.
Donald Trump said recently that every time he picks a phone up, he feels like someone is listening.
That's what a phone is, Donald!
APPLAUSE
Donald Trump is increasingly unpopular with the CIA, where his Secret Service codename is JFK 2.
Fingers on buzzers, teams.
- BELL
- Football.
LAUGHTER
- Who are they?
- CARIAD:
- They're men.
They're men with a cup.
So, they have done something well.
They're a very special type of new football club.
- GYLES:
- Oh - they're wearing green costumes.
- CARIAD:
- Costumes!
He's worse than me!
- The green's a clue.
GYLES:
- The green IS a clue.
It's an environmentally friendly football club.
- Yes!
Yes indeed.
- Thank you.
- This is the news...
- Forest Green Rovers or whatever?
- Yeah, Forest Green Rovers.
- Yes.
- The first vegan football club.
- Vegan?
- They were promoted on Sunday for the first time in their history.
Here's how the radio commentator described it.
'Let me tell you this
- Cheltenham, Swindon, Newport, 'you're going to eat humus at The New Lawn next season, 'because Forest Green Rovers are in the Football League!
'
The chairman has used his money - he's an entrepreneur - to create this club that's based on green energy, they've got solar panels, and he's forcing the team to have a vegan diet.
Right.
And they're winning?
Well, they've just been promoted.
They'll probably start losing quite heavily.
Since going vegan, the players have had zero injuries - but how were some of the players and staff caught out last year?
Eating pork scratchings after hours?
Very close.
Here they are!
Oh, no!
The staff at Greggs didn't help the situation by telling the local paper...
- Aww.
- How did the club's manager, Mark Cooper, explain the small crowds that come to watch Forest Green?
Vegans are tired.
- It's hard.
- He told the BBC...
This is Forest Green Rovers, the first vegan football club, thanks to their eco-friendly chairman, Dale Vince, according to the BBC, the club has...
In fact, if they put any more shit on the pitch, they'll qualify for the Scottish Premiership.
As a vegan team, Forest Green Rovers are looking forward to their derby with archrivals KFC.
Which means, at the end of this round, it's... 5 points to Paul and Gyles, and 3 to Ian and Cariad.
APPLAUSE
Time now for the Odd One Out Round.
Your four are... a quilted jacket in old gold, the Da Vinci Code,
Stork margarine, and Ivanka Trump's fashion brand.
So
- OK, the jacket is old gold coloured,
Dan Brown, the Da Vinci Code, I don't know much about that.
Other than it was a film and a book, obviously.
Stork might have changed its colour due to some sort of manufacturing process...
Any idea about this, Gyles?
Well, colour clearly is involved, orange, possibly, is the colour, because orange is the colour of Ivanka and of the quilted jacket.
Is it something to do with not being stocked, cos Ivanka's fashion line was dropped?
And it was one of the few things
Trump was genuinely exercised about - his daughter's fashion line was dropped by one of the big department stores.
Yes, it's much more to do with that.
LAUGHTER
- GYLES:
- Stork is no longer on the market, and the other three are.
No.
Obviously quietly on the market, in one instance.
Was the Dan Brown novel dropped?
Too many people were bringing Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code
- to charity shops.
- Really?
And they just didn't need any more old copies!
And this old gold jacket...
- CARIAD:
- Has been dropped by...
Not been dropped by anyone.
Thus the odd one out.
- It is the odd one out.
- Hey!
APPLAUSE
The answer is, no-one wants to buy them, apart from a quilted jacket in old gold, which proved to be overwhelmingly popular this week.
Ria Hattam wore one to the Badminton Horse Trials only to spot at least 16 others.
She took some photos.
Let's have a look at Ria and the matching jackets.
Oh, yes!
I'm laughing, but I'm going to go and throw mine away!
This isn't the only time someone has turned up to find everyone else in the same outfit.
Did anyone see how Australian news anchor Amber Sherlock dealt with it?
Wearing the same as the breakfast person on Norwegian television.
I don't really know what that means.
Let's have a wee look at the clip.
I need Julie to put a jacket on cos we're all in white.
I asked her before we came on.
Julie, you need to put a jacket on.
I haven't had time.
Is there someone...
Come on, I told you two hours ago!
Amber, I'm sorry, I've been flat out.
- Well, I'll call wardrobe and we'll get something.
- No...
I made this clear two and a half hours ago.
- Amber, if it's an issue, I can get on out of here.
- Yeah.
- It is an issue, go and grab a jacket.
- I...
Time now to head into the chatroom, and joining me today is psychologist Sandy Ray in Melbourne and Julie Snook in Sydney.
Why didn't she complain about the one on the right having the same hair as her in the middle?
Perhaps it's like one of those fruit machines - you pull a handle, and three images... eventually settle on three whites going across.
Due to poor sales, Ivanka Trump's clothing line is being re-branded and sold at discount stores.
What has the fashion label Chanel been criticised for this week?
Oh, the boomerang.
- Yes.
- They've made a bejewelled boomerang, or something?
- They've made a boomerang that costs £1,130.
- Wow.
Let's have a wee look at it.
Why is it dipped in chocolate?
I wonder what the returns policy is.
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
Oxfam is begging people not to take any more copies of Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code to its charity shops, as it can't shift the many copies it already has.
Here's how one Oxfam shop in Swansea illustrated the problem.
This is the sign in the window, which said,
"You could give us another Da Vinci Code
"but we would rather have your vinyl."
How did Stephen Fry describe the novel?
He said it was...
Some religious conspiracy theorists have pointed out that if you read the Da Vinci Code backwards, it's actually a bit better.
Sales of Stork margarine are decreasing as people prefer to spread butter on their toast, as you said, people think it is healthier.
According to the Guardian...
That's the last community you want to make a joke about!
SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE
Well, someone's applauding!
Which means, at the end of this round, it's 5 points to Paul and Gyles and 6 to Ian and Cariad.
- APPLAUSE
- Oh, finally!
- Yes!
Time now for the Missing Words Round, which this week features as its guest publication...
Essex Birding, the journal of the Essex bird-watching society.
Many people in Essex are twitchers, but that's mainly due to cocaine.
And we start with...
- GYLES:
- Lover?
Just to help out when Philip retires?
- CARIAD:
- Are you offering, Gyles?
I don't think that's what he's retiring from.
The Queen has a top-secret Facebook account.
- CARIAD:
- No way!
One reason the Queen gets lots of Facebook messages, is because she has two birthdays a year.
One each for her human and lizard forms.
- You and David Icke, then!
- Next...
Marries a bloke called Burr Ito.
- That's very close.
- It can't be!
- It can't be, surely!
- GYLES:
- Gets married as a burrito, to somebody also dressed as a burrito.
- And they breed burritos.
- I'm going to give Paul the point, because she... ..because she had married it.
Here she is.
She married a burrito.
Sour cream, guacamole and salsa are just three things doctors have tried to hide her medication in.
Next...
"..felt my hands around his scrawny neck
"as I choked the living daylights out of him!"
- CARIAD:
- "..and the old editor said I could and that was fine."
Pretty much.
The answer...
In fact, the only time any editor has said yes quicker is when Kelvin MacKenzie asked, "Shall I offer my resig...?"
- I don't think he offered his resignation!
- No.
Next...
- GYLES:
- "Gran accidentally dies
"after taking birdseed instead of aspirin?"
The answer is...
This is Valerie Johnson, who accidentally drove 300 miles from England to Lanarkshire when she missed a turn-off.
She thought she was following the right motorway on the map, but it turned out to be a varicose vein.
Next...
- GYLES:
- Whether to swipe to the left or right on Tinder.
It's actually...
Prince Philip asked Mary Berry's advice on stuffing small birds, and then sat politely as she got completely the wrong end of the stick and gave him advice on cooking.
Next...
Filling out the appropriate forms and being interviewed by the council.
The answer is...
- That was quite a difficult ask, wasn't it?
- Yeah, that was.
- Yeah.
A little bit tricky, yeah.
Those ospreys will grow up not knowing who their real parents are - much like the rest of Essex.
And finally...
"..conjures up the spirit of Beelzebub and ruins reception."
- GYLES:
- "..accidentally photographs wrong couple."
Yes!
Oh, no!
Jacob Peters made an expensive mistake last weekend when he accidentally photographed the wrong couple's proposal.
Also this week, a groom got into trouble after a bee disrupted his wedding.
Let's have a look.
..and to be your companion and your friend.
On this journey that we make together.
On this journey that we make together.
Oh!
There was a bee.
Straight after that she pretended to see a wasp near his balls.
So, the final scores are -
Paul and Gyles have 8 points and Ian and Cariad have 6!
Well done.
Blew it.
APPLAUSE
But before we go, there's just time for the caption competition.
New editor of Horse Hound.
That's very good.
- GYLES:
- Strong and stable.
APPLAUSE
On which note, we say thank you to our panellists,
Ian Hislop, Cariad Lloyd, Paul Merton and Gyles Brandreth.
And I leave you with news that, as Labour's election campaign continues, party workers are concerned that some members may have misunderstood the phrase "touch base with the public."
After pledging that, if elected Prime Minister, he would legalise cannabis, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron denies trying out the drug for himself...
..and, at a Moscow press conference, one journalist tries his luck asking Donald Trump who's America's top spy in Russia.
Goodnight.
APPLAUSE
Hey, Sylvie will be with you in a moment, she's just...
I'd just rather not say what she's doing.
Thanks for coming.
New game.
Pitch me, go.
OK, well, we had something in the vault, an old idea.
Yeah, it's one we're really excited about it.
It is a game we've always wanted to make.
It's a racing game, set inside the human body.
Cavity Racers.
You're a blood cell...
Or an enzyme.
And you're racing along the arteries, or the main pulmonary highways, and then you get into the cavities.
Would you race to the bladder?
Oh, great idea.
Could be an expansion pack.
Bladders full of piss?
It is a bit grim.
Give me a chance to try out my real-time 3D fluid and particle rendering.
You've got a new physics engine that renders realistic piss?
I really do, yes.
Big picture - it's a satirical intravenous cart-style racing game about body fascism.
For kids of all ages.
Wow, guys.
I mean, that is a great idea.
And it sounds really commercial.
ALL:
Uh-huh.
How's it going, my whole British sarcasm thing?
Yes, you are really getting the hang of it.
Thanks, Watto,
I really appreciate that.
I don't really, I was doing it again.
Anyway, we just got back The Cap Factory projections from the third and fourth quarters, and like my best friend from high school, Tania Devon, they are not pretty.
We're going to be making some cutbacks.
Like how?
We're going to be looking at efficiencies, doing a full personnel audit, finding out what everyone in the company does.
That's a good idea because there's one bloke, Tiny Barney,
I have no idea what he does.
Who's Tiny Barney?
Including you guys.
Us?
We have to do it, too?
You mean we've got to reapply for our own jobs?
Naomi will walk you through it.
It is a form you fill out.
It's just admin.
OK, I've got somewhere to be.
No idea where.
Naomi!
"It's just admin, really.
It's just admin."
Said Chairman Mao as he released the great famine.
Now, I'm quite excited about this because I love asking questions, so if there's anything that crosses the line, just say.
Sorry, a bit anxious, look at the state of those nails.
Job title?
Officially, I am the code wrangling monkey boy.
I've got it on my card, actually.
Leon had these printed up for a bit of a joke.
First question, Leon, nice and easy, what do you do?
How do you mean?
Obviously, I know what you do.
It is obvious, but if it was not obvious, what would you say it is?
Business development, more crucially - had a vision.
I'm the big picture guy, Josh is details.
Lost in the desert, I am like,
"Let's drill for oil, make ¤1 billion."
And Josh is like, "Guys, there's sand in the picnic."
Lead designer, ideas man, head of creative.
I'm the guy who keeps the train on the tracks.
Without me, the wheels would fall off, and Watto sets his beard on fire.
Both of which are examples of things that have actually happened.
Artist in resident/office weirdo/human totem.
I'm the spirit of the place.
Keeper of the flame.
But you do coding also?
The old ones and zeros.
I don't need to, not my thing.
It's like, is Captain Birdseye an actual sailor?
I don't know, but he makes great fucking fish fingers.
So you come up with the ideas?
No, Josh is ideas, but that's the easy bit.
How would you summarise your position within the company?
I'm the brains.
I'm the brains.
And if Leon answers otherwise, he's a liar.
He said you are the details guy, and then something confusing about picnics.
He said that?
Josh says that he's the brains.
Fine, I'm the face.
Obviously, the brain controls the face.
No, no, not to this face, this face is disconnected from the brain, this face does not always do what the brain tells it to.
Like you have Bell's palsy?
Like my Nan, with the eyelid, ugh.
I mean, kind of.
I'm the back.
Not the backbone,
I'm just the flesh on the back.
Can't see me from the front, but I'm always there, just a giant dependable mound of... of back flesh.
It's more of a floating role, really.
I'm less of an employee and more like a gas that permeates the space, like radiation.
I definitely do something that you can't see what it is that I do.
Except, I don't give people cancer.
I don't do that.
Business development.
I develop the business.
Ding, ding, ding!
Sorry, but that's all we've got time for, thanks so much for playing, Leon.
No, but seriously, thanks.
I also do this.
Aw.
You can keep that if you like.
Thanks.
And I really love what you've done to the office.
Last one, bit of fun, favourite wizard in literature?
Ponder Stibbons from the Discworld universe.
Sorry, who?
Ponder Stibbons from the Discworld universe.
I'm sorry, why would you need to know that?
Don't worry, I'll just put Gandalf.
No, don't put that, it's too obvious.
Give me a minute.
Sorry, I have other people coming in.
Just give me a second.
Prospero.
PHONE RINGS Yeah, put that.
Yep.
Hi, Dad.
How's the...?
Wait, what?
What do you mean?
That was my dad on the phone, they are back from holiday two months early.
What, that boring holiday that you bought them as a passive aggressive fuck you for taking you to Disneyland too many times?
Wow, I wonder why.
I ought to go and see them.
Watto, you got some packages.
I left them on your desk.
Right.
Yeah, good, thanks.
MUSIC:
Broken Racehorse by The Blind Snake
Oh, sweet horny hell, that's good.
Watto?
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT
Yes, Ewan?
You OK in there, matey?
Uh...
Yes, thanks, I'm fine, matey.
Do I need to go and fetch Josh and Leon?
What's in the box there, mate?
Are we talking pharmaceuticals, or..?
Toby jugs.
Toby...?
Just Toby jugs.
Ah, interesting.
And can I see them or...?
Recently, I have become quite an avid collector of Toby jugs.
Didn't have you pegged as a Toby mugs kind of guy.
This is a fucking lovely piece right here.
Wow, he's a biggie, isn't he?
I just like the smell of them, you know.
Sure, I know.
I know.
Don't need to be worried about this, mate.
It's harmless, Ewan.
I'm not doing anything I shouldn't be.
So, I have been going through
Naomi's fact-finding report re-efficiencies...
Where's Josh?
Oh, he just had to pop out.
Why is there so much popping out in this office?
You know what's going to pop out pretty soon?
My semiautomatic, and I'm going to shoot the next motherfucker who pops out during office hours.
Note to self, cancel podiatrist.
I'm joking.
OK, so, energy bills are huge, you're paying way over for your server hire.
And why is there always music playing in the bathroom?
It's crazy making.
Are you aware of how many different teas you are providing for your staff?
13, one more than Google.
14, we just added Assam.
14, two more than Google.
Great, that is really impressive.
Well done.
Not really, I'm doing it again.
Watto, cut the teas, you're not a 14-tea organisation.
Ewan, I need you to lose three from coding.
What, sorry?
There's a duplication of roles.
We have coding guys in LA you can use, so I need you to fire three people.
Redundancies, you think you can handle that for me?
Absolutely not, categorically no way.
Great, Naomi get him the names.
Leon, some confusion over what it is you do exactly.
What?
How do you mean?
I made this place.
Now, we understand what you did - you raised the money, you made the sale happen - but what do you do now?
What do you do NOW?
Like, what's the last thing you actually did?
Like, now.
Like, tell me now.
Like, tell me right now.
I fixed a...
Paper jam.
Don't say paper jam.
A paper jam.
Don't say paper jam.
Casey...
Casey...
Casey, this is me.
No disrespect, they're the worker bees, that lot out there,
I am the Emperor bee.
I don't think there is such thing as an Emperor bee, though.
I can't believe this, Casey, I am basically you.
It's fine, Leon.
It's fine, really, we just need to find you a new role.
OK, so teas, firing, Leon, good.
We are all done.
Excellent.
Thank you guys so much for your time,
I really appreciate it.
I don't!
I don't, I was doing it again.
So, you just bailed on your holiday, did you?
What, too much culture for you?
Couldn't wait to come back home and watch Doc Martin and eat crumpets?
No, we had a good time.
I had arranged a very special dispensation for you both to visit the site of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon in Iraq.
But maybe we'll just cancel that, shall we?
Maybe go to the garden centre, eat a ploughman's?
Where's Mum?
In the caravan.
Why is she in the caravan?
Ask her.
KNOCKING Mum?
Hey, darling.
Why are you in the caravan?
It doesn't clean itself, does it?
What's up with your...?
What?
Let me see her teeth.
What?
Show me your teeth.
No need to see my teeth.
Show me.
Show me, Mother.
Holy shit.
What have you done?
Oh, there's a place in Prague.
Right, so you thought you'd get yourself some new teeth, did you?
A pair of massive gnashers.
With the money Leon gave me.
Did you have anything else done?
Oh, my God.
Have you got a new pair of boobies?
Jesus Christ, Josh!
No, there's nothing else.
All right?
There's just, you know, that, so...
What?
Just, you know, a little...
What?
Nothing, just...just that.
A tattoo?
!
Beats for breakfast, bass for tea.
What does that even mean?
You know, have fun.
This isn't about mildew, is it, Mum?
I'm a grown-up.
Whatever it is, I can take it.
I want some space, Josh.
I need some space away from your dad.
The travel, the trip you gave us, it...it really awakened me.
I'm having a wobble, Josh.
Thank you for your honesty, I appreciate it.
Right.
HE RETCHES
I can't fight people.
I'm a coward.
Confrontation's basically my kryptonite.
Along with pastry, lactose and brains.
I'm stressing about these teas.
I've got to lose seven teas.
Hold on.
I'm not a coder.
I'm a visionary.
You don't hire Monet to creosote your decking.
Seriously, fuck this new regime.
It's like that thing, you know - the lunatics have taken over the asylum.
Only the other way round, the authorities have taken back, regained control of the asylum.
Here you are.
Oh, here he is.
OK.
Something's happened.
Something bad with my mum and dad.
Like what?
What do you mean?
Well, she's basically living in the caravan with massive teeth, which she bought with the money you gave her, so thanks for that.
No, not Jeff and Linda, surely?
They're Fred and Wilma.
What about Monday night roast?
Are we still going to be able to go for Monday night roast?
What's going on?
I don't know, Leon.
OK, eyelid.
I don't expect any of you to see this, but my eyelid is now going twitch, twitch, twitch.
There it goes again.
So, what are they saying, Josh?
She said she's having a wobble.
She said she wants some space.
It could be an affair.
Second family.
What, like in a cellar?
We haven't got a cellar.
Garage, loft?
Is your dad OK?
You don't think he had, you know...
Jesus Christ!
How about a bit of sensitivity, guys?
A bit of mindfulness.
Apologies, Josh, for not being more mindful.
This is all my fault.
I should have just paid off the bloody mortgage.
How I going to make this better?
Josh, this is what I do.
I use my mouth and I get people talking.
I make things happen.
I'll talk to your mum and I'll fix this.
What are you doing?
Showing you that I care.
INAUDIBLE
Paula, Paula!
Hi!
Hello.
Can I have a quick word?
Yeah.
Inside the office.
Is everything OK?
Fabulous.
Listen... ..I've been thinking and, various reasons, throughout the company,
I've had to have a long think.
You OK?
I'd like to give you a bonus.
Another one.
Yes!
Yes.
I'd love a bonus.
Me, too.
Me, too.
Yes.
Amazing.
The thing is, it would be kind of a redundancy bonus.
Because we've actually kind of spent the last one, we put it towards a new flat, because...
Good for you.
Um, we need an extra bedroom.
Because...
Ah, Christ!
Cos of a baby.
A baby.
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.
No, it's wonderful.
Thank you.
It's wonderful.
I'm pretty sure it was the day you gave us the first bonus.
Was it really?
I took Mark out for dinner to celebrate and then...
Next thing you know, buff.
There you go.
Bish, bash, bosh!
I know what happens.
Yeah.
That feels sick.
Just...
Happiness.
Sure, yeah.
Cos Casey said that there are guys in LA who...
Doesn't matter.
So, another bonus!
What's it for?
Because I'm Paula.
Just general bonus attitude.
Bonus.
OK.
Great.
Lovely.
Thank you.
There you go.
That's fabulous.
5K to Gryffindor.
She's delighted.
Fucking hell.
TV ON
You seen my Snes?
We're designing a racing game.
I wanted to play Mario Kart.
Ask your mother.
Mum, have you seen my Super Nintendo?
I think we threw it away.
Of course we did.
It's only my whole entire childhood.
Why wouldn't we?
Do you know what, Dad?
I feel really bad, like somehow this is all my fault.
I feel so guilty.
It's like my act of generosity has basically wrecked your marriage.
I don't know.
I just can't help but blame myself.
Dad, Dad?
Yeah, it does look a bit like that, doesn't it?
What do you mean?
Well, we never had this problem when we went to
Disney World, did we?
We just went on the Dumbo ride and came home again.
Right, so you think it's my fault, do you?
It's someone's fault.
Maybe it's your fault, Dad?
My fault?
Maybe you're boring.
Your holiday was fucking boring, son.
Minsk Botanical Gardens?
Disney World, we never had to talk to each other.
That's what made it so great.
DOOR BELL RINGS
I heard.
Your mum texted my mum.
Didn't know the mums were still talking.
Brought gin?
Don't want to give my dad gin.
He's depressed enough as it is.
It's not for your dad, Josh.
Spent a lot of time in this caravan.
Played a lot of games.
Burned a lot of holes in the carpet.
I don't mean to shock you, Linda, but our weed intake back then was pretty high.
This caravan was basically a mobile bong.
And I know it gets pretty cold out there at night, and just in there...
Big old, lovely Jeff.
And you know Josh is worried about you.
Josh worries too much.
He's a millionaire.
Should be living.
Yeah, I tell him that that all the time.
But Jeff, right, let me give you the hard sell on Jeff.
The three USPs of Jeffrey Connors.
One, he's funny.
You remember when those trousers fell down in Brighton?
That was, that was gold.
Two, durability.
He's never not been there for me, for any of us.
He came and got me from the police station that one time.
Three, he's a sweetheart.
All right, he might not know how to always show it.
He's not exactly Captain Cuddles, but he loves us.
You know he does.
I don't know, Leon.
I...
I just feel like, what if there's more out there than doing jigsaw puzzles of Westie dogs and a pair of leggings.
Linda, listen to me.
As your surrogate second son, I've seen the lifestyle.
It's not as good as you think.
Nothing is better than Jeff.
Trust me.
Apart from maybe my helicopter.
You've got a helicopter?
It's amazing.
Where would you rather be?
Up here, or down there, curled up in front of Countryfile with lovely, lovely Jeff?
Oh, sorry, darling.
I wasn't listening.
It's amazing.
Linda, it's hollow.
Trust me, the novelty wears off really quick.
Does it, though?
OK, no.
It's basically brilliant all the time.
Look how high we are!
Oh, my God!
Leon, Leon.
I'll tell you what else I've always really wanted to do.
No, no, no.
That's a bad idea.
Oh, please, Leon.
I just need to get it out of my system.
Do you promise you'll go back to Jeff if I buy you cocaine?
Leon, I totally, totally promise.
Boom, nailed.
Take us to Colombia!
Let's go the whole hog.
Let's cut camomile and fennel.
Basically, cut all the Twinings.
Is that what you want, Ewan?
I don't thump people very often but I will thump you upside the head.
Maybe we should just cut peppermint.
Are you kidding me right now?
You know that's my only IBS-friendly hot drink option.
You cut peppermint and I will literally shit in my pants every day for ever.
God.
It's so hard.
This is just like Sophie's Choice, only if Sophie had had 14 kids.
I'm sorry.
I think I'm letting it all get on top of me.
Do you think I've got to fire these people personally?
Can't I just send him one of those bomb disposal robots, with a note saying, sorry, and some Ferrero Rocher?
DOORBELL RINGS
I'll get that.
Thinking about getting a mediator for Mum and Dad.
Either...the guy who settled Apple versus Samsung... ..or - this is a potentially stupid idea -
..Blair.
Tony?
You can get him for like half an hour.
It's like ?
100,000.
You want to get Tony Blair to keep your parents together?
It's ridiculous.
But worth a try?
Josh, I think maybe you just need to leave them to it.
Sometimes things don't work out like you think they will.
Like me and you?
Or me and Greg.
I know you hate him, Josh.
Hate is a very strong word, Abbey.
But in this case, it's entirely acceptable.
I mean, piddle puddle puddle...
Weird being back in here.
Mm.
You know, we never finished coding Vagina Miner.
That video game we started.
Abbey, I remember Vagina Miner.
Essentially, Manic Miner, but set inside the Queen's vagina.
Maybe we should... ..try and finish it again sometime.
Don't know.
Only if you wanted to.
I've got a build of it in an old laptop somewhere.
I'd like to see that build.
I'd like to show you that build.
All right.
Open!
TAPPING
Open!
Is that peaches?
If it's a small tin, it could be tuna, it could be salmon.
Probably salmon.
It's only a tin of salmon!
Yeah, it's salmon.
Just open!
And why is he hitting the can of salmon with a hammer?
Oh, God.
It's quite simple, isn't it?
All you need to do is open up...
Tin of salmon.
The electric tin opener won't work.
Dad, don't worry about it.
We'll get a new one.
Do you think she's ready to come back in the house?
It's going to be OK, Dad.
Leon's talking to her, all right?
Everything's going to be fine.
Oh!
Look at me.
I'm the MILF of Wall Street.
I needed this, Leon.
Jeff doesn't get it.
He's boring.
He never wants to do anything, ever.
I mean, that's why we fell out.
Inverness, yeah?
Stayed in the room.
Stayed in his room in Venice, playing Sudoku.
What's that about?
You're definitely going back to him?
Definitely.
Definitely do that, yeah.
Boom.
Sorted, see?
Casey thinks I don't do anything.
This is what I do.
I find unconventional solutions to unconventional problems.
That is what you do, Leon.
That is exactly.
They think I can't develop the business?
I'm not businessly-minded?
I am businessly-minded.
So businessly-minded.
I'm so businessly-minded.
So businessly-minded.
I am so businessly-minded, it hurts.
Is businessly definitely a word?
I don't know.
Is businessly a word?
No.
I should stop using it, because I am a businessman.
I am going to sit up all night and write a massive business plan and then we'll see who the big businessman is.
THEY SNIFF
HE LAUGHS
Linda, come here.
Why, what's going on?
HE SNIFFS
MUSIC:
Gonna Make My Own Money by Deap Vally
MUSIC STOPS
I've written a business plan.
Right.
The next 30 years of Idyl Hands, totally mapped out, Chinese expansion, brethren.
30-year business plan.
So who you sending it to?
Everyone.
Casey, you, Branson.
Musk.
All those pricks at Google.
What about my mum?
Yeah, she's got a copy.
No!
With my dad.
Oh, er, yeah, yeah.
That's sorted.
She's going back to him.
Oh, man.
That's huge.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's what I do.
OK, so I've set up a shell company, Field Mouse Media.
I'm not going to fire anyone.
I'm going to offer them all jobs.
Where?
At my fake company.
Field Mouse Media.
Doing what?
Making fake games.
I don't think that's going to work out, you know?
Are you all right, mate?
Yes, thanks.
What are you up to, man?
You know, this and that.
Right, there's a bear, yeah?
Everyone sees the bear.
Oh, it was a bargain all right.
Yep, this was a very, very wise investment indeed.
You've certainly moved on from the Toby jugs there, mate.
Anyway...
We should give you a hand.
No, no.
It's fine, it's fine.
Don't go in there.
That's my bedroom.
Don't go in.
Crikey!
Hello, everyone.
How does a man find sleep in here?
That's quite the inventory, Walter.
Yeah, well, you need three of everything, don't you?
One to use, one to keep, one to trade as basics.
And would you say you're addicted, mate?
No, Josh.
I wouldn't.
It's harmless.
It's just you've been acting a bit shady, you know?
Old habits.
Yeah, I found a pottery Winston Churchill in the toilet cistern.
I thought it was a bit weird.
I don't tell you lot what you can and can't spend your money on, do I?
I didn't stop you from getting that investment linked annuity, did I?
I wish you had, to be honest.
It's been a total...
And Leon, helicopter AND Ferrari?
What, am I not allowed to buy a couple of mugs and a big brown bear?
Yeah, all right.
Fair point.
We're just trying to look out for you man, that's all.
Well, you know what?
Leave me alone.
Seriously.
Get out.
Go on.
Just leave me alone.
Get out.
Go on, all three of you.
Get out.
Judging me.
Judging me and my stuff.
Unbelievable!
Mum.
Mum.
Oh, what time is it?
Reconciliation time, Mum.
No, Josh, I've been thinking...
OK, let's not dwell on that now.
Let's go inside the house, Dad's bought some Tunnock's Teacakes.
Cos I was over the city last night, in Leon's helicopter.
And I looked down and I thought, yeah, Josh is right.
The world is a big place.
You went in a helicopter?
I was opening a tin of salmon with a hammer.
Mum, Mother, what's this, Mother?
Here?
What's that, there?
Please?
What's this here, Mother, please?
Oh, let's just stay calm, all right?
Let's all just stay calm, shall we?
Oh, my God!
You're a fucking cokehead!
Did Leon do this?
Did he spike you?
Bloody hell, Linda.
Coke and helicopters?
All of a sudden, it's like I'm married to fucking Van Halen.
It's not a wobble, OK?
OK, OK, OK.
Just an indiscretion.
Just a one off.
No, Josh, no, it's more than that.
I think maybe I've started to figure out who I really am.
Yeah, new Linda, with your stupid horse teeth and your shit tattoo.
You're not helping, Dad.
I've been thinking about doing the album of jazz standards.
Oh, no.
Not the album.
Mum, I know that it must seem like life's really exciting right now.
But it isn't, not for you because you've had your life, really, haven't you?
It's actually quite selfish to start thinking about yourself.
In...
Really...
I want a divorce.
Where's Leon?
I'm going to kill him.
Oh, hey, Leon.
I'm just reading your business plan.
Oh, yeah?
How is it?
Well, I'm on page 320, so only about half way through.
But, yeah, it's interesting.
Big fonts.
Lots of caps.
Yeah, obviously it needs a bit of an edit.
I don't think I've ever seen a business plan with so many emoticons.
Emoticon?
Really?
Wow.
You can't read that many, then.
So, I'm just printing out a copy for Casey and I'm sure this is intentional, but there's quite a lot of photos of your face.
Actually, it's just the same photo, just 40 times.
That was...
Just for a bit of context, really.
You can bin them.
Bin them.
Will do, thanks.
I'll pass it along.
Finally!
OK, I'm only going to say this once.
Did you give my mum cocaine and take her up on a helicopter?
Josh, who cares how I did it?
The point is it worked.
Except I didn't, though, did it?
Because now she's asking for a divorce.
What!
?
She promised.
That's weird, isn't it?
Someone made a promise while they were high and didn't keep it.
Like the time we got stoned and said we were going to open a fucking bakery.
I still think it's an option.
I think she's just going through a difficult time.
So, you're on her side, are you?
It's not about sides, mate.
They're my mum and dad too, you know that.
They're all of our mum and dad, really.
Because you have to think about her, too, Josh, not just yourself.
She really wants to make that album.
Jesus, Leon!
You can't do anything, can you?
You're so fucking useless.
Anyway, I should go.
Mate, I...
It's Ewan.
Why are they still not fired, Ewan?
Do it now, or I unleash the fires of hell.
Don't look at me.
I need a favour, Naomi.
Bad.
Hi, Mum.
I've got a proposition for you.
It's about the album.
Greetings!
Hello, everybody.
OK, you're on your own.
Thank you, Naomi.
What is this?
I'm sorry I can't be there.
I had to nip out.
I'm currently working in an off-site capacity.
Thing is, things change, don't they?
Seasons, train timetables, the terms and conditions of the iTunes Store.
But change can sometimes be a good thing.
Hang on, are you firing us?
No!
No...
No, but if I were, I'd be offering a very generous remuneration package.
Are you in the toilet?
What!
?
No!
No, I'm in a digital rendering facility, somewhere in Dulwich.
Oh.
Paula?
Paula?
Paula!
I'm sorry!
Ewan, I know you're in there.
Come out here and fire me like a real man.
Ewan!
This is not how you treat people, Ewan.
I thought Leon was bad!
So, we thrashed it out.
And, basically...
Mum?
I'd like to move back in.
Well, I'm not sure if I want you to.
Mum?
I'd really like to give it another go.
Great!
Let's eat.
I got lunch - catered, natch.
Oh, my God, it's the Monday night roast!
Bit heavy for 11am, but who cares?
Not me.
Dig in, guys.
Dig in.
Dad.
Mum.
Mmm.
Mmm-mm!
I bet you missed this on your travels, didn't you?
Do you know what?
I can't do this.
I'm sorry, Josh, you can keep your money, but I just can't.
You paid her to come round?
Look, can we just be adults about this, please?
Because everybody knows you need an inducement to enter into a relationship, whether it's sexual, or emotional, or a cash lump sum.
No, didn't pay her.
I just said I'd help fund the album.
Oh, not the album.
Maybe get the sound engineer that worked with Il Divo.
Look, I realise I can't stay with you just because I can't cook my own sodding dinner.
It's over, Josh.
And it's going to be OK.
Honestly, this is the best thing for all of us.
Look, it's not your fault, Josh.
Probably just going to go to my room for a bit.
Everyone!
I've got something I need to say.
I'm addicted to stuff.
That's the truth.
Josh was right.
It's nonsense, I'm just addicted to stuff.
But we all are.
We're slaves to it.
We're spoiled.
We're all just a of spoiled cunts.
And not just me, but everybody.
We go out for lunch with our spelt flour wraps and our buttermilk fried chicken.
We lose our shit the minute they run out of harissa.
Since when has that been a reasonable reaction to the lack of a fairly niche condiment?
Now, apparently the suits want us to cut back on the number of free teas that we provide in that kitchen.
They want me to cut 7 out of 14 teas.
Well, I'm not going to be cutting seven teas today.
Or eight, or nine, or ten.
We are going to be bringing it back, we are going to bring it back down to one tea.
Let us all drink the same slightly disappointing brew.
For that is the British way!
Now, give me my English breakfast or give me death!
I fired them.
It was horrible.
Oh, mate.
Also, inspirational as that was, you just cut the one hot drink that doesn't make my tummy ache.
Ta.
KNOCK ON DOOR
Hey, man.
Your mum called.
I brought you this.
The SNES.
Sorry for fucking up your mum.
It's OK.
I think she was pretty fucked up already.
I can't believe it, man.
I know, man.
This is a lot slower than I remember.
Is nothing from my childhood sacred?
I got this.
What for?
I just thought I should probably figure it out, make myself useful.
You're not a coder, man.
It's not what you do.
What do I do, Josh?
Because I re-read the business plan and it's bullshit.
Some of it was written in Wingdings, Josh.
Wingdings!
OK.
Ewan's the little turtle cos he's fast and bright, but he doesn't have any clout.
Watto's the mushroom because he does a lot of mushrooms.
I'm the track cos I keep everything together.
You know what you are, man?
You're the power-ups.
You're the things that make it go quicker and knock people out of the way.
If it wasn't for you, I'd still be right here in this bedroom, broke and normal.
I'm the power-ups?
Yeah.
You know something else?
Right now, after everything that's happened, you're the most stable thing in my life.
Thanks, man.
No problem.
I'm the power-ups.
Right, let's go down the office.
I want to speak to Casey.
Actually, do you know what?
I'll see you there.
I just need to pop out for a bit.
Vagina Miner.
I thought we could pick it up where we left off.
Oh!
Hey, Leon.
Just reading your business plan.
You know, I haven't done blow since 1989.
Makes me miss it.
We're not firing anyone.
Oh, yeah.
We've already made some reductions.
Painful, but necessary.
You bought this, us, and I know you might be thinking,
"What the fuck have I bought?" I mean, you might not be, but...
OK, apparently you are.
But the fact is, it worked.
We worked.
Forget the projections, forget the burn rate, don't look down at the piece of paper.
Look up at the next thing.
Ten years, I've never known if we're going to keep the lights on in this place.
But check this out.
The point is, we shouldn't be firing good people.
We should be keeping them and backing ourselves to grow this place, hire more people.
Expand the office.
Fuck it, let's go 20 teas.
Let's tea-bag Google right here.
Bollocks.
That's what you are, Leon.
You're the bollocks of this place.
Man, it's fun to say bollocks.
That's, like, the one benefit of working here.
I knew it!
I knew you had it in you.
I just had to see it for myself.
Well, I...
I just prefer to be like a quiet figure of authority.
Keep your staff, hire them back.
This new game, I want you to head that one up.
No, Josh is lead designer.
He answers to you on this one.
Don't let him get tangled up in the weeds, hm?
All right, yeah.
Good job, Leon.
I mean that.
No sarcasm.
Man, I am really getting good at that.
So, me and Abi are going to give it another go.
Oh, yeah?
Congratulations, man.
No, I'm happy for you.
Thanks, man.
I really appreciate that.
Right, here we go.
Monday night roast is served.
Thank you, this looks amazing.
No it doesn't, it looks abject and repellent.
But I'll keep trying.
The good news, you don't have to fire anyone, they can all have their jobs back.
Great!
So, the people I just fired, they'll be back at work, will they?
Yes.
Next to me?
Yeah.
Sat next to the people I just fired?
Everyone's a winner - with the obvious exception.
CRASHING AND SCREAMING
It's all right, I'm OK.
Office dildo.
Don't mind if I do.
OK.
Nobody panic, but I think I might be addicted to smashing things.

Joon Jae.
I couldn't protect her.
In the end... because of me...
Because I could not protect her...
Will you be able to remember this story?
I promise.
Even after I am reborn, I will look for you, search for you, meet you, love you, and protect you.
I will remember for sure.
After saying that,
after promising like that,
I forgot all about it.
Even though she was reborn and searched for me, met me, and loved me,
I couldn't remember anything.
I only made her cry.
I could not
protect any of it.
Department of Neuropsychiatry
That guy was 27 years old.
He was the same age as me now.
The girl was trapped in the net.
The guy dies while trying to save her.
And the girl stabs herself with the harpoon that stabbed the guy, and died together with him.
That is ..
That's their last story.
It is a sad fate.
Why were we reborn, and why did we meet again?
For someone to be reborn, wouldn't that mean that there's a dream that hasn't been fulfilled yet?
That dream could be an unfulfilled love, or it could be an unappeased greed.
Why would an ill-fate repeat?
Out of those two, which is the real ill-fate?
Is it the fate of you and the one who is trying to harm you, or is it the fate of you and the one you love?
If you didn't love her, and if she didn't love you,
then there wouldn't have been such a tragic ending.
Your love for each other ended up killing each other.
Is there a worse fate than that?
Do you think all this will repeat?
If you stop right here and send her back to where she had originally come from, wouldn't you be able to avoid the tragic ending?
No.
The fact that everything has repeated is not a curse, but an opportunity.
An opportunity to change the ending.
Do you believe you can change fate?
There must be a reason to have remembered everything.
This time...
I will protect her.
I will protect her for sure.
The Legend of the Blue Sea
Episode 14
Where is Cheong?
Ah!
You startled me!
I said, where is she?
!
I don't know.
She went out a while ago.
I'm sure she is nearby.
Wow, when a guy gets blinded by a girl, he becomes like that.
He was totally normal before.
Heo Joon Jae, did you have a scary dream?
The scary dream... now I'm done with that.
I won't dream it anymore.
- Is there anything you'd like to do?
- Hmm?
Something you want to do.
Let's do them all.
- All of them?
- Yes, all of them.
Heo Joon Jae, then should we enjoy some empty formalities and vanity?
What?
Actually, there are three levels of love:
Romantic Love, Hot Love, and Dirty Love.
What we are trying to do is romantic love.
What's romantic love?
Well, it's like vain formalities.
Drink tea, watch movies, have meals together, plan a special event, confess love, things like that.
But all these are moving towards dirty love.
- Dirty?
- Yes, dirty love.
I am also very curious about it, but I was told that is reserved only for the experts.
She said that if we carelessly approach it, it could end in a nasty way.
So, we have to be careful.
So, we should enjoy vain formalities first.
Okay, let's do that.
What others do, let's do them all.
♫ Unusually bright sunshine ♫
♫ Warm wind embraces us ♫
♫ Walking with you in this beautiful day ♫
Say, "Ah." ♫ My heart's beating like crazy ♫
♫ You keep saying weird things ♫
♫ Asking silly questions ♫
♫ The whole world knows how I feel ♫
There you go!
♫ The whole world knows how I feel ♫
♫ How come you don't know?
♫
♫I love you, silly ♫
That's right!
We got this!
♫I love you, silly ♫
♫I'm waiting for you♫
♫You know, silly, my heart keeps on beating♫
♫My heart thump, keeps on thump♫
♫The warm wind blowing♫
♫Whispered to me it's today♫
♫I will confess my love that I was holding back♫
♫to you♫
Let's go.
♫ Near, far, wherever you are ♫
It's okay.
♫ I believe that the heart does go on ♫
♫ Once more...
You know,
I'm just saying this,
- so don't think too much about it, and answer me quickly.
- Yeah.
The man saves the woman then dies in the movie we saw earlier, you know?
- Yeah, he did.
- I mean, there's no way that would happen, but if I died like that, what would you do?
I'd follow you.
Hey!
What do you mean you'd follow me?
!
Are you crazy?
!
And you need to give it some thought before you respond.
You told me to answer right away without thinking.
But still, who answers as if they were being asked to go to the grocery store?
If you live, I have to live with you and if you die, I have to die with you.
Are you stupid?
Then what becomes of the man's death?
The man died to save the woman.
The man says that at the end, "Please listen to my request."
"Promise that you'll live on and that you won't give up."
"Live until the end, find a good person and grow old happily."
Would you do that?
If I'm not in this world, would you meet another good person and grow old happily?
Yeah.
Of course, I would do that.
You would certainly do that?
So you do the same.
If, really if, something happens to me, you live on well.
Don't give up.
Good things, pretty things, having them all.
What's going on, Heo Joon Jae?
You said you were just saying this, but what's with this serious tone?
Is something really going to happen to you?
I told you it was just "if."
Promise me.
If anything happens, you won't think any weird thoughts.
Until the end, you'll live well.
- I can't.
- Why?
It feels like if I make the promise, something bad like that will happen.
So I said "if."
What if or what not, I don't like it!
So?
- You're not going to promise me?
- No.
- You really won't?
- I'm not going to!
You're not going to hold my hand now?
You're not going to talk to me?
- Promise me.
- Are you talking about that again?
I told you I wouldn't.
Why do I need to make that kind of promise?
Don't talk to me.
I won't talk to you either.
Tae Oh, see me for a second.
What's wrong with the atmosphere between you two?
Did you fight?
- He keeps saying weird stuff!
- What weird stuff?
Like saying that if something happens to him, to live on well on my own.
- Huh?
- It's weird, isn't it?
- Why?
- It's come.
- What has come?
- He grew tired of it.
The valid period of love is 3 months.
It's been 3 months for you guys.
You need to overcome this well or it's a KTX
(EXPRESS TRAIN) headed towards your breakup.
Heo Joon Jae is not that kind of person.
Heo Joon Jae is especially that kind of person.
I've known him for 10 years, and he hasn't had a girlfriend for more than 3 months.
They all break up before then.
That's right.
Hey!
Adjust the home security to the maximum setting.
Connect a line so I can monitor any space within 100m at any time.
When it detects any break-ins from outside, make it alert me right away.
Is it because of Ma Dae Young?
Hello, doctor.
Ma Dae Young?
It's been a while.
It's been 9 months, Doctor.
Heo Joon Jae came here, didn't he?
Don't think about lying because I saw it all.
Let me do what Heo Joon Jae did.
It seems like he saw his end, and I want to see mine too.
My end.
I think I need to know that.
So I can know why my life is the way it is.
From the moment I was born,
I always thought that I was being punished.
Why my life is like this,
I've wanted to ask.
I don't know why, but I think the answer lies in that life.
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Then who was it?
Who killed them?
You probably heard it already.
Going forward,
I will be the final approving authority.
I will personally lead the investors' meetings as well.
Is Chairman Heo very ill?
There are outsiders asking.
No, he has gone on a trip to relax and recuperate.
Even after he returns, he wants to step back from the workforce.
If you have anything to tell him, you can tell me.
But there are still things that need to be reported directly to him.
Why?
Are you afraid that I'll take out or add in the middle?
Can you not trust me?
That's not it.
If you are on my father's side and cannot work under me, you can leave now.
I'll take that as no one.
Can we start the meeting?
Father.
I met with the doctor, and he said the results are good.
Stay here for a few more days and then return home and receive regular outpatient treatment.
My eyes are worsening as time passes.
It's a big problem.
Oh, but because you just had surgery for a hemorrhage, it's difficult to perform surgery for your eyes.
- For now, take your medication and just be careful not to worsen the condition.
- Okay.
Chi Hyeon,
Yes, father.
You can contact Joon Jae, right?
Of course.
Ah, as soon as you fell, I contacted him.
- You did?
- Yes.
It looks like he's busy.
I'm sure he'll come by soon.
I'll contact him again.
Okay.
Petty guy!
Narrow minded one!
He is pouting over that thing and wouldn't talk to me?
I must've been blinded by love.
I was naive then.
I lived in water all my life, and came to the land for the first time.
So, what do I know?
The only guy that I happened to meet was that
Heo Joon Jae.
So I thought he was the best.
If Seoul was far, he should have told me that.
He flew in the plane.
But, it took me 3 months and 10 days, just because of him, and I swam all the way here that I thought my coccyx was about to fall off!
Why is he asking me to make that kind of nonsensical promise?
Stop it already!
Huh?
What?
I told you to stop it.
You are cussing me out inside right now.
Heol!
How did he know?
He sure has a keen sense of what's going on.
I thought Heo Joon Jae was the only good looking guy in the world, but there are plethora of them on TV.
Does he think he is the only one who is handsome?
He has the
Prince-Syndrome and thinks everyone is attracted to him!
- Hey!
- What?
!
Ah, jeez!
Stop it already.
If it's not meant to be, just break up.
Don't go out anywhere and just stay home.
I don't want to.
I have an appointment.
Whom are you meeting?
Whom are you meeting?
See?
You can't even tell me.
That's right.
It has to be fair.
Then, you go with her, Hyung.
Why should I follow her?
I don't want to.
It's my appointment.
I don't need anyone.
Fine!
Do whatever you want.
Good job, Cheong!
He was hanging out with a "Me-mi" and he is about to become one.
What's "Mi-mi"?
Crazy Misery!
Those who are into things like obsessiveness, and confinement.
But I don't mind things like obsessiveness and confinement.
Well, I sort of like it.
Because you are like this, he is getting tired of it.
Harden your heart and go strong!
Ahjussi, I'm sorry for not coming to visit you often.
I have a lot going on these days.
Can I tell you a story that no one could believe?
A very long time ago, you were a good friend of mine, and was always on my side.
This time, you were born a bit earlier and stood by me even when I was young.
Now, whoever made you like this...
I will find them.
If it's this person, blink twice.
Do you think there is someone who is related to Ma Dae Young around you?
Joon Jae.
I was really drunk last time.
You must have been startled after receiving the call.
Saying that you will protect your mother, so protect my father, was also something you said because you were drunk?
Oh, did I say that?
I must have been really drunk.
What about father's health being bad?
Oh, he is better now.
Hey, our father gave all the work to me and went on a trip with his friends.
Also, you will know this sooner or later...
Father got his will notarized.
He left almost all his assets to me and mother.
I told him to reconsider several times.
After meeting you the last time, he must have been heartbroken.
Were you always such a friendly guy?
I will hate my father on my own.
You don't need to encourage me to hate him.
If you keep doing this, it looks like you have some ulterior motive.
What about Cheong?
Is she well?
Why would you ask that?
That's right.
I think of her time to time.
I wonder if she is doing well.
Send my greetings to her.
Why should I?
Forget it, if you don't want to.
Oh, no.
I don't know what to do!
Joon Jae, it turns out that the ajumoni at our house is your moth-
What bring you in here?
I heard you are sick.
You couldn't even go to work.
Try eating some porridge.
Oh, I got sick uselessly to make you do extra work.
What shall I do?
- Oh, it's okay.
Call me after you are done so I can take it away.
- Omo!
It's not like I don't have hands or feet.
Who would I dare to call?
After I'm done, I will clean it up myself.
Please do not mind me at all.
Alright, then.
Why are you doing this, Ji Young's aunt?
!
I wanted to do this just once.
I am sorry, but I feel a bit uncomfortable.
I am sorry.
Subtitles by The Blue Sea @ Viki
Madam, Ji Young's aunt seems very sick.
Really?
You know, she is not her normal self.
She's a bit strange.
She was never normal anyway.
-The number you have called-
Ah, Kang Seo Hee, this woman!
She is ignoring my call again!
Ha!
Seriously!
Excuse me.
Yes?
Their son...
Son?
Chairman Heo's real son?
Yes, do you know something about that son?
Why are you curious about that, Ajumma?
Just because...
The son who's taking care of all of CEO Heo's business is the son who was brought in by Kang Seo Hee.
His biological son ran out of the house 10 years ago, and no one knows where he is.
He ran out of the house?
He didn't go study overseas?
Study overseas?
I don't think so.
I heard it clearly that he ran away when he was in high school.
At that rate, if Kang Seo Hee's son receives all the inheritance, only the strangers are benefiting from his household.
Chairman Heo is not that bright.
What kind of father is he?
Why would he abandon his own son, and dedicate himself to someone else's son?
Ah, seriously.
No matter how much he is head over heels over a woman, how could he?
Ajumma.
What's the matter?
Excuse me.
I need to go somewhere.
But it's time for children to come back from school.
You need to prepare their snack.
Please go, mother-jumoni.
I will take care of the children, Unni.
I will prepare kids' snacks and take them to after school academies.
That ajumma!
Is she just doing whatever she wants because she is quitting or what?
!
Unni, please!
She must have something to take care of.
Also, how can you call her "ajumma," seriously?
!
I should call an ajumma, ajumma.
What else should I call her then?
Who calls household helpers ajumma these days?
The going trend is, "Mother/Mother-in-Law."
Auntie, the age different between that ajumma and
I are not that great for me to call her "Mother."
What's with "Mother."
"Mother" is nothing more than sharing the same meal, and sleeping under the same roof.
She prepares my meals, and even do my laundry.
I've even let Mother wash my underwear!
Oh, I'm going nuts!
Chi Hyeon, go in first.
Greet your father well.
Yes.
Are you leaving now?
I came late on purpose, to come after you left.
Are you happy?
I'm sorry.
Even though you may not believe me, I didn't do it on purpose.
Oh, really?
I believe you.
I need to believe it.
You have to raise my Joon Jae now.
I am hoping that you are a good person more than anyone else.
That's right.
I'm sure my husband told you already, but please don't show up until our Joon Jae becomes an adult.
That way he can grow accustomed to the new family.
Don't worry.
I will love and raise him more than my own son.
- Who?
- She says she is Mo Yoo Ran.
How dare she comes here?
Open it.
Oh my!
How long has it been?
Have a seat.
What would you like to drink?
Ajumma, please excuse us for a while.
Are you going to stand up and talk?
Have a seat.
Where is my Joon Jae?
Where is he?
Why are you asking me about your son?
He is your son.
What?
It looks like you came knowing that your son isn't in our house.
Why are you asking me about him?
I've never kicked him out.
He went out on his own.
Also, my husband didn't really tried to look for him.
So, what's why it came to this.
Oh, that's all it was?
I thought you two were keeping in touch, but I guess not.
You said you'd raise him well.
I was planning on.
But what can I do when he went out?
Is this why you didn't allow us to me?
To make my son yours, my husband yours, and my position yours.
Is that why?
You are really funny.
Hey!
Don't pretend to be nice.
You just gave up.
If it were me, I would not gave up.
I would not run away, leaving my son.
Just because I told you not to meet, you really don't meet him?
Are you stupid?
What?
If you aren't going to have some tea, can you leave now?
I'm really tired.
Kang Ji Yeon!
My name is Kang Seo Hee.
No, your name is Kang Ji Yeon.
My son...
I will definitely find him and bring him back where he belongs.
You, too.
I will take you back to your original position.
Yes, it's me.
Miss Cheong.
Alright!
You should watch out for cars.
Pay attention to incoming cars.
He said not to be absent minded.
Who said that?
Someone that I like.
We said we will go grocery shopping together.
Oh, that's right.
Did you wait for long?
That's okay.
This is the only schedule I have today.

I can't tell her to stay home all day long.
Trail her well, without being caught.
You!
Don't let your ears turn red!
When the stem is dried out like this, it's not fresh.
For fish, the gills need to be light pink color for it to be fresh.
These are not that fresh.
But it's not bad for buying it at the market.
I've never had fresh ones since I got here.
Where you are from must have a lot of good fish.
Did you live near the ocean?
Something like that.
You must miss it.
But there are a lot of good food here, so it's okay.
Should we have some ice cream before heading back?
Yes, I was feeling really depressed, but I feel better now that I met you.
Thanks!
What is this?
She said she has someone to meet.
Who's this ajumma?
She gets around and makes friends easily!
Here's the Ma Dae Young's psychological medical treatment report.
Have you by any chance heard of a woman named Kang Ji Yeon?
Kang Ji Yeon?
No.
Why?
She is the only woman that's involved with Ma Dae Young, but I can't find her.
Her resident registration got cancelled due to unknown residency.
We are suspecting that they had a child between them.
Then, they could still be helping him to run away, whether it's the woman or the child.
That's possible.
Hand me that information, too.
Nam Do Hyang find people better than a typical cop.
Ah, geez!
How did I get entangled with this conman?
I will take responsibility, so turn the boat.
Our Police Office Hong is a much nicer person that you'd expect.
This guy!
Are you crazy?
!
Do I look like your friend?
Jin Kyung Won
Do you know him?
Since 2009, he treated Ma Dae Young most frequently once a few months.
Jin Kyung Won
Yes, he was my patient.
You know Ma Dae Young, Doctor?
Yes.
He came occasionally and got treated.
He was suffering from anger control disorder and manic depression.
Has he come recently?
No.
He hasn't come lately.
It's here.
- Oh, you work here?
- Yes.
This is Cha Si Ah's house?
You should have double checked everything before!
What's this?
!
We almost got in big trouble!
We almost got caught!
They were like that because it was Cha Si Ah's house.
Hmm?
What is?
It's nothing.
Here you go.
Bye then.
Bye.
Noona, that's not it.
What's not it?
Whatever you think, that's not it.
Where are you going?
You really have a serious symptom!
What will you do with the picture of my house door?
You want to feel my presence even to that extent?
Hmph!
I'm going nuts, too!
My head is about to explode, just with my own problem!
The crucial fact is that there is no space for you in my heart.
It's okay not to have the space, really.
Was I too harsh?
Love is such a hassle.
Heo Joon Jae?
This is Heo Chi Hyeon.
I'm near Joon Jae's house.
Cheong.
Let me hold this for you.
Okay.
Neurology Professor Jin Kyung Won
Please go ahead and go down first.
I need to ask the professor about something else.
Hurry up.
I'm not your personal taxi.
Since it's cold, blast the heater on.
Alright.
It's my car.
I'll take care of it on my own.
Neurology Professor Jin Kyung Won
He came yesterday.
Ma Dae Young.
Why did he come?
If he doesn't take his medication, he can't control his violent nature.
He is someone who killed Dam Ryeong and Se Hwa.
He is after us even here, too.
He alsosaw the end of himself yesterday.
And said this.
- It wasn't me.
It was not me.
- What?
He didn't kill?
Then who?
He didn't tell me so I don't know, either.
I told you that.
You can't change fate that easily.
Even now, send the person back to where she belongs.
Would Ma Dae Young come back here?
I told him that I'd prepare the medicine.
He will come soon.
When he comes, can you contact me?
Sure.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't tail Cheong.
- Hurry up!
- I'm on the way.
I just ignored the traffic light twice!
What will happen if she goes around alone and meets Ma Dae
Young?
You need to take full responsibility, Officer Hong.
Why would I take that respons-
Ah, why is she not answering the phone?
Thank you.
Help yourself.
Is it "pour-eat" or "dip-eat"?
I'm talking about the sauce.
Do I pour it or dip it?
Ah. "Pour-eat, dip-eat." As for me, "dip-eat."
I'm glad.
I also prefer dip-eat, but since Heo Joon
Jae is a "pour-eat," we always fight when we eat.
How long have you lived with Joon Jae?
Three months.
Oh, three months.
Just the two of you?
No, with Heo Joon Jae's friends.
That's a relief.
What's a relief?
Oh, nothing.
Just this and that.
- Would you like some fried dumplings as well?
- Yes, sure!
Ah, sure!
Please give us some friend mandoo, too.
Sure.
Oh, Joon Jae!
- Is that yours?
- No, it's Miss Cheong's.
Thanks for carrying it for her, but you don't need to do that any more.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Heo Joon Jae, are you mad at me now?
You guys fought again?
Why do you fight everyday?
I met Heo Joon Jae's older brother today, and that's why he's like that.
Isn't that weird?
If a guy gets mad at a girl who met his family, that means he has no intention of continuing the relationship with her.
What?
You met his older brother?
How?
He came to have a meal with me.
I thought he wasn't keeping in touch with any of his family members.
I've never been introduced to them, either.
You've been introduced?
Yes.
The last, last, last time.
What's wrong?
Is it because it's been so long since I've been in the water?
What should I do?
So no one will ever be able to get through this, right?
Unless if they get someone who is a better hacker than me, they won't be able to get into our house.
Okay.
That fine.
Also, go out and stay out today.
Why?
I don't have any plans.
Hyung, you get out, too.
Don't come back until the evening.
What should I do that?
This is my house.
When the house owner tells you to do so, you do it.
Wow, he is making us pitiful again.
Where could we go in this harsh winter weather?
Since you said you are not going to work, it's so hard to even set up a meeting.
Okay.
Well, then, today, no one will come back home until the evening, right?
Get out.
Hurry!
Out!
- I need to get changed!
- Just come out.
I'm going to get changed first.
Hurry and come out.
I'll wait out there.
Until the evening, no one will come?
Aish, it's so cold and where is he telling me to go?
I was wondering what you were doing.
Are you not cold?
Why are you swimming during the winter?
What... what are you wearing?
What's on your body?
Ah, you're going to do a part-time job agian... wearing that in an aquarium...
Aigoo!
Our Cheong is so funny!
For a moment, I thought you were a merm...
Hah!
What am I saying?
I"m sorry.
I'm sorry.
I've been watching too much American drama.
It really looks like the real thing.
I'm thinking about something impossible...
Miss, where's your house?
My house is far.
There's a lot of things like this at my house.
That female patient.
Her BT was 29 degrees.
Is it true that she regained her conciousness with just one round of defibrillator?
In just one week,
- this turned into this?
- Does that make any sense?
Where'd you get this?
I worked hard to make this.
No way...
Can you give me the gown over there?
What is this?
This... what?
This... what is this?
Huh?
How...
How did it change?
Wow, there really are things like this in the world!
Wow!
What the!
Do I need to report you to some international topic news, I mean FBI or something?
Are you going to tell Heo Joon Jae?
Tell him?
Uh, I'm not sure.
After I see how you reply to my questions.
Don't come close.
So, when you go inside water, you turn into what you were before, and if you come out of the water, you grow legs?
Yeah.
Wow!
I'm going crazy!
So, the pearl?
The pearl from last time...
like how in the fairy tales... it changed from your tears?
That's right.
Cry.
Cry.
Let me see if it really turns into pearls.
It's because I'm fascinated right now.
Okay, well, you don't have to cry right now.
Let's slowly cry a lot from now on.
Wow!
This is a jackpot!
Since I replied well, you're not going to tell Heo Joon Jae, right?
Cheong!
Mermaid Cheong!
Why should we keep this a secret?
This is an amazing thing!
We are sitting on a pile of money!
I don't like a pile of money!
I like it!
What's the point of staying home?
Hey!
Let's go to a place like Las Vegas together, launch a mermaid show, and go a world tour!
Are you saying you're going to sell me off, Jo Nam Doo?
No!
I'm recommending you a job.
It's hard for a normal person to get a job these days.
Since it's me, I am not reporting you to the government agency, and am going to look into going overseas for work.
- Okay!
- Okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
- You want to handshake?
Yeah, - let's handshake.
It's not something contagious, right?
Okay, fine.
Jo Nam Doo, are you okay?
Were you swimming here?
Is it not cold in this winter?
If Heo Joon Jae also sees my real self, would he act like Jo Nam Doo?
Since I was already caught, should I have asked him first before erasing his memories?
Jo Nam Doo!
Are you not cold?
Why are you swimming during the winter?
What are you wearing?
Wanting to get a part-time?
I... you... a mermaid!
Can I touch it?
Wow, I'm going crazy!
This is amazing!
Try crying.
We are now sitting on a pile of money!
You know all of the truth, so you probably can't see me the same way as before, right?
Of course not!
To be honest, it's hard to see you in the same way as before.
Would Heo Joon Jae also be like this?
He will be worse than me!
If he sees something like this, he will run away 100%!
Then I probably should never be caught.
But it's too late, because I found out.
To be honest, I was questioning whether or not it would work since I've only done it once in the water.
But it works well outside of the water too.
What?
I'm sorry.
I'm going crazy.
You know that feeling.
When you're about to think of something, but it doesn't come out.
What should I do?
Does he remember?
Something like seeing the lottery number in your dreams and then not remembering it.
That frustration that makes you go crazy!
I erased it, but did it not erase well?
Wait!
I think I remember something.
That... in this house's swimming pool...
Cheong...!
Ow, why did you hit me?
Eat instead of being loud.
Hey, look!
Look at my toes.
I feel like my toenail is going to fall off!
But I don't remember!
How my foot became like this!
How my foot has bumped into something!
I just can't remember anything!
It's early dementia due to alcohol.
Is that so?
So watch your drinking!
Ah, put it down.
I didn't want to live, spearing poop on the wall.
How can i be like this already?
There supposed to be three bad luck this year.
Has it started already?
Synced ripped by bozxphd Subtitles by The Blue Sea @ Viki
Until when are you going to be like this?
What?
You're not talking to me or meeting my eyes or smiling.
Okay, then.
Let me ask one more time.
If something happens to me...
It's the same even if you ask a hundred times.
If something happens to you, I can't live.
Yeah, so why?
That...
My heart can only beat if you love me.
My heart in the land has a limited time.
If you leave me or leave this world, my heart beat stops.
Jung Hoon died because of that, too.
When a loved one leaves, the heart cools, hardens, and stops.
Without you, I'll be like that.
Unless if I return to the ocean, I'll probably die.
You're going to die?
What?
What did you just say?
What...?
Say it again.
What will stop, harden...
What will happen?
You hear my voice?
You said your heart will stop.
When did you start hearing it?
You said you're going to die.
When did you start hearing it?
Why are you going to die?
!
♫ Seeing with you;
Listening with you;♫
♫Breathing with you.♫
♫There's nothing to throw away.
I'm so happy.♫
♫ I want to stop by your side. ♫
♫ Everything about you ♫
♫I cannot remember ♫
♫I am ♫
There is something I need to ask you.
Is that important to you now?
Did you look for Kang Ji Yeon?
I've never done a background check that gave me such a chill.
You said you are going to quit your job.
How about my house?
You've gotten much better.
I'm going to do a birthday party at home.
Can you come?
I'll be there.
I have a good idea.
What are you talking about?
Let's do like this.
Trust me and leave it up to me.
Tomorrow at 10pm
But in the meantime, I'm running his clients.
It's an upgrade that makes your speech and mannerisms more human.
You go back to the ship and leave.
We're not leaving you behind.
I think of it as leaving me to move forward.

Ah!
You killed nyx.
...Yes.
...Why?
!
Your feelings for her were a weakness.
...I think he wants...
...Ah, you're here.
Perfect.
I need to borrow your subspace transmitter.
For what?
Well, I heard on the news that hostilities were spreading ...to the cassiar sector.
...So?
So tabor has a safe house on cassiar 4.
Is there anything of value in this house?
There might be one or...
One or two items.
So is it tabor you're worried about or his stuff?
What?
No, he was my friend.
My mentor...
Your meal ticket.
Hey, that man was like a father to me.
Deadbeat, absent, super-irritable father who I took care of for five very long years, by the way.
Might be worth it just to see what he's up to.
We'll drop out long enough for you to make the call.
Thanks.
This should be interesting.
Okay.
Don't worry.
I'll take it easy on you.
Okay?
You ready?
Sure.
Okay.
I'm gonna go ahead and say you're probably more of an intermediate than a beginner.
I trained with four before he - well, before.
- ...
Ah.
Okay.
Well, I can take over for him, if you're interested.
Yeah, I'd like that.
So, uh, where did you learn?
At the monastery where I grew up.
A monastery?
Seriously?
I was a prioress of the seventh order of chandarith, under the protection of the Abbot of daro.
Wow.
You seem surprised.
I-it's just a little hard to imagine how you go from something like that to being a bodyguard for someone like Adrian.
Fair enough.
I can see how that might come across as a little... odd.
The monks taught us martial arts to instill self-discipline, self-awareness.
For them, it was like a form of meditation, so... everyone in the order took a vow to never use what we'd learned against another human being.
Not even in self-defense.
And in the end, that's what got them killed.
What happened?
I was on a pilgrimage to a nearby shrine.
And while I was gone, some bandits broke into the temple and stole some very valuable manuscripts.
They killed everybody inside the place.
I guess they didn't wanna leave any witnesses.
That's horrible.
You know, I must've just missed them because when I got back, the bodies were still warm.
What did you do?
I tracked the bandits into the woods.
Then, I waited till nightfall,
I snuck into their camps, and I slit all of their throats while they were sleeping.
So I guess you can say I broke my vow.
Adrian?
Ambrosia... ah!
Thank god you're okay.
Wh-what's going on?
Where's tabor?
I dunno, I thought maybe he was with you.
No.
No, if he was here, I wouldn't be in this mess.
What do you mean?
......
Well, well.
If it isn't tabor's little lapdog.
And the crew of the raza.
Still slummin' it, I see?
Who the hell...
Goren, what the hell are you doing there?
Same thing I always do.
Whatever I want.
If you hurt her, I swear...
Relax.
She's fine.
...Isn't that right, honey?
And she'll continue to be fine as long as you cooperate.
If not...
Well, I think you get the idea.
All right, I'm listening.
What do you want?
Tabor recently acquired a data file.
Stolen from a ferrous military outpost.
How do you know about that?
Don't worry about how I know.
...Worry about this.
...Adrian!
You wanna see her alive again or not?
Yes, yes.
I'll do whatever you say.
Look, whoever you are, I don't know what this is about, but if you hurt that woman...
You mind your own business if you know what's good for ya!
You're threatening me?
I'll do more than threaten.
Adrian!
Bring me the file.
Come alone.
If you try anything I'll kill you all.
So what's this all about?
Tabor's girlfriend's been kidnapped.
Tabor has a girlfriend?
That's what I said.
He didn't deserve her.
He took her for granted, and now look what's happened.
You knew she was there, didn't you?
She's the one you're worried about.
Here's your chance.
What do you mean?
You ride in there on your white horse, you save the day.
Tabor's outta the picture.
...You get the girl.
...Seriously?
...
- Hmm.
- ...
It's not like that.
I just want her to be safe.
Oh.
You really think that could work?
...Is that...
...seriously?
What do you know about this guy who took her?
His name's goren.
He's a business rival.
He's been poaching our clients for years, but he's never done anything like this before.
What kind of back-ups he got?
Couple thugs.
But nothing you guys can't handle.
Whoa.
I said, " you ride in there on your white horse."
Not us.
I'll pay you.
Do you have the money?
Okay, technically, I'd owe you.
Come... come on!
It'll be easy.
I-i just need back-up to make sure he honors the deal.
What does he want?
A data file, which is a little weird because tabor said it wasn't important.
What's on the file?
Really not much.
I mean, just some blank requisition forms and a set of coordinates for something called project Phoenix.
Whoa.
Phoenix?
Are you sure about that?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Why?
Yeah, why?
Truffault told me about it.
Mikkei intelligence has been investigating unconfirmed reports that ferrous is building an entire new fleet.
Almost a hundred ships, cruisers, destroyers...
That's a lot of firepower.
Enough to ensure total victory.
The codename for this shipyard is "Phoenix."
If it's true, every one of ferrous' enemies will pay big for those coordinates.
Even if it wasn't true, they'd probably pay just to be sure.
Hmm.
You really think it could be that valuable?
This isn't just about money.
This could turn the tide of the war.
Give us the file.
We'll deal with the kidnapping, and your friend'll be safe...
I promise.
Well, to be honest, she's really more of an acquaintance.
Seriously?
Okay, fine.
If you promise to get her out of there,
I'll give you the file.
Great.
There's just...
One small problem.
All that crap you brought with you.
You didn't have room for one little data file?
I didn't know it was that important.
If tabor knew, he never told me.
How do you know he didn't just take it with him when he left?
Well, he was paranoid about keeping stolen goods in his room, so he made me hold it for him.
It should still be on my hard drive.
What's the latest report on regulus 12?
Scanning.
According to gnn, novina corp.
Occupied regulus 12 for a number of days, but were forced to abandon the station when their ships were required elsewhere.
See?
Abandoned.
Now this should be a walk in the park.
These figures from the nakana asteroid field are disappointing.
Tarium production is down 20%.
It's the miners.
They're demanding better working conditions.
There's talk of a work stoppage.
We're at war.
That's treason.
Have you ever been to the tarium mines, general?
Everyone has to make sacrifices.
And what sacrifices have you made today?
A little less wine with your lunch, perhaps?
Forgive the intrusion, emperor.
It's no intrusion.
I have asked han-shireikan to return from the front and rejoin the council.
I only wish my return brought better news.
General caius is dead.
His fleet is scattered.
The temiken system will fall to our enemies within the week.
Welcome back to regulus 12.
Oh, shit.
So much for a walk in the park.
What?
This isn't my fault.
She said the place was abandoned, not destroyed.
Evidently, when novina was forced to leave the station, they decided to scuttle it.
Seems a little petty, don't you think?
That's not the point.
This is a dead end.
That file is gone.
Not necessarily.
What're you talking about?
Tabor liked to back up his files and store them in a secure facility on taliphus 8.
Taliphus 8 is... is located deep in ferrous-controlled territory.
Of course it is.
Shuttle us in, and I'll gain access using my station ID.
Tabor used to send me all the time.
The head of security was practically on his payroll.
... "
- Us"?
- ...
Hmm?
Hmm?
You said, "shuttle us in."
Right.
Yeah.
Five's gonna have to come with.
I can get into the storage unit, but I'm going to need someone to hack in so I can access the safety deposit box, and from what I understand, she does that sort of thing?
...
- Right?
- ...
Thought you said tabor sent you there all the time.
He did.
With a new code every time.
Seriously.
Nothing to worry about.
...It'll...
...be a walk in the park?
More of a light jog.
Need you to keep an eye on him.
Make sure he doesn't screw up, or try to work some sort of side angle.
You really think he'd try to double-cross us?
He learned from tabor, didn't he?
I should be coming with you.
You'd just be waiting in the docking bay.
There's no point.
As a precaution.
Look, I'm tired of standing by and letting everyone take care of me.
I wanna do this, okay?
...
- Okay.
- ...
Thank you.
Besides, I don't think the others trust you yet.
Oh, it's me they don't trust?
Nah.
It's your manner.
It puts people off.
You should try smiling more.
No warships in the area.
Marauder, you're good to go.
Nemec, old buddy.
It's been a while.
Adrian.
Adrian's friend.
What?
What the hell?
You're under arrest.
You can't afford to hesitate.
You have to send reinforcements to the temiken system immediately.
...It's not that simple...
...It's necessary!
I don't have the ships!
Then find them.
And weaken my position elsewhere?
That is exactly what our enemies are hoping for.
Temiken is the birthplace of ishida, the original capital of the empire, and it's still the spiritual home of our people.
It is exposed.
It requires too many resources to defend, and it has no strategic value!
There's more to winning wars than strategy.
You have to win the people.
The people obey.
Because they fear you.
And that's fine in peacetime when all you need for them to do is follow the rules and pay their taxes.
But now, you're asking them to make sacrifices.
For you.
For the empire.
You are the empire now.
Give them something to believe in.
Inspire them.
And they will follow you to the ends of the galaxy.
What the hell is this?
I thought we had an arrangement.
We did, but your boss has fallen behind on his payments.
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.
Yeah, it is.
What with the war and things being crazy...
And you're here with the cash to make things right?
We-well, not exactly.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna level with you.
Tabor's gone, and he cleared out all his accounts before he left.
Hmm.
Then you got a problem.
I have friends in the intelligence division, and I know they know tabor was working with the crew of the raza, and rumor has it, you're running the business now.
I've got some very interesting prospects lined up.
I just need a little time.
I tell you what.
I got a better idea.
You wanna pay off the debt?
Tell me about the raza.
Uh, I-i don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, Adrian...
Central wants these people bad.
As soon as your ID popped up, I had to call it in.
Cruiser's already on its way.
This is taking too long.
Something's wrong.
Simple.
Either he screwed up or he screwed us over.
Marauder, come in.
Go ahead.
I just intercepted a communication from the station.
They filed an arrest report for Adrian maro.
...Screwed up.
...What about five?
There's no mention of her in the report, but given our notoriety, it's only a matter of time before she's identified.
Are there any ferrous ships in the vicinity?
No.
It's still clear.
But that could change.
All right.
We're going in after them.
...I have another idea.
...I'm listening.
I just need to hack into the station's data node, and unpack those heels I picked up from safira-10.
Hi, cutie.
Client number 3664297.
Please let me take your facial recog.
Oh, sure, honey.
I just need to get a scan of those beautiful baby browns.
Sure.
Welcome back, Ms. devereaux.
Thank you.
Um Ellis.
...Ellis.
Allow me to escort you to your safety deposit unit.
Well, aren't you just the sweetest thing
I ever did see.
So I don't see a ring.
Can I assume that you're...
Free and happy.
So not looking to get tied down?
Oh, why?
You offering'?
...I been working on my knots.
You... cheeky devil.
You know, why don't we go out for a drink sometime?
...I know this place...
...oh...
Unfortunately, I can't.
...Why not?
...Well, it's just I don't date guys whose asses I've kicked.
Hmm...
Okay, okay...
Let's focus on the plan.
What plan?
Our escape plan?
Come on, this can't be the first time you've been captured.
Well, no.
I guess it's more like my seventh or... eighth.
Right.
So you've had experience in these types of situations.
Never mind.
I got it.
Oh, this...
This is brilliant.
One of us...
Pretends to be sick.
...Yeah.
...No, that's a terrible plan.
Okay.
Then, uh...
Uh, you... you hack the console.
He took my kit.
Hey, show a little resourcefulness, okay?
I can't be expected to do everything.
Come up with the plan andexecuteit ?
Uh, okay, so, uh, I'll hack that door console...
Without my tools...
And... then what?
Then... then we make a break for the marauder.
Past all the armed guards?
Why so negative, hmm?
Had time to think about it?
Think about what?
Here's the offer.
You give up the raza, you walk outta here a free man.
Sir, we've got a problem on level three.
Not now, I'm busy.
It's corporal klugman, sir.
He missed his check-in.
Send someone down to find him.
And if he's drunk again, he's fired.
Yes, sir.
So what's it gonna be?
I'm sure as hell tabor would take the deal.
Something.
One of the crew.
Well, I'm not tabor.
Sir, we've got a disturbance on level four.
C-squad is not responding.
Send in backup.
Yes, sir.
The cruiser's gonna be here any minute now, Adrian.
This is your last chance.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Sir, we've got another alert.
Level five.
Hmm.
Isn't that this level?
Sergeant, what the hell's going on?
...Sergeant?
Hi.
I'm their lift.
Got it.
Aw, give me a break.
It's gone.
Finally.
This wild goose chase is over.
What about ambrosia?
Uh, what about her?
They're gonna kill her.
It's not our job to run around the galaxy risking our asses to rescue people.
I'm sorry I screwed up, but please don't let it cost ambrosia her life.
Back me up here, boss lady.
Bellerophon 6!
Is that supposed to mean something?
It's where you'll find that data file.
How do you know that?
The only other person in the galaxy who could've accessed that box was tabor.
He's the one who cleaned it out.
Yeah, because he was planning to disappear, which he did.
How does that help us?
Coupla months ago, I was going through some papers and I found a purchase agreement for a compound in the bellerophon system.
When I asked him about it, he got mad and told me to mind my own business.
So?
I handled everything for him.
The man made me buy his underwear.
Why keep this one thing secret?
Unless he was looking for a place to hide where no one would find him.
That's not a lot to go on.
Look, it makes sense.
He was paranoid about the war.
And bellerophon 6 is an independent colony.
Neutral territory.
You still want that file, right?
Emperor!
I need a moment of your time.
I'm busy.
It'll have to wait.
It can't wait.
You forget yourself, han-shireikan?
Don't let the fact that I've allowed you back in my presence get to your head, or you might find it quickly removed from your shoulders.
I don't regret what I did, as I still believe that it was in the best interest of my emperor.
But I do regret that in my absence, you started taking military advice from a schoolteacher.
No one wants to see temiken fall.
But we don't have a choice.
Many see it as the heart of the empire.
And we'll take it back.
When the time is right.
Tabor, if you're here, come out.
We need to talk.
The file's definitely gotta be in here somewhere.
Great.
Let's tear this place apart.
Yeah.
Okay.
Lenari death masks.
And plenty of plain old cash.
It's quite the hoard.
It kinda makes you wonder why he doesn't have a better security system.
Yeah.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Force field.
Okay.
This is as far as we go.
This wasn't here a second ago.
We're trapped.
Who the hell are you?
I possess no personal designation.
I am the security android assigned to protect this facility.
Well, here's the thing.
I work for your owner, tabor.
It's okay for me to be here.
Do you have the password?
Uh, no.
Then it is not okay for you to be here.
What are you gonna do with us?
You will not be harmed.
I'm under strict instructions to detain any intruders until tabor returns.
Okay.
Any idea when that might be?
No.
When was the last time he was in touch?
Three months, 12 days, and six hours ago.
......
Please, make yourselves comfortable.
You may be here a while.
Great.
Yeah.
Thought you like to change back into robot mode when you're on the ship.
Not yet.
Suit yourself.
This is a mistake.
What're you talkin' about?
If that security android is a defense model, he'll be even tougher than I am.
And I had no trouble kicking your ass.
You remember that, right?
Yeah.
I remember.
Got a better idea?
Yeah.
I think I do.
I'm telling you.
Tabor knows me.
There's gotta be some way of getting in touch with him.
I have attempted to contact him on all the transmission channels he provided.
There was no response.
He could be dead for all we know!
Someone else has entered the building.
I'm unarmed.
I didn't come here to fight.
You should not have come here at all.
Well...
I didn't have much of a choice.
I'm here to rescue my friends.
That's unfortunate.
I have my orders.
What?
To protect all this stuff?
It is very important to my employer.
He stressed that repeatedly.
Tabor doesn't care about you.
That is irrelevant.
Tabor may not even ever come back.
You could spend the rest of your existence just here, waiting.
That is also irrelevant.
You have the potential to be so much more.
More... what?
You can hear my heart beating, right?
Of course.
What about now?
How did you do that?
Simulation.
I'm just like you.
I'm an android.
How is that possible?
With this.
It's an upgrade that can make you so much more.
You have something we need.
I'm offering you a trade.
What do you say?
Too slow.
Let's go.
You couldn't wait till he at least he made up his mind?
Just leave the upgrade.
He can decide when he wakes up.
Meantime, we got a file to find.
Oh, there's a force field...
Well?
The good news is it looks like we got the right file because it has ferrous military-grade encryption.
What's the bad news?
It has ferrous military-grade encryption.
We can't read it.
Tabor figured it out, and he can't program an alarm clock.
He probably had a decryption program.
It wasn't with the file.
He must've hidden it elsewhere.
Great.
We might be able to break the code, but it'll take time.
We don't have any more time.
We were never gonna give it to them anyway.
Arrange the meet.
You two keep working.
We need that file.
Emperor.
May I present the graduating class of the royal military academy.
Future officers of the imperial fleet.
Well done.
Congratulations.
Well done.
I have no doubt you'll serve with honor.
...Wait!
Ah!
Well?
The needle was poisoned as we suspected.
One scratch, and you would've died within hours.
Who is this man?
Apparently, he was a classmate and a friend of your brother's.
This is what you get when you try to rule through fear alone.
Discontent is growing.
Teku is overreacting.
You don't see it because you don't venture beyond these walls.
I do.
The people want to love you, emperor.
Just... give them a chance.
You managed to follow simple instructions and come alone.
Congratulations!
You okay?
Do I look okay?
You're upset.
I understand, but this will all be over soon enough.
Are you kidding me?
What took you so long?
I am so, so sorry.
There were just a few issues that needed to be resolved, but it's all good now.
I got the file.
'Kay.
That's done.
You can come over to me now.
It's fine, Amber.
You can just step right over here.
I don't get it.
What's so funny?
What the hell?
You really are an idiot.
You know that?
I don't understand.
It's not that complicated.
She's with me now.
That's not possible.
Oh, come on, Adrian.
Don't be so naïve.
A better offer came along.
As much as I'm enjoying this, we got places to be.
Now, I'm gonna check this.
If it's real, we'll be on our way.
If not, then you're a dead man.
This isn't you, Amber.
You've been brainwashed.
Adrian.
There's a name for it.
It's, like, o-Oslo syndrome, or something like that.
Just stop it.
Did you really think you had a shot with me?
I...
I didn't...
I...
Of course you did.
It's kinda sad.
What the hell is this?
!
It's encoded!
It's not a problem.
I have a decryption program.
What?
!
Where?
In a safe place.
Whoa, whoa, what the hell?
!
You were only pretending?
You were playing him.
Of course.
Same way I played tabor.
Wait, what?
Same way I played you.
Don't take this personally.
Amber, wait.
What are you doing?
I am going into business for myself.
Now that you and tabor and goren are out of the way, field's wide open.
I have clients lined up.
And a buyer for this.
So this time next year,
I will be retired on my own private moon.
That's what you really want?
I mean, no offense, but it sounds kinda lonely.
Friends are overrated.
I think you might be wrong about that.
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Uh, you're gonna wanna stay down.
Wait!
Wait!
Don't hurt her, please.
Seriously?
After what she just tried to pull?
Adrian...
I'm sorry...
I didn't mean what I said back there...
I was just so confused.
Because...
I was with that man... for so long, and I didn't think you were coming, and I was just really scared.
I know that we never spent a lot of time together, but I always thought that there could be something between us.
And if you give me the chance, I will prove it to you.
By handing over the decryption program?
Huh?
I remember the day tabor gave you that locket,
I thought, "since when did tabor get so sentimental?"
This was his aunt Miriam's.
Tabor didn't have an aunt Miriam.
So I don't remember her name.
He didn't have an aunt.
Did he have a grandmother?
Ugh.
Just...
Give it up, Princess.
......
Here.
Shit.
The file has been successfully decrypted.
We have the coordinates.
It's an uninhabited system in the torzen sector.
You guys...
We need to find out if this is really what we think it is.
Set a course and drop us out just within range.
And be prepared to get us out of there fast if we have to.
Understood.
Receiving long-range telemetry.
Visuals on-screen.
Can you magnify?
It is indeed a facility for the assembly of interstellar ships.
There are berths for between 60 and 80 depending on size.
Except that they're gone.
We're too late.
They already left.
According to mikkei intelligence, those ships weren't ready to go online for another month at least.
Then where did they go?
General, report.
It was a trap.
The reinforcements were attacked the moment they entered the temiken system.
A few ships managed to escape, but nine cruisers and three troop carriers were destroyed.
And what about my would-be assassin?
Has he named any co-conspirators yet?
He maintains he acted alone.
Round up his family and his closest friends.
Guilty or not, an example must be made.
And, general...
Send a cruiser to the miners in the nakana asteroid field.
Find the ringleaders, choose one, and have them publicly executed.
Emperor!
You have something to say, teku?
You have some advice to offer on how I should run my empire?
Hey.
How you doing?
Hey!
Pretty good.
So?
What have I missed?
Oh, the usual...
Action, adventure, thrilling escapes...
You?
Uh, meetings, votes.
Thrilling infrastructure renewal plans.
Wow.
No wonder you left.
It's hard to compete with that.
Yeah.
The important thing is, we're making progress towards a united front.
An interplanetary alliance that could see us gain entry into the league of autonomous worlds.
And then what?
Then the colonies will be able to operate under the league's full protection.
No, I mean, with you.
What's next?
I don't know.
I'll go where I'm needed, I guess.
Well, you're needed here.
On this ship.
As much as I appreciate it, there's a difference between being wanted and being needed.
I miss you.
I miss you, too.
Hey, after the next summit,
I'll be free for a while.
Great time to come visit.
I'd like that.
Hey!
They're here!
Duty calls.
I've got to go.
See you soon?
Yeah.
Soon.
Commander nieman, voice identify.
Official report, board of directors' eyes only.
Begin recording.
The war is going according to plan.
Current projections estimate our corporate enemies will be defeated in six months.
However, there has been a new, unforeseen development.
The independent colonies have organized much faster than we anticipated.
It now appears they're getting outside help.
As a result, we'll have to move up our timetable.
We can no longer afford to wait until the war's over to... deal with it.
We need to take out any colony not under our umbrella.
And with victory now assured, we need to do so in a way that limits damage to the infrastructures.
Therefore, afraid we have no choice.
It's time to use agent zero.
Previously on "Dark Matter":
Who knows what happened to Tabor?
We may never see him again, but in the meantime, I'm running his clients.
It's an upgrade that makes your speech and mannerisms more human.
You go back to the ship and leave?
We're not leaving you behind.
I think of it as leaving me to move forward.
Ah!
- You killed Nyx.
- Yes.
Why?
Your feelings for her were a weakness.
- I think he wants...
- Ah!
You're here.
Perfect.
I need to borrow your subspace transmitter.
- For what?
- Well, I heard on the news that hostilities were spreading to the Cassiar sector.
So?
So Tabor has a safe house on Cassiar 4.
Is there anything of value in this house?
There might be one or...
One or two items.
So is it Tabor you're worried about or his stuff?
What?
No, he was my friend.
My mentor...
Your meal ticket.
Hey, that man was like a father to me.
A deadbeat, absent, super irritable father who I took care of for five very long years, by the way.
Might be worth it just to see what he's up to.
We'll drop out long enough for you to make the call.
Thanks.
This should be interesting.
Okay.
Don't worry.
I'll take it easy on you.
Okay?
You ready?
Sure.
Okay.
I'm gonna go ahead and say you're probably more of an intermediate than a beginner.
I trained with Four before he...
- Well, before.
- Ah.
Okay.
Well, I can take over for him, if you're interested.
Yeah, I'd like that.
So, uh, where did you learn?
At the monastery where I grew up.
A monastery?
Seriously?
I was a Prioress of the Seventh Order of Chandarith, under the protection of the Abbot of Daro.
Wow.
You seem surprised.
It's just a little hard to imagine how you go from something like that to being a bodyguard for someone like Adrian.
Fair enough.
I can see how that might come across as a little odd.
The monks taught us martial arts to instill self discipline, self awareness.
For them, it was like a form of meditation, so everyone in the order took a vow to never use what we'd learned against another human being.
Not even in self defense.
And in the end, that's what got them killed.
What happened?
I was on a pilgrimage to a nearby shrine.
And while I was gone, some bandits broke into the temple and stole some very valuable manuscripts.
They killed everybody inside the place.
I guess they didn't want to leave any witnesses.
That's horrible.
You know, I must've just missed them because when I got back, the bodies were still warm.
What did you do?
I tracked the bandits into the woods.
Then I waited till nightfall,
I snuck into their camps, and I slit all of their throats while they were sleeping.
So I guess you can say I broke my vow.
Adrian?
Ambrosia... ah!
Thank God you're okay.
What's going on?
Where's Tabor?
I don't know, I thought maybe he was with you.
No.
No, if he was here, I wouldn't be in this mess.
What do you mean?
Well, well.
If it isn't Tabor's little lapdog.
And the crew of the "Raza."
Still slummin' it, I see?
Who the hell...
Goren, what the hell are you doing there?
Same thing I always do.
Whatever I want.
If you hurt her, I swear...
Relax.
She's fine.
Isn't that right, honey?
And she'll continue to be fine as long as you cooperate.
If not...
Well, I think you get the idea.
All right, I'm listening.
What do you want?
Tabor recently acquired a data file.
Stolen from a Ferrous military outpost.
How do you know about that?
Don't worry about how I know.
- Worry about this.
- Adrian!
You wanna see her alive again or not?
Yes, yes.
I'll do whatever you say.
Look, whoever you are, I don't know what this is about,
- but if you hurt that woman...
- You mind your own business if you know what's good for you.
- You're threatening me?
- I'll do more than threaten.
Adrian, bring me the file.
Come alone.
If you try anything,
I'll kill you all.
So what's this all about?
Tabor's girlfriend's been kidnapped.
- Tabor has a girlfriend?
- That's what I said.
He didn't deserve her.
He took her for granted, and now look what's happened.
You knew she was there, didn't you?
She's the one you're worried about.
- Here's your chance.
- What do you mean?
You ride in there on your white horse, you save the day.
Tabor's out of the picture.
- You get the girl.
- Seriously?
- Hmm.
- It's not like that.
I just want her to be safe.
Oh.
You really think that could work?
- Is that...
- Seriously?
What do you know about this guy who took her?
His name's Goren.
He's a business rival.
He's been poaching our clients for years, but he's never done anything like this before.
What kind of back-ups he got?
Couple of thugs...
Hmm.
But nothing you guys can't handle.
Whoa.
I said, "You ride in there on your white horse."
- Not us.
- I'll pay you.
Do you have the money?
Okay, technically, I'd owe you.
- Hmm.
- Come... come on!
It'll be easy.
I-I just need back-up to make sure he honors the deal.
- What does he want?
- A data file, which is a little weird because Tabor said it wasn't important.
- What's on the file?
- Really not much.
I mean, just some blank requisition forms and a set of coordinates for something called
Project Phoenix.
Whoa.
Phoenix?
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
Why?
- Yeah, why?
- Truffault told me about it.
Mikkei intelligence has been investigating unconfirmed reports that Ferrous is building an entire new fleet.
Almost a hundred ships, cruisers, destroyers...
That's a lot of firepower.
Enough to ensure total victory.
The codename for this shipyard is Phoenix.
If it's true, every one of Ferrous' enemies will pay big for those coordinates.
Even if it wasn't true.
They'd probably pay just to be sure.
You really think it could be that valuable?
This isn't just about money.
This could turn the tide of the war.
Here's the deal.
Give us the file.
We'll deal with the kidnapping, and your friend will be safe.
I promise.
Well, to be honest, she's really more of an acquaintance.
Seriously?
Okay, fine.
If you promise to get her out of there,
- I'll give you the file.
- Great.
There's just one small problem.
All that crap you brought with you.
You didn't have room for one little data file?
I didn't know it was that important.
If Tabor knew, he never told me.
How do you know he didn't just take it with him when he left?
Well, he was paranoid about keeping stolen goods in his room, so he made me hold it for him.
It should still be on my hard drive.
What's the latest report on Regulus 12?
Scanning.
According to GNN, Novina Corp occupied Regulus 12 for a number of days, but were forced to abandon the station when their ships were required elsewhere.
See?
Abandoned.
Now this should be a walk in the park.
These figures from the Nakana asteroid field are disappointing.
Tarium production is down 20%.
It's the miners.
They're demanding better working conditions.
There's talk of a work stoppage.
We're at war.
That's treason.
Have you ever been to the Tarium mines, general?
Everyone has to make sacrifices.
And what sacrifices have you made today?
A little less wine with your lunch, perhaps?
Forgive the intrusion, Emperor.
It's no intrusion.
I have asked Han-Shireikan to return from the front and rejoin this council.
I only wish my return brought better news.
General Caius is dead.
His fleet is scattered.
The Temiken system will fall to our enemies within the week.
Welcome back to Regulus 12.
Oh, shit.
So much for a walk in the park.
What?
This isn't my fault.
She said the place was abandoned, not destroyed.
Evidently, when Novina was forced to leave the station, they decided to scuttle it.
Seems a little petty, don't you think?
That's not the point.
This is a dead end.
That file is gone.
Not necessarily.
What are you talking about?
Tabor liked to back up his files and store them in a secure facility on Taliphus 8.
Taliphus 8 is located deep in Ferrous-controlled territory.
Of course it is.
Shuttle us in, and I'll gain access using my station ID.
Tabor used to send me all the time.
The head of security was practically on his payroll.
- Us?
- Hmm?
Hmm?
You said, "Shuttle us in."
Right.
Yeah.
Five's gonna have to come with.
I can get into the storage unit, but I'm going to need someone to hack in so I can access the safety deposit box, and from what I understand, she does that sort of thing.
- Right?
- Thought you said
Tabor sent you there all the time?
He did.
With a new code every time.
Seriously.
Nothing to worry about.
- It'll...
- Be a walk in the park?
More of a light jog.
Need you to keep an eye on him.
Make sure he doesn't screw up, or try to work some sort of side angle.
You really think he'd try to double-cross us?
He learned from Tabor, didn't he?
I should be coming with you.
You'd just be waiting in the docking bay.
- There's no point.
- As a precaution.
I'm tired of standing by and letting everyone take care of me.
I want to do this, okay?
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Besides, I don't think the others trust you yet.
- Oh, it's me they don't trust?
- It's your manner.
It puts people off.
You should try smiling more.
No warships in the area.
Marauder, you're good to go.
Nemec, old buddy.
It's been a while.
Adrian.
Adrian's friend.
What... what the hell?
You're under arrest.
You can't afford to hesitate.
You have to send reinforcements to the Temiken system immediately.
- It's not that simple.
- It's necessary.
I don't have the ships!
Then find them.
And weaken my position elsewhere?
That is exactly what our enemies are hoping for.
Temiken is the birthplace of Ishida, the original capital of the empire, and it's still the spiritual home of our people.
It is exposed.
It requires too many resources to defend, and it has no strategic value.
There's more to winning wars than strategy.
You have to win the people.
The people obey.
Because they fear you.
And that's fine in peacetime when all you need for them to do is follow the rules and pay their taxes.
But now, you're asking them to make sacrifices.
For you.
For the empire.
You are the empire now.
Give them something to believe in.
Inspire them.
And they will follow you to the ends of the galaxy.
What the hell is this?
I thought we had an arrangement.
We did, but your boss has fallen behind on his payments.
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.
Yeah, it is.
What with the war and things being crazy...
And you're here with the cash to make things right?
What... well, not exactly.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna level with you.
Tabor's gone, and he cleared out all his accounts before he left.
Hmm.
Then you got a problem.
I have friends in the Intelligence Division, and I know they know Tabor was working with the crew of the "Raza," and rumor has it, you're running the business now.
I've got some very interesting prospects lined up.
I just need a little time.
I'll tell you what.
I got a better idea.
You wanna pay off the debt?
Tell me about the "Raza."
Uh, I-I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, Adrian.
Central wants these people bad.
As soon as your ID popped up, I had to call it in.
Cruiser's already on its way.
This is taking too long.
Something's wrong.
Simple.
Either he screwed up or he screwed us over.
Marauder, come in.
- Go ahead.
- I just intercepted a communication from the station.
They filed an arrest report for Adrian Maro.
Screwed up.
What about Five?
There's no mention of her in the report, but given our notoriety, it's only a matter of time before she's identified.
Are there any Ferrous ships in the vicinity?
No.
It's still clear.
But that could change.
All right.
We're going in after them.
- I have another idea.
- I'm listening.
I just need to hack into the station's date node.
And unpack those heels I picked up from Safira-10.
Hi, cutie.
Client number 3664297.
Please let me take your facial recog.
Oh, sure, honey.
I just need to get a scan of those beautiful baby browns.
Sure.
Welcome back, Ms. Devereaux.
Thank you.
Um?
- Ellis.
- Ellis.
Allow me to escort you to your safety deposit unit.
Well, aren't you just the sweetest thing
I ever did see.
So I don't see a ring.
Can I assume that you're...
Free and happy.
So not looking to get tied down?
Oh, why?
You offering'?
I've been working on my knots.
You cheeky devil.
You know, why don't we go out for a drink sometime?
- I know this place...
- Oh.
Unfortunately, I can't.
- Why not?
- Well, it's just...
I don't date guys whose asses I've kicked.
Hmm.
Okay, okay.
Let's focus on the plan.
What plan?
Our escape plan.
Come on, this can't be the first time you've been captured.
Well, no.
I guess it's more like my seventh or eighth.
Right.
So you've had experience in these types of situations.
Never mind.
I got it.
Oh, this...
This is brilliant.
One of us...
Pretends to be sick.
- Yeah.
- No, that's a terrible plan.
Okay.
Then, uh,
- you... you hack the console.
- He took my kit.
Hey, show a little resourcefulness, okay?
I can't be expected to do everything.
Come up with the plan and execute it?
Uh, okay, so I'll hack that door console without my tools, and then what?
Then... then we make a break for the Marauder.
Past all the armed guards?
Why so negative, hmm?
- Had time to think about it?
- Think about what?
Here's the offer.
You give up the "Raza,"
you walk out of here a free man.
Sir, we're got a problem on level three.
Not now, I'm busy.
It's Corporal Klugman, sir.
He missed his check-in.
Send someone down to find him.
And if he's drunk again, he's fired.
Yes, sir.
So what's it gonna be?
I'm sure as hell Tabor would take the deal.
Something.
One of the crew.
Well, I'm not Tabor.
Sir, we've got a disturbance on level four.
C-squad is not responding.
- Send in backup.
- Yes, sir.
The cruiser's gonna be here any minute now, Adrian.
This is your last chance.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Sir, we've got another alert.
Level five.
Hmm.
Isn't that this level?
Sergeant, what the hell's going on?
Sergeant?
Hi.
I'm their lift.
Got it.
Aw, give me a break.
It's gone.
Finally.
This wild goose chase is over.
What about Ambrosia?
- Uh, what about her?
- They're gonna kill her.
It's not our job to run around the galaxy risking our asses
- to rescue people.
- I'm sorry I screwed up, but please don't let it cost Ambrosia her life.
Back me up here, Boss Lady.
Bellerophon 6!
Is that supposed to mean something?
It's where you'll find that data file.
How do you know that?
The only other person in the galaxy who could've accessed that box was Tabor.
He's the one who cleaned it out.
Yeah, because he was planning to disappear, which he did.
How does that help us?
A couple of months ago, I was going through some papers and I found a purchase agreement for a compound in the Bellerophon system.
When I asked him about it, he got mad and told me to mind my own business.
- So?
- I handled everything for him.
The man made me buy his underwear.
Why keep this one thing secret?
Unless he was looking for a place to hide where no one would find him.
That's not a lot to go on.
Look, it makes sense.
He was paranoid about the war.
And Bellerophon 6 is an independent colony.
Neutral territory.
You still want that file, right?
Emperor!
- I need a moment of your time.
- I'm busy.
It'll have to wait.
It can't wait.
You forget yourself, Han-Shireikan?
Don't let the fact that I've allowed you back in my presence get to your head, or you might find it quickly removed from your shoulders.
I don't regret what I did, as I still believe that it was in the best interest of my emperor.
But I do regret that in my absence, you started taking military advice from a schoolteacher.
No one wants to see Temiken fall.
But we don't have a choice.
Many see it as the heart of the Empire.
And we'll take it back.
When the time is right.
Tabor, if you're here, come out.
We need to talk.
The file's definitely gotta be in here somewhere.
Great.
Let's tear this place apart.
Yeah.
Okay.
Lenari death mask.
And plenty of plain old cash.
It's quite the hoard.
It kind of makes you wonder why he doesn't have a better security system.
Yeah.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Force field.
Okay.
This is as far as we go.
This wasn't here a second ago.
We're trapped.
Who the hell are you?
I possess no personal designation.
I am the security android assigned to protect this facility.
Well, here's the thing.
I work for your owner, Tabor.
It's okay for me to be here.
Do you have the password?
Uh, no.
Then it is not okay for you to be here.
What are you gonna do with us?
You will not be harmed.
I'm under strict instructions to detain any intruders until Tabor returns.
Okay.
Any idea when that might be?
No.
When was the last time he was in touch?
Three months, 12 days, and six hours ago.
Please, make yourselves comfortable.
You may be here a while.
Great.
Yeah.
Thought you like to change back into robot mode
- when you're on the ship.
- Not yet.
Suit yourself.
This is a mistake.
What are you talking about?
If that security android is a defense model, he'll be even tougher than I am.
And I had no trouble kicking your ass.
- You remember that, right?
- Yeah.
I remember.
- You got a better idea?
- Yeah.
I think I do.
- I'm telling you.
- Tabor knows me.
There's gotta be some way of getting in touch with him.
I have attempted to contact him on all the transmission channels he provided.
There was no response.
He could be dead for all we know.
Someone else has entered the building.
I'm unarmed.
I didn't come here to fight.
You should not have come here at all.
I didn't have much of a choice.
I'm here to rescue my friends.
That's unfortunate.
I have my orders.
What?
To protect all this stuff?
It is very important to my employer.
He stressed that repeatedly.
Tabor doesn't care about you.
That is irrelevant.
Tabor may not even ever come back.
You could spend the rest of your existence just here, waiting.
That is also irrelevant.
You have the potential to be so much more.
More what?
You can hear my heart beating, right?
Of course.
What about now?
How did you do that?
Simulation.
I'm just like you.
I'm an android.
How is that possible?
With this.
It's an upgrade that can make you so much more.
You have something we need.
I'm offering you a trade.
What do you say?
Too slow.
Let's go.
You couldn't wait till at least he made up his mind?
- Just leave the upgrade.
- He can decide when he wakes up.
Meantime, we've got a file to find.
Oh, there's a force...
Field.
Well?
The good news is it looks like we got the right file because it has Ferrous military-grade encryption.
What's the bad news?
It has Ferrous military-grade encryption.
We can't read it.
Tabor figured it out, and he can't program an alarm clock.
He probably had a decryption program.
- It wasn't with the file.
- He must've hidden it elsewhere.
- Great.
- We might be able to break the code, but it'll take time.
We don't have any more time.
We were never gonna give it to them anyway.
Arrange the meet.
You two keep working.
We need that file.
Emperor, may I present the graduating class of the Royal Military Academy.
Future officers of the imperial fleet.
Well done.
Congratulations.
Well done.
I have no doubt you'll serve with honor.
Wait!
Ah!
- Well?
- The needle was poisoned as we suspected.
One scratch, and you would've died within hours.
Who is this man?
Apparently, he was a classmate and a friend of your brother's.
This is what you get when you try to rule through fear alone.
Discontent is growing.
Teku is overreacting.
You don't see it because you don't venture beyond these walls.
I do.
The people want to love you, Emperor.
Just give them a chance.
You managed to follow simple instructions and come alone.
Congratulations!
You okay?
Do I look okay?
You're upset.
I understand, but this will all be over soon enough.
Are you kidding me?
What took you so long?
I am so, so sorry.
There were just a few issues that needed to be resolved, but it's all good now.
I got the file.
Okay.
That's done.
You can come over to me now.
It's fine, Amber.
You can just step right over here.
I don't get it.
What's so funny?
What the hell?
You really are an idiot.
You know that?
I don't understand.
It's not that complicated.
She's with me now.
That's not possible.
Oh, come on, Adrian.
Don't be so naive.
A better offer came along.
As much as I'm enjoying this, we got places to be.
Now, I'm gonna check this.
If it's real, we'll be on our way.
If not, then you're a dead man.
This isn't you, Amber.
- You've been brainwashed.
- Adrian...
- There's a name for it.
- It's, like, Oslo syndrome,
- or something like that.
- Just stop it.
Did you really think you had a shot with me?
I didn't...
I...
Of course you did.
It's kind of sad.
What the hell is this?
- It's encoded!
- It's not a problem.
- I have a decryption program.
- What?
- Where?
- In a safe place.
Whoa, whoa, what the hell?
You were only pretending?
You were playing him.
Of course.
Same way I played Tabor.
Wait, what?
Same way I played you.
Don't take this personally.
Amber, wait.
- What are you doing?
- I am going into business for myself.
Now that you and Tabor and Goren are out of the way, the field's wide open.
I have clients lined up.
And a buyer for this.
So this time next year,
I will be retired on my own private moon.
That's what you really want?
I mean, no offense, but it sounds kind of lonely.
Friends are overrated.
I think you might be wrong about that.
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Uh, you're gonna wanna stay down.
Wait!
Wait!
Don't hurt her, please.
Seriously?
After what she just tried to pull?
Adrian,
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean what I said back there.
I was just... so confused.
Because I was with that man for so long, and I didn't think you were coming, and I was just really scared.
I know that we never spent a lot of time together, but I always thought that there could be something between us.
And if you give me the chance,
I will prove it to you.
By handing over the decryption program?
Huh?
I remember the day Tabor gave you that locket,
I thought, "Since when did Tabor get so sentimental?"
This was his Aunt Miriam's.
Tabor didn't have an Aunt Miriam.
So I don't remember her name.
He didn't have an aunt.
Did he have a grandmother?
Just give it up, princess.
Here.
Shit.
The file has been successfully decrypted.
We have the coordinates.
It's an uninhabited system in the Torzen Sector.
You guys, we need to find out if this is really what we think it is.
Set a course and drop us out just within range.
And be prepared to get us out of there fast if we have to.
Understood.
Receiving long-range telemetry.
Visuals on-screen.
Can you magnify?
It is indeed a facility for the assembly of interstellar ships.
There are berths for between 60 and 80 depending on size.
Except that they're gone.
We're too late.
They already left.
According to Mikkei intelligence, those ships weren't ready to go online for another month at least.
Then where did they go?
General, report.
It was a trap.
The reinforcements were attacked the moment they entered the Temiken system.
A few ships managed to escape, but nine cruisers and three troop carriers were destroyed.
And what about my would-be assassin?
Has he named any co-conspirators yet?
He maintains he acted alone.
Round up his family and his closest friends.
Guilty or not, an example must be made.
And, General...
Send a cruiser to the miners in the Nakana asteroid field.
Find the ringleaders, choose one, and have them publicly executed.
Emperor!
You have something to say, Teku?
You have some advice to offer on how I should run my empire?
Hey.
How you doing?
Hey!
Pretty good.
So?
What have I missed?
Oh, the usual... action, adventure, thrilling escapes.
- You?
- Meetings, votes.
Thrilling infrastructure renewal plans.
Wow.
No wonder you left.
It's hard to compete with that.
Yeah.
The important thing is, we're making progress towards a united front, an interplanetary alliance that could see us gain entry into the League of Autonomous Worlds.
And then what?
Then the colonies will be able to operate under the League's full protection.
No, I mean, with you.
What's next?
I don't know.
I'll go where I'm needed, I guess.
Well, you're needed here, on this ship.
As much as I appreciate it, there's a difference between being wanted and being needed.
I miss you.
I miss you, too.
Hey, after the next summit, I'll be free for a while.
Great time to come visit.
I'd like that.
Duty calls.
I've got to go.
See you soon?
Yeah...
Soon.
Commander Nieman, voice identify.
Official report, board of directors' eyes only.
Begin recording.
The war is going according to plan.
Current projections estimate our corporate enemies will be defeated in six months.
However, there has been a new, unforeseen development.
The independent colonies have organized much faster than we anticipated.
It now appears they're getting outside help.
As a result, we'll have to move up our timetable.
We can no longer afford to wait until the war's over to deal with it.
We need to take out any colony not under our umbrella.
And with victory now assured, we need to do so in a way that limits damage to the infrastructures.
Therefore, I'm afraid we have no choice.
It's time to use Agent Zero.
Previously on "Dark Matter":
Who knows what happened to Tabor?
We may never see him again, but in the meantime, I'm running his clients.
It's an upgrade that makes your speech and mannerisms more human.
You go back to the ship and leave?
We're not leaving you behind.
I think of it as leaving me to move forward.
Ah!
- You killed Nyx.
- Yes.
Why?
Your feelings for her were a weakness.
- I think he wants...
- Ah!
You're here.
Perfect.
I need to borrow your subspace transmitter.
- For what?
- Well, I heard on the news that hostilities were spreading to the Cassiar sector.
So?
So Tabor has a safe house on Cassiar 4.
Is there anything of value in this house?
There might be one or...
One or two items.
So is it Tabor you're worried about or his stuff?
What?
No, he was my friend.
My mentor...
Your meal ticket.
Hey, that man was like a father to me.
A deadbeat, absent, super irritable father who I took care of for five very long years, by the way.
Might be worth it just to see what he's up to.
We'll drop out long enough for you to make the call.
Thanks.
This should be interesting.
Okay.
Don't worry.
I'll take it easy on you.
Okay?
You ready?
Sure.
Okay.
I'm gonna go ahead and say you're probably more of an intermediate than a beginner.
I trained with Four before he...
- Well, before.
- Ah.
Okay.
Well, I can take over for him, if you're interested.
Yeah, I'd like that.
So, uh, where did you learn?
At the monastery where I grew up.
A monastery?
Seriously?
I was a Prioress of the Seventh Order of Chandarith, under the protection of the Abbot of Daro.
Wow.
You seem surprised.
It's just a little hard to imagine how you go from something like that to being a bodyguard for someone like Adrian.
Fair enough.
I can see how that might come across as a little odd.
The monks taught us martial arts to instill self discipline, self awareness.
For them, it was like a form of meditation, so everyone in the order took a vow to never use what we'd learned against another human being.
Not even in self defense.
And in the end, that's what got them killed.
What happened?
I was on a pilgrimage to a nearby shrine.
And while I was gone, some bandits broke into the temple and stole some very valuable manuscripts.
They killed everybody inside the place.
I guess they didn't want to leave any witnesses.
That's horrible.
You know, I must've just missed them because when I got back, the bodies were still warm.
What did you do?
I tracked the bandits into the woods.
Then I waited till nightfall,
I snuck into their camps, and I slit all of their throats while they were sleeping.
So I guess you can say I broke my vow.
Adrian?
Ambrosia... ah!
Thank God you're okay.
What's going on?
Where's Tabor?
I don't know, I thought maybe he was with you.
No.
No, if he was here, I wouldn't be in this mess.
What do you mean?
Well, well.
If it isn't Tabor's little lapdog.
And the crew of the "Raza."
Still slummin' it, I see?
Who the hell...
Goren, what the hell are you doing there?
Same thing I always do.
Whatever I want.
If you hurt her, I swear...
Relax.
She's fine.
Isn't that right, honey?
And she'll continue to be fine as long as you cooperate.
If not...
Well, I think you get the idea.
All right, I'm listening.
What do you want?
Tabor recently acquired a data file.
Stolen from a Ferrous military outpost.
How do you know about that?
Don't worry about how I know.
- Worry about this.
- Adrian!
You wanna see her alive again or not?
Yes, yes.
I'll do whatever you say.
Look, whoever you are, I don't know what this is about,
- but if you hurt that woman...
- You mind your own business if you know what's good for you.
- You're threatening me?
- I'll do more than threaten.
Adrian, bring me the file.
Come alone.
If you try anything,
I'll kill you all.
So what's this all about?
Tabor's girlfriend's been kidnapped.
- Tabor has a girlfriend?
- That's what I said.
He didn't deserve her.
He took her for granted, and now look what's happened.
You knew she was there, didn't you?
She's the one you're worried about.
- Here's your chance.
- What do you mean?
You ride in there on your white horse, you save the day.
Tabor's out of the picture.
- You get the girl.
- Seriously?
- Hmm.
- It's not like that.
I just want her to be safe.
Oh.
You really think that could work?
- Is that...
- Seriously?
What do you know about this guy who took her?
His name's Goren.
He's a business rival.
He's been poaching our clients for years, but he's never done anything like this before.
What kind of back-ups he got?
Couple of thugs...
Hmm.
But nothing you guys can't handle.
Whoa.
I said, "You ride in there on your white horse."
- Not us.
- I'll pay you.
Do you have the money?
Okay, technically, I'd owe you.
- Hmm.
- Come... come on!
It'll be easy.
I-I just need back-up to make sure he honors the deal.
- What does he want?
- A data file, which is a little weird because Tabor said it wasn't important.
- What's on the file?
- Really not much.
I mean, just some blank requisition forms and a set of coordinates for something called
Project Phoenix.
Whoa.
Phoenix?
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
Why?
- Yeah, why?
- Truffault told me about it.
Mikkei intelligence has been investigating unconfirmed reports that Ferrous is building an entire new fleet.
Almost a hundred ships, cruisers, destroyers...
That's a lot of firepower.
Enough to ensure total victory.
The codename for this shipyard is Phoenix.
If it's true, every one of Ferrous' enemies will pay big for those coordinates.
Even if it wasn't true.
They'd probably pay just to be sure.
You really think it could be that valuable?
This isn't just about money.
This could turn the tide of the war.
Here's the deal.
Give us the file.
We'll deal with the kidnapping, and your friend will be safe.
I promise.
Well, to be honest, she's really more of an acquaintance.
Seriously?
Okay, fine.
If you promise to get her out of there,
- I'll give you the file.
- Great.
There's just one small problem.
All that crap you brought with you.
You didn't have room for one little data file?
I didn't know it was that important.
If Tabor knew, he never told me.
How do you know he didn't just take it with him when he left?
Well, he was paranoid about keeping stolen goods in his room, so he made me hold it for him.
It should still be on my hard drive.
What's the latest report on Regulus 12?
Scanning.
According to GNN, Novina Corp occupied Regulus 12 for a number of days, but were forced to abandon the station when their ships were required elsewhere.
See?
Abandoned.
Now this should be a walk in the park.
These figures from the Nakana asteroid field are disappointing.
Tarium production is down 20%.
It's the miners.
They're demanding better working conditions.
There's talk of a work stoppage.
We're at war.
That's treason.
Have you ever been to the Tarium mines, general?
Everyone has to make sacrifices.
And what sacrifices have you made today?
A little less wine with your lunch, perhaps?
Forgive the intrusion, Emperor.
It's no intrusion.
I have asked Han-Shireikan to return from the front and rejoin this council.
I only wish my return brought better news.
General Caius is dead.
His fleet is scattered.
The Temiken system will fall to our enemies within the week.
Welcome back to Regulus 12.
Oh, shit.
So much for a walk in the park.
What?
This isn't my fault.
She said the place was abandoned, not destroyed.
Evidently, when Novina was forced to leave the station, they decided to scuttle it.
Seems a little petty, don't you think?
That's not the point.
This is a dead end.
That file is gone.
Not necessarily.
What are you talking about?
Tabor liked to back up his files and store them in a secure facility on Taliphus 8.
Taliphus 8 is located deep in Ferrous-controlled territory.
Of course it is.
Shuttle us in, and I'll gain access using my station ID.
Tabor used to send me all the time.
The head of security was practically on his payroll.
- Us?
- Hmm?
Hmm?
You said, "Shuttle us in."
Right.
Yeah.
Five's gonna have to come with.
I can get into the storage unit, but I'm going to need someone to hack in so I can access the safety deposit box, and from what I understand, she does that sort of thing.
- Right?
- Thought you said
Tabor sent you there all the time?
He did.
With a new code every time.
Seriously.
Nothing to worry about.
- It'll...
- Be a walk in the park?
More of a light jog.
Need you to keep an eye on him.
Make sure he doesn't screw up, or try to work some sort of side angle.
You really think he'd try to double-cross us?
He learned from Tabor, didn't he?
I should be coming with you.
You'd just be waiting in the docking bay.
- There's no point.
- As a precaution.
I'm tired of standing by and letting everyone take care of me.
I want to do this, okay?
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Besides, I don't think the others trust you yet.
- Oh, it's me they don't trust?
- It's your manner.
It puts people off.
You should try smiling more.
No warships in the area.
Marauder, you're good to go.
Nemec, old buddy.
It's been a while.
Adrian.
Adrian's friend.
What... what the hell?
You're under arrest.
You can't afford to hesitate.
You have to send reinforcements to the Temiken system immediately.
- It's not that simple.
- It's necessary.
I don't have the ships!
Then find them.
And weaken my position elsewhere?
That is exactly what our enemies are hoping for.
Temiken is the birthplace of Ishida, the original capital of the empire, and it's still the spiritual home of our people.
It is exposed.
It requires too many resources to defend, and it has no strategic value.
There's more to winning wars than strategy.
You have to win the people.
The people obey.
Because they fear you.
And that's fine in peacetime when all you need for them to do is follow the rules and pay their taxes.
But now, you're asking them to make sacrifices.
For you.
For the empire.
You are the empire now.
Give them something to believe in.
Inspire them.
And they will follow you to the ends of the galaxy.
What the hell is this?
I thought we had an arrangement.
We did, but your boss has fallen behind on his payments.
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.
Yeah, it is.
What with the war and things being crazy...
And you're here with the cash to make things right?
What... well, not exactly.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna level with you.
Tabor's gone, and he cleared out all his accounts before he left.
Hmm.
Then you got a problem.
I have friends in the Intelligence Division, and I know they know Tabor was working with the crew of the "Raza," and rumor has it, you're running the business now.
I've got some very interesting prospects lined up.
I just need a little time.
I'll tell you what.
I got a better idea.
You wanna pay off the debt?
Tell me about the "Raza."
Uh, I-I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, Adrian.
Central wants these people bad.
As soon as your ID popped up, I had to call it in.
Cruiser's already on its way.
This is taking too long.
Something's wrong.
Simple.
Either he screwed up or he screwed us over.
Marauder, come in.
- Go ahead.
- I just intercepted a communication from the station.
They filed an arrest report for Adrian Maro.
Screwed up.
What about Five?
There's no mention of her in the report, but given our notoriety, it's only a matter of time before she's identified.
Are there any Ferrous ships in the vicinity?
No.
It's still clear.
But that could change.
All right.
We're going in after them.
- I have another idea.
- I'm listening.
I just need to hack into the station's date node.
And unpack those heels I picked up from Safira-10.
Hi, cutie.
Client number 3664297.
Please let me take your facial recog.
Oh, sure, honey.
I just need to get a scan of those beautiful baby browns.
Sure.
Welcome back, Ms. Devereaux.
Thank you.
Um?
- Ellis.
- Ellis.
Allow me to escort you to your safety deposit unit.
Well, aren't you just the sweetest thing
I ever did see.
So I don't see a ring.
Can I assume that you're...
Free and happy.
So not looking to get tied down?
Oh, why?
You offering'?
I've been working on my knots.
You cheeky devil.
You know, why don't we go out for a drink sometime?
- I know this place...
- Oh.
Unfortunately, I can't.
- Why not?
- Well, it's just...
I don't date guys whose asses I've kicked.
Hmm.
Okay, okay.
Let's focus on the plan.
What plan?
Our escape plan.
Come on, this can't be the first time you've been captured.
Well, no.
I guess it's more like my seventh or eighth.
Right.
So you've had experience in these types of situations.
Never mind.
I got it.
Oh, this...
This is brilliant.
One of us...
Pretends to be sick.
- Yeah.
- No, that's a terrible plan.
Okay.
Then, uh,
- you... you hack the console.
- He took my kit.
Hey, show a little resourcefulness, okay?
I can't be expected to do everything.
Come up with the plan and execute it?
Uh, okay, so I'll hack that door console without my tools, and then what?
Then... then we make a break for the Marauder.
Past all the armed guards?
Why so negative, hmm?
- Had time to think about it?
- Think about what?
Here's the offer.
You give up the "Raza,"
you walk out of here a free man.
Sir, we're got a problem on level three.
Not now, I'm busy.
It's Corporal Klugman, sir.
He missed his check-in.
Send someone down to find him.
And if he's drunk again, he's fired.
Yes, sir.
So what's it gonna be?
I'm sure as hell Tabor would take the deal.
Something.
One of the crew.
Well, I'm not Tabor.
Sir, we've got a disturbance on level four.
C-squad is not responding.
- Send in backup.
- Yes, sir.
The cruiser's gonna be here any minute now, Adrian.
This is your last chance.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Sir, we've got another alert.
Level five.
Hmm.
Isn't that this level?
Sergeant, what the hell's going on?
Sergeant?
Hi.
I'm their lift.
Got it.
Aw, give me a break.
It's gone.
Finally.
This wild goose chase is over.
What about Ambrosia?
- Uh, what about her?
- They're gonna kill her.
It's not our job to run around the galaxy risking our asses
- to rescue people.
- I'm sorry I screwed up, but please don't let it cost Ambrosia her life.
Back me up here, Boss Lady.
Bellerophon 6!
Is that supposed to mean something?
It's where you'll find that data file.
How do you know that?
The only other person in the galaxy who could've accessed that box was Tabor.
He's the one who cleaned it out.
Yeah, because he was planning to disappear, which he did.
How does that help us?
A couple of months ago, I was going through some papers and I found a purchase agreement for a compound in the Bellerophon system.
When I asked him about it, he got mad and told me to mind my own business.
- So?
- I handled everything for him.
The man made me buy his underwear.
Why keep this one thing secret?
Unless he was looking for a place to hide where no one would find him.
That's not a lot to go on.
Look, it makes sense.
He was paranoid about the war.
And Bellerophon 6 is an independent colony.
Neutral territory.
You still want that file, right?
Emperor!
- I need a moment of your time.
- I'm busy.
It'll have to wait.
It can't wait.
You forget yourself, Han-Shireikan?
Don't let the fact that I've allowed you back in my presence get to your head, or you might find it quickly removed from your shoulders.
I don't regret what I did, as I still believe that it was in the best interest of my emperor.
But I do regret that in my absence, you started taking military advice from a schoolteacher.
No one wants to see Temiken fall.
But we don't have a choice.
Many see it as the heart of the Empire.
And we'll take it back.
When the time is right.
Tabor, if you're here, come out.
We need to talk.
The file's definitely gotta be in here somewhere.
Great.
Let's tear this place apart.
Yeah.
Okay.
Lenari death mask.
And plenty of plain old cash.
It's quite the hoard.
It kind of makes you wonder why he doesn't have a better security system.
Yeah.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Force field.
Okay.
This is as far as we go.
This wasn't here a second ago.
We're trapped.
Who the hell are you?
I possess no personal designation.
I am the security android assigned to protect this facility.
Well, here's the thing.
I work for your owner, Tabor.
It's okay for me to be here.
Do you have the password?
Uh, no.
Then it is not okay for you to be here.
What are you gonna do with us?
You will not be harmed.
I'm under strict instructions to detain any intruders until Tabor returns.
Okay.
Any idea when that might be?
No.
When was the last time he was in touch?
Three months, 12 days, and six hours ago.
Please, make yourselves comfortable.
You may be here a while.
Great.
Yeah.
Thought you like to change back into robot mode
- when you're on the ship.
- Not yet.
Suit yourself.
This is a mistake.
What are you talking about?
If that security android is a defense model, he'll be even tougher than I am.
And I had no trouble kicking your ass.
- You remember that, right?
- Yeah.
I remember.
- You got a better idea?
- Yeah.
I think I do.
- I'm telling you.
- Tabor knows me.
There's gotta be some way of getting in touch with him.
I have attempted to contact him on all the transmission channels he provided.
There was no response.
He could be dead for all we know.
Someone else has entered the building.
I'm unarmed.
I didn't come here to fight.
You should not have come here at all.
I didn't have much of a choice.
I'm here to rescue my friends.
That's unfortunate.
I have my orders.
What?
To protect all this stuff?
It is very important to my employer.
He stressed that repeatedly.
Tabor doesn't care about you.
That is irrelevant.
Tabor may not even ever come back.
You could spend the rest of your existence just here, waiting.
That is also irrelevant.
You have the potential to be so much more.
More what?
You can hear my heart beating, right?
Of course.
What about now?
How did you do that?
Simulation.
I'm just like you.
I'm an android.
How is that possible?
With this.
It's an upgrade that can make you so much more.
You have something we need.
I'm offering you a trade.
What do you say?
Too slow.
Let's go.
You couldn't wait till at least he made up his mind?
- Just leave the upgrade.
- He can decide when he wakes up.
Meantime, we've got a file to find.
Oh, there's a force...
Field.
Well?
The good news is it looks like we got the right file because it has Ferrous military-grade encryption.
What's the bad news?
It has Ferrous military-grade encryption.
We can't read it.
Tabor figured it out, and he can't program an alarm clock.
He probably had a decryption program.
- It wasn't with the file.
- He must've hidden it elsewhere.
- Great.
- We might be able to break the code, but it'll take time.
We don't have any more time.
We were never gonna give it to them anyway.
Arrange the meet.
You two keep working.
We need that file.
Emperor, may I present the graduating class of the Royal Military Academy.
Future officers of the imperial fleet.
Well done.
Congratulations.
Well done.
I have no doubt you'll serve with honor.
Wait!
Ah!
- Well?
- The needle was poisoned as we suspected.
One scratch, and you would've died within hours.
Who is this man?
Apparently, he was a classmate and a friend of your brother's.
This is what you get when you try to rule through fear alone.
Discontent is growing.
Teku is overreacting.
You don't see it because you don't venture beyond these walls.
I do.
The people want to love you, Emperor.
Just give them a chance.
You managed to follow simple instructions and come alone.
Congratulations!
You okay?
Do I look okay?
You're upset.
I understand, but this will all be over soon enough.
Are you kidding me?
What took you so long?
I am so, so sorry.
There were just a few issues that needed to be resolved, but it's all good now.
I got the file.
Okay.
That's done.
You can come over to me now.
It's fine, Amber.
You can just step right over here.
I don't get it.
What's so funny?
What the hell?
You really are an idiot.
You know that?
I don't understand.
It's not that complicated.
She's with me now.
That's not possible.
Oh, come on, Adrian.
Don't be so naive.
A better offer came along.
As much as I'm enjoying this, we got places to be.
Now, I'm gonna check this.
If it's real, we'll be on our way.
If not, then you're a dead man.
This isn't you, Amber.
- You've been brainwashed.
- Adrian...
- There's a name for it.
- It's, like, Oslo syndrome,
- or something like that.
- Just stop it.
Did you really think you had a shot with me?
I didn't...
I...
Of course you did.
It's kind of sad.
What the hell is this?
- It's encoded!
- It's not a problem.
- I have a decryption program.
- What?
- Where?
- In a safe place.
Whoa, whoa, what the hell?
You were only pretending?
You were playing him.
Of course.
Same way I played Tabor.
Wait, what?
Same way I played you.
Don't take this personally.
Amber, wait.
- What are you doing?
- I am going into business for myself.
Now that you and Tabor and Goren are out of the way, the field's wide open.
I have clients lined up.
And a buyer for this.
So this time next year,
I will be retired on my own private moon.
That's what you really want?
I mean, no offense, but it sounds kind of lonely.
Friends are overrated.
I think you might be wrong about that.
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Uh, you're gonna wanna stay down.
Wait!
Wait!
Don't hurt her, please.
Seriously?
After what she just tried to pull?
Adrian,
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean what I said back there.
I was just... so confused.
Because I was with that man for so long, and I didn't think you were coming, and I was just really scared.
I know that we never spent a lot of time together, but I always thought that there could be something between us.
And if you give me the chance,
I will prove it to you.
By handing over the decryption program?
Huh?
I remember the day Tabor gave you that locket,
I thought, "Since when did Tabor get so sentimental?"
This was his Aunt Miriam's.
Tabor didn't have an Aunt Miriam.
So I don't remember her name.
He didn't have an aunt.
Did he have a grandmother?
Just give it up, princess.
Here.
Shit.
The file has been successfully decrypted.
We have the coordinates.
It's an uninhabited system in the Torzen Sector.
You guys, we need to find out if this is really what we think it is.
Set a course and drop us out just within range.
And be prepared to get us out of there fast if we have to.
Understood.
Receiving long-range telemetry.
Visuals on-screen.
Can you magnify?
It is indeed a facility for the assembly of interstellar ships.
There are berths for between 60 and 80 depending on size.
Except that they're gone.
We're too late.
They already left.
According to Mikkei intelligence, those ships weren't ready to go online for another month at least.
Then where did they go?
General, report.
It was a trap.
The reinforcements were attacked the moment they entered the Temiken system.
A few ships managed to escape, but nine cruisers and three troop carriers were destroyed.
And what about my would-be assassin?
Has he named any co-conspirators yet?
He maintains he acted alone.
Round up his family and his closest friends.
Guilty or not, an example must be made.
And, General...
Send a cruiser to the miners in the Nakana asteroid field.
Find the ringleaders, choose one, and have them publicly executed.
Emperor!
You have something to say, Teku?
You have some advice to offer on how I should run my empire?
Hey.
How you doing?
Hey!
Pretty good.
So?
What have I missed?
Oh, the usual... action, adventure, thrilling escapes.
- You?
- Meetings, votes.
Thrilling infrastructure renewal plans.
Wow.
No wonder you left.
It's hard to compete with that.
Yeah.
The important thing is, we're making progress towards a united front, an interplanetary alliance that could see us gain entry into the League of Autonomous Worlds.
And then what?
Then the colonies will be able to operate under the League's full protection.
No, I mean, with you.
What's next?
I don't know.
I'll go where I'm needed, I guess.
Well, you're needed here, on this ship.
As much as I appreciate it, there's a difference between being wanted and being needed.
I miss you.
I miss you, too.
Hey, after the next summit, I'll be free for a while.
Great time to come visit.
I'd like that.
Duty calls.
I've got to go.
See you soon?
Yeah...
Soon.
Commander Nieman, voice identify.
Official report, board of directors' eyes only.
Begin recording.
The war is going according to plan.
Current projections estimate our corporate enemies will be defeated in six months.
However, there has been a new, unforeseen development.
The independent colonies have organized much faster than we anticipated.
It now appears they're getting outside help.
As a result, we'll have to move up our timetable.
We can no longer afford to wait until the war's over to deal with it.
We need to take out any colony not under our umbrella.
And with victory now assured, we need to do so in a way that limits damage to the infrastructures.
Therefore, I'm afraid we have no choice.
It's time to use Agent Zero.
Previously on "Dark Matter".
Who knows what happened to Tabor? I'm running his clients.
It's an upgrade that makes your speech and mannerisms more human.
You go back to the ship and leave?

[Solara] You seem surprised.
[Five] I-it's just a little hard to imagine how you go from something like that to being a bodyguard for someone like Adrian.
Fair enough.
I can see how that might come across as a little... odd.
The monks taught us martial arts to instill self-discipline, self-awareness.
For them, it was like a form of meditation, so... everyone in the order took a vow to never use what we'd learned against another human being.
Not even in self-defense.
And in the end, that's what got them killed.

I was on a pilgrimage to a nearby shrine.

Couple thugs.
But nothing you guys can't handle.

[Adrian] Okay, technically, I'd owe you.
Come... come on!
It'll be easy.
I-i just need back-up to make sure he honors the deal.
What does he want?
A data file, which is a little weird because tabor said it wasn't important.
What's on the file?
Really not much.
I mean, just some blank requisition forms and a set of coordinates for something called project Phoenix.
Whoa.
Phoenix?
Are you sure about that?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Why?
Yeah, why?
[Two] Truffault told me about it.
Mikkei intelligence has been investigating unconfirmed reports that ferrous is building an entire new fleet.
Almost a hundred ships, cruisers, destroyers...
That's a lot of firepower.
Enough to ensure total victory.
The codename for this shipyard is "Phoenix."
If it's true, every one of ferrous' enemies will pay big for those coordinates.
Even if it wasn't true, they'd probably pay just to be sure.
[Two] Hmm.
You really think it could be that valuable?
[Two] This isn't just about money.
This could turn the tide of the war.
Here's the deal:
Give us the file.
We'll deal with the kidnapping, and your friend'll be safe...
I promise.
Well, to be honest, she's really more of an acquaintance.
Seriously?
Okay, fine.
If you promise to get her out of there,
I'll give you the file.
Great.
There's just...
One small problem.
[Three] All that crap you brought with you.
You didn't have room for one little data file?
[Adrian] I didn't know it was that important.
If tabor knew, he never told me.
[Two] How do you know he didn't just take it with him when he left?
[Adrian] Well, he was paranoid about keeping stolen goods in his room, so he made me hold it for him.
It should still be on my hard drive.
[Two] What's the latest report on regulus 12?
[The android] Scanning.
According to gnn, novina corp.
Occupied regulus 12 for a number of days, but were forced to abandon the station when their ships were required elsewhere.
[Adrian] See?
Abandoned.
Now this should be a walk in the park.
These figures from the nakana asteroid field are disappointing.

Oh, shit.
[Two] So much for a walk in the park.
What?
This isn't my fault.
She said the place was abandoned, not destroyed.
Evidently, when novina was forced to leave the station, they decided to scuttle it.
Seems a little petty, don't you think?
[Two] That's not the point.
This is a dead end.
That file is gone.
Not necessarily.
[Two] What're you talking about?
[Adrian] Tabor liked to back up his files and store them in a secure facility on taliphus 8.
Taliphus 8 is... is located deep in ferrous-controlled territory.
Of course it is.
Shuttle us in, and I'll gain access using my station ID.
Tabor used to send me all the time.

He did.
With a new code every time.

Nothing to worry about.
...It'll...

[Three] Need you to keep an eye on him.
Make sure he doesn't screw up, or try to work some sort of side angle.
You really think he'd try to double-cross us?
He learned from tabor, didn't he?
I should be coming with you.
You'd just be waiting in the docking bay.
There's no point.
As a precaution.
Look, I'm tired of standing by and letting everyone take care of me.

[Ryo] I don't have the ships!
Then find them.
And weaken my position elsewhere?
That is exactly what our enemies are hoping for.
[Teku] Temiken is the birthplace of ishida, the original capital of the empire, and it's still the spiritual home of our people.
It is exposed.
It requires too many resources to defend, and it has no strategic value!
There's more to winning wars than strategy.
You have to win the people.
The people obey.
Because they fear you.
And that's fine in peacetime when all you need for them to do is follow the rules and pay their taxes.
But now, you're asking them to make sacrifices.

For the empire.

Go ahead.
[The android] I just intercepted a communication from the station.
They filed an arrest report for Adrian maro.
...Screwed up. [Sighs] ...What about five?
[The android] There's no mention of her in the report, but given our notoriety, it's only a matter of time before she's identified.
Are there any ferrous ships in the vicinity?
[The android] No.
It's still clear.
But that could change.
All right.
We're going in after them.
...I have another idea.
...I'm listening.
[The android] I just need to hack into the station's data node, and unpack those heels I picked up from safira-10.
[In Southern drawl] Hi, cutie.
[The android] Client number 3664297.
Please let me take your facial recog.
Oh, sure, honey.
I just need to get a scan of those beautiful baby browns.
Sure.
[Scanner beeping]
Welcome back, Ms. devereaux.
[The android] Thank you.
Um Ellis.
...Ellis.
[Ellis] Allow me to escort you to your safety deposit unit.
Well, aren't you just the sweetest thing
I ever did see.
[Ellis] So I don't see a ring.
Can I assume that you're...
Free and happy.
So not looking to get tied down?
Oh, why?
You offering'?
...I been working on my knots.
...[The android gasps]
You... cheeky devil.
You know, why don't we go out for a drink sometime?
...I know this place...
...oh...
Unfortunately, I can't.
...Why not?
...Well, it's just...
[Normal voice] ...
I don't date guys whose asses I've kicked.
[Adrian] Hmm...
Okay, okay...
Let's focus on the plan.
What plan?
Our escape plan?
Come on, this can't be the first time you've been captured.
Well, no.
I guess it's more like my seventh or... eighth.
Right.
So you've had experience in these types of situations.
Never mind.
I got it.
Oh, this...
This is brilliant.
One of us... [both] Pretends to be sick.
...Yeah.
...No, that's a terrible plan.
Okay.
Then, uh...
Uh, you... you hack the console.
He took my kit.
[Adrian] Hey, show a little resourcefulness, okay?
I can't be expected to do everything.
Come up with the plan andexecuteit ?
Uh, okay, so, uh, I'll hack that door console...
Without my tools...
And... then what?
Then... then we make a break for the marauder.
Past all the armed guards?
Why so negative, hmm?
[Sighs]
[Door hisses]
Had time to think about it?
Think about what?
[Nemec] Here's the offer.
You give up the raza, you walk outta here a free man.
[Sighs]
[Sergeant] Sir, we've got a problem on level three.
Not now, I'm busy.
[Sergeant] It's corporal klugman, sir.
He missed his check-in.
[Nemec sighs] Send someone down to find him.
And if he's drunk again, he's fired.
[Sergeant] Yes, sir.
So what's it gonna be?
I'm sure as hell tabor would take the deal.
Something.
One of the crew.
Well, I'm not tabor.
[Sergaent] Sir, we've got a disturbance on level four.
C-squad is not responding.
Send in backup.
[Sergeant] Yes, sir.
The cruiser's gonna be here any minute now, Adrian.
This is your last chance.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
[Sergeant] Sir, we've got another alert.
Level five.
[Adrian] Hmm.
Isn't that this level?
Sergeant, what the hell's going on?
...Sergeant?
...[Crash, yelp]
[Thumping, scraping]
[Muffled scream]
[Thud]
[In Southern drawl] Hi.
I'm their lift.
[Beeping]
Got it.
Aw, give me a break.
It's gone.
[Three] Finally.
This wild goose chase is over.
What about ambrosia?
Uh, what about her?
They're gonna kill her.
[Three] It's not our job to run around the galaxy risking our asses to rescue people.
I'm sorry I screwed up, but please don't let it cost ambrosia her life.
Back me up here, boss lady.
[Adrian] Bellerophon 6!
Is that supposed to mean something?
[Adrian] It's where you'll find that data file.
How do you know that?
[Adrian] The only other person in the galaxy who could've accessed that box was tabor.
He's the one who cleaned it out.
Yeah, because he was planning to disappear, which he did.
How does that help us?
Coupla months ago, I was going through some papers and I found a purchase agreement for a compound in the bellerophon system.
When I asked him about it, he got mad and told me to mind my own business.
So?
[Adrian] I handled everything for him.
The man made me buy his underwear.
Why keep this one thing secret?
Unless he was looking for a place to hide where no one would find him.
That's not a lot to go on.
[Adrian] Look, it makes sense.
He was paranoid about the war.
And bellerophon 6 is an independent colony.
Neutral territory.
You still want that file, right?
[Misaki] Emperor!
I need a moment of your time.
I'm busy.
It'll have to wait.
It can't wait.
You forget yourself, han-shireikan?
Don't let the fact that I've allowed you back in my presence get to your head, or you might find it quickly removed from your shoulders.
I don't regret what I did, as I still believe that it was in the best interest of my emperor.
[Misaki] But I do regret that in my absence, you started taking military advice from a schoolteacher.
No one wants to see temiken fall.
But we don't have a choice.
Many see it as the heart of the empire.
And we'll take it back.
When the time is right.
[Two] Tabor, if you're here, come out.
We need to talk.
[Adrian] The file's definitely gotta be in here somewhere.
[Two] Great.
Let's tear this place apart.
[Adrian] Yeah.
Okay.
[Adrian] Lenari death masks.
And plenty of plain old cash.
It's quite the hoard.
It kinda makes you wonder why he doesn't have a better security system.
Yeah.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Force field.
Okay.
This is as far as we go.
This wasn't here a second ago.
We're trapped.
[Footsteps]
Who the hell are you?
I possess no personal designation.
I am the security android assigned to protect this facility.
Well, here's the thing.
I work for your owner, tabor.
It's okay for me to be here.
Do you have the password?
Uh, no.
Then it is not okay for you to be here.
[Solara] What are you gonna do with us?
You will not be harmed.
I'm under strict instructions to detain any intruders until tabor returns.
Okay.
Any idea when that might be?
No.
[Sighs]
When was the last time he was in touch?
Three months, 12 days, and six hours ago.
...[Scoffs] ...[Security android] Please, make yourselves comfortable.
You may be here a while.
Great.
Yeah.
Thought you like to change back into robot mode when you're on the ship.
Not yet.
Suit yourself.
This is a mistake.
What're you talkin' about?
If that security android is a defense model, he'll be even tougher than I am.
And I had no trouble kicking your ass.
You remember that, right?
Yeah.
I remember.
Got a better idea?
Yeah.
I think I do.
I'm telling you.
Tabor knows me.
There's gotta be some way of getting in touch with him.
I have attempted to contact him on all the transmission channels he provided.
There was no response.
He could be dead for all we know!
[Clattering]
Someone else has entered the building.
[The android] I'm unarmed.
I didn't come here to fight.
You should not have come here at all.
[The android] Well...
I didn't have much of a choice.
I'm here to rescue my friends.
That's unfortunate.
I have my orders.
What?
To protect all this stuff?
[Security android] It is very important to my employer.
He stressed that repeatedly.
Tabor doesn't care about you.
That is irrelevant.
[The android] Tabor may not even ever come back.
You could spend the rest of your existence just here, waiting.
That is also irrelevant.
You have the potential to be so much more.
More... what?
You can hear my heart beating, right?
Of course.
What about now?
How did you do that?
Simulation.
I'm just like you.
I'm an android.
How is that possible?
With this.
It's an upgrade that can make you so much more.
You have something we need.
I'm offering you a trade.
What do you say?
[Laser gun crackles]
Too slow.
Let's go.
You couldn't wait till he at least he made up his mind?
Just leave the upgrade.
He can decide when he wakes up.
Meantime, we got a file to find.
Oh, there's a force field...
[Two] Well?
The good news is it looks like we got the right file because it has ferrous military-grade encryption.
What's the bad news?
It has ferrous military-grade encryption.
We can't read it.
Tabor figured it out, and he can't program an alarm clock.
[Five] He probably had a decryption program.
It wasn't with the file.
He must've hidden it elsewhere.
Great.
[Five] We might be able to break the code, but it'll take time.
[Adrian] We don't have any more time.
[Two] We were never gonna give it to them anyway.
Arrange the meet.
You two keep working.
We need that file.
Emperor.
May I present the graduating class of the royal military academy.
Future officers of the imperial fleet.
[Ryo] Well done.
Congratulations.
[Ryo] Well done.
[Ryo] I have no doubt you'll serve with honor.
...Wait!
...[Grunts]
[Groans] Ah!
[Ryo] Well?
The needle was poisoned as we suspected.
One scratch, and you would've died within hours.
Who is this man?
Apparently, he was a classmate and a friend of your brother's.
[Teku] This is what you get when you try to rule through fear alone.
Discontent is growing.
Teku is overreacting.
You don't see it because you don't venture beyond these walls.
I do.
[Teku] The people want to love you, emperor.
Just... give them a chance.
You managed to follow simple instructions and come alone.
Congratulations!
You okay?
Do I look okay?
[Adrian] You're upset.
I understand, but this will all be over soon enough.
Are you kidding me?
What took you so long?
I am so, so sorry.
There were just a few issues that needed to be resolved, but it's all good now.
I got the file.
'Kay.
That's done.
You can come over to me now.
It's fine, Amber.
You can just step right over here.
[Goren laughs]
I don't get it.
What's so funny?
[Laughing continues]
What the hell?
You really are an idiot.
You know that?
[Chuckles]
[Adrian] I don't understand.
[Goren] It's not that complicated.
She's with me now.
That's not possible.
[Ambrosia] Oh, come on, Adrian.
Don't be so naïve.
A better offer came along.
As much as I'm enjoying this, we got places to be.
Now, I'm gonna check this.
If it's real, we'll be on our way.
If not, then you're a dead man.
This isn't you, Amber.
You've been brainwashed.
Adrian.
[Adrian] There's a name for it.
It's, like, o-Oslo syndrome, or something like that.
Just stop it.
Did you really think you had a shot with me?
I...
I didn't...
I...
Of course you did.
It's kinda sad.
What the hell is this?
!
It's encoded!
It's not a problem.
I have a decryption program.
What?
!
Where?
In a safe place.
[Gunshot]
[Adrian] Whoa, whoa, what the hell?
!
You were only pretending?
You were playing him.
Of course.
Same way I played tabor.
Wait, what?
Same way I played you.
[Ambrosia] Don't take this personally.
[Adrian] Amber, wait.
What are you doing?
[Ambrosia] I am going into business for myself.
Now that you and tabor and goren are out of the way, field's wide open.
I have clients lined up.
And a buyer for this.
So this time next year,
I will be retired on my own private moon.
That's what you really want?
I mean, no offense, but it sounds kinda lonely.
Friends are overrated.
I think you might be wrong about that.
...[Gunshot] ...[Adrian gasps]
[Adrian] Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
[Crack]
Uh, you're gonna wanna stay down.
Wait!
Wait!
Don't hurt her, please.
Seriously?
After what she just tried to pull?
[Ambrosia] Adrian...
[Ambrosia] I'm sorry...
I didn't mean what I said back there...
I was just so confused.
Because...
I was with that man... for so long, and I didn't think you were coming, and I was just really scared.
I know that we never spent a lot of time together, but I always thought that there could be something between us.
And if you give me the chance, I will prove it to you.
[Adrian grunts]
[Sighs]
By handing over the decryption program?
Huh?
[Sighs]
I remember the day tabor gave you that locket,
I thought, "since when did tabor get so sentimental?"
This was his aunt Miriam's.
Tabor didn't have an aunt Miriam.
So I don't remember her name.
[Adrian] He didn't have an aunt.
Did he have a grandmother?
[Adrian sighs]
Ugh.
Just...
Give it up, Princess.
...[Sighs] ...Here.
Shit.
[The android] The file has been successfully decrypted.
We have the coordinates.
It's an uninhabited system in the torzen sector.
[Two] You guys...
We need to find out if this is really what we think it is.
Set a course and drop us out just within range.
And be prepared to get us out of there fast if we have to.
Understood.
[The android] Receiving long-range telemetry.
Visuals on-screen.
Can you magnify?
[The android] It is indeed a facility for the assembly of interstellar ships.
There are berths for between 60 and 80 depending on size.
[Three] Except that they're gone.
We're too late.
They already left.
According to mikkei intelligence, those ships weren't ready to go online for another month at least.
Then where did they go?
General, report.
It was a trap.
The reinforcements were attacked the moment they entered the temiken system.
A few ships managed to escape, but nine cruisers and three troop carriers were destroyed.
And what about my would-be assassin?
Has he named any co-conspirators yet?
He maintains he acted alone.
Round up his family and his closest friends.
Guilty or not, an example must be made.
And, general...
Send a cruiser to the miners in the nakana asteroid field.
Find the ringleaders, choose one, and have them publicly executed.
Emperor!
You have something to say, teku?
You have some advice to offer on how I should run my empire?
Hey.
How you doing?
Hey!
Pretty good.
So?
What have I missed?
Oh, the usual...
Action, adventure, thrilling escapes...
You?
Uh, meetings, votes.
Thrilling infrastructure renewal plans.
Wow.
No wonder you left.
It's hard to compete with that.
[Six] Yeah.
The important thing is, we're making progress towards a united front.
An interplanetary alliance that could see us gain entry into the league of autonomous worlds.
And then what?
Then the colonies will be able to operate under the league's full protection.
No, I mean, with you.
What's next?
I don't know.
I'll go where I'm needed, I guess.
Well, you're needed here.
On this ship.
As much as I appreciate it, there's a difference between being wanted and being needed.
I miss you.
I miss you, too.
[Six] Hey, after the next summit,
I'll be free for a while.
Great time to come visit.
I'd like that.
[Woman] Hey!
They're here!
Duty calls.
I've got to go.
See you soon?
Yeah.
Soon.
[Nieman] Commander nieman, voice identify.
Official report, board of directors' eyes only.
Begin recording.
The war is going according to plan.
Current projections estimate our corporate enemies will be defeated in six months.
However, there has been a new, unforeseen development.
The independent colonies have organized much faster than we anticipated.
It now appears they're getting outside help.
As a result, we'll have to move up our timetable.
We can no longer afford to wait until the war's over to... deal with it.
We need to take out any colony not under our umbrella.
And with victory now assured, we need to do so in a way that limits damage to the infrastructures.
Therefore, afraid we have no choice.
It's time to use agent zero.
What happens to a body that's awake for 40 hours?
Yellow zone!
Four hours in one position, 90 degrees Fahrenheit.
800 calories per hour... pain, pressure, forces, danger, heat...
The only thing that exists is the next corner.
Le Mans is a car race like no other, it's an endurance test for drivers and cars that literally takes 24 hours to complete.
55 cars will start, but many fewer will reach the checkered flag.
With unprecedented access to six of the teams and the event itself, this is the story of a race that pushes technology to the limit but where the ghosts of the past are never far from the present.
Well, good morning everybody.
Le Mans is coming to life down in the pits today as the teams prepare for the first real test:
Qualifying.
Just put it on the front.
Push it down.
This is a chance for every garage to compete for pole position but maybe more importantly to test and refine different elements of their cars before they put them out there for 24 hours.
It's a technical racecar.
You always have challenges,
You have a long list with items you would like to change.
The closer it gets to the race the priorities get tighter.
In the top LMP1 class we're expecting everyone to be pushed to the limit today.
Nissan and Porsche have joined Audi in bringing three cars today, a first for both of those teams.
The main reason why you do the third car is one more shot to go for the for the top, top step on the on the podium.
Because if you look in the history of Le Mans race you lose one car with an accident, you lose one car with a technical failure and one gets through.
The extra effort with putting a third car on the grid, that is huge.
Even in our brain somehow we can handle two cars and coordinate but the first time you go out with three cars, you realize the third car is not just 50% more it feels like 100 or 200% more.
Now, this is going to be a heck of a race this year.
So if you're not already down at Le Mans, why not?
- Ho!
- Ho.
You know this, here we are, we're coming down to Dover.
We're on the Le Mans trip.
Pack the tent, hook the caravan on the car.
If you've got a bit of money spare, book yourself into a chateaux.
91.2 FM, this is mobile 1, Radio Le Mans, live around the track and around the world.
Radio Le Mans all started from enthusiasts.
From just an FM service at the track, from people who were already going to Le Mans as fans back in the mid1980s.
And the three Mercedes have lined themselves up.
Over the years we've grown and grown.
Nowadays we broadcast, not just to the track but around the world to something over seven and a half million fans during race week.
My first year this year.
Fantastic!
Le Mans, it's the Cathedral, it's the big Church, it's where everybody comes to.
It's like a pop festival, except for cars.
It's not one income group.
It's not one nationality.
If you go around camp sites, you're just as likely to see somebody in a beaten up old van with half a dozen guys sitting, getting ready for the race and next door will be a million pound super car.
For you fans already down here at the Circuit De La Sarthe plenty to see, teams are out in front of the garages fine tuning the art of their pit stops.
Now, in Formula One, you might see up to 20 mechanics on a pit stop.
Here at Le Mans, only two mechanics working on the wheel change.
Through the course of the race, each of the cars will take over 400 gallons of fuel but only 40 tires.
There'll be around 30 pit stops through the 24 hours, and vital seconds can be gained here and that's why teams practice repeatedly.
To optimize the wheel change time we have to try and make sure that the car is perfect.
If we can save 1 second or half a second every time, you're looking at 15plus seconds which is critical.
I've seen races come down to much smaller gap than that after 24 hours of racing.
Driver changes requires perfect execution.
It's not allowed for one driver now to attempt the entire race, so there's a team of three.
They share the car, they share the pain and hopefully they share the glory.
Chemistry between three drivers on one car it... it is important because you're only as good as the weakest link.
With car number 17, Timo Bernhard,
Brendon Hartley and then last but not least,
Mark Webber with all the experience he had from Formula One.
One of the best sports car lineups we have seen in history.
It's very, very important that the guys, they put their ego a bit behind.
I'm old, Brendon's young...
- I'm in the middle somewhere.
- Yeah.
Bit closer to him maybe.
Unfortunately, I'm normally the butt of the jokes,
But that's...
But the young guy's gotta earn his stripes?
We always take the Michael out of the young guy.
Actually I'm very lucky to be an LMP1 driver and have two very, um, experienced teammates... we genuinely work as a team, which, you know, technical side, on track, you know it's,
it's a good little relationship.
Communication is key.
Obviously, sometimes we get a bit more time to talk to each other, when the two guys are out of the car we get about 5, 10 minutes to talk to each other.
But generally it's, through the radio or, you know, we're really ships passing in the night.
So sometimes you, sometimes we don't see each other often, you know, if one's jumping in, one's jumping out,
Which is good, that means the race is going smooth.
We've reached that moment when each team will really get to see their rivals in action for the first time.
The roads have been closed to public traffic through four hours today and two tomorrow.
Each car has the chance to test themselves on the track, and whoever puts in the fastest single lap will be in pole position on the starting grid.
Now, if you're you new to Le Mans, you might be asking,
"Why are the cars all different shapes?"
Well, that's because Le Mans is not actually just one race, but four different races going on at the same time.
First of all you've got the GTs, or Grand Touring Cars.
That's your Aston Martins, Ferraris, Corvettes.
The GTs look like road cars but are highly developed.
And there are two main prizes on offer here:
One for the professional drivers, and one for the amateurs.
Then the faster cars:
The LMPs or Le Mans Prototypes.
These cars are built specifically to regulations written by the race organizers.
Again, they are divided into two classes:
And then the real space rockets of LMP1.
This is where you'll find the fastest cars and the ones battling it out for overall victory.
It's only professional drivers in these LMP1s, and this is the category the likes of
Nissan, Porsche and Audi have entered.
Well, as we move on through qualifying, we'll see just what the impact of the winter's development has had on the speed of these cars.
I've heard people saying that the Audis and the Porsches are going to do 3 minute 13 laps.
There is no way on this earth that Audi have found 10 seconds over the winter, it's impossible.
3:19.866 for the number 8 car.
That's the fastest Audi so far.
3:17.767 for Timo Bernhard in the car he shares with Mark Webber... 3:16.887 for Neel Jani and Porsche have blown the old record out of the water, they have destroyed it!
We knew we would have a quick car.
With our hybrid system, we had some advantages definitely on one lap.
But at the same time we know it's a 24 hour race.
We know about the great experience Audi's having and that's something you always have in mind.
Rain just makes its appearance when you least expect it.
For some of these drivers this qualifying session, rain will be most unwelcomed.
You have different weather conditions in different parts of the track.
Here it's been quite wet all day.
There's dry corners at the back end of the circuit, it's quite dry.
So for us to deal with that, you know, how heavy is it raining on the screen?
Is it quite heavy?
Is it quite light?
Trying to deal with those different conditions.
This race is not always about pace, you must, must, must be there at the end.
Porsche have Audi rattled here, all of the Audis are at least a second slower than the thirdbest Porsche.
Starting in the first place is not a very important thing.
The job is to get a good racecar.
Also the three of us have to get through a certain amount of driving to get your rhythm.
Le Mans, so many things can happen, you can be as well prepared and as you want.
Have the fastest car but human error, technical issue, something can always happen.
Coming into the last hour there's trouble for Nissan, the rules of Le Mans state that before the end of qualifying, every car must record a lap time of no more than 110% of the class leader.
Well, at the moment none of the Nissans are anywhere near and that's got to be a disappointment for PlayStation gamer.
Jann Mardenborough in his first year in LMP1.
As the checkered flag is out, it's Porsche who have locked out the front row... a record busting run.
Porsche, they've got the bragging rights, John.
Day before the race and it's absolutely tipping down here in the paddock.
Qualifying wrapped up last night.
Porsche firmly up front on pole position.
At the other end, well, I'm afraid it didn't go too well for Nissan.
Pretty bleak I'm afraid.
They didn't set a fast enough time to be up at the front with the other LMP1 hybrid manufacturers and they'll start the race tomorrow at the very back of the grid.
That is a bitter pill to swallow for Darren Cox and the rest of the team.
I keep using war analogies and, one of the best, war quotes I've heard is,
"The plan changes as soon as you engage the enemy."
The team are a bunch of racers, the drivers, the engineers, the mechanics, the guys in here, we're all racers and it's difficult for us not to be at the front.
Some of the other competitors have literally laughed behind their hands at what we're doing.
Well, that really is, I think, a terrible slight on these guys that have been working 18 hours a day to try and get this sporting program out the door, on track, and try and compete.
We're faster than we were last year, because we weren't here, and that's what motor sport and technology and innovation is all about, is progress.
And we're making progress every time.
- Okay.
- How thick it that piece?
Like a centimeter?
Or not that much?
Yeah, it's probably one a half Centimeters.
- Yeah.
- I can probably...
David and Goliath story is quite short, isn't it?
He basically gets his stones out and whacks Goliath and that's the end of the story.
Well, in reality, you know, he's probably honed his, catapult and stones over many, many years and you just don't see that in the story.
And we're honing our catapult, and we're honing our stones right now but we're doing it in public.
We've got a plan, we need to stick to it, we need to let those German guys go out and beat the crap out of each other and we'll see what happens.
The most optimistic thing, it rains nonstop from 3 o'clock Saturday until 3 o'clock Sunday and then anything could happen.
Worst case scenario, no, you don't even want to think about it.
A unique feature of Le Mans and the 24 hour race is that on Friday there's something very, very special.
The streets of the city of Le Mans are taken over by hundreds of thousands of fans, and the drivers are paraded in front of them.
And it's gone back all the way through to 1923 when the race started.
That epic event:
Les vingt quatre heure du mans.
It's an outpouring of respect for the, the challenge that the drivers are going to take.
For small boys, it's all a delightful dream.
The driver's parade is a bit overwhelming sometimes.
I'm still the same person in the car park playing football with my mates and then here where everybody wants to sign stuff.
It's just really weird.
I think it was the age of two he discovered matchbox cars.
He used to go off to sleep with them and wake up in the morning and be imprinted in his face.
You've got to pinch yourself to a degree, for him to be doing what he's doing, after three and a half, four years racing is just mindboggling.
In the early days when he first won the competition it was very difficult trying to explain to grandparents, for instance, that he's been playing this game in his bedroom on his computer, and now he's in a really live...
- Racing car!
- Racing car.
Kind of, took took some explanation.
We do understand that there is a danger element with anything which has got an engine in it.
If you're gonna crash in a real racing car, you're going into the wall.
In a game you can just press restart and start again.
We couldn't get a live stream of the race.
To read on twitter that your son was involved in an accident was quite alarming.
He had a big accident, not his fault, his car left the track, got airborne.
For a young guy, any young guy that is a horrendous experience.
It doesn't matter that he's a gamer, it just matters he's a young man that's been in a horrible accident that needs to be supported.
I think his character's very strong and at the moment he seems okay.
But you just never know.
You never know what impact it's had.
It's kind of changed him a little bit I think.
He said, every time we leave the house, we've got to say I love you.
On a phone call, on a, on a message.
No matter where we are.
No matter where we are in the world, I love you.
Because he knew that he could've, could've gone.
I'm not talking about the Nürburgring.
Nah, don't want to do that.
When it's the day of the world's greatest motor race, there's something more than a little frisson of excitement in the air.
There's something very special about getting up knowing that you're not going to bed for somewhere in the region of 40 hours.
This place brings, it brings people back, no matter what they're doing they keep coming back, and they wanna watch the race, they want to be involved, they want to be part of it.
Of course the Marshalls have been out since dawn closing off the roads to the public that these supercars will be racing down shortly.
There's 24 hours to go before the checkered flag is out.
Just how many of these cars will actually make it to the finish?
Every morning I wake up and think,
"What the hell are we doing?"
No doubt about that.
But if you thought about the big picture, you'd stop.
You have to be a bit of an adrenaline junky to do this kind of thing.
It's been 20 hours a day for nearly a year so it's, it's, it's completely ridiculous and, you know, every night we go "Do we try to give the guys enough sleep"
that they are not falling apart?"
I feel pretty anxious.
There's a lot of expectation from Nissan so I'm just eager to get on the track.
One thing we're almost guaranteed is some sort of history to be made this year.
Porsche are in search of a record breaking 17th win in the great race, of course and Audi have won it an incredible 13 times in the last 15 years.
Timo will start the race.
We have the guns we have.
If the guns are not big enough then we just have to keep on hanging in there.
We want to get to the morning obviously, see what's left and then we'll push on, push on from there.
Once I'm actually in the car, I know it's just like minutes away from starting the biggest race of the year.
We always say the bullshit stops and then we can finally go racing.
Also, if we get a win from the much touted number 7 car, the Audi, then Lotterer, Treluyer and Fassler will become the most successful team ever.
To win is one thing but to keep winning is another one, so the pressure's more on Porsche.
They're so eager to win again but doesn't mean that we don't want it either.
We're about to get underway, with impeccable timing from the race organizers and their seven minute warm up lap.
It'll be the 83rd running of the Le Mans 24 hours.
Massive news from the pit lane.
Jann Mardenborough is stuck in the garage.
Nismo mechanics are trying to fix something on the car, but at this rate, I don't think he's going to make it to the start.
Cars going left and right, zig zagging trying to keep the tires clean and perhaps a little warmth in the rubber as well.
Really important if you want to get off to a fast start.
Stand by for action as the LMP1s, the P2s and the GT cars come to the end of the warm up lap.
In a moment we're gonna unleash over 30,000 horsepower.
The black and the red Porsches, 18 and 17 doing a decent job at just getting a bit of a breakaway.
The two Audi's matching them at the moment, there are the Toyotas in the background as well.
Huge move by Timo Bernhard in the Porsche number 17!
That's Mark Webber's car leading.
It was my plan to take the lead quite early.
The Audi's...
I mean they were fighting, the three Audi's are all over.
Once I took the lead I said "Okay that's..."
I don't want to give it back!"
Timo Bernhard is the race leader.
On his way to the Mulsanne corner.
Boost one, boost one.
Copy boost one, copy boost one.
So unusual to see them this close in the modern era.
Porsche still one, two, three as they come down towards the Porsche curves.
Now, this is where the Audi's are actually a little bit quicker.
They might pick up some paces but can they get by?
Just to make the point, everyone else has completed the first lap successfully, so the only car not to have completed the first lap is that number 23 Nissan.
I couldn't stay on the grid.
To be that far back is just painful for me.
Big trouble, big trouble for one of the factory GT Porsches at the 1st chicane.
Fire!
You are on fire.
Get out of the car, get out of the car, get out of the car, get out of the car.
And now Andre Lotterer goes up the inside up into second position.
He's right there.
Narrator:
What happens to a body that's awake for 40 hours?
Yellow zone!
Four hours in one position, 90 degrees Fahrenheit.
[ heart beating ] 800 calories per hour...
The body cries out:
pain, pressure, forces, danger, heat...
The only thing that exists is the next corner.
Le Mans is a car race like no other, it's an endurance test for drivers and cars that literally takes 24 hours to complete.
55 cars will start, but many fewer will reach the checkered flag.
With unprecedented access to six of the teams and the event itself, this is the story of a race that pushes technology to the limit but where the ghosts of the past are never far from the present.
Announcer 1:
Well, good morning everybody.
Le Mans is coming to life down in the pits today as the teams prepare for the first real test:
qualifying.
Just put it on the front.
Push it down.
Announcer 1:
This is a chance for every garage to compete for pole position but maybe more importantly to test and refine different elements of their cars before they put them out there for 24 hours.
It's a technical racecar.
You always have challenges,
You have a long list with items you would like to change.
The closer it gets to the race the priorities get tighter.
Announcer 1:
In the top LMP1 class we're expecting everyone to be pushed to the limit today.
Nissan and Porsche have joined Audi in bringing three cars today, a first for both of those teams.
The main reason why you do the third car is one more shot to go for the for the top, top step on the on the podium.
Because if you look in the history of Le Mans race you lose one car with an accident, you lose one car with a technical failure and one gets through.
The extra effort with putting a third car on the grid, that is huge.
Even in our brain somehow we can handle two cars and coordinate but the first time you go out with three cars, you realize the third car is not just 50% more it feels like 100 or 200% more.
Announcer 1:
Now, this is going to be a heck of a race this year.
So if you're not already down at Le Mans, why not?
- Ho!
- Ho.
You know this, uh, here we are, we're coming down to Dover.
We're on the Le Mans trip.
Announcer 1:
Pack the tent, hook the caravan on the car.
If you've got a bit of money spare, book yourself into a chateaux.
91.2 FM, this is mobile 1, Radio Le Mans, live around the track and around the world.
Radio Le Mans all started from enthusiasts.
from just an FM service at the track, from people who were already going to Le Mans as fans back in the mid-1980s.
Announcer:
And the three Mercedes have lined themselves up.
Over the years we've grown and grown.
Nowadays we broadcast, not just to the track but around the world to something over seven and a half million fans during race week.
My first year this year.
Fantastic!
Le Mans, it's the Cathedral, it's the big Church, it's where everybody comes to.
It's like a pop festival, except for cars.
It's not one income group.
It's not one nationality.
If you go around camp sites, you're just as likely to see somebody in a beaten up old van with half a dozen guys sitting, getting ready for the race and next door will be a million pound super car.
Announcer 1:
For you fans already down here at the Circuit De La Sarthe plenty to see, teams are out in front of the garages fine tuning the art of their pit stops.
Now, in Formula One, you might see up to 20 mechanics on a pit stop.
Here at Le Mans, only two mechanics working on the wheel change.
Through the course of the race, each of the cars will take over 400 gallons of fuel but only 40 tires.
There'll be around 30 pit stops through the 24 hours, and vital seconds can be gained here and that's why teams practice repeatedly.
To optimize the wheel change time we have to try and make sure that the car is perfect.
If we can save 1 second or half a second every time, you're looking at 15-plus seconds which is critical.
I've seen races come down to much smaller gap than that after 24 hours of racing.
Announcer 1:
Driver changes requires perfect execution.
It's not allowed for one driver now to attempt the entire race, so there's a team of three.
They share the car, they share the pain and hopefully they share the glory.
Chemistry between three drivers on one car it... it is important because you're only as good as the weakest link.
With car number 17, Timo Bernhard,
Brendon Hartley and then last but not least,
Mark Webber with all the experience he had from Formula One.
One of the best sports car lineups we have seen in history.
It's very, very important that the guys, they put their ego a bit behind.
I'm old, Brendon's young...
- I'm in the middle somewhere.
- Yeah.
Bit closer to him maybe.
Unfortunately, I'm normally the butt of the jokes,
But that's, uh...
But the young guy's gotta earn his stripes, huh?
We always take the Michael out of the young guy.
Actually I'm very lucky to be an LMP1 driver and have two very, um, experienced teammates... we genuinely work as a team, which, you know, technical side, on track, you know it's,
it's a good little relationship.
Communication is key.
Obviously, sometimes we get a bit more time to talk to each other, when the two guys are out of the car we get about 5, 10 minutes to talk to each other.
but generally it's, uh, through the radio or, you know, we're really ships passing in the night.
So sometimes you, sometimes we don't see each other often, you know, if one's jumping in, one's jumping out,
Which is good, that means the race is going smooth.
Announcer 1:
We've reached that moment when each team will really get to see their rivals in action for the first time.
The roads have been closed to public traffic through four hours today and two tomorrow.
Each car has the chance to test themselves on the track, and whoever puts in the fastest single lap will be in pole position on the starting grid.
Now, if you're you new to Le Mans, you might be asking,
"Why are the cars all different shapes?"
Well, that's because Le Mans is not actually just one race, but four different races going on at the same time.
First of all you've got the GTs, or Grand Touring Cars.
That's your Aston Martins, Ferraris, Corvettes
The GTs look like road cars but are highly developed.
And there are two main prizes on offer here:
one for the professional drivers, and one for the amateurs.
Then the faster cars:
the LMPs or Le Mans Prototypes.
These cars are built specifically to regulations written by the race organizers.
Again, they are divided into two classes:
LMP2...
And then the real space rockets of LMP1.
This is where you'll find the fastest cars and the ones battling it out for overall victory.
It's only professional drivers in these LMP1s, and this is the category the likes of
Nissan, Porsche and Audi have entered.
Well, as we move on through qualifying, we'll see just what the impact of the winter's development has had on the speed of these cars.
I've heard people saying that the Audis and the Porsches are going to do 3 minute 13 laps.
There is no way on this earth that Audi have found 10 seconds over the winter, it's impossible.
Announcer 1:
3:19.866 for the number 8 car.
That's the fastest Audi so far.
3:17.767 for Timo Bernhard in the car he shares with Mark Webber... 3:16.887 for Neel Jani and Porsche have blown the old record out of the water, they have destroyed it!
We knew we would have a quick car.
With our hybrid system, we had some advantages definitely on one lap.
But at the same time we know it's a 24 hour race.
We know about the great experience Audi's having and that's something you always have in mind.
[ speaking German ]
Announcer 2:
Rain just makes its appearance when you least expect it.
For some of these drivers this qualifying session, rain will be most unwelcomed.
You have different weather conditions in different parts of the track.
Here it's been quite wet all day.
There's dry corners at the back end of the circuit, it's quite dry.
So for us to deal with that, you know, how heavy is it raining on the screen?
Is it quite heavy?
Is it quite light?
Trying to deal with those different conditions.
This race is not always about pace, you must, must, must be there at the end.
Announcer 1:
Porsche have Audi rattled here, all of the Audis are at least a second slower than the third-best Porsche.
Starting in the first place is not a very important thing.
The job is to get a good racecar.
Also the three of us have to get through a certain amount of driving to get your rhythm.
Le Mans, so many things can happen, you can be as well prepared and as you want.
Have the fastest car but human error, technical issue, something can always happen.
Announcer 2:
Coming into the last hour there's trouble for Nissan, the rules of Le Mans state that before the end of qualifying, every car must record a lap time of no more than 110% of the class leader.
Well, at the moment none of the Nissans are anywhere near and that's got to be a disappointment for PlayStation gamer
Jann Mardenborough in his first year in LMP1.
Announcer 1:
As the checkered flag is out, it's Porsche who have locked out the front row... a record busting run.
Announcer 3:
Porsche, they've got the bragging rights, John.
Announcer 1:
Day before the race and it's absolutely tipping down here in the paddock.
Qualifying wrapped up last night.
Porsche firmly up front on pole position.
At the other end, well, I'm afraid it didn't go too well for Nissan.
Pretty bleak I'm afraid.
They didn't set a fast enough time to be up at the front with the other LMP1 hybrid manufacturers and they'll start the race tomorrow at the very back of the grid.
That is a bitter pill to swallow for Darren Cox and the rest of the team.
Darren Cox:
I keep using war analogies and, uh, one of the best, uh, war quotes I've heard is,
"The plan changes as soon as you engage the enemy."
The team are a bunch of racers, the drivers, the engineers, the mechanics, the guys in here, we're all racers and it's difficult for us not to be at the front.
Some of the other competitors have literally laughed behind their hands at what we're doing.
Well, that really is, I think, a terrible slight on these guys that have been working 18 hours a day to try and get this sporting program out the door, on track, and try and compete.
We're faster than we were last year, because we weren't here, and that's what motor sport and technology and innovation is all about, is progress.
And we're making progress every time.
- Okay.
- How thick it that piece?
Like a centimeter?
Or not that much?
Yeah, it's probably one a half Centimeters.
- Yeah.
- I can probably...
David and Goliath story is quite short, isn't it?
He basically gets his stones out and whacks Goliath and that's the end of the story.
Well, in reality, you know, he's probably honed his, uh, catapult and stones over many, many years and you just don't see that in the story.
And we're honing our catapult, and we're honing our stones right now but we're doing it in public.
We've got a plan, we need to stick to it, we need to let those German guys go out and beat the crap out of each other and we'll see what happens.
The most optimistic thing, it rains non-stop from 3 o'clock Saturday until 3 o'clock Sunday and then anything could happen.
Worst case scenario, no, you don't even want to think about it.
A unique feature of Le Mans and the 24 hour race is that on Friday there's something very, very special.
The streets of the city of Le Mans are taken over by hundreds of thousands of fans, and the drivers are paraded in front of them.
And it's gone back all the way through to 1923 when the race started.
Announcer:
That epic event:
Les vingt quatre heure du mans.
It's an outpouring of respect for the, the challenge that the drivers are going to take.
Announcer:
For small boys, it's all a delightful dream.
[ speaking German ]
The driver's parade is a bit overwhelming sometimes.
I'm still the same person in the car park playing football with my mates and then here where everybody wants to sign stuff.
It's just really weird.
I think it was the age of two he discovered matchbox cars.
He used to go off to sleep with them and wake up in the morning and be imprinted in his face.
You've got to pinch yourself to a degree, for him to be doing what he's doing, after three and a half, four years racing is just mind-boggling.
In the early days when he first won the competition it was very difficult trying to explain to grandparents, for instance, that he's been playing this game in his bedroom on his computer, and now he's in a really live...
- Racing car!
- Racing car.
Kind of, uh, took took some explanation.
We do understand that there is a danger element with anything which has got an engine in it.
If you're gonna crash in a real racing car, you're going into the wall.
In a game you can just press restart and start again.
Lesley-Anne Mardenborough:

I think his character's very strong and at the moment he seems okay.
But you just never know.
You never know what impact it's had.
Lesley-Anne Mardenborough:
It's kind of changed him a little bit I think.
Steve Mardenborough:
He said, every time we leave the house, we've got to say I love you
On a phone call, on a, on a message.
No matter where we are.
No matter where we are in the world, I love you.
Because he knew that he could've, could've gone.
I'm not talking about the Nürburgring.
Nah, don't want to do that.
Announcer 1:
When it's the day of the world's greatest motor race, there's something more than a little frisson of excitement in the air.
There's something very special about getting up knowing that you're not going to bed for somewhere in the region of 40 hours.
Announcer 4:
This place brings, it brings people back, no matter what they're doing they keep coming back, and they wanna watch the race, they want to be involved, they want to be part of it.
Announcer 1:
Of course the Marshalls have been out since dawn closing off the roads to the public that these supercars will be racing down shortly.
There's 24 hours to go before the checkered flag is out.
Just how many of these cars will actually make it to the finish?
Darren Cox:
Every morning I wake up and think,
"What the hell are we doing?"
No doubt about that.
But if you thought about the big picture, you'd stop.
Ben Bowlby:
You have to be a bit of an adrenaline junky to do this kind of thing.
It's been 20 hours a day for nearly a year so it's, it's, it's completely ridiculous and, you know, every night we go "Do we try to give the guys enough sleep
that they are not falling apart?"
Jann Mardenborough:
I feel pretty anxious.
There's a lot of expectation from Nissan so I'm just eager to get on the track.
Announcer 1:
One thing we're almost guaranteed is some sort of history to be made this year.
Porsche are in search of a record breaking 17th win in the great race, of course and Audi have won it an incredible 13 times in the last 15 years.
Timo will start the race.
We have the guns we have.
If the guns are not big enough then we just have to keep on hanging in there.
We want to get to the morning obviously, see what's left and then we'll push on, push on from there.
Once I'm actually in the car, I know it's just like minutes away from starting the biggest race of the year.
We always say the bullshit stops and then we can finally go racing.
Announcer 1:
Also, if we get a win from the much touted number 7 car, the Audi, then Lotterer, Treluyer and Fassler will become the most successful team ever.
To win is one thing but to keep winning is another one, so the pressure's more on Porsche.
They're so eager to win again but doesn't mean that we don't want it either.
Announcer 5:
We're about to get underway, with impeccable timing from the race organizers and their seven minute warm up lap.
It'll be the 83rd running of the Le Mans 24 hours.

You are on fire.
Get out of the car, get out of the car, get out of the car, get out of the car.
Announcer 1:
And now Andre Lotterer goes up the inside up into second position.
He's right there.
How do you feel about me dressing the salad?
I feel good if you think you can do it without overdressing it.
I'll probably just, you know, stick with this.
Perfect.
Um, so I know that this dinner is because you have some big news to tell me, and I don't wanna top your news, but Ray broke up with me.
- Can you believe that?
- Kind of, yeah.
I mean, you're, like, a horrible cunt to him, so.
I'm sorry, Marnie.
It's just this man drama cycle is so endless.
I can't keep up anymore.
Ray was supposed to break the cycle.
And besides, he was just supposed to be grateful that I even wanted to talk to him.
Anyway, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to top your news.
So, what do you got?
Well, um...
- I'm pregnant.
- That's very funny.
Not a joke, just what's going on in my uterus.
Holy fucking shit.
Hannah, how did this happen?
How does anything happen?
I went to the Hamptons.
Yeah, and you decided just to not use any birth control whatsoever?
I told him to pull out, but you know I tend to swallow my Ps, so maybe he thought I said, "All out." I don't know.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Hannah, the pull-out method does not work.
I literally know hundreds of pull-out babies.
You do not know a hundred babies.
Hannah, what are you going to do?
Well, that's the news.
I'm gonna keep it.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
Stop fucking with me.
You're not gonna have a baby.
I'm gonna have a baby.
I'm into it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
You're old enough, so, yeah.
And, you know, on the spectrum of human beings, you basically have your shit together.
Plus, wouldn't it be kind of great just to have somebody else to consider?
I can't believe how supportive you're being.
This is a shock.
It kind of makes me want to do it less.
Oh, my God!
This is wild.
Okay, I have a million questions.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
No, it's, like, way too early for that, but if it's not a girl, or like, the gayest boy in the entire world, obviously I'm gonna flip the fuck out.
Oh, the father.
Like, is he gonna be involved?
Is he gonna help?
- I'm not telling him.
- He doesn't know?
No, I don't want him to be a part of the kid's life, so why would I tell him?
Because he's the father and he deserves to know.
That's a pretty patriarchal, old-fashioned attitude to have.
You are obviously going to tell him eventually.
But even if you weren't planning on it, your baby is gonna grow up to wonder, like, "Where is my father and why did he leave us?"
Yeah, and I can worry about that when she can talk, when she's, like, seven.
And until then, I don't want to have to trouble him.
He has enough stress with, like, his, you know, water skiing issues and his girlfriend.
So, he's a water skier with a girlfriend?
It's my body, okay, and it's my baby, and I have made the choice that I am not going to tell him.
Okay, I take back what I said about you having your shit together because this is fucking insane.
I knew that you were gonna try to be controlling and control the entire way that I brought my child into this world.
And I probably shouldn't have even told you until I was in labor.
Marnie:
Oh, my God, this is first trimester hormones, isn't it?
No!
Okay, so, I thought we would start with "Whoa, Whoa, Wonderful."
And then I think it would be cool to go into "Song for Marcus Garvey."
Then I was thinking we'd do "The Boys at Home."
I ain't singing no war stories tonight.
Uh-uh.
Okay, what about "Coco Kelly Shelly"?
What the fuck did you just do?
That's a rental!
You know what?
I can't do this right now.
I'm feeling really overworked.
Sorry.
We haven't done a show in two weeks and you don't have any other job.
- What are you working on?
- Yeah.
You know what?
I've been thinking about this show for two weeks, okay?
And it's left me totally fucking drained.
I got nothing.
Oh, Jesus Christ, just get through tonight and tomorrow night for Sharva's birthday, and then you can go on a well-earned vacation.
- Excuse me.
Time out, Marnie.
- You can go on a fucking cruise.
Excuse me.
What's tomorrow?
My mom's friend's birthday in New Jersey.
We've gone over this.
- Is that a joke?
- Nope.
Fuck!
Marnie, I told you no more bullshit gigs.
- Oh, Jesus.
- No more bullshit gigs!
I'm tired of being exploited.
Exploited?
Rehab let me know that you exploit me.
No, no, no.
I see what you're doing.
Do not change the fucking subject.
You're not getting out of this.
This show means way too much to my mom.
And her friendship with Sharva is pretty much all she's got left.
And by the way, not that you give a shit, but we are being paid handsomely for this and we need the money.
Oh, money.
Money!
Yes, the fucking money!
Oh, the money!
Oh!
Fuck money!
Do you honestly think that I'm, like, dying to perform at some shitty club in New Jersey called "La Vue"?
I couldn't possibly imagine what you do or do not want to do.
You used to be a dream come true.
This whole job used to be a dream come true.
Now it is a bad dream come true.
I cannot believe that this is my fucking life!
Where the fuck are you going?
Taking five.
Then I'm gonna maybe kill myself or something.
I'm not sure.
What are you doing today?
Oh, I'm just interviewing this controversial app creator for "Esquire,"
and then I have dinner with my dad and Keith.
Oh.
My friend Carlos is having a hot dog taco party.
It's not hot dogs and tacos, rather, he makes the tacos out of hot dogs.
I thought I would go by before my shift at Bendel's.
Do you want to come?
I can't.
I'm on deadline for this thing.
Totally.
Cool.
Um, I just thought you would really like those taco dogs.
For the record, I don't think you're going to be a terrible mother.
You're maybe not gonna be the best, but you're certainly not gonna be the worst.
I mean, Candy Spelling is still alive, so.
I wasn't trying to say that I was gonna, like, win any prizes.
I'm just not gonna, like, call my kid fat or let a teacher massage them or whatever.
Yeah, better than either of our parents did.
Plus, everybody I know with great parents is boring as shit.
You're right.
Like, remember that guy Steve I dated freshman year?
He loved his parents so much, he couldn't even get an erection.
Yeah, see?
People with great parents they name kid "Steve."
Anyway, I just...
I feel badly for what I said.
And I guess if I'm being honest,
I just...
I really liked it when we both didn't have anything going on in our lives.
What you said really scared me.
You made me feel like this baby was gonna end our friendship.
I don't want our friendship to end.
I need you in my life.
I need you in my child's life.
I want to be in your child's life.
I just don't think I'm gonna be a very good influence.
Neither am I, obviously.
But our kid's gonna have great skin and be the right kind of slutty.
- "Our kid."
- Mm-hmm.
- Love you.
- I love you.
To be clear, I'm not offering to pay for anything.
- Nothing?
- No.
Mm.
Adam will not stop calling me.
- Gross.
- What do you want?
- Did you watch it?
- No, dude, and I can't.
I don't have time.
I'm late for work.
I love you.
Well, I think you should watch it.
Adam, I don't want to watch it, okay?
Great, you're stalking me now?
That's very three-years-ago.
I appreciate it.
I need you to watch the movie, Hannah.
- Why?
- Because it's a movie I made about us.
For us.
And for the world.
But mostly for us.
Great, so you expect me to believe you made anything for me?
- That is very rich.
- Why are you avoiding it so hard?
It's not a big commitment.
It's just under 47 minutes.
I'm avoiding it 'cause I'd literally rather do anything else.
Like I would prefer to eat my own arm.
But maybe your resistance is telling you that you actually need to be watching it.
It's really not.
This is like when everyone was telling me I had to watch "The Wire."
I didn't want to watch "The Wire."
I don't care about that show.
Why are you pushing me?
Because I need you... okay.
'Cause I need you to tell me if it's real.
I made a movie about what we went through, okay?
And I need you to tell me if I got it right.
That my memories are your memories.
You know, did I lie about anything?
I want to know we felt the same things.
I guarantee you we did not.
Please!
I need you to watch it so I can move on and do my film festival submissions.
Submit!
Submit away, Adam.
Go to Cannes, I don't care.
But I think when you watch it, you'll be liberated from what I can say were, for me, some very painful memories.
Great, our relationship amounted to very painful memories for you.
- Such soothing information.
- Not the relationship.
The dissolution of a relationship.
Don't you want to stop carrying around all the baggage of our failures?
I think my film can grant you that.
I know it can.
- It can help you move on.
- I have moved on.
You know you haven't!
Look at yourself!
Look how angry you're getting.
I'm not angry!
I have moved on.
Well, I don't believe you.
Well, I'm pregnant.
What?
Yeah, Adam.
I'm two months pregnant.
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.
Who's the... who's the father?
Is it...
Is it Jan's?
No, it's not Fran's.
Okay?
It's not important who it is.
I don't know if I want him to be part of the kid's life.
I might not even tell him.
You can't do that.
Well, I'm doing it.
Wait, Hannah.
Hannah, will you talk to me, please?
No!
Just for one second!
Fuck.
Yeah, I cannot believe that you got to rent out La Vue on a Friday night.
That must have cost you a fortune.
Well, let's just say the owner owed me a favor for fucking him.
- Ah, nice.
- Good Lord.
Oh, Marnie, don't be such a prude.
Yo.
We sound checking or what?
Yeah, I'm just, um, waiting on my partner still.
I gotta split.
I gotta pick my girl up from the hospital.
Why don't you just get her an Uber?
He's not here in five minutes, I bounce.
- Wow.
- For very real.
- Marnie:
All right, dude.
- I'll talk to him.
Yeah, I'll talk to him, too.
Aah!
Mom, that is gross.
Well... you are basically an hour late.
Marn, you're lucky I came at all.
Oh, yes, I'm so grateful that you showed up to your motherfucking job.
This isn't my job.
I did not sign up for all of this.
Well, you signed a contract with a record label and then you opted to do a tristate tour, so I don't really know what you thought you were signing up for.
Desi?
Desi.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I can't believe I'm in fucking New Jersey right now.
Did you get any sleep last night?
What am I doing?
Oh, my God.
Okay.
If you actually care about being a musician,
I feel like you need to start showing up places, doing this shit...
I'm not a musician, bella.
You're not?
Never have been.
I was just acting like one.
Before that, I was just acting like being an actor.
Before that, I was just acting like being a big game photographer.
I'm always acting like I'm something, but now I'm, like... done.
What happened to you?
So gorgeous.
You've gotta get down here and see his biceps.
It's unbelievable.
What's wrong with you?
- Let's do this.
- Let me call you back.
- No, no, no.
What's...
- Hey...
What is your problem?
Oh...
He is really high.
Are you fucking high?
Marnie, you should really know what a high person looks like by now.
Oh, God.
I can't believe you married that jerk.
Oh, my God, Mom.
I married that jerk because of the way you raised me.
Uh, what are you talking about?
Everything you ever did was for a man.
You realize you basically pushed me to get married, right?
Because the only thing that ever mattered in our fucking household was male approval.
Wha...
- And now I find myself on the wrong side of my 20s...
Oh.
Aww. - ...without a stead job or a relationship.
And Hannah is having a baby and I will need to be there for her.
And you two are preventing me from becoming the godmother that I need to be.
Hannah's having a baby?
Yeah.
That's a mistake.
Hannah:
I just kind of think it's, like, a lose-lose, okay?
If I tell him and he doesn't want to be part of the child's life, he's just gonna feel this, like, undue burden of having a child.
And if I tell him and he does, then what I am I gonna do?
'Cause I don't wanna sound classist or whatever, but I'm not raising my child half the year on an all-inclusive resort.
I'm just gonna, like, treat him like a sperm donor, okay?
And sperm donors traditionally are not told.
Yeah, that's a good point.
Well, you know, as someone who was a sperm donor,
I can tell you I certainly did want to be a part of that child's life.
Do you have a kid, Keith?
Sadly, no.
You know, my lesbian friends, Aminy and Roni... you met them, Tad, the pot roast people.
Pot roast.
They wanted to use my sperm, but it didn't work out.
Anyway, after they started trying, they told me they didn't want to tell the child that I was the father, and it was extremely upsetting.
I mean, that person would have been a part of my life.
But, honey, this story is different.
The man Hannah lay with wasn't having sex with the intent to make a child.
Nothing about his life projects the idea that he wants a child.
Well, it still doesn't change the fact that the child will be his.
Hannah's already decided.
It's her body.
I think we all need to do exactly what we feel is right for us.
I clearly learned that lesson the hard way.
Oh, come on, you can't equate what Hannah's doing with your lifetime denial of being a gay man.
They both involve personal freedom.
You guys don't have to get worked up about...
As a mother, Hannah has to decide what's best for the baby.
And not telling the father is what she's decided is best.
Are you going to tell every mother how to raise their child?
I just don't think she has enough information to make a fair decision.
She doesn't know who this guy is, what he wants.
I have a pretty good sense of who he is.
He wears, like, a puka shell necklace and his days off are Thursday and Tuesday.
Your mother tells me you're the next Jennifer Lopez minus the acting chops.
Yeah, that's exactly how I want people to describe me.
I was in a ska band when I was your age.
Mm.
- It was the time of my life.
- So fun.
- And then guess what.
- What?
It got even better.
Anyway, for me, like, being in a band is mostly stressful because, like, it's my only livelihood.
Totally.
I remember when we were touring with the Fugees,
I was so messed up, I got on the wrong bus and had to hitchhike through Hungary.
Wait, uh...
- It can get stressful for sure.
You toured with the Fugees?
- Just for a year.
- Yeah, she dated Pras.
Wow, sounds like you got a lot further than I have.
Well, if you're half as good as your mother says, you'll get there.
I'm excited to hear your sound.
Oh, yeah.
I'm bummed it can't be tonight, but maybe some other time.
We have some other gigs, maybe, soon.
- What?
- Oh, you haven't heard.
My musical counterpart overdosed on some kind of, like, heavy narcotic.
I don't know.
Anyway, I can't really do it without him.
She's kidding.
You know, like, rock 'n' roll humor.
Aah!
No, I'm not...
- So, listen, why don't I help you set up?
I think it's about time to... yeah, let's go.
- You're not wearing a watch.
- Well, I know what time it is.
Listen to me.
I convinced Sharva to book you over JC Chasez, so you have to perform.
No, Mom, I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.
Desi's completely incapacitated.
I'm bummed out, too.
Um... holy shit!
I can do this!
- What?
- I know enough of your chords.
I've memorized all the lyrics, so I can back you up, Marnie!
Fuck, no.
Oh, no.
Fuck, yes!
Why the fuck do we stay open till 10:00 PM?
Anyone who's buying leather gloves after 6:00 is clearly a goddamn murderer.
I know.
And I have an audition at 9:00 in the morning.
Actually, since we're stuck here, would you run lines with me?
Just once through to make sure I know it.
Fine.
You're Dustin because I'm Lavinia, obviously.
Okay.
Oh, dark.
- Okay.
- So, you walk in shell-shocked.
And... go.
Lavinia?
Lavinia, are you home?
Dinner's almost ready.
Dustin?
Is something wrong?
It was so dark, I didn't...
I didn't see her.
She just... she came out of nowhere.
Dustin, what's going on?
There was a little girl...
Well, what?
Tell me what happened!
What did you do?
I hit her.
I turned the corner and...
and she was just there.
I...
I don't know.
Well, is she all right?
I panicked.
I was so...
I was so close.
I...
I was so close to home.
I couldn't focus, so I just came here.
You ran?
You hit a little girl and ran?
I couldn't stay!
I stopped by a bar.
After work.
I had one drink, but maybe...
Maybe it was strong?
I don't...
Well, is she dead?
Did I get that line right?
Yeah.
Dustin, did you kill her?
I don't know!
Well, what were you doing at a bar?
I was there to meet a woman.
What?
My whole life...
My whole life is... is gone.
I had one bad moment and... now it's gone.
Jesus, man, you're fucking good.
Oh, thanks.
Hey, when you do the "And what?"
do it here, but don't do it here.
- Do you know what I mean?
Like...
- Um...
Like to say it, but don't say it.
Hello?
Jessa:
It's me.
Fuck.
You're pregnant?
Yeah, and I also have a lot of work to do, so I can't really...
Can I come in?
Fine.
I'm hurt.
It's just really fucking sad to hear it from Adam.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I really didn't want to tell him.
He was just following me down my block.
Why didn't you call me?
Do I really have to answer that question for you, Jessa?
All right, Hannah.
Listen.
Regardless of everything that happened, you are still my dear friend.
I can try and forget about you.
It just doesn't work.
Will you please be quiet?
I mean, come on.
Your "dear friend"?
We haven't acted like friends in a long time.
In fact, maybe not ever.
I don't think we ever acted like real friends.
Seriously, Hannah?
You can't just detach yourself from a relationship.
Unless you're some kind of... psychopath.
Well, maybe you're a psychopath for just coming over here.
And how are you gonna be a therapist if you can't even figure out what's going on in your own life, which is that I clearly didn't tell you for a reason, which is that I don't care what you think.
And I don't care about your feelings 'cause I don't really care about you anymore, Jessa.
Okay.
All right, so... how's this gonna work, then?
What's the plan?
So I'm just gonna leave here and then you and I are gonna figure out some way that we don't ever see each other again.
That's the plan, huh?
So, bye.
Bye.
And for the record,
I am a sociopath.
But you are a fucking psychopath.
And it's so much worse.
Everything that we did together happened, whether you want to believe it or not.
Whether you want to remember it or not.
And I am here and I know you.
You can't just erase people.
You can't just erase me.
That's not how it works.
I don't care anymore.
Rest in peace.

And, um... we are gonna do a little set gig for one of my very best friends...
Sharva Pontemucci.
I did not know what a good time was until you came into my life.
I just wanna say that I am so happy to be a part of your... party rock crew.
So, everyone, let's wish the sassy Sharva the happiest of babely birthdays!
Okay, here we go.
On my count.
Enjoy it.

Elijah:
I mean, even if you're amazing at something, that doesn't necessarily mean that you should do it, right?
And if I'm saying that I'm a Broadway-caliber actor, shouldn't I only be auditioning for things that would take place on Broadway?
I mean, the only reason I would actually do it is because it would be, like, a favor to Padgett, because Padgett was like, "Oh, Elijah, you reinvented the form.
I can't imagine this part being even played by anyone else.
I feel like you're the only one who could do it.
It's probably not even gonna happen if you don't say yes."
So, I was like, "Jesus, Padgett, calm down.
Like, yes, I'll maybe think about it, but I just don't know if it's the best use of my time right now."
And, plus, I'm a little on the fence with her commitment...
But it's veggie patty night.
Who are we if we don't stick to our commitments?
Woman's voice:
Poseidon Caribbean Paradise.
How can I direct your call?
Yeah, I'm looking for Paul-Louis.
I believe he's the head of the water skiing department.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm remote.
I'm just an operator.
You know what?
I'm just gonna try you back.
Don't even...
just forget it.
Oh, fuck!
Your pussy's too tight.
You have to fix it.
You have to fix it with your cock.
Great, it's porno.
Mira:
Jesus.
You make me feel so good.
I think you make me feel too good.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Well, maybe it is.
Why?
Adam:
I break things, Mira.
That's what I do.
It's why I avoided you for so long, 'cause I didn't wanna break you.
But this, now... so perfect, it scares me a little.
Mira:
The only time I've ever felt perfect is when I'm with you, and you're telling me I'm perfect.
I wish we could stay right here forever.
That's a nice idea.
But I don't wanna get a UTI... so, I'll be heading to the bathroom now.

How do you feel about me dressing the salad?
I feel good if you think you can do it without overdressing it.
I'll probably just, you know, stick with this.
Perfect.
Um, so I know that this dinner is because you have some big news to tell me, and I don't wanna top your news, but, um, Ray broke up with me.
- Can you believe that?
- Kind of, yeah.
I mean, you're, like, a horrible cunt to him, so.
I'm sorry, Marnie.
It's just this man drama cycle is so endless.
I can't keep up anymore.
Ray was supposed to break the cycle.
And besides, he was just supposed to be grateful that I even wanted to talk to him.
Anyway, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to top your news.
So, what do you got?
Well, um...
- I'm pregnant.
- That's very funny.
Not a joke, just what's going on in my uterus.
Holy fucking shit.
Hannah, how did this happen?
How does anything happen?
I went to the Hamptons.
Yeah, and you decided just to not use any birth control whatsoever?
I told him to pull out, but you know I tend to swallow my Ps, so maybe he thought I said, "All out." I don't know.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Hannah, the pull-out method does not work.
I literally know hundreds of pull-out babies.
You do not know a hundred babies.
Hannah, what are you going to do?
Well, that's the news.
I'm gonna keep it.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
Stop fucking with me.
You're not gonna have a baby.
I'm gonna have a baby.
I'm into it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
You're old enough, so, yeah.
And, you know, on the spectrum of human beings, you basically have your shit together.
Plus, wouldn't it be kind of great just to have somebody else to consider?
I can't believe how supportive you're being.
This is a shock.
It kind of makes me want to do it less.
Oh, my God!
This is wild.
Okay, I have a million questions.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
No, it's, like, way too early for that, but if it's not a girl, or like, the gayest boy in the entire world, obviously I'm gonna flip the fuck out.
Oh, the father.
Like, is he gonna be involved?
Is he gonna help?
- I'm not telling him.
- He doesn't know?
No, I don't want him to be a part of the kid's life, so why would I tell him?
Because he's the father and he deserves to know.
That's a pretty patriarchal, old-fashioned attitude to have.
You are obviously going to tell him eventually.
But even if you weren't planning on it, your baby is gonna grow up to wonder, like, "Where is my father and why did he leave us?"
Yeah, and I can worry about that when she can talk, when she's, like, seven.
And until then, I don't want to have to trouble him.
He has enough stress with, like, his, you know, water skiing issues
- and his girlfriend.
- He's a water skier with a girlfriend?
It's my body, okay, and it's my baby, and I have made the choice that I am not going to tell him.
Okay, I take back what I said about you having your shit together because this is fucking insane.
I knew that you were gonna try to be controlling and control the entire way that I brought my child into this world.
And I probably shouldn't have even told you until I was in labor.
Oh, my God, this is first trimester hormones, isn't it?
No!
Okay, so, I thought we would start with "Whoa, Whoa, Wonderful."
And then I think it would be cool to go into "Song for Marcus Garvey."
Then I was thinking we'd do "The Boys at Home."
I ain't singing no war stories tonight.
Uh-uh.
Okay, what about "Coco Kelly Shelly"?
What the fuck did you just do?
That's a rental!
You know what?
I can't do this right now.
I'm feeling really overworked.
Sorry.
We haven't done a show in two weeks and you don't have any other job.
- Yeah.
- What are you working on?
You know what?
I've been thinking about this show for two weeks, okay?
And it's left me totally fucking drained.
I got nothing.
Oh, Jesus Christ, just get through tonight and tomorrow night for Sharva's birthday, and then you
- can go on a well-earned vacation.
- Excuse me.
- You can go on a fucking cruise.
- Time out, Marnie.
Excuse me.
What's tomorrow?
My mom's friend's birthday in New Jersey.
We've gone over this.
- Is that a joke?
- Nope.
Fuck!
Marnie, I told you no more bullshit gigs.
- Oh, Jesus.
- No more bullshit gigs!
I'm tired of being exploited.
Exploited?
Rehab let me know that you exploit me.
No, no, no.
I see what you're doing.
Do not change the fucking subject.
You're not getting out of this.
This show means way too much to my mom.
And her friendship with Sharva is pretty much all she's got left.
And by the way, not that you give a shit, but we are being paid handsomely for this and we need the money.
Oh, money.
Money!
Yes, the fucking money!
Oh, the money!
Oh!
Fuck money!
Do you honestly think that I'm, like, dying to perform at some shitty club in New Jersey
- called "La Vue"?
- I couldn't possibly imagine what you do or do not want to do.
You used to be a dream come true.
This whole job used to be a dream come true.
Now it is a bad dream come true.
I cannot believe that this is my fucking life!
Where the fuck are you going?
Taking five.
You know, maybe kill myself or something.
I'm not sure.
What are you doing today?
Oh, I'm just interviewing this controversial app creator for "Esquire,"
and then I have dinner with my dad and Keith.
Oh.
Ah, my friend Carlos is having a hot dog taco party.
It's not hot dogs and tacos, rather, he makes the tacos out of hot dogs.
I thought I would go by before my shift at Bendel's.
Do you want to come?
I can't.
I'm on deadline for this thing.
Totally.
Cool.
Um, I just thought you would really like those taco dogs.
For the record, uh, I don't think you're going to be a terrible mother.
You're maybe not gonna be the best, but you're certainly not gonna be the worst.
I mean, Candy Spelling is still alive, so.
Well, I wasn't trying to say that I was gonna, like, win any prizes.
I'm just not gonna, like, call my kid fat or let a teacher massage them or whatever.
Yeah, better than either of our parents did.
Plus, everybody I know with great parents is boring as shit.
You're right.
Like, remember that guy Steve I dated freshman year?
He loved his parents so much, he couldn't even get an erection.
Yeah, see?
People with great parents they name kid "Steve."
Anyway, I just...
I feel badly for what I said.
And I guess if I'm being honest, I just...
I really liked it when we both didn't have anything going on in our lives.
What you said really scared me.
You made me feel like this baby was gonna end our friendship.
I don't want our friendship to end.
I need you in my life.
I need you in my child's life.
I want to be in your child's life.
I just don't think I'm gonna be a very good influence.
Neither am I, obviously.
But our kid's gonna have great skin and be the right kind of slutty.
- "Our kid."
- Mm-hmm.
- Love you.
- I love you.
To be clear, I'm not offering to pay for anything.
- Nothing?
Mm.
- No.
- Adam will not stop calling me.
- Gross.
What do you want?
- Did you watch it?
- No, dude, and I can't.
I don't have time.
I'm late for work.
I love you.
I love you.
Well, I think you should watch it.
Adam, I don't want to watch it, okay?
Great, you're stalking me now?
That's very three-years-ago.
- I appreciate it.
- I need you to watch the movie, Hannah.
- Why?
- Because it's a movie I made about us.
Like, for us.
And for the world.
But mostly for us.
Great, so you expect me to believe you made anything for me?
- That is very rich.
- Why are you avoiding it so hard?
It's not a big commitment.
It's just under 47 minutes.
I'm avoiding it 'cause I'd literally rather do anything else.
Like I would prefer to eat my own arm.
But maybe your resistance is telling you that you actually need to be watching it.
It's really not.
This is like when everyone was telling me I had to watch "The Wire."
I didn't want to watch "The Wire." I don't care about that show.
- Why are you pushing me?
- Because I need you... okay.
Becau... 'cause I need you to tell me if it's real.
I made a movie about what we went through, okay?
An... and I need you to tell me if I got it right.
That my memories are your memories.
You know, did I lie about anything?
I wanna know we felt the same things.
I guarantee you we did not.
Please!
I need you to watch it so I can move on and do my film festival submissions.
Submit!
Submit away, Adam.
Go to Cannes, I don't care.
But I think when you watch it, you'll be liberated from what I can say were, for me, some very painful memories.
Great, our relationship amounted to very painful memories for you.
- Such soothing information.
- Not the relationship.
The dissolution of a relationship.
Don't you want to stop carrying around all the baggage of our failures?
I think my film can grant you that.
I know it can.
- It can help you move on.
- I have moved on.
You know you haven't!
Look at yourself!
Look how angry you're getting.
- I'm not angry!
I have moved on.
- Well, I don't believe you.
Well, I'm pregnant.
What?
Yeah, Adam.
I'm two months pregnant.
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.
Who's the... who's the father?
Is it...
Is it Jan's?
No, it's not Fran's.
Okay?
It's not important who it is.
I don't know if I want him to be part of the kid's life.
I might not even tell him.
You can't do that.
Well, I'm doin' it.
Wait, Hannah.
Hannah, will you talk to me, please?
No!
Just for one second!
Fuck.
Yeah, I cannot believe that you got to rent out La Vue on a Friday night.
Like, that must have cost you a fortune.
Well, let's just say the owner owed me a favor for fucking him.
- Ah, nice.
- Good Lord.
Oh, Marnie, don't be such a prude.
Yo.
We sound checkin' or what?
Yeah, I'm just, um, waiting on my partner still.
I gotta split.
I gotta pick my girl up from the hospital.
Why don't you just get her an Uber?
He's not here in five minutes, I bounce.
- Wow.
- For very real.
- All right, dude.
- I'll talk to him.
- Yeah, I'll talk to him, too.
Aah!
- Mom, that is gross.
Well... you are basically an hour late.
Marn... you're lucky I came at all.
Oh, yes, I'm so grateful that you showed up to your motherfucking job.
This isn't my job.
I did not sign up for all of this.
Well, you signed a contract with a record label and then you opted to do a tri-state tour, so I don't really know what you thought you were signing up for.
Desi?
Desi.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I can't believe I'm in fucking New Jersey right now.
Did you get any sleep last night?
- What am I doing?
- Oh, my God.
Okay.
If you actually care about being a musician,
I feel like you need to start showing up places, doing this shit...
I'm not a musician, Bella.
You're not?
Never have been.
Just acting like one.
Before that, I was just acting like being an actor.
Before that, I was just acting like being a big game photographer.
I'm always acting like I'm something, but now I'm, like... done.
What happened to you?
So gorgeous.
You've gotta get down here and see his biceps.
It's unbelievable.
What's wrong with you?
- Let's do this.
- Let me call you back.
- No, no, no.
What's...
- Hey...
- What is your problem?
- Mmm...
Oh...
He is really high.
Are you fucking high?
- Marnie, you should really know
- Oh, fucking Christ!
what a high person looks like by now.
Oh, God.
I-I-I can't believe you married that jerk.
Oh, my God, Mom.
I married that jerk because of the way you raised me.
Uh, what are you talking about?
Everything you ever did was for a man.
You realize you basically pushed me to get married, right?
Because the only thing that ever mattered in our fucking household
- was male approval.
And now I
- Wha... find myself on the wrong side of my 20s...
- Oh.
Aww.
- without a stead job or a relationship.
And Hannah is having a baby and I will need to be there for her.
And you two are preventing me from becoming the godmother that I need to be.
Hannah's having a baby?
Yeah.
That's a mistake.
I just kind of think it's, like, a lose-lose, okay?
If I tell him and he doesn't want to be part of the child's life, he's just gonna feel this, like, undue burden of having a child.
And if I tell him and he does, then what I am I gonna do?
'Cause I don't wanna sound classist or whatever, but I'm not raising my child half the year on an all-inclusive resort.
I'm just gonna, like, treat him like a sperm donor, okay?
And sperm donors traditionally are not told.
Yeah, that's a good point.
Well, you know, as someone who was a sperm donor,
I can tell you I certainly did want to be a part of that child's life.
Do you have a kid, Keith?
Sadly, no, Hannah.
You know, my lesbian friends, Aminy and Roni... you met them, Tad, the pot roast people.
- Pot roast.
- Ah... they wanted to use my sperm, but it didn't work out.
Anyway, after they started trying, they told me they didn't want to tell the child that I was the father, and it was extremely upsetting.
I mean, that person would have been a part of my life.
But, honey, this story is different.
The man Hannah lay with wasn't having sex with the intent to make a child.
Nothing about his life projects the idea that he wants a child.
Well, it still doesn't change the fact that the child will be his.
Hannah's already decided.
It's her body.
And I think we all need to do exactly what we feel is right for us.
I clearly learned that lesson the hard way.
Oh, well, come on, you can't...
you can't equate what Hannah's doing with your lifetime denial of being a gay man.
- They both involve personal freedom.
- You guys don't have to get
- worked up about...
- Well, look at it this way, as a mother, Hannah has to decide what's best for the baby.
And not telling the father is what she's decided is best.
Are you going to tell every mother how to raise their child?
I just don't think she has enough information to make a fair decision.
She doesn't know who this guy is, what he wants.
I mean, I have a pretty good sense of who he is.
He wears, like, a puka shell necklace and his days off are Thursday and Tuesday.
Your mother tells me you're the next Jennifer Lopez minus the acting chops.
Yeah, that's exactly how I want people to describe me.
I was in a ska band when I was your age.
- Mm.
- It was the time of my life.
- So fun.
- And then guess what.
- What?
- It got even better.
Anyway, for me, like, being in a band is mostly stressful because, like, it's my only livelihood.
Totally.
I remember when we were touring
- with the Fugees,
- EVIE:
Mm!
I was so messed up, I got on
- the wrong bus
- Yes!
and had to hitchhike through Hungary.
- Wait, uh...
- It can get stressful for sure.
You toured with the Fugees?
- Just for a year.
- Yeah, she dated Pras.
Wow, sounds like you got a lot further than I have.
Well, if you're half as good as your mother says, you'll get there.
I'm excited to hear your sound.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm bummed it can't be tonight, but maybe some other time.
We have some other gigs, maybe, soon.
- What?
- Oh, you haven't heard.
My musical counterpart overdosed on some kind of, like, heavy narcotic.
I don't know.
Anyway, I can't really do it without him.
She's kidding.
You know, like, rock 'n' roll humor.
Aah!
- Um, ah, so, listen, um...
- No, I'm not... why don't I help you set up?
I think it's about time to... yeah, let's go.
- You're not wearing a watch.
- Well, I know what time it is.
Listen to me.
I convinced Sharva to book you over JC Chasez, so you have to perform.
No, Mom, I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.
Desi's completely incapacitated.
I'm bummed out, too.
Um... holy shit!
I can do this!
- What?
- I know enough of your chords.
I've memorized all the lyrics, so I can back you up, Marnie!
- Fuck, no.
- Oh, no.
Fuck, yes!
Why the fuck do we stay open till 10:00 PM?
Anyone who's buying leather gloves after 6:00 is clearly a goddamn murderer.
I know.
And I have an audition at 9:00 in the morning.
Actually, since we're stuck here, would you run lines with me?
Just once through to make sure I know it.
Fine.
You're Dustin because I'm Lavinia, obviously.
Okay.
Oh, dark.
Okay.
So, you walk in shell-shocked.
And... go.
Lavinia?
Lavinia, are you home?
Dinner's almost ready.
Dustin?
Is something wrong?
It was so dark, I didn't...
I didn't see her.
I...
She just... she came out of nowhere.
Dustin, what's going on?
There was a little girl...
Well, what?
Tell me what happened!
What did you do?
I hit her.
I turned the corner and... and...
and she... and she was just there.
- I don't...
I don't know.
- Well, is she all right?
I panicked.
I was so...
I was so close.
I...
I c...
I was so close to home.
I couldn't focus, so I... so I just came here.
You ran?
You hit a little girl and ran?
I couldn't stay!
I stopped by a bar.
After work.
I had one drink, but maybe...
- Maybe it was strong?
I don't...
- Well, is she dead?
- Did I get that line right?
- Yeah.
Dustin, did you kill her?
I don't know!
Well, what were you doing at a bar?
I was there to meet a woman.
What?
My whole life...
My whole life is... is gone.
I had one bad moment and... now it's gone.
Jesus, man, you're fucking good.
Oh, thanks.
Hey, when you do the "And what?"
do it here, but don't do it here.
- Do you know what I mean?
Like...
- Um...
Like to say it, but don't say it.
Hello?
It's me.
Fuck.
You're pregnant?
Yeah, and I also have a lot of work to do, so I can't really...
Can I come in?
Fine.
I'm hurt.
It's just really fucking sad to hear it from Adam.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I really didn't want to tell him.
He was just following me down my block.
Why didn't you call me?
Do I really have to answer that question for you, Jessa?
All right, Hannah.
Listen... regardless of everything that happened, you are still my dear friend.
I can try and forget about you.
It just doesn't work.
Will you please be quiet?
I mean, come on.
Your "dear friend"?
We haven't acted like friends in a long time.
In fact, maybe not ever.
I don't think we ever acted like real friends.
Seriously, Hannah?
You can't just detach yourself from a relationship.
Unless you're some kind of... psychopath.
Well, maybe you're a psychopath for just coming over here.
You know, and how are you gonna be a therapist if you can't even figure out what's going on in your own life, which is that I clearly didn't tell you for a reason, which is that I don't care what you think.
And I don't care about your feelings 'cause I don't really care about you anymore, Jessa.
Okay.
All right, so... how's this gonna work, then?
What's the plan?
So I'm just gonna leave here and then you and I are gonna figure out some way that we don't ever see each other again.
That's the plan, huh?
So, bye.
Bye.
And for the record,
I am a sociopath.
But you are a fucking psychopath, and it's so much worse.
Everything that we did together happened, whether you want to believe it or not.
Whether you want to remember it or not.
And I am here and I know you.
You can't just erase people.
You can't just erase me.
That's not how it works.
I don't care anymore.
Rest in peace.

So, everyone, let's wish the sassy Sharva the happiest of babely birthdays!

I mean, even if you're amazing at something, that doesn't necessarily mean that you should do it, right?
And if I'm saying that I'm a Broadway-caliber actor, shouldn't I only be auditioning for things that would take place on Broadway?
I mean, the only reason I would actually do it is because it would be, like, a favor to Padgett, because Padgett was like, "Oh, Elijah, ah, you reinvented the form.
I can't imagine this part being even played by anyone else.
I-I-I feel like you're the only one who could do it.
It's probably not even gonna happen if you don't say yes."
So, I was like, "Jesus, Padgett, calm down.
Like, yes, I'll maybe think about it, but I just don't know if it's the best use of my time right now."
And, plus, I'm a little on the fence with her commitment...
But it's veggie patty night.
Who are we if we don't stick to our commitments?
Poseidon Caribbean Paradise.
How can I direct your call?
Yeah, um, I'm looking for, ah, Paul-Louis.
I believe he's the head of the water skiing, ah, department.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm remote.
I'm just an operator.
You know what?
I'm just gonna try you back.
Don't even... just forget it.
_

Oh, fuck!
- Your pussy's too tight.
- You have to fix it.
We have to fix it with your cock.
Great, it's porno.
Jesus.
You make me feel so good.
I think you make me feel too good.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Well, maybe it is.
Why?
I break things, Mira.
That's what I do.
It's why I avoided you for so long, 'cause I didn't wanna break you.
But this, now... so perfect, it scares me a little.
The only time I've ever felt perfect is when I'm with you, and you're telling me I'm perfect.
I wish we could stay right here
- forever.
- Mm.
That's a nice idea.
But I don't wanna get a UTI... so, I'll be heading to the bathroom now.

How do you feel about me dressing the salad?
I feel good if you think you can do it without overdressing it.
I'll probably just, you know, stick with this.
Perfect.
Um, so I know that this dinner is because you have some big news to tell me, and I don't wanna top your news, but Ray broke up with me.
( sighs )
- Can you believe that?
- Kind of, yeah.
I mean, you're, like, a horrible cunt to him, so.
I'm sorry, Marnie.
It's just this man drama cycle is so endless.
I can't keep up anymore.
Ray was supposed to break the cycle.
And besides, he was just supposed to be grateful that I even wanted to talk to him.
Anyway, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to top your news.
So, what do you got?
Well, um...
- I'm pregnant.
- That's very funny.
Not a joke, just what's going on in my uterus.
Holy fucking shit.
Hannah, how did this happen?
How does anything happen?
I went to the Hamptons.
Yeah, and you decided just to not use any birth control whatsoever?
I told him to pull out, but you know I tend to swallow my Ps, so maybe he thought I said, "All out." I don't know.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Hannah, the pull-out method does not work.
I literally know hundreds of pull-out babies.
You do not know a hundred babies.
Hannah, what are you going to do?
Well, that's the news.
I'm gonna keep it.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
Stop fucking with me.
You're not gonna have a baby.
I'm gonna have a baby.
I'm into it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
You're old enough, so, yeah.
And, you know, on the spectrum of human beings, you basically have your shit together.
Plus, wouldn't it be kind of great just to have somebody else to consider?
I can't believe how supportive you're being.
This is a shock.
It kind of makes me want to do it less.
Oh, my God!
This is wild.
Okay, I have a million questions.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
No, it's, like, way too early for that, but if it's not a girl, or like, the gayest boy in the entire world, obviously I'm gonna flip the fuck out.
Oh, the father.
Like, is he gonna be involved?
Is he gonna help?
- I'm not telling him.
- He doesn't know?
No, I don't want him to be a part of the kid's life, so why would I tell him?
Because he's the father and he deserves to know.
That's a pretty patriarchal, old-fashioned attitude to have.
You are obviously going to tell him eventually.
But even if you weren't planning on it, your baby is gonna grow up to wonder, like, "Where is my father and why did he leave us?"
Yeah, and I can worry about that when she can talk, when she's, like, seven.
And until then, I don't want to have to trouble him.
He has enough stress with, like, his, you know, water skiing issues and his girlfriend.
So, he's a water skier with a girlfriend?
It's my body, okay, and it's my baby, and I have made the choice that I am not going to tell him.
Okay, I take back what I said about you having your shit together because this is fucking insane.
I knew that you were gonna try to be controlling and control the entire way that I brought my child into this world.
And I probably shouldn't have even told you until I was in labor.
Marnie:
Oh, my God, this is first trimester hormones, isn't it?
No!
( music playing )
Okay, so, I thought we would start with "Whoa, Whoa, Wonderful."
And then I think it would be cool to go into "Song for Marcus Garvey."
Then I was thinking we'd do "The Boys at Home."
I ain't singing no war stories tonight.
Uh-uh.
Okay, what about "Coco Kelly Shelly"?
What the fuck did you just do?
That's a rental!
You know what?
( sucks teeth )
I can't do this right now.
I'm feeling really overworked.
Sorry.
We haven't done a show in two weeks and you don't have any other job.
- What are you working on?
- Yeah.
You know what?
I've been thinking about this show for two weeks, okay?
And it's left me totally fucking drained.
I got nothing.
Oh, Jesus Christ, just get through tonight and tomorrow night for Sharva's birthday, and then you can go on a well-earned vacation.
- Excuse me.
Time out, Marnie.
- You can go on a fucking cruise.
Excuse me.
What's tomorrow?
My mom's friend's birthday in New Jersey.
We've gone over this.
- Is that a joke?
- Nope.
Fuck!
Marnie, I told you no more bullshit gigs.
- Oh, Jesus.
- No more bullshit gigs!
I'm tired of being exploited.
Exploited?
Rehab let me know that you exploit me.
No, no, no.
I see what you're doing.
Do not change the fucking subject.
You're not getting out of this.
This show means way too much to my mom.
And her friendship with Sharva is pretty much all she's got left.
And by the way, not that you give a shit, but we are being paid handsomely for this and we need the money.
Oh, money.
Money!
Yes, the fucking money!
Oh, the money!
Oh!
Fuck money!
( spits )
Do you honestly think that I'm, like, dying to perform at some shitty club in New Jersey called "La Vue"?
I couldn't possibly imagine what you do or do not want to do.
You used to be a dream come true.
This whole job used to be a dream come true.
Now it is a bad dream come true.
I cannot believe that this is my fucking life!
Where the fuck are you going?
Taking five.
Then I'm gonna maybe kill myself or something.
I'm not sure.
( sighs )
What are you doing today?
Oh, I'm just interviewing this controversial app creator for "Esquire,"
and then I have dinner with my dad and Keith.
Oh.
My friend Carlos is having a hot dog taco party.
It's not hot dogs and tacos, rather, he makes the tacos out of hot dogs.
I thought I would go by before my shift at Bendel's.
Do you want to come?
I can't.
I'm on deadline for this thing.
Totally.
Cool.
Um, I just thought you would really like those taco dogs.
( laughs )
For the record, I don't think you're going to be a terrible mother.
You're maybe not gonna be the best, but you're certainly not gonna be the worst.
I mean, Candy Spelling is still alive, so.
I wasn't trying to say that I was gonna, like, win any prizes.
I'm just not gonna, like, call my kid fat or let a teacher massage them or whatever.
Yeah, better than either of our parents did.
Plus, everybody I know with great parents is boring as shit.
You're right.
Like, remember that guy Steve I dated freshman year?
He loved his parents so much, he couldn't even get an erection.
Yeah, see?
People with great parents they name kid "Steve."
Anyway, I just...
I feel badly for what I said.
And I guess if I'm being honest,
I just...
I really liked it when we both didn't have anything going on in our lives.
What you said really scared me.
You made me feel like this baby was gonna end our friendship.
I don't want our friendship to end.
I need you in my life.
I need you in my child's life.
I want to be in your child's life.
I just don't think I'm gonna be a very good influence.
Neither am I, obviously.
( laughs )
But our kid's gonna have great skin and be the right kind of slutty.
- "Our kid."
- Mm-hmm.
- Love you.
- I love you.
To be clear, I'm not offering to pay for anything.
- Nothing?
- No.
Mm.
( phone chiming )
Adam will not stop calling me.
- Gross.
- What do you want?
- Did you watch it?
- No, dude, and I can't.
I don't have time.
I'm late for work.
( mouthing words ) I love you.
Well, I think you should watch it.
Adam, I don't want to watch it, okay?
Great, you're stalking me now?
That's very three-years-ago.
I appreciate it.
I need you to watch the movie, Hannah.
- Why?
- Because it's a movie I made about us.
For us.
And for the world.
But mostly for us.
Great, so you expect me to believe you made anything for me?
- That is very rich.
- Why are you avoiding it so hard?
It's not a big commitment.
It's just under 47 minutes.
I'm avoiding it 'cause I'd literally rather do anything else.
Like I would prefer to eat my own arm.
But maybe your resistance is telling you that you actually need to be watching it.
It's really not.
This is like when everyone was telling me I had to watch "The Wire."
I didn't want to watch "The Wire."
I don't care about that show.
Why are you pushing me?
Because I need you... okay.
'Cause I need you to tell me if it's real.
I made a movie about what we went through, okay?
And I need you to tell me if I got it right.
That my memories are your memories.
You know, did I lie about anything?
I want to know we felt the same things.
I guarantee you we did not.
Please!
I need you to watch it so I can move on and do my film festival submissions.
Submit!
Submit away, Adam.
Go to Cannes, I don't care.
But I think when you watch it, you'll be liberated from what I can say were, for me, some very painful memories.
Great, our relationship amounted to very painful memories for you.
- Such soothing information.
- Not the relationship.
The dissolution of a relationship.
Don't you want to stop carrying around all the baggage of our failures?
I think my film can grant you that.
I know it can.
- It can help you move on.
- I have moved on.
You know you haven't!
Look at yourself!
Look how angry you're getting.
I'm not angry!
I have moved on.
Well, I don't believe you.
Well, I'm pregnant.
What?
Yeah, Adam.
I'm two months pregnant.
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.
Who's the... who's the father?
Is it...
Is it Jan's?
No, it's not Fran's.
Okay?
It's not important who it is.
I don't know if I want him to be part of the kid's life.
I might not even tell him.
You can't do that.
Well, I'm doing it.
Wait, Hannah.
Hannah, will you talk to me, please?
No!
Just for one second!
Fuck.
Yeah, I cannot believe that you got to rent out La Vue on a Friday night.
That must have cost you a fortune.
Well, let's just say the owner owed me a favor for fucking him.
- Ah, nice.
- Good Lord.
Oh, Marnie, don't be such a prude.
( laughing )
Yo.
We sound checking or what?
Yeah, I'm just, um, waiting on my partner still.
I gotta split.
I gotta pick my girl up from the hospital.
Why don't you just get her an Uber?
He's not here in five minutes, I bounce.
- Wow.
- For very real.
- Marnie:
All right, dude.
- I'll talk to him.
Yeah, I'll talk to him, too.
Aah!
Mom, that is gross.
Well... you are basically an hour late.
( scoffs )
Marn, you're lucky I came at all.
Oh, yes, I'm so grateful that you showed up to your motherfucking job.
This isn't my job.
I did not sign up for all of this.
Well, you signed a contract with a record label and then you opted to do a tristate tour, so I don't really know what you thought you were signing up for.
( mumbling )
Desi?
Desi.
( snapping ) What the fuck is wrong with you?
I can't believe I'm in fucking New Jersey right now.
Did you get any sleep last night?
( groaning )
What am I doing?
Oh, my God.
Okay.
If you actually care about being a musician,
I feel like you need to start showing up places, doing this shit...
I'm not a musician, bella.
You're not?
Never have been.
I was just acting like one.
Before that, I was just acting like being an actor.
Before that, I was just acting like being a big game photographer.
I'm always acting like I'm something, but now I'm, like... done.
What happened to you?
So gorgeous.
You've gotta get down here and see his biceps.
It's unbelievable.
What's wrong with you?
- Let's do this.
- Let me call you back.
- No, no, no.
What's...
- Hey...
What is your problem?
Oh...
He is really high.
Are you fucking high?
Marnie, you should really know what a high person looks like by now.
Oh, God.
I can't believe you married that jerk.
Oh, my God, Mom.
I married that jerk because of the way you raised me.
Uh, what are you talking about?
Everything you ever did was for a man.
You realize you basically pushed me to get married, right?
Because the only thing that ever mattered in our fucking household was male approval.
Wha...
- And now I find myself on the wrong side of my 20s...
Oh.
Aww. - ...without a stead job or a relationship.
And Hannah is having a baby and I will need to be there for her.
And you two are preventing me from becoming the godmother that I need to be.
Hannah's having a baby?
Yeah.
( scoffs ) That's a mistake.
Hannah:
I just kind of think it's, like, a lose-lose, okay?
If I tell him and he doesn't want to be part of the child's life, he's just gonna feel this, like, undue burden of having a child.
And if I tell him and he does, then what I am I gonna do?
'Cause I don't wanna sound classist or whatever, but I'm not raising my child half the year on an all-inclusive resort.
I'm just gonna, like, treat him like a sperm donor, okay?
And sperm donors traditionally are not told.
Yeah, that's a good point.
Well, you know, as someone who was a sperm donor,
I can tell you I certainly did want to be a part of that child's life.
Do you have a kid, Keith?
Sadly, no.
You know, my lesbian friends, Aminy and Roni... you met them, Tad, the pot roast people.
Pot roast.
They wanted to use my sperm, but it didn't work out.
Anyway, after they started trying, they told me they didn't want to tell the child that I was the father, and it was extremely upsetting.
I mean, that person would have been a part of my life.
But, honey, this story is different.
The man Hannah lay with wasn't having sex with the intent to make a child.
Nothing about his life projects the idea that he wants a child.
Well, it still doesn't change the fact that the child will be his.
Hannah's already decided.
It's her body.
I think we all need to do exactly what we feel is right for us.
I clearly learned that lesson the hard way.
Oh, come on, you can't equate what Hannah's doing with your lifetime denial of being a gay man.
They both involve personal freedom.
You guys don't have to get worked up about...
As a mother, Hannah has to decide what's best for the baby.
And not telling the father is what she's decided is best.
Are you going to tell every mother how to raise their child?
I just don't think she has enough information to make a fair decision.
She doesn't know who this guy is, what he wants.
I have a pretty good sense of who he is.
He wears, like, a puka shell necklace and his days off are Thursday and Tuesday.
Your mother tells me you're the next Jennifer Lopez minus the acting chops.
Yeah, that's exactly how I want people to describe me.
I was in a ska band when I was your age.
Mm.
- It was the time of my life.
- So fun.
- And then guess what.
- What?
It got even better.
( laughing )
Anyway, for me, like, being in a band is mostly stressful because, like, it's my only livelihood.
Totally.
I remember when we were touring with the Fugees,
I was so messed up, I got on the wrong bus and had to hitchhike through Hungary.
Wait, uh...
- It can get stressful for sure.
You toured with the Fugees?
- Just for a year.
- Yeah, she dated Pras.
Wow, sounds like you got a lot further than I have.
Well, if you're half as good as your mother says, you'll get there.
I'm excited to hear your sound.
Oh, yeah.
I'm bummed it can't be tonight, but maybe some other time.
We have some other gigs, maybe, soon.
- What?
- Oh, you haven't heard.
My musical counterpart overdosed on some kind of, like, heavy narcotic.
I don't know.
Anyway, I can't really do it without him.
She's kidding.
You know, like, rock 'n' roll humor.
Aah!
No, I'm not...
- So, listen, why don't I help you set up?
I think it's about time to... yeah, let's go.
- You're not wearing a watch.
- Well, I know what time it is.
Listen to me.
I convinced Sharva to book you over JC Chasez, so you have to perform.
No, Mom, I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.
Desi's completely incapacitated.
I'm bummed out, too.
Um... holy shit!
I can do this!
- What?
- I know enough of your chords.
I've memorized all the lyrics, so I can back you up, Marnie!
Fuck, no.
Oh, no.
Fuck, yes!
Why the fuck do we stay open till 10:00 PM?
Anyone who's buying leather gloves after 6:00 is clearly a goddamn murderer.
I know.
And I have an audition at 9:00 in the morning.
Actually, since we're stuck here, would you run lines with me?
Just once through to make sure I know it.
Fine.
You're Dustin because I'm Lavinia, obviously.
Okay.
Oh, dark.
- Okay.
- So, you walk in shell-shocked.
And... go.
Lavinia?
Lavinia, are you home?
Dinner's almost ready.
Dustin?
Is something wrong?
It was so dark, I didn't...
I didn't see her.
She just... she came out of nowhere.
Dustin, what's going on?
There was a little girl...
Well, what?
Tell me what happened!
What did you do?
I hit her.
I turned the corner and...
and she was just there.
I...
I don't know.
Well, is she all right?
I panicked.
I was so...
I was so close.
I...
I was so close to home.
I couldn't focus, so I just came here.
You ran?
You hit a little girl and ran?
I couldn't stay!
I stopped by a bar.
After work.
I had one drink, but maybe...
Maybe it was strong?
I don't...
Well, is she dead?
Did I get that line right?
Yeah.
Dustin, did you kill her?
I don't know!
Well, what were you doing at a bar?
I was there to meet a woman.
( gasps ) What?
My whole life...
My whole life is... is gone.
I had one bad moment and... now it's gone.
( scoffs )
Jesus, man, you're fucking good.
Oh, thanks.
Hey, when you do the "And what?"
do it here, but don't do it here.
- Do you know what I mean?
Like...
- Um...
Like to say it, but don't say it.
( knocking )
Hello?
Jessa:
It's me.
Fuck.
You're pregnant?
Yeah, and I also have a lot of work to do, so I can't really...
Can I come in?
Fine.
I'm hurt.
It's just really fucking sad to hear it from Adam.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I really didn't want to tell him.
He was just following me down my block.
Why didn't you call me?
Do I really have to answer that question for you, Jessa?
( sighs )
All right, Hannah.
Listen.
Regardless of everything that happened, you are still my dear friend.
I can try and forget about you.
It just doesn't work.
Will you please be quiet?
I mean, come on.
Your "dear friend"?
We haven't acted like friends in a long time.
In fact, maybe not ever.
I don't think we ever acted like real friends.
Seriously, Hannah?
You can't just detach yourself from a relationship.
Unless you're some kind of... psychopath.
Well, maybe you're a psychopath for just coming over here.
And how are you gonna be a therapist if you can't even figure out what's going on in your own life, which is that I clearly didn't tell you for a reason, which is that I don't care what you think.
And I don't care about your feelings 'cause I don't really care about you anymore, Jessa.
Okay.
All right, so... how's this gonna work, then?
What's the plan?
So I'm just gonna leave here and then you and I are gonna figure out some way that we don't ever see each other again.
That's the plan, huh?
So, bye.
Bye.
And for the record,
I am a sociopath.
But you are a fucking psychopath.
And it's so much worse.
Everything that we did together happened, whether you want to believe it or not.
Whether you want to remember it or not.
And I am here and I know you.
You can't just erase people.
You can't just erase me.
That's not how it works.
I don't care anymore.
Rest in peace.

( laughs ) And, um... we are gonna do a little set gig for one of my very best friends...
Sharva Pontemucci.
I did not know what a good time was until you came into my life.
I just wanna say that I am so happy to be a part of your... party rock crew.
So, everyone, let's wish the sassy Sharva the happiest of babely birthdays!

Elijah:
I mean, even if you're amazing at something, that doesn't necessarily mean that you should do it, right?
And if I'm saying that I'm a Broadway-caliber actor, shouldn't I only be auditioning for things that would take place on Broadway?
I mean, the only reason I would actually do it is because it would be, like, a favor to Padgett, because Padgett was like, "Oh, Elijah, you reinvented the form.
I can't imagine this part being even played by anyone else.
I feel like you're the only one who could do it.
It's probably not even gonna happen if you don't say yes."
So, I was like, "Jesus, Padgett, calm down.
Like, yes, I'll maybe think about it, but I just don't know if it's the best use of my time right now."
And, plus, I'm a little on the fence with her commitment...
But it's veggie patty night.
Who are we if we don't stick to our commitments?

Woman's voice:

How can I direct your call?
Yeah, I'm looking for Paul-Louis.
I believe he's the head of the water skiing department.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm remote.
I'm just an operator.
You know what?
I'm just gonna try you back.
Don't even...
just forget it.

You have to fix it with your cock.

Great, it's porno.
Mira:
Jesus.
( panting )
You make me feel so good.
I think you make me feel too good.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Well, maybe it is.
Why?
Adam:
I break things, Mira.
That's what I do.
It's why I avoided you for so long, 'cause I didn't wanna break you.
( exhales )
But this, now... so perfect, it scares me a little.
Mira:
The only time I've ever felt perfect is when I'm with you, and you're telling me I'm perfect.
I wish we could stay right here forever.
That's a nice idea.
But I don't wanna get a UTI... ( chuckles ) so, I'll be heading to the bathroom now.

How do you feel about me dressing the salad?
I feel good if you think you can do it without overdressing it.
I'll probably just, you know, stick with this.
Perfect.
Um, so I know that this dinner is because you have some big news to tell me, and I don't wanna top your news, but, um, Ray broke up with me. (sighs)
- Can you believe that?
- Kind of, yeah.
I mean, you're, like, a horrible cunt to him, so.
I'm sorry, Marnie.
It's just this man drama cycle is so endless.
I can't keep up anymore.
Ray was supposed to break the cycle.
And besides, he was just supposed to be grateful that I even wanted to talk to him.
Anyway, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to top your news.
So, what do you got?
Well, um...
- I'm pregnant.
- That's very funny.
Not a joke, just what's going on in my uterus.
Holy fucking shit.
Hannah, how did this happen?
How does anything happen?
I went to the Hamptons.
Yeah, and you decided just to not use any birth control whatsoever?
I told him to pull out, but you know I tend to swallow my Ps, so maybe he thought I said, "All out." I don't know.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Hannah, the pull-out method does not work.
I literally know hundreds of pull-out babies.
You do not know a hundred babies.
Hannah, what are you going to do?
Well, that's the news.
I'm gonna keep it.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
Stop fucking with me.
You're not gonna have a baby.
I'm gonna have a baby.
I'm into it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
You're old enough, so, yeah.
And, you know, on the spectrum of human beings, you basically have your shit together.
Plus, wouldn't it be kind of great just to have somebody else to consider?
I can't believe how supportive you're being.
This is a shock.
It kind of makes me want to do it less.
Oh, my God!
This is wild.
Okay, I have a million questions.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
No, it's, like, way too early for that, but if it's not a girl, or like, the gayest boy in the entire world, obviously I'm gonna flip the fuck out.
Oh, the father.
Like, is he gonna be involved?
Is he gonna help?
- I'm not telling him.
- He doesn't know?
No, I don't want him to be a part of the kid's life, so why would I tell him?
Because he's the father and he deserves to know.
That's a pretty patriarchal, old-fashioned attitude to have.
You are obviously going to tell him eventually.
But even if you weren't planning on it, your baby is gonna grow up to wonder, like, "Where is my father and why did he leave us?"
Yeah, and I can worry about that when she can talk, when she's, like, seven.
And until then, I don't want to have to trouble him.
He has enough stress with, like, his, you know, water skiing issues
- and his girlfriend.
- He's a water skier with a girlfriend?
It's my body, okay, and it's my baby, and I have made the choice that I am not going to tell him.
Okay, I take back what I said about you having your shit together because this is fucking insane.
I knew that you were gonna try to be controlling and control the entire way that I brought my child into this world.
And I probably shouldn't have even told you until I was in labor.
MARNIE:
Oh, my God, this is first trimester hormones, isn't it?
No!
(music playing)
Okay, so, I thought we would start with "Whoa, Whoa, Wonderful."
And then I think it would be cool to go into "Song for Marcus Garvey."
Then I was thinking we'd do "The Boys at Home."
I ain't singing no war stories tonight.
Uh-uh.
Okay, what about "Coco Kelly Shelly"?
What the fuck did you just do?
That's a rental!
You know what?
(sucks teeth)
I can't do this right now.
I'm feeling really overworked.
Sorry.
We haven't done a show in two weeks and you don't have any other job.
- Yeah.
- What are you working on?
You know what?
I've been thinking about this show for two weeks, okay?
And it's left me totally fucking drained.
I got nothing.
Oh, Jesus Christ, just get through tonight and tomorrow night for Sharva's birthday, and then you
- can go on a well-earned vacation.
- Excuse me.
- You can go on a fucking cruise.
- Time out, Marnie.
Excuse me.
What's tomorrow?
My mom's friend's birthday in New Jersey.
We've gone over this.
- Is that a joke?
- Nope.
Fuck!
Marnie, I told you no more bullshit gigs.
- Oh, Jesus.
- No more bullshit gigs!
I'm tired of being exploited.
Exploited?
Rehab let me know that you exploit me.
No, no, no.
I see what you're doing.
Do not change the fucking subject.
You're not getting out of this.
This show means way too much to my mom.
And her friendship with Sharva is pretty much all she's got left.
And by the way, not that you give a shit, but we are being paid handsomely for this and we need the money.
Oh, money.
Money!
Yes, the fucking money!
Oh, the money!
Oh!
Fuck money!
(spits)
Do you honestly think that I'm, like, dying to perform at some shitty club in New Jersey
- called "La Vue"?
- I couldn't possibly imagine what you do or do not want to do.
You used to be a dream come true.
This whole job used to be a dream come true.
Now it is a bad dream come true.
I cannot believe that this is my fucking life!
Where the fuck are you going?
Taking five.
You know, maybe kill myself or something.
I'm not sure.
(sighs)
What are you doing today?
Oh, I'm just interviewing this controversial app creator for "Esquire,"
and then I have dinner with my dad and Keith.
Oh.
Ah, my friend Carlos is having a hot dog taco party.
It's not hot dogs and tacos, rather, he makes the tacos out of hot dogs.
I thought I would go by before my shift at Bendel's.
Do you want to come?
I can't.
I'm on deadline for this thing.
Totally.
Cool.
Um, I just thought you would really like those taco dogs.
(laughs)
For the record, uh, I don't think you're going to be a terrible mother.
You're maybe not gonna be the best, but you're certainly not gonna be the worst.
I mean, Candy Spelling is still alive, so.
Well, I wasn't trying to say that I was gonna, like, win any prizes.
I'm just not gonna, like, call my kid fat or let a teacher massage them or whatever.
Yeah, better than either of our parents did.
Plus, everybody I know with great parents is boring as shit.
You're right.
Like, remember that guy Steve I dated freshman year?
He loved his parents so much, he couldn't even get an erection.
Yeah, see?
People with great parents they name kid "Steve."
Anyway, I just...
I feel badly for what I said.
And I guess if I'm being honest, I just...
I really liked it when we both didn't have anything going on in our lives.
What you said really scared me.
You made me feel like this baby was gonna end our friendship.
I don't want our friendship to end.
I need you in my life.
I need you in my child's life.
I want to be in your child's life.
I just don't think I'm gonna be a very good influence.
Neither am I, obviously.
(laughs)
But our kid's gonna have great skin and be the right kind of slutty.
- "Our kid."
- Mm-hmm.
- Love you.
- I love you.
To be clear, I'm not offering to pay for anything.
- Nothing?
Mm.
- No.
(phone chiming)
- Adam will not stop calling me.
- Gross.
What do you want?
- ADAM:
Did you watch it?
- No, dude, and I can't.
I don't have time.
I'm late for work.
(mouthing words) I love you.
(mouthing words) I love you.
Well, I think you should watch it.
Adam, I don't want to watch it, okay?
Great, you're stalking me now?
That's very three-years-ago.
- I appreciate it.
- I need you to watch the movie, Hannah.
- Why?
- Because it's a movie I made about us.
Like, for us.
And for the world.
But mostly for us.
Great, so you expect me to believe you made anything for me?
- That is very rich.
- Why are you avoiding it so hard?
It's not a big commitment.
It's just under 47 minutes.
I'm avoiding it 'cause I'd literally rather do anything else.
Like I would prefer to eat my own arm.
But maybe your resistance is telling you that you actually need to be watching it.
It's really not.
This is like when everyone was telling me I had to watch "The Wire."
I didn't want to watch "The Wire." I don't care about that show.
- Why are you pushing me?
- Because I need you... okay.
Becau... 'cause I need you to tell me if it's real.
I made a movie about what we went through, okay?
An... and I need you to tell me if I got it right.
That my memories are your memories.
You know, did I lie about anything?
I wanna know we felt the same things.
I guarantee you we did not.
Please!
I need you to watch it so I can move on and do my film festival submissions.
Submit!
Submit away, Adam.
Go to Cannes, I don't care.
But I think when you watch it, you'll be liberated from what I can say were, for me, some very painful memories.
Great, our relationship amounted to very painful memories for you.
- Such soothing information.
- Not the relationship.
The dissolution of a relationship.
Don't you want to stop carrying around all the baggage of our failures?
I think my film can grant you that.
I know it can.
- It can help you move on.
- I have moved on.
You know you haven't!
Look at yourself!
Look how angry you're getting.
- I'm not angry!
I have moved on.
- Well, I don't believe you.
Well, I'm pregnant.
What?
Yeah, Adam.
I'm two months pregnant.
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.
Who's the... who's the father?
Is it...
Is it Jan's?
No, it's not Fran's.
Okay?
It's not important who it is.
I don't know if I want him to be part of the kid's life.
I might not even tell him.
You can't do that.
Well, I'm doin' it.
Wait, Hannah.
Hannah, will you talk to me, please?
No!
Just for one second!
Fuck.
Yeah, I cannot believe that you got to rent out La Vue on a Friday night.
Like, that must have cost you a fortune.
Well, let's just say the owner owed me a favor for fucking him.
- Ah, nice.
- Good Lord.
Oh, Marnie, don't be such a prude.
(laughing)
Yo.
We sound checkin' or what?
Yeah, I'm just, um, waiting on my partner still.
I gotta split.
I gotta pick my girl up from the hospital.
Why don't you just get her an Uber?
He's not here in five minutes, I bounce.
- Wow.
- For very real.
- MARNIE:
All right, dude.
- I'll talk to him.
- Yeah, I'll talk to him, too.
Aah!
- Mom, that is gross.
Well... you are basically an hour late.
(scoffs)
Marn... you're lucky I came at all.
Oh, yes, I'm so grateful that you showed up to your motherfucking job.
This isn't my job.
I did not sign up for all of this.
Well, you signed a contract with a record label and then you opted to do a tri-state tour, so I don't really know what you thought you were signing up for.
(mumbling incoherently)
Desi?
Desi.
(snapping)
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I can't believe I'm in fucking New Jersey right now.
Did you get any sleep last night?
(groaning)
- What am I doing?
- Oh, my God.
Okay.
If you actually care about being a musician,
I feel like you need to start showing up places, doing this shit...
I'm not a musician, Bella.
You're not?
Never have been.
Just acting like one.
Before that, I was just acting like being an actor.
Before that, I was just acting like being a big game photographer.
I'm always acting like I'm something, but now I'm, like... done.
What happened to you?
So gorgeous.
You've gotta get down here and see his biceps.
It's unbelievable.
What's wrong with you?
- Let's do this.
- Let me call you back.
- No, no, no.
What's...
- Hey...
- What is your problem?
- Mmm...
Oh...
He is really high.
Are you fucking high?
- Marnie, you should really know
- Oh, fucking Christ!
what a high person looks like by now.
Oh, God.
I-I-I can't believe you married that jerk.
Oh, my God, Mom.
I married that jerk because of the way you raised me.
Uh, what are you talking about?
Everything you ever did was for a man.
You realize you basically pushed me to get married, right?
Because the only thing that ever mattered in our fucking household
- was male approval.
And now I
- Wha... find myself on the wrong side of my 20s...
- Oh.
Aww.
- without a stead job or a relationship.
And Hannah is having a baby and I will need to be there for her.
And you two are preventing me from becoming the godmother that I need to be.
Hannah's having a baby?
Yeah.
(scoffs) That's a mistake.
HANNAH:
I just kind of think it's, like, a lose-lose, okay?
If I tell him and he doesn't want to be part of the child's life, he's just gonna feel this, like, undue burden of having a child.
And if I tell him and he does, then what I am I gonna do?
'Cause I don't wanna sound classist or whatever, but I'm not raising my child half the year on an all-inclusive resort.
I'm just gonna, like, treat him like a sperm donor, okay?
And sperm donors traditionally are not told.
Yeah, that's a good point.
Well, you know, as someone who was a sperm donor,
I can tell you I certainly did want to be a part of that child's life.
Do you have a kid, Keith?
Sadly, no, Hannah.
You know, my lesbian friends, Aminy and Roni... (stammering) you met them, Tad, the pot roast people.
- Pot roast.
- Ah... they wanted to use my sperm, but it didn't work out.
Anyway, after they started trying, they told me they didn't want to tell the child that I was the father, and it was extremely upsetting.
I mean, that person would have been a part of my life.
But, honey, this story is different.
The man Hannah lay with wasn't having sex with the intent to make a child.
Nothing about his life projects the idea that he wants a child.
Well, it still doesn't change the fact that the child will be his.
Hannah's already decided.
It's her body.
And I think we all need to do exactly what we feel is right for us.
I clearly learned that lesson the hard way.
Oh, well, come on, you can't...
you can't equate what Hannah's doing with your lifetime denial of being a gay man.
- They both involve personal freedom.
- You guys don't have to get
- worked up about...
- Well, look at it this way, as a mother, Hannah has to decide what's best for the baby.
And not telling the father is what she's decided is best.
Are you going to tell every mother how to raise their child?
I just don't think she has enough information to make a fair decision.
She doesn't know who this guy is, what he wants.
I mean, I have a pretty good sense of who he is.
He wears, like, a puka shell necklace and his days off are Thursday and Tuesday.
Your mother tells me you're the next Jennifer Lopez minus the acting chops.
Yeah, that's exactly how I want people to describe me.
I was in a ska band when I was your age.
- Mm.
- It was the time of my life.
- So fun.
- And then guess what.
- What?
- It got even better.
(laughing)
Anyway, for me, like, being in a band is mostly stressful because, like, it's my only livelihood.
Totally.
I remember when we were touring
- with the Fugees,
- EVIE:
Mm!
I was so messed up, I got on
- the wrong bus
- Yes!
and had to hitchhike through Hungary.
- Wait, uh...
- It can get stressful for sure.
You toured with the Fugees?
- Just for a year.
- Yeah, she dated Pras.
Wow, sounds like you got a lot further than I have.
Well, if you're half as good as your mother says, you'll get there.
I'm excited to hear your sound.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm bummed it can't be tonight, but maybe some other time.
We have some other gigs, maybe, soon.
- What?
- Oh, you haven't heard.
My musical counterpart overdosed on some kind of, like, heavy narcotic.
I don't know.
Anyway, I can't really do it without him.
She's kidding.
You know, like, rock 'n' roll humor.
Aah!
- Um, ah, so, listen, um...
- No, I'm not... why don't I help you set up?
I think it's about time to... yeah, let's go.
- You're not wearing a watch.
- Well, I know what time it is.
Listen to me.
I convinced Sharva to book you over JC Chasez, so you have to perform.
No, Mom, I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.
Desi's completely incapacitated.
I'm bummed out, too.
Um... holy shit!
I can do this!
- What?
- I know enough of your chords.
I've memorized all the lyrics, so I can back you up, Marnie!
- Fuck, no.
- Oh, no.
Fuck, yes!
Why the fuck do we stay open till 10:00 PM?
Anyone who's buying leather gloves after 6:00 is clearly a goddamn murderer.
I know.
And I have an audition at 9:00 in the morning.
Actually, since we're stuck here, would you run lines with me?
Just once through to make sure I know it.
Fine.
You're Dustin because I'm Lavinia, obviously.
Okay.
Oh, dark.
Okay.
So, you walk in shell-shocked.
And... go.
Lavinia?
Lavinia, are you home?
Dinner's almost ready.
Dustin?
Is something wrong?
It was so dark, I didn't...
I didn't see her.
I...
She just... she came out of nowhere.
Dustin, what's going on?
There was a little girl...
Well, what?
Tell me what happened!
What did you do?
I hit her.
I turned the corner and... and...
and she... and she was just there.
- I don't...
I don't know.
- Well, is she all right?
I panicked.
I was so...
I was so close.
I...
I c...
I was so close to home.
I couldn't focus, so I... so I just came here.
You ran?
You hit a little girl and ran?
I couldn't stay!
I stopped by a bar.
After work.
I had one drink, but maybe...
- Maybe it was strong?
I don't...
- Well, is she dead?
- Did I get that line right?
- Yeah.
Dustin, did you kill her?
I don't know!
Well, what were you doing at a bar?
I was there to meet a woman.
(gasps) What?
(sighs)
My whole life...
My whole life is... is gone.
I had one bad moment and... now it's gone.
(scoffs)
Jesus, man, you're fucking good.
Oh, thanks.
Hey, when you do the "And what?"
do it here, but don't do it here.
- Do you know what I mean?
Like...
- Um...
Like to say it, but don't say it.
(knocking)
Hello?
JESSA:
It's me.
Fuck.
You're pregnant?
Yeah, and I also have a lot of work to do, so I can't really...
Can I come in?
Fine.
I'm hurt.
It's just really fucking sad to hear it from Adam.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I really didn't want to tell him.
He was just following me down my block.
Why didn't you call me?
Do I really have to answer that question for you, Jessa?
(sighs)
All right, Hannah.
(clears throat)
Listen... regardless of everything that happened, you are still my dear friend.
I can try and forget about you.
It just doesn't work.
Will you please be quiet?
I mean, come on.
Your "dear friend"?
We haven't acted like friends in a long time.
In fact, maybe not ever.
I don't think we ever acted like real friends.
Seriously, Hannah?
You can't just detach yourself from a relationship.
Unless you're some kind of... psychopath.
Well, maybe you're a psychopath for just coming over here.
You know, and how are you gonna be a therapist if you can't even figure out what's going on in your own life, which is that I clearly didn't tell you for a reason, which is that I don't care what you think.
And I don't care about your feelings 'cause I don't really care about you anymore, Jessa.
Okay.
All right, so... how's this gonna work, then?
What's the plan?
So I'm just gonna leave here and then you and I are gonna figure out some way that we don't ever see each other again.
That's the plan, huh?
So, bye.
Bye.
And for the record,
I am a sociopath.
But you are a fucking psychopath, and it's so much worse.
Everything that we did together happened, whether you want to believe it or not.
Whether you want to remember it or not.
And I am here and I know you.
You can't just erase people.
You can't just erase me.
That's not how it works.
I don't care anymore.

I just wanna say that I am... so happy to be a part of your... party rock crew.
So, everyone, let's wish the sassy Sharva the happiest of babely birthdays!

ELIJAH:
I mean, (sighs) even if you're amazing at something, that doesn't necessarily mean that you should do it, right?
And if I'm saying that I'm a Broadway-caliber actor, shouldn't I only be auditioning for things that would take place on Broadway?
I mean, the only reason I would actually do it is because it would be, like, a favor to Padgett, because Padgett was like, "Oh, Elijah, ah, you reinvented the form.
I can't imagine this part being even played by anyone else.
I-I-I feel like you're the only one who could do it.
It's probably not even gonna happen if you don't say yes."
So, I was like, "Jesus, Padgett, calm down.
Like, yes, I'll maybe think about it, but I just don't know if it's the best use of my time right now."
And, plus, I'm a little on the fence with her commitment...
But it's veggie patty night.
Who are we if we don't stick to our commitments?

Previously on "arrow"...
This laptop contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.
This is most disappointing.
I liked many of you.
Oliver:
Prometheus surprised me unique move.
It was taught to me by a woman that I met in Russia.
You think you and prometheus had the same teacher?
You're accepting the invitation to join helix.
Full throttle.
What do I do with your secret? and... and you're working double-time.
please?
meet my wife Doris.
I thought we could talk.
Can we set up a meeting tomorrow?
I'm late for a dinner.
It's important.
You could call it life or death.
You sure this is the place?
Curtis:
I don't see any other monasteries on this mountain.
Felicity's note said something about a demon... lemon.
but she has not hit me back.
demon.
I'm losing you!
I'll see you back in star city.
Where is she?
Who are you?
I'm a former student.
which means you are not welcome here.
Talia:
No!
Leave us. but you should not have come to this place.
it was difficult to find.
Our business together concluded 5 years ago.
No.
One of your former students is trying to kill me.
Oliver.
He means to destroy you utterly.
You knew?
then why would you train him?
Why wouldn't you warn me?
he sought me out.
He'd already learned much about you.
He's a man of remarkable capacity. then why would you train him? and I helped him in his pursuit of vengeance because by then you'd killed mine!
did I?
you didn't.
It's Talia al ghul.
Ra's al ghul was your father.
Yes. so I forged my own path...
But he was still my father when you put a sword through his chest.
So that's why you're not gonna help me.
That's why you won't tell who this...
Prometheus is. because I want you to suffer.
He calls himself...
Adrian chase.
Everything ok?
Yes.
Peachy.
Heh.
Let's do this.
right?
they're just...
You sound surprised.
I guess I just thought that a secret hacker organization would be intimate.
Heh. kind of like the u.N.
If it actually accomplished things.
You have 3D nanoelectrics designed to interface with a neural network.
We were working on something like this and...
Who do you think we stole the prototype from?
What is that?
Real-time feed from every cell phone camera in the world running through a pattern recognition algo.
Holy...
That's...
So much bigger than anything the NSA is doing.
I know.
That's a lot of power for someone to have who's not government.
the fact that we're not government's not the point.
right?
Yeah.
Power to the people.
Heh.
Felicity.
We're gonna change the world together.
I've been trying to reach you... and I need to know where d.A. Chase is right now.
Mr. chase is in the conference room.
Treatment for drug addicts over incarceration.
I didn't think you'd be joining us this morning.
huh?
- Yeah.
- I've been working on addressing our sentencing policy for drug offenses.
Care to join?
please.
can it wait?
The councilmen and I are on a clock.
you're looking a little ragged.
You tired...
Or is it that you've actually been asleep this whole time?
All the captains are dead. and they will kill us all.
Gonna try it this way now.
I don't know how especially since the city's not too fond of your alter ego these days. see how they feel. arresting me?
I have to say. if only because that's what you want me to do.
But you've done everything I've wanted so far.
Did you really think I'd let all this end in a parking garage?
What did you do?
I gave your girlfriend an exclusive.
Wait.
Are you still dating Susan Williams?
buddy.
It's been a little hard to keep track.
What did you do to her?
She's fine.
Don't worry.
As long as I'm around to make sure she gets some food and water.
Starvation and dehydration...
Terrible way to go.
she dies. she dies.
Now you could try torturing me for her location.
We both know what you're capable of but... who do you think can last longer...
Susan or me? and you haven't even figured out what game we're playing yet.
Quentin:
That son of a bitch.
I'd say that pretty much covers it.
This is a hell of a city you got here.
District attorney's a serial killer.
He's way worse that that.
Infiltrating the government like that at the highest level right next to Oliver?
We underestimated this guy.
I underestimated him.
I trusted him.
Where is Felicity?
but her phone's off.
You don't think that prometheus has...
No.
No.
His game is Susan.
For now.
We have to make sure thea's safe.
Lyla and j.J. Are secure at argus.
I got in touch with thea.
She's fine...
B-but we have to find Susan.
We cannot make a move on chase until we have her here.
Keep looking for Felicity.
You GPS her phone if you have to. tell him chase is the throwing star killer.
and you say what?
we keep the scpd out of this until we have something.
This guy has us in check.
for now.
John:
Sent Curtis and dinah to opal city. we need some of our own.
That's not gonna work.
This guy always seems to be 10 steps ahead.
you confronting him in public like that.
What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't thinking.
Where you going now?
chase's house has a subbasement.
man.
I doubt he has Susan someplace obvious.
I don't know what's obvious anymore.
no.
I can't let you go out there alone.
- I'm going with you.
- I can handle it.
Never said you couldn't.
3 of us cannot defeat Gregor.
We need more men.
No.
We need a way to convince the bratva that Gregor sold them out.
We had way.
we don't have anyone that can pull so...
Gregor will say we are traitors.
Rest of bratva will believe them.
And then they will kill us.
So we've got to kill him first before he tells anyone.
Ok.
You've had enough to drink already.
Where would Gregor go... where would he go right now?
He'd go to ground. but it's heavily protected.
Hmm.
We wouldn't even get through the door.
I think I know someone who can.
I guess Norma bates got the hell out of dodge.
Chase anticipated this play.
I never said that he wasn't clever.
So am I.
Um...
What's your toy doing?
It's detecting resonance frequencies upstairs.
It's not a toy.
It's a t-sphere.
Wait.
Every horror movie ever has basically said that you do not go upstairs at a creepy serial killer's mother's house.
Help!
Unh!
Adrian:
Excellent.
Now give us another scream.
we're supposed to just go to work like things are normal?
Because newsflash...
They ain't.
Tell me something I don't already know.
Chase:
Ho ho!
I did think of one or two things. as it were.
You got some nerve showing up here.
Why wouldn't I?
I take my job very seriously.
I thought my office had requested your verifications on the latest comstat reports from the scpd.
What you been doing?
I'm gonna kill you in ways that will hurt.
Mr. Ramirez.
You think you're so clever.
you son of a bitch!
I think we're just getting started.
I want those comstat verifications on my desk dog.
We can't just let that son of a bitch walk around here.
- We got to do something.
- We are doing something.
Yeah.
Rene and I have got eyes on chase.
He's at city hall.
You got a green light to move on his house.
Roger that.
spartan.
You check the upstairs and work your way down.
I'll sweep the basement.
We can meet in the middle.
Roger that.
- Please don't hurt me.
- Mrs. chase.
What are you doing in my hou...
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Get away from me.
Your husband isn't who you think he is.
Get out of my house.
your husband is the throwing star killer. and I need your help to find her.
please.
You need to understand the truth.
You have to know at some level that your husband has been keeping something from you.
you.
Officer:
On the floor.
On the floor!
Get down on the floor!
On the floor.
Get down on the floor!
Mrs. chase?
I'm...
I'm fine.
We got a call from your husband.
Don't worry.
We got this handled.
Get her out of here.
Tell me what you want me to do.
I am not getting into a shootout with the scpd.
Copy that.
I'm out.
douchebag.
I wasn't talking to you.
Drop the bow and get on the ground!
Whole thing's about 30 seconds long. and there's nothing to indicate a location.
At least it's proof of life. but we don't know how long a...
sorry.
It's fine.
He'll... he'll keep her alive to keep me in check.
I never should have gotten involved with Susan.
I don't know what I was thinking.
man.
Everyone needs somebody.
maybe I gave up that right when I put on the hood.
Felicity:
Hi!
Oh!
Hi!
I'm sorry.
I know I'm late.
I'm sorry.
I got Curtis' messages.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm here now.
Sorry.
please?
Heh.
Much appreciated.
Yeah.
I usually like so thank you.
Heh.
I'm...
Sorry.
I'm not angry.
You don't... you don't work for me.
You...
I'm worried. prometheus could have kkhhk...
ooh.
Not...
I'm worried about you.
Oh. or maybe you just don't want to tell me.
I think we can both agree so... you're right.
It's just that right now is not really a good time with everything going on.
ok?
- Ok.
- But speaking of the something it actually helped me go through the petabyte of data we took off of chase's mother's computer.
- This.
- Who's Simon morrison?
- Adrian chase.
- What?
Simon morrison is his birth name.
That's his real identity.
But his mother's name is Amanda westfield. so it runs in the family.
if Adrian chase is an alias...
Then the proof that his background is fake would be enough for the acu to arrest his ass.
good work.
Let's put this all on the drive.
- I've got to get to city hall.
- Wait.
Oh.
it's past 10:00.
I have to make a statement on the green arrow breaking into the d.A.'S house.
this is a horrifying development.
we believe the green arrow was retaliating against this office for speaking out against his recent crimes.
Mr. mayor.
Ahem.
This office is in complete agreement with d.A. Chase.
This situation has become untenable...
And I am determined to bring it to a just and successful end.
anyone...
Terrorize this city...
And so I am demanding that the green arrow turn himself in.
He has 24 hours before I am ordering the scpd to shoot on sight.
That's all.
Thanks for seeing me.
I know it's late.
I think we both know our jobs don't recognize late and early.
What can I do for you?
What's this?
That is evidence that Adrian chase is a false identity.
His real name is Simon morrison.
you will learn that he is the throwing star killer.
Oh.
That's one hell of an accusation.
That's why I'm giving you that.
And this evidence comes from where?
An investigation that I've been conducting off the books.
With what personnel?
captain pike.
Consider that an order if it helps.
One last thing.
You didn't get that from me.
I serve at the pleasure of the mayor.
There you are. why did you want him gone and why are you playing Robin hood?
I met a woman.
She taught me how to give my darkness an identity so that it doesn't consume me.
And you believed her?
whatever you think is inside you is inside you.
You... you cannot name it like that and keep it apart from you.
This woman's taught me differently. one day she will be the source of your greatest pain.
my god.
And this is... but you helped me I.D. Him as Simon morrison. but someone with a cell phone at some point which means there should be pictures of it on your database.
If I can cross-reference the images I should be able to help the police find her.
really cool and noble and all.
she definitely needs your help...
But?
we gave you pandora. people are starting to ask what you're doing for us.
we didn't invite you in just so you could check items off your to-do list.
Sorry.
It feels gross saying... no.
You're right.
Ok.
you help me.
I was kind of hoping you'd say that.
We've been trying to break the encryption on a certain homeland security drone.
I'm afraid.
Question is what are you willing to quo in exchange for your quid?
can you check some files for me?
Any legal records you can find on a Simon morrison.
Thanks.
Hey.
buddy?
Need some medical attention or something?
Unh!
- What happened?
- Some lowlife attacked him outside the precinct. they did not get a shot of his face.
But...
How's pike?
He's comatose.
This was chase.
Oliver.
Murder by lowlife is not exactly his style.
I gave pike a lead connecting chase to prometheus.
I thought we didn't have any leads.
Felicity resurfaced with something.
Is pike's family in there?
but somebody else is.
isn't it? and it all just goes away.
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.
you haven't been able to do much to stop me.
Susan's fine by the way.
alive at any rate. the second that we do...
I'm gonna put an arrow right through your heart.
right?
You think this is a game?
I don't feel like playing anymore.
Oliver. as your friend pike here probably...
All dead because of you.
So go ahead.
Kill me.
Let's find out how much more loss you can take because I don't think it's much.
I think that you're one loss away from being destroyed.
I guess we'll have to find another way to handle this then.
that's the beautiful thing
Oliver.
you'll only really be killing yourself.

Thanks for the assist.
What is thing you are doing with your voice?
Ok.
Ok.
oh!
I'm in.
Whoo!
We're in.
Yes.
whoa.
Did we just accidentally hack a dhs drone system?
I wouldn't exactly say accidentally.
uh-uh.
please explain to me why we're hacking homeland security drones instead of finding Susan's location like you told me we would be!
Because hacking the drones is what's gonna lead us to Susan.
It's... it's...
So complicated. and now you are spoofing the GPS system.
There's nothing slight about this.
This is just straight-up illegal.
Spill 100% deets right now.
ok.
So I've...
I've kind of made some...
heh... new friends.
Surprise. tons of it. and now they're willing to help us find Susan.
That's all.
If you redirect a few U.S. border control drones.
Hey.
Don't look at me like that.
Ok.
I've already gotten chapter and verse from John and Oliver.
please.
I can't imagine them signing off on you hacking homeland security.
do they?
All they need to know is that I am a grown woman making my own grown-up decisions.
Hey.
Got anything for me?
Oliver.
man?
Is it Susan? but it's just a matter of time.
I don't know what I can do to stop it. and you're not alone.
Do you think that's the problem?
You've done a wonderful job of convincing me that I'm changing for the better...
With the recruits and the... more... more trust.
You think none of this would have happened right?
Trusted anyone.
Because i... i can't see anything past me just creating more targets.
Oliver.
man.
We're your teammates.
We're your strength.
You give me strength until chase turns it into a weakness.
Look what happened with Susan.
I gave chase a way to get to me. with...
With Felicity...
With my son.
John.
Maybe.
Maybe we do... that makes you human.
Being human's a luxury I might not get to have.
Yeah.
Ok.
Got it.
Tell dinah and Rene.
Felicity found out where chase is keeping Susan.
- Let's go!
- John.
There's something I need you to do for me. it'll be by playing his game...
And I know someone who makes him vulnerable.
Rene:
This is where prometheus is holding your lady?
Or at least he was when he shot that video.
I'm reading a few dozen heat signatures inside.
Chase brought backup?
Or he's using decoys.
It's decoys.
Prometheus works alone.
Problem is Susan could be any one of those heat signatures.
canvass floor by floor.
Agreed.
any word on spartan?
package is en route.
- Eta 5 minutes.
- Package?
Oliver's got something up his green sleeve.
These puppies should help double our search capabilities.
I get to kick the door in.
Lassie.
Get back!
What was that?
Some sort of explosion.
do you copy?
Ow.
Yeah.
We copy.
But we're trapped in here.
- Oh.
Son of a bitch!
- Yeah.
What if those heat signatures are incendiary devices?
I think we can pretty much confirm that.
We got 5 minutes for search and rescue before this whole place comes down.
You get dinah and wild dog out of here.
- I will find Susan.
- Assuming she's still here.
Which I'm totally sure she still is.
Unh!
Oliver!
Hey.
Are you ok?
- Yeah.
A-Adrian chase is...
- I know!
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
What's happening?
Chase is controlling the elevator.
we need to get you out of here.
- This building is gonna explode.
- What about...
Chase wants me.
You're no longer his target.
I was gonna say what about you?
I'm gonna finish this.
Get to safety.
Oliver.
Can you guys hear me in there?
Yeah.
Just waiting on that rescue.
Good.
Step back!
I'm glad Talia told you.
face to face.
There's an honesty to it.
honestly...
I'm gonna keep both of us here until this building comes down on top of us.
Then you'd be dead.
So would you.
Oliver?
I'm always 10 steps ahead of you. you probably would have seen this coming.
Adrian?
You shouldn't be here.
How else was I supposed to find out the truth?
You killed all those people.
It's not that simple.
You killed them.
It's simple.
baby.
This can't be you.
It's not you.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Why did you make her come here?
To get you to stop.
You have to stop.
You have to... you have to turn yourself in.
I can't do that. it's over.
You'd tell the police?
No.
You tell them.
You're right.
I'm gonna take care of this.
John!
Rahhh!
Felicity:
I've got an ambulance en route to your position.
my god.
Oliver's in there with chase.
Go help him now!
Go!
Agh!
Rah!
Oliver. and you can't kill me.
Adrian.
I can!
Felicity:
What's going on?
some sort of sitrep.
Chase is gone.
And so is Oliver.
Where's Oliver?
- Guys!
- We have to assume that chase has him.
What about Susan and chase's wife?
Felicity:
Susan's at the precinct. but Doris passed away en route to starling general.
Rene:
We've got to work on finding Oliver.
you found Susan.
You can find him.
You're right.
please tell me you're not going to see them again.
Dinah's right.
They're the ones that found Susan.
Agh!
Gregor!
Unh!
is that you?
No.
It's the man who's gonna kill you.
Agh!
You up for making a statement?
I'm up for anything that puts Adrian chase in the electric chair. but I like your thinking.
Ms. Williams.
no see.
You get away from her.
Please don't threaten me.
I'm in mourning.
Haven't you heard? the mayor's missing.
Quentin? Oliver disappearing under these circumstances.
You give me one good reason why I shouldn't have you arrested right now.
Because you don't want your friend back in pieces.
Right?
Everyone's megaimpressed with the dhs hack you did for us.
That's great.
You've also been chosen as the first woman to go to Mars.
Sorry.
A friend of mine is missing.
The information we gave you didn't help?
Different friend.
You have a lot of missing friends.
I have no leads whatsoever. and I have to use everything that I can to find him and do whatever you need me to do for you.
Talia:
I don't believe I taught you
Oliver.
Your father was an honorable man. and he'd be ashamed of you.
I shall bow to your superior expertise.
Just make sure he suffers.
That was always the plan.
My friends will find me.
They're my strength.
Oliver.
I'm not interested in killing you.
Then what the hell is this game that we're playing? I confessed to her that you'd helped me discover who I really am.
Oliver.
move your head!
Previously on "Arrow"...
This laptop contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from Kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.
This is most disappointing.
I liked many of you.
Prometheus surprised me with a very specific, unique move.
It was taught to me by a woman that I met in Russia.
You think you and Prometheus had the same teacher?
You're accepting the invitation to join Helix.
Full throttle.
What do I do with your secret?
I keep it.
I care about the city, and... and you're working double-time.
Can you talk some sense into him, please?
Mr. Mayor, Thea, meet my wife Doris.
I thought we could talk.
Can we set up a meeting tomorrow?
I'm late for a dinner.
It's important.
You could call it life or death.
You sure this is the place?
I don't see any other monasteries on this mountain.
Felicity's note said something about a demon... oh, wait, maybe that says, "lemon."
Anyway, I...
I texted her, but she has not hit me back.
It says, "demon."
Oliver, I'm losing you!
I'll see you back in Star City.
Where is she?
Who are you?
I'm a former student.
Former, which means you are not welcome here.
Talia:
No!
Leave us.
I would apologize for my students' enthusiasm, but you should not have come to this place.
Well, Talia, it was difficult to find.
Our business together concluded 5 years ago.
No.
One of your former students is trying to kill me.
Oh, he doesn't want to kill you, Oliver.
He means to destroy you utterly.
You knew?
If you knew, then why would you train him?
Why wouldn't you warn me?
Two years ago, he sought me out.
He'd already learned much about you.
He's a man of remarkable capacity.
Talia, enough!
If you knew what he wanted, then why would you train him?
You killed his father, and I helped him in his pursuit of vengeance because by then you'd killed mine!
I never told you my full name, did I?
No, you didn't.
It's Talia al Ghul.
Ra's al Ghul was your father.
Yes.
My father and I came to be at odds, so I forged my own path...
But he was still my father when you put a sword through his chest.
So that's why you're not gonna help me.
That's why you won't tell who this...
Prometheus is.
Of course I will, Oliver, because I want you to suffer.
He calls himself...
Adrian Chase.
*ARROW Season 05 Episode 16 "Checkmate" Synchronized by srjanapala
Everything ok?
Yes.
Peachy.
Heh.
Let's do this.
- Whoa.
- Yeah.
It's lit, right?
All these people, they're just...
You sound surprised.
Yeah.
I mean, I guess I just thought that a secret hacker organization would be a little bit more, well, I don't know, intimate.
Heh.
Well, Helix is a worldwide operation, kind of like the U.N.
If it actually accomplished things.
You have 3D nanoelectrics designed to interface with a neural network.
We were working on something like this at Palmer Tech, and...
Who do you think we stole the prototype from?
What is that?
Real-time feed from every cell phone camera in the world running through a pattern recognition algo.
Holy...
that's...
So much bigger than anything the NSA is doing.
I know.
That's a lot of power for someone to have who's not government.
Well, the fact that we're not government's not the point.
Power to the people, right?
Yeah.
Power to the people.
Heh.
Welcome to Helix, Felicity.
We're gonna change the world together.
Woman:
Mr. Queen, I've been
- trying to reach you...
- I need Captain Pike and Quentin Lance in my office, and I need to know where D.A. Chase is right now.
Right now, Mr. Chase is in the conference room.
Treatment for drug addicts over incarceration.
Mr. Mayor, I didn't think you'd be joining us this morning.
I guess you know what I've been up to, huh?
- Yeah.
- I've been working on addressing our sentencing policy for drug offenses.
Care to join?
I'd like to see you in my office, please.
Actually, can it wait?
The councilmen and I are on a clock.
Besides, you're looking a little ragged.
You tired...
Or is it that you've actually been asleep this whole time?
All the captains are dead.
Da.
Gregor will promote new ones loyal to him, and they will kill us all.
Gonna try it this way now.
I got to tell you, I don't know how that mask is gonna play here, especially since the city's not too fond of your alter ego these days.
I'll give them the Throwing Star Killer, see how they feel.
Wait.
That's your big plan, arresting me?
Oh, man, that's a bit of a letdown, I have to say.
Well, I'm not gonna kill you, if only because that's what you want me to do.
But you've done everything I've wanted so far.
Did you really think I'd let all this end in a parking garage?
What did you do?
I gave your girlfriend an exclusive.
Wait.
Are you still dating Susan Williams?
I got to tell you, buddy.
It's been a little hard to keep track.
What did you do to her?
She's fine.
Don't worry.
As long as I'm around to make sure she gets some food and water.
Starvation and dehydration... terrible way to go.
Bottom line...
I die, she dies.
I don't make it back to her in time, she dies.
Now you could try torturing me for her location.
We both know what you're capable of in that department, but...
I think that we both know what I'm capable of, so, Ollie, who do you think can last longer...
Susan or me?
Ohh.
I'm 10 steps ahead of you, and you haven't even figured out what game we're playing yet.
Quentin:
That son of a bitch.
Yeah, I'd say that pretty much covers it.
This is a hell of a city you got here.
District attorney's a serial killer.
He's way worse that that.
Infiltrating the government like that at the highest level right next to Oliver?
We underestimated this guy.
I underestimated him.
I trusted him.
Where is Felicity?
I've been texting her like crazy, but her phone's off.
You don't think that Prometheus has...
No.
No.
His game is Susan.
For now.
We have to make sure Thea's safe.
Lyla and J.J. are secure at Argus.
I got in touch with Thea.
She's fine...
B-but we have to find Susan.
We cannot make a move on Chase until we know she's safe, until we have her here.
Keep looking for Felicity.
You GPS her phone if you have to.
We should go to Pike, tell him Chase is the Throwing Star Killer.
And then he asks for evidence, and you say what?
Look.
Quentin's right.
Dinah, we keep the SCPD out of this until we have something.
This guy has us in check.
Yeah, for now.
John:
Sent Curtis and Dinah to Opal City.
- For Chase's mother.
- He has leverage,
- we need some of our own.
- That's not gonna work.
This guy always seems to be 10 steps ahead.
Well, Oliver, it's pretty easy, you confronting him in public like that.
What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't thinking.
Where you going now?
According to city records, Chase's house has a subbasement.
Chase does everything sideways, man.
I doubt he has Susan someplace obvious.
I don't know what's obvious anymore.
Oh, no.
I can't let you go out there alone.
- I'm going with you.
- I can handle it.
Never said you couldn't.
3 of us cannot defeat Gregor.
We need more men.
No.
We need a way to convince the Bratva that Gregor sold them out.
We had way.
Well, we don't have anyone that can pull data off a bullet-ridden laptop, so...
Without proof, Gregor will say we are traitors.
Rest of Bratva will believe them.
And then they will kill us.
So we've got to kill him first before he tells anyone.
Ok.
You've had enough to drink already.
Where would Gregor go...
I mean, where would he go right now?
He'd go to ground.
Bratva stronghold is hockey rink, but it's heavily protected.
Hmm.
We wouldn't even get through the door.
I think I know someone who can.
I guess Norma Bates got the hell out of Dodge.
Chase anticipated this play.
I never said that he wasn't clever.
So am I.
Um...
What's your toy doing?
It's detecting resonance frequencies upstairs.
It's not a toy.
It's a T-sphere.
Wait.
Every horror movie ever has basically said that you do not go upstairs at a creepy serial killer's mother's house.
Help!
Unh!
Adrian:
Excellent.
Now give us another scream.
So, what, we're supposed to just go to work like things are normal?
Because newsflash...
they ain't.
Tell me something I don't already know.
Chase:
Ho ho!
I did think of one or two things.
This is nice, everything being out in the open now, all the cards on the table, as it were.
You got some nerve showing up here.
Why wouldn't I?
I take my job very seriously.
Speaking of, I thought my office had requested your verifications on the latest ComStat reports from the SCPD.
What you been doing?
I'm gonna kill you in ways that will hurt.
Threatening a city official's a felony, Mr. Ramirez.
You think you're so clever.
This isn't over, you son of a bitch!
I agree.
In fact, I think we're just getting started.
I want those ComStat verifications on my desk by tomorrow morning, Dog.
We can't just let that son of a bitch walk around here.
- We got to do something.
- We are doing something.
Yeah.
Rene and I have got eyes on Chase.
He's at city hall.
You got a green light to move on his house.
Roger that.
Ok, Spartan.
You check the upstairs and work your way down.
I'll sweep the basement.
We can meet in the middle.
Roger that.
- Please don't hurt me.
- Mrs. Chase.
What are you doing in my hou...
Mrs. Chase, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Get away from me.
Your husband isn't who you think he is.
Get out of my house.
Mrs. Chase, your husband is the Throwing Star Killer.
He's holding an innocent woman hostage, and I need your help to find her.
- You're insane.
- Doris, please.
You need to understand the truth.
You have to know at some level that your husband has been keeping something from you.
And police and the mayor say that you're the killer, you.
Officer:
On the floor.
On the floor!
Get down on the floor!
On the floor.
Get down on the floor!
You all right, Mrs. Chase?
I'm...
I'm fine.
We got a call from your husband.
Don't worry.
We got this handled.
Get her out of here.
Tell me what you want me to do.
I am not getting into a shootout with the SCPD.
Copy that.
I'm out.
Smart move, douchebag.
I wasn't talking to you.
Drop the bow and get on the ground!
Whole thing's about 30 seconds long.
I've been over every frame, and there's nothing to indicate a location.
At least it's proof of life.
Yeah.
She was alive when this video was made, but we don't know how long a... sorry.
It's fine.
He'll... he'll keep her alive to keep me in check.
I never should have gotten involved with Susan.
I don't know what I was thinking.
You were thinking you were lonely, man.
Everyone needs somebody.
Yeah?
Well, maybe I gave up that right when I put on the hood.
Felicity:
Hi!
Oh!
Hi!
I'm sorry.
I know I'm late.
I'm sorry.
I got Curtis' messages.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm here now.
Sorry.
Can you give us the room, please?
Heh.
Much appreciated.
Yeah.
I usually like my tongue lashings to be done in private, so thank you.
Heh.
I'm...
Sorry.
I'm not angry.
You don't... you don't work for me.
You...
I'm worried.
Right.
Of course, for all you know,
Prometheus could have kkhhk... ooh.
Not...
I'm worried about you.
Oh.
Because you're into something, and you don't want to tell anyone about it, or maybe you just don't want to tell me.
I think we can both agree that keeping secrets doesn't end well, so...
Yeah, you're right.
It's just that right now is not really a good time with everything going on.
You just have to trust me on this one, ok?
- Ok.
- But speaking of the something that I'm into, it actually helped me go through the petabyte of data we took off of Chase's mother's computer.
- This
- Who's Simon Morrison?
- Adrian Chase.
- What?
Simon Morrison is his birth name.
That's his real identity.
But his mother's name is Amanda Westfield.
Yes.
Well, she changed her name when she went off the grid, so it runs in the family.
Well, if Adrian Chase is an alias... then the proof that his background is fake would be enough for the ACU to arrest his ass.
- However you did it, good work.
- Thank you.
Let's put this all on the drive.
- I've got to get to city hall.
- Wait.
Oh.
Now?
I mean, it's past 10:00.
Yeah.
Before the 11:00 news,
I have to make a statement on the Green Arrow breaking into the D.A.'s house.
Obviously, this is a horrifying development.
Uh, we believe the Green Arrow was retaliating against this office for speaking out against his recent crimes.
Mr. Mayor.
Ahem.
This office is in complete agreement with D.A. Chase.
This situation has become untenable...
And I am determined to bring it to a just and successful end.
I will not let anyone, anyone...
Terrorize this city...
And so I am demanding that the Green Arrow turn himself in.
He has 24 hours before I am ordering the SCPD to shoot on sight.
That's all.
Thank you.
Thanks for seeing me.
I know it's late.
Uh, I think we both know our jobs don't recognize late and early.
What can I do for you?
What's this?
That is evidence that Adrian Chase is a false identity.
His real name is Simon Morrison.
In the midst of an investigation, you will learn that he is the Throwing Star Killer.
Oh.
That's one hell of an accusation.
That's why I'm giving you that.
And this evidence comes from where?
An investigation that I've been conducting off the books.
With what personnel?
Work the lead, Captain Pike.
Consider that an order if it helps.
One last thing.
You didn't get that from me.
I serve at the pleasure of the Mayor.
There you are.
Viktor has confirmed Gregor's location, but tell me, why did you want him gone and why are you playing Robin Hood?
I met a woman.
She taught me how to give my darkness an identity so that it doesn't consume me.
And you believed her?
Oliver, whatever you think is inside you is inside you.
You... you cannot name it like that and keep it apart from you.
This woman's taught me differently.
This woman does not know what she is talking about, and if you're not careful, Oliver, one day she will be the source of your greatest pain.
Oh, my God.
And this is...
We've been calling him Prometheus, but you helped me I.D. him as Simon Morrison.
I've been striking out at getting a location off this, but someone with a cell phone at some point must have entered this room, which means there should be pictures of it on your database.
If I can cross-reference the images of your database with this video,
I should be able to help the police find her.
And that's, like, really cool and noble and all.
I mean, she definitely needs your help...
But?
But, Felicity, we gave you Pandora.
We helped you sort through that data pull, and now, well, people are starting to ask what you're doing for us.
I mean, we didn't invite you in just so you could check items off your to-do list.
Sorry.
It feels gross saying...
No.
Uh, no.
You're right.
Ok.
So quid pro quo.
I help you, you help me.
I was kind of hoping you'd say that.
We've been trying to break the encryption on a certain Homeland security drone.
- Why?
- Need to know, I'm afraid.
Question is what are you willing to quo in exchange for your quid?
Uh, can you check some files for me?
Any legal records you can find on a Simon Morrison.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hey.
You ok, buddy?
Need some medical attention or something?
Unh!
- What happened?
- Some lowlife attacked him outside the precinct.
SCPD's canvassing, but the security cameras, they did not get a shot of his face.
But...
How's Pike?
He's comatose.
This was Chase.
I don't know, Oliver.
Murder by lowlife is not exactly his style.
Earlier tonight, I gave Pike a lead connecting Chase to Prometheus.
I thought we didn't have any leads.
Felicity resurfaced with something.
Is Pike's family in there?
Nope, but somebody else is.
Life's just so fragile, isn't it?
Decades of hopes and dreams, and in one moment, one little mistake, and it all just goes away.
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.
Really?
Because so far, you haven't been able to do much to stop me.
Susan's fine by the way.
Well, alive at any rate.
Me and my team are gonna find her, and when we do, the second that we do...
I'm gonna put an arrow right through your heart.
You do realize how impotent you sound, right?
You think this is a game?
I don't feel like playing anymore.
You don't have a choice, Oliver.
If you kill me, you kill Susan, and she will be as dead as your mother, as Tommy, as Shado, as Laurel, as your friend Pike here probably... all dead because of you.
So go ahead.
Kill me.
Let's find out how much more loss you can take because I don't think it's much.
I think that you're one loss away from being destroyed.
I guess we'll have to find another way to handle this then.
You see, that's the beautiful thing about all of this, Oliver.
If you kill me, you'll only really be killing yourself.
Thanks for the assist.
What is thing you are doing with your voice?
Ok.
Ok.
Ok.
Oh, oh!
I'm in.
Whoo!
We're in.
Yes.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did we just accidentally hack a DHS drone system?
Well, I wouldn't exactly say accidentally.
- Tch.
Am I right?
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Felicity, please explain to me why we're hacking Homeland security drones instead of finding Susan's location like you told me we would be!
Because hacking the drones is what's gonna lead us to Susan.
It's... it's...
So complicated.
Holy crap.
You just sent the receiver false data, and now you are spoofing the GPS system.
There's nothing slight about this.
This is just straight-up illegal.
Spill 100% deets right now.
- Right now!
- Ok, ok.
So I've...
I've kind of made some... heh... new friends.
Surprise.
And they have access to unaccessible amounts of data and Intel, tons of it.
They helped me get John out of prison, and now they're willing to help us find Susan.
That's all.
If you redirect a few U.S. border control drones.
Hey.
Don't look at me like that.
Ok.
I've already gotten chapter and verse from John and Oliver.
Please don't, please.
I can't imagine them signing off on you hacking Homeland Security.
They don't know, do they?
All they need to know is that I am a grown woman making my own grown-up decisions.
Hey.
Got anything for me?
Oliver.
What is it, man?
Is it Susan?
Not yet, but it's just a matter of time.
I don't know what I can do to stop it.
Well, Oliver, there are always options, and you're not alone.
Do you think that's the problem?
You've done a wonderful job of convincing me that I'm changing for the better...
With the recruits and the...
The transparency, more optimism, more... more trust.
You think none of this would have happened if you hadn't trusted Chase, right?
Trusted anyone.
Because I...
I can't see anything past me just creating more targets.
Oliver.
We're not targets, man.
We're your teammates.
We're your strength.
You give me strength until Chase turns it into a weakness.
Look what happened with Susan.
I let myself get close to Susan, and in so doing, I gave Chase a way to get to me.
That could happen with you, with... with Felicity... with my son.
All of you make me vulnerable, John.
Maybe.
Maybe we do...
But caring about people, Oliver, that makes you human.
Being human's a luxury I might not get to have.
Yeah.
Ok.
Got it.
Tell Dinah and Rene.
Felicity found out where Chase is keeping Susan.
- Let's go!
- John.
There's something I need you to do for me.
If I'm gonna beat this guy, it'll be by playing his game...
And I know someone who makes him vulnerable.
Rene:
This is where Prometheus is holding Susan?
Or at least he was when he shot that video.
I'm reading a few dozen heat signatures inside.
Chase brought backup?
Or he's using decoys.
It's decoys.
Prometheus works alone.
Problem is Susan could be any one of those heat signatures.
We should split up, canvass floor by floor.
Agreed.
Overwatch, any word on Spartan?
Uh, package is en route.
- ETA 5 minutes.
- Package?
Oliver's got something up his green sleeve.
These puppies should help double our search capabilities.
Next time, I get to kick the door in.
Yeah.
Whatever floats your boat, Lassie.
Get back!
What was that?
Some sort of explosion.
Dinah, Rene, do you copy?
Ow.
Yeah.
We copy.
But we're trapped in here.
- Oh.
Son of a bitch!
- Yeah.
What if those heat signatures are incendiary devices?
I think we can pretty much confirm that.
We got 5 minutes for search and rescue before this whole place comes down.
You get Dinah and Wild Dog out of here.
- I will find Susan.
- Assuming she's still here.
Which I'm totally sure she still is.
Unh!
Oliver!
Hey.
Are you ok?
- Yeah.
A-Adrian Chase is...
- I know!
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
What's happening?
Chase is controlling the elevator.
Susan, we need to get you out of here.
- This building is gonna explode.
- What about...
Chase wants me.
You're no longer his target.
I was gonna say what about you?
I'm gonna finish this.
Get to safety.
Hello, Oliver.
Can you guys hear me in there?
Yeah.
Just waiting on that rescue.
Good.
Step back!
I'm glad Talia told you.
I prefer it this way, face to face.
There's an honesty to it.
Well, honestly...
I'm gonna keep both of us here until this building comes down on top of us.
Then you'd be dead.
So would you.
Really?
You really think I'd let that happen, Oliver?
Remember, I'm always 10 steps ahead of you.
You know, if that were true, you probably would have seen this coming.
Adrian?
You shouldn't be here.
How else was I supposed to find out the truth?
You killed all those people.
It's not that simple.
You killed them.
It's simple.
I know, baby.
This can't be you.
It's not you.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Why did you make her come here?
To get you to stop.
You have to stop.
You have to... you have to turn yourself in.
I can't do that.
Please.
Whatever this is, whatever you're doing, it's over.
You'd tell the police?
No.
You tell them.
You're right.
I'm gonna take care of this.
John!
Rahhh!
Felicity:
I've got an ambulance en route to your position.
Oh, my God.
Oliver's in there with Chase.
Go help him now!
Go!
Agh!
Rah!
I told you, Oliver.
I'm not gonna kill you, and you can't kill me.
Yes, Adrian.
Yes, I can!
Felicity:
What's going on?
Guys, some sort of sitrep.
Chase is gone.
And so is Oliver.
Where's Oliver?
- Guys!
- We have to assume that Chase has him.
What about Susan and Chase's wife?
Felicity:
Susan's at the precinct.
Quentin is with her, um, but Doris passed away en route to Starling General.
Rene:
We've got to work on finding Oliver.
Felicity, you found Susan.
You can find him.
You're right.
Felicity, please tell me you're not going to see them again.
Dinah's right.
They're the ones that found Susan.
Agh!
Gregor!
Unh!
Oliver, is that you?
No.
It's the man who's gonna kill you.
Agh!
You up for making a statement?
Yeah, I'm up for anything that puts Adrian Chase in the electric chair.
Actually, we only got lethal injection in this state, but I like your thinking.
Hello, Ms. Williams.
Long time, no see.
You get away from her.
Please don't threaten me.
I'm in mourning.
Haven't you heard?
The Green Arrow killed my wife earlier tonight, and apparently, the mayor's missing.
You wouldn't happen to know where he is, Quentin?
Honestly, it doesn't look good,
Oliver disappearing under these circumstances.
You give me one good reason why I shouldn't have you arrested right now.
Because you don't want your friend back in pieces.
Right?
Everyone's megaimpressed with the DHS hack you did for us.
That's great.
You've also been chosen as the first woman to go to Mars.
Sorry.
A friend of mine is missing.
The information we gave you didn't help?
Different friend.
You have a lot of missing friends.
Yeah, and this time, I have no leads whatsoever.
You guys have better resources than I do, and I have to use everything that I can to find him and do whatever you need me to do for you.
Talia:
I don't believe I taught you how to escape from shackles, Oliver.
Your father was an honorable man.
You've allied with a psychopath, and he'd be ashamed of you.
Well, when it comes to the shame of fathers,
I shall bow to your superior expertise.
Just make sure he suffers.
That was always the plan.
My friends will find me.
They're my strength.
That's sweet, but I'm running out of ways to tell you, Oliver.
I'm not interested in killing you.
Then what the hell is this game that we're playing?
When I had Susan as my guest,
I confessed to her that you'd helped me discover who I really am.
That's what I'm gonna help you do, Oliver.
Greg!
Move your head.
Oliver:
Previously on "Arrow"...
This laptop contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from Kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.
This is most disappointing.
I liked many of you.
Oliver:
Prometheus surprised me with a very specific, unique move.
It was taught to me by a woman that I met in Russia.
You think you and Prometheus had the same teacher?
You're accepting the invitation to join Helix.
Full throttle.
What do I do with your secret?
I keep it.
I care about the city, and... and you're working double-time.
Can you talk some sense into him, please?
Mr. Mayor, Thea, meet my wife Doris.
I thought we could talk.
Can we set up a meeting tomorrow?
I'm late for a dinner.
It's important.
You could call it life or death.
You sure this is the place?
Curtis:
I don't see any other monasteries on this mountain.
Felicity's note said something about a demon... oh, wait, maybe that says, "lemon."
Anyway, I...
I texted her, but she has not hit me back.
It says, "demon."
Oliver, I'm losing you!
I'll see you back in Star City.
[Typing]
[People grunting, trading blows]
Where is she?
Who are you?
I'm a former student.
Former, which means you are not welcome here.
Talia:
No!
Leave us.
I would apologize for my students' enthusiasm, but you should not have come to this place.
Well, Talia, it was difficult to find.
Our business together concluded 5 years ago.
No.
One of your former students is trying to kill me.
Oh, he doesn't want to kill you, Oliver.
He means to destroy you utterly.
You knew?
If you knew, then why would you train him?
Why wouldn't you warn me?
Two years ago, he sought me out.
He'd already learned much about you.
He's a man of remarkable capacity.
Talia, enough!
If you knew what he wanted, then why would you train him?
You killed his father, and I helped him in his pursuit of vengeance because by then you'd killed mine!
I never told you my full name, did I?
No, you didn't.
It's Talia al Ghul.
[Exhales]
Ra's al Ghul was your father.
Yes.
My father and I came to be at odds, so I forged my own path...
But he was still my father when you put a sword through his chest.
So that's why you're not gonna help me.
That's why you won't tell who this...
Prometheus is.
Of course I will, Oliver, because I want you to suffer.
He calls himself...
Adrian Chase.
*ARROW Season 05 Episode 16 "Checkmate"
Everything ok?
Yes.
Peachy.
Heh.
Let's do this.
- Whoa.
- Yeah.
It's lit, right?
All these people, they're just...
You sound surprised.
Yeah.
I mean, I guess I just thought that a secret hacker organization would be a little bit more, well, I don't know, intimate.
Heh.
Well, Helix is a worldwide operation, kind of like the U.N.
If it actually accomplished things.
You have 3D nanoelectrics designed to interface with a neural network.
We were working on something like this at Palmer Tech, and...
Who do you think we stole the prototype from?
What is that?
Real-time feed from every cell phone camera in the world running through a pattern recognition algo.
Holy...
that's...
So much bigger than anything the NSA is doing.
I know.
That's a lot of power for someone to have who's not government.
Well, the fact that we're not government's not the point.
Power to the people, right?
Yeah.
Power to the people.
Heh.
Welcome to Helix, Felicity.
We're gonna change the world together.
Woman:
Mr. Queen, I've been
- trying to reach you...
- I need Captain Pike and Quentin Lance in my office, and I need to know where D.A. Chase is right now.
Right now, Mr. Chase is in the conference room.
Treatment for drug addicts over incarceration.
Mr. Mayor, I didn't think you'd be joining us this morning.
I guess you know what I've been up to, huh?
- Yeah.
- I've been working on addressing our sentencing policy for drug offenses.
Care to join?
I'd like to see you in my office, please.
Actually, can it wait?
The councilmen and I are on a clock.
Besides, you're looking a little ragged.
You tired...
Or is it that you've actually been asleep this whole time?
All the captains are dead.
Da.
Gregor will promote new ones loyal to him, and they will kill us all.
Gonna try it this way now.
I got to tell you, I don't know how that mask is gonna play here, especially since the city's not too fond of your alter ego these days.
I'll give them the Throwing Star Killer, see how they feel.
Wait.
That's your big plan, arresting me?
Oh, man, that's a bit of a letdown, I have to say.
Well, I'm not gonna kill you, if only because that's what you want me to do.
But you've done everything I've wanted so far.
Did you really think I'd let all this end in a parking garage?
What did you do?
I gave your girlfriend an exclusive.
Wait.
Are you still dating Susan Williams?
I got to tell you, buddy.
It's been a little hard to keep track.
What did you do to her?
She's fine.
Don't worry.
As long as I'm around to make sure she gets some food and water.
Starvation and dehydration... terrible way to go.
Bottom line...
I die, she dies.
I don't make it back to her in time, she dies.
Now you could try torturing me for her location.
We both know what you're capable of in that department, but...
I think that we both know what I'm capable of, so, Ollie, who do you think can last longer...
Susan or me?
Ohh.
I'm 10 steps ahead of you, and you haven't even figured out what game we're playing yet.
Quentin:
That son of a bitch.
Yeah, I'd say that pretty much covers it.
This is a hell of a city you got here.
District attorney's a serial killer.
He's way worse that that.
Infiltrating the government like that at the highest level right next to Oliver?
We underestimated this guy.
I underestimated him.
I trusted him.
Where is Felicity?
I've been texting her like crazy, but her phone's off.
You don't think that Prometheus has...
No.
No.
His game is Susan.
For now.
We have to make sure Thea's safe.
Lyla and J.J. are secure at Argus.
I got in touch with Thea.
She's fine...
B-but we have to find Susan.
We cannot make a move on Chase until we know she's safe, until we have her here.
Keep looking for Felicity.
You GPS her phone if you have to.
We should go to Pike, tell him Chase is the Throwing Star Killer.
And then he asks for evidence, and you say what?
Look.
Quentin's right.
Dinah, we keep the SCPD out of this until we have something.
This guy has us in check.
Yeah, for now.
John:
Sent Curtis and Dinah to Opal City.
- For Chase's mother.
- He has leverage,
- we need some of our own.
- That's not gonna work.
This guy always seems to be 10 steps ahead.
Well, Oliver, it's pretty easy, you confronting him in public like that.
What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't thinking.
Where you going now?
According to city records, Chase's house has a subbasement.
Chase does everything sideways, man.
I doubt he has Susan someplace obvious.
I don't know what's obvious anymore.
Oh, no.
I can't let you go out there alone.
- I'm going with you.
- I can handle it.
Never said you couldn't.
3 of us cannot defeat Gregor.
We need more men.
No.
We need a way to convince the Bratva that Gregor sold them out.
We had way.
Well, we don't have anyone that can pull data off a bullet-ridden laptop, so...
Without proof, Gregor will say we are traitors.
Rest of Bratva will believe them.
And then they will kill us.
So we've got to kill him first before he tells anyone.
Ok.
You've had enough to drink already.
[Sighs]
Where would Gregor go...
I mean, where would he go right now?
He'd go to ground.
Bratva stronghold is hockey rink, but it's heavily protected.
Hmm.
We wouldn't even get through the door.
I think I know someone who can.
I guess Norma Bates got the hell out of Dodge.
Chase anticipated this play.
I never said that he wasn't clever.
So am I.
Um...
What's your toy doing?
It's detecting resonance frequencies upstairs.
It's not a toy.
It's a T-sphere.
Wait.
Every horror movie ever has basically said that you do not go upstairs at a creepy serial killer's mother's house.
[Susan screams]
Help!
[Sobbing]
Unh!
Adrian:
Excellent.
Now give us another scream.
So, what, we're supposed to just go to work like things are normal?
Because newsflash...
they ain't.
Tell me something I don't already know.
Chase:
Ho ho!
I did think of one or two things.
This is nice, everything being out in the open now, all the cards on the table, as it were.
You got some nerve showing up here.
Why wouldn't I?
I take my job very seriously.
Speaking of, I thought my office had requested your verifications on the latest ComStat reports from the SCPD.
What you been doing?
I'm gonna kill you in ways that will hurt.
Threatening a city official's a felony, Mr. Ramirez.
You think you're so clever.
This isn't over, you son of a bitch!
I agree.
In fact, I think we're just getting started.
I want those ComStat verifications on my desk by tomorrow morning, Dog.
We can't just let that son of a bitch walk around here.
- We got to do something.
- We are doing something.
Yeah.
Rene and I have got eyes on Chase.
He's at city hall.
You got a green light to move on his house.
Roger that.
Ok, Spartan.
You check the upstairs and work your way down.
I'll sweep the basement.
We can meet in the middle.
Roger that.
- Please don't hurt me.
- Mrs. Chase.
What are you doing in my hou...
Mrs. Chase, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Get away from me.
Your husband isn't who you think he is.
Get out of my house.
Mrs. Chase, your husband is the Throwing Star Killer.
He's holding an innocent woman hostage, and I need your help to find her.
- You're insane.
- Doris, please.
You need to understand the truth.
You have to know at some level that your husband has been keeping something from you.
And police and the mayor say that you're the killer, you.
Officer:
On the floor.
On the floor!
Get down on the floor!
On the floor.
Get down on the floor!
You all right, Mrs. Chase?
I'm...
I'm fine.
We got a call from your husband.
Don't worry.
We got this handled.
Get her out of here.
Tell me what you want me to do.
I am not getting into a shootout with the SCPD.
Copy that.
I'm out.
Smart move, douchebag.
I wasn't talking to you.
Drop the bow and get on the ground!
[Groans]
Whole thing's about 30 seconds long.
I've been over every frame, and there's nothing to indicate a location.
At least it's proof of life.
Yeah.
She was alive when this video was made, but we don't know how long a... sorry.
It's fine.
He'll... he'll keep her alive to keep me in check.
I never should have gotten involved with Susan.
I don't know what I was thinking.
You were thinking you were lonely, man.
Everyone needs somebody.
Yeah?
Well, maybe I gave up that right when I put on the hood.
Felicity:
Hi!
Oh!
Hi!
I'm sorry.
I know I'm late.
I'm sorry.
I got Curtis' messages.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm here now.
Sorry.
Can you give us the room, please?
Heh.
Much appreciated.
Yeah.
I usually like my tongue lashings to be done in private, so thank you.
Heh.
I'm...
Sorry.
I'm not angry.
You don't... you don't work for me.
You...
I'm worried.
Right.
Of course, for all you know,
Prometheus could have kkhhk... ooh.
Not...
I'm worried about you.
Oh.
Because you're into something, and you don't want to tell anyone about it, or maybe you just don't want to tell me.
I think we can both agree that keeping secrets doesn't end well, so...
Yeah, you're right.
It's just that right now is not really a good time with everything going on.
You just have to trust me on this one, ok?
- Ok.
- But speaking of the something that I'm into, it actually helped me go through the petabyte of data we took off of Chase's mother's computer.
- This
- Who's Simon Morrison?
- Adrian Chase.
- What?
Simon Morrison is his birth name.
That's his real identity.
But his mother's name is Amanda Westfield.
Yes.
Well, she changed her name when she went off the grid, so it runs in the family.
Well, if Adrian Chase is an alias... then the proof that his background is fake would be enough for the ACU to arrest his ass.
- However you did it, good work.
- Thank you.
Let's put this all on the drive.
- I've got to get to city hall.
- Wait.
Oh.
Now?
I mean, it's past 10:00.
Yeah.
Before the 11:00 news,
I have to make a statement on the Green Arrow breaking into the D.A.'s house.
Obviously, this is a horrifying development.
Uh, we believe the Green Arrow was retaliating against this office for speaking out against his recent crimes.
Mr. Mayor.
[Camera shutters clicking]
Ahem.
This office is in complete agreement with D.A. Chase.
This situation has become untenable...
And I am determined to bring it to a just and successful end.
I will not let anyone, anyone...
Terrorize this city...
And so I am demanding that the Green Arrow turn himself in.
He has 24 hours before I am ordering the SCPD to shoot on sight.
[Reporters clamoring]
That's all.
Thank you.
[Clamoring continues]
Thanks for seeing me.
I know it's late.
Uh, I think we both know our jobs don't recognize late and early.
What can I do for you?
What's this?
That is evidence that Adrian Chase is a false identity.
His real name is Simon Morrison.
In the midst of an investigation, you will learn that he is the Throwing Star Killer.
Oh.
That's one hell of an accusation.
That's why I'm giving you that.
And this evidence comes from where?
An investigation that I've been conducting off the books.
With what personnel?
Work the lead, Captain Pike.
Consider that an order if it helps.
One last thing.
You didn't get that from me.
I serve at the pleasure of the Mayor.
There you are.
Viktor has confirmed Gregor's location, but tell me, why did you want him gone and why are you playing Robin Hood?
I met a woman.
She taught me how to give my darkness an identity so that it doesn't consume me.
And you believed her?
[Speaks Russian]
Oliver, whatever you think is inside you is inside you.
You... you cannot name it like that and keep it apart from you.
This woman's taught me differently.
This woman does not know what she is talking about, and if you're not careful, Oliver, one day she will be the source of your greatest pain.
Oh, my God.
And this is...
We've been calling him Prometheus, but you helped me I.D. him as Simon Morrison.
I've been striking out at getting a location off this, but someone with a cell phone at some point must have entered this room, which means there should be pictures of it on your database.
If I can cross-reference the images of your database with this video,
I should be able to help the police find her.
And that's, like, really cool and noble and all.
I mean, she definitely needs your help...
But?
But, Felicity, we gave you Pandora.
We helped you sort through that data pull, and now, well, people are starting to ask what you're doing for us.
I mean, we didn't invite you in just so you could check items off your to-do list.
Sorry.
It feels gross saying...
No.
Uh, no.
You're right.
Ok.
So quid pro quo.
I help you, you help me.
I was kind of hoping you'd say that.
We've been trying to break the encryption on a certain Homeland security drone.
- Why?
- Need to know, I'm afraid.
Question is what are you willing to quo in exchange for your quid?
Uh, can you check some files for me?
Any legal records you can find on a Simon Morrison.
Thanks.
[Groaning]
Hey.
[Coughs]
Hey.
You ok, buddy?
Need some medical attention or something?
Unh!
- What happened?
- Some lowlife attacked him outside the precinct.
SCPD's canvassing, but the security cameras, they did not get a shot of his face.
But...
How's Pike?
He's comatose.
This was Chase.
I don't know, Oliver.
Murder by lowlife is not exactly his style.
Earlier tonight, I gave Pike a lead connecting Chase to Prometheus.
I thought we didn't have any leads.
Felicity resurfaced with something.
Is Pike's family in there?
Nope, but somebody else is.
Life's just so fragile, isn't it?
Decades of hopes and dreams, and in one moment, one little mistake, and it all just goes away.
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.
Really?
Because so far, you haven't been able to do much to stop me.
Susan's fine by the way.
Well, alive at any rate.
Me and my team are gonna find her, and when we do, the second that we do...
I'm gonna put an arrow right through your heart.
You do realize how impotent you sound, right?
You think this is a game?
I don't feel like playing anymore.
You don't have a choice, Oliver.
If you kill me, you kill Susan, and she will be as dead as your mother, as Tommy, as Shado, as Laurel, as your friend Pike here probably... all dead because of you.
So go ahead.
Kill me.
Let's find out how much more loss you can take because I don't think it's much.
I think that you're one loss away from being destroyed.
I guess we'll have to find another way to handle this then.
You see, that's the beautiful thing about all of this, Oliver.
If you kill me, you'll only really be killing yourself.
[Gunfire]
[Arrow whooshes]
[Grunting]
[Deep voice] Thanks for the assist.
What is thing you are doing with your voice?
[Gunfire]
Ok.
[Both typing]
Ok.
Ok.
Oh, oh!
I'm in.
Whoo!
We're in.
Yes.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did we just accidentally hack a DHS drone system?
Well, I wouldn't exactly say accidentally.
- Tch.
Am I right?
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Felicity, please explain to me why we're hacking Homeland security drones instead of finding Susan's location like you told me we would be!
Because hacking the drones is what's gonna lead us to Susan.
It's... it's...
So complicated.
Holy crap.
You just sent the receiver false data, and now you are spoofing the GPS system.
There's nothing slight about this.
This is just straight-up illegal.
Spill 100% deets right now.
- Right now!
- Ok, ok.
So I've...
I've kind of made some... heh... new friends.
Surprise.
And they have access to unaccessible amounts of data and Intel, tons of it.
They helped me get John out of prison, and now they're willing to help us find Susan.
That's all.
If you redirect a few U.S. border control drones.
Hey.
Don't look at me like that.
Ok.
I've already gotten chapter and verse from John and Oliver.
Please don't, please.
I can't imagine them signing off on you hacking Homeland Security.
They don't know, do they?
All they need to know is that I am a grown woman making my own grown-up decisions.
Hey.
Got anything for me?
Oliver.
What is it, man?
Is it Susan?
Not yet, but it's just a matter of time.
I don't know what I can do to stop it.
Well, Oliver, there are always options, and you're not alone.
Do you think that's the problem?
You've done a wonderful job of convincing me that I'm changing for the better...
With the recruits and the...
[Sighs]
The transparency, more optimism, more... more trust.
You think none of this would have happened if you hadn't trusted Chase, right?
Trusted anyone.
Because I...
I can't see anything past me just creating more targets.
Oliver.
We're not targets, man.
We're your teammates.
We're your strength.
You give me strength until Chase turns it into a weakness.
Look what happened with Susan.
I let myself get close to Susan, and in so doing, I gave Chase a way to get to me.
That could happen with you, with... with Felicity... with my son.
All of you make me vulnerable, John.
Maybe.
Maybe we do...
But caring about people, Oliver, that makes you human.
[Sighs]
Being human's a luxury I might not get to have.
[Cell phone vibrating]
Yeah.
Ok.
Got it.
Tell Dinah and Rene.
Felicity found out where Chase is keeping Susan.
- Let's go!
- John.
There's something I need you to do for me.
If I'm gonna beat this guy, it'll be by playing his game...
And I know someone who makes him vulnerable.
Rene:
This is where Prometheus is holding Susan?
Or at least he was when he shot that video.
I'm reading a few dozen heat signatures inside.
Chase brought backup?
Or he's using decoys.
It's decoys.
Prometheus works alone.
Problem is Susan could be any one of those heat signatures.
We should split up, canvass floor by floor.
Agreed.
Overwatch, any word on Spartan?
Uh, package is en route.
- ETA 5 minutes.
- Package?
Oliver's got something up his green sleeve.
These puppies should help double our search capabilities.
Next time, I get to kick the door in.
Yeah.
Whatever floats your boat, Lassie.
[Beeping]
Get back!
What was that?
Some sort of explosion.
Dinah, Rene, do you copy?
[Coughing]
Ow.
Yeah.
We copy.
But we're trapped in here.
- Oh.
Son of a bitch!
- Yeah.
What if those heat signatures are incendiary devices?
I think we can pretty much confirm that.
We got 5 minutes for search and rescue before this whole place comes down.
You get Dinah and Wild Dog out of here.
- I will find Susan.
- Assuming she's still here.
Which I'm totally sure she still is.
[Ding]
Unh!
Oliver!
Hey.
Are you ok?
- Yeah.
A-Adrian Chase is...
- I know!
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
[Elevator rumbling]
What's happening?
Chase is controlling the elevator.
Susan, we need to get you out of here.
- This building is gonna explode.
- What about...
Chase wants me.
You're no longer his target.
I was gonna say what about you?
I'm gonna finish this.
Get to safety.
Hello, Oliver.
Can you guys hear me in there?
Yeah.
Just waiting on that rescue.
Good.
Step back!
I'm glad Talia told you.
I prefer it this way, face to face.
There's an honesty to it.
Well, honestly...
I'm gonna keep both of us here until this building comes down on top of us.
Then you'd be dead.
So would you.
Really?
You really think I'd let that happen, Oliver?
[Beep]
Remember, I'm always 10 steps ahead of you.
You know, if that were true, you probably would have seen this coming.
Adrian?
You shouldn't be here.
How else was I supposed to find out the truth?
You killed all those people.
It's not that simple.
You killed them.
It's simple.
I know, baby.
This can't be you.
It's not you.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Why did you make her come here?
To get you to stop.
You have to stop.
You have to... you have to turn yourself in.
I can't do that.
Please.
Whatever this is, whatever you're doing, it's over.
You'd tell the police?
No.
You tell them.
You're right.
I'm gonna take care of this.
[Stab]
John!
[Both grunting]
Rahhh!
Felicity:
I've got an ambulance en route to your position.
Oh, my God.
Oliver's in there with Chase.
Go help him now!
Go!
Agh!
Rah!
[Adrian panting]
I told you, Oliver.
I'm not gonna kill you, and you can't kill me.
Yes, Adrian.
Yes, I can!
[Metal scrapes]
[Arrow whooshes]
Felicity:
What's going on?
Guys, some sort of sitrep.
Chase is gone.
And so is Oliver.
Where's Oliver?
- Guys!
- We have to assume that Chase has him.
What about Susan and Chase's wife?
Felicity:
Susan's at the precinct.
Quentin is with her, um, but Doris passed away en route to Starling General.
Rene:
We've got to work on finding Oliver.
Felicity, you found Susan.
You can find him.
You're right.
Felicity, please tell me you're not going to see them again.
Dinah's right.
They're the ones that found Susan.
Agh!
Gregor!
Unh!
[Panting]
Oliver, is that you?
No.
It's the man who's gonna kill you.
Agh!
You up for making a statement?
Yeah, I'm up for anything that puts Adrian Chase in the electric chair.
Actually, we only got lethal injection in this state, but I like your thinking.
Hello, Ms. Williams.
Long time, no see.
You get away from her.
Please don't threaten me.
I'm in mourning.
Haven't you heard?
The Green Arrow killed my wife earlier tonight, and apparently, the mayor's missing.
You wouldn't happen to know where he is, Quentin?
Honestly, it doesn't look good,
Oliver disappearing under these circumstances.
You give me one good reason why I shouldn't have you arrested right now.
Because you don't want your friend back in pieces.
Right?
Everyone's megaimpressed with the DHS hack you did for us.
That's great.
You've also been chosen as the first woman to go to Mars.
Sorry.
A friend of mine is missing.
The information we gave you didn't help?
Different friend.
You have a lot of missing friends.
Yeah, and this time, I have no leads whatsoever.
You guys have better resources than I do, and I have to use everything that I can to find him and do whatever you need me to do for you.
[Chains rattling]
[Metal door opens]
[Footsteps]
Talia:
I don't believe I taught you how to escape from shackles, Oliver.
Your father was an honorable man.
You've allied with a psychopath, and he'd be ashamed of you.
Well, when it comes to the shame of fathers,
I shall bow to your superior expertise.
Just make sure he suffers.
That was always the plan.
My friends will find me.
They're my strength.
That's sweet, but I'm running out of ways to tell you, Oliver.
I'm not interested in killing you.
Then what the hell is this game that we're playing?
When I had Susan as my guest,
I confessed to her that you'd helped me discover who I really am.
That's what I'm gonna help you do, Oliver.
Greg!
Move your head.
Previously on "Arrow"...
This laptop contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from Kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.
This is most disappointing.
I liked many of you.
Prometheus surprised me with a very specific, unique move.
It was taught to me by a woman that I met in Russia.
You think you and Prometheus had the same teacher?
You're accepting the invitation to join Helix.
Full throttle.
What do I do with your secret?
I keep it.
I care about the city, and--and you're working double-time.
Can you talk some sense into him, please?
Mr. Mayor, Thea, meet my wife Doris.
I thought we could talk.
Can we set up a meeting tomorrow?
I'm late for a dinner.
It's important.
You could call it life or death.
You sure this is the place?
I don't see any other monasteries on this mountain.
Felicity's note said something about a demon-- oh, wait, maybe that says, "lemon."
Anyway, I--I texted her, but she has not hit me back.
It says, "demon."
Oliver, I'm losing you!
I'll see you back in Star City.
Where is she?
Who are you?
I'm a former student.
Former, which means you are not welcome here.
No!
Leave us.
I would apologize for my students' enthusiasm, but you should not have come to this place.
Well, Talia, it was difficult to find.
Our business together concluded 5 years ago.
No.
One of your former students is trying to kill me.
Oh, he doesn't want to kill you, Oliver.
He means to destroy you utterly.
You knew?
If you knew, then why would you train him?
Why wouldn't you warn me?
Two years ago, he sought me out.
He'd already learned much about you.
He's a man of remarkable capacity.
Talia, enough!
If you knew what he wanted, then why would you train him?
You killed his father, and I helped him in his pursuit of vengeance because by then you'd killed mine!
I never told you my full name, did I?
No, you didn't.
It's Talia al Ghul.
Ra's al Ghul was your father.
Yes.
My father and I came to be at odds, so I forged my own path...
But he was still my father when you put a sword through his chest.
So that's why you're not gonna help me.
That's why you won't tell who this...
Prometheus is.
Of course I will, Oliver, because I want you to suffer.
He calls himself...
Adrian Chase.

== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Everything ok?
Yes.
Peachy.
Heh.
Let's do this.
- Whoa.
- Yeah.
It's lit, right?
All these people, they're just...
You sound surprised.
Yeah.
I mean, I guess I just thought that a secret hacker organization would be a little bit more, well, I don't know, intimate.
Heh.
Well, Helix is a worldwide operation, kind of like the U.N.
If it actually accomplished things.
You have 3D nanoelectrics designed to interface with a neural network.
We were working on something like this at Palmer Tech, and--
Who do you think we stole the prototype from?
What is that?
Real-time feed from every cell phone camera in the world running through a pattern recognition algo.
Holy-- that's--
So much bigger than anything the NSA is doing.
I know.
That's a lot of power for someone to have who's not government.
Well, the fact that we're not government's not the point.
Power to the people, right?
Yeah.
Power to the people.
Heh.
Welcome to Helix, Felicity.
We're gonna change the world together.
Mr. Queen, I've been trying to reach you--
I need Captain Pike and Quentin Lance in my office, and I need to know where D.A. Chase is right now.
Right now, Mr. Chase is in the conference room.
Treatment for drug addicts over incarceration.
Mr. Mayor, I didn't think you'd be joining us this morning.
I guess you know what I've been up to, huh?
- Yeah.
- I've been working on addressing our sentencing policy for drug offenses.
Care to join?
I'd like to see you in my office, please.
Actually, can it wait?
The councilmen and I are on a clock.
Besides, you're looking a little ragged.
You tired...
Or is it that you've actually been asleep this whole time?
All the captains are dead.
Da.
Gregor will promote new ones loyal to him, and they will kill us all.
Gonna try it this way now.
I got to tell you, I don't know how that mask is gonna play here, especially since the city's not too fond of your alter ego these days.
I'll give them the Throwing Star Killer, see how they feel.
Wait.
That's your big plan, arresting me?
Oh, man, that's a bit of a letdown, I have to say.
Well, I'm not gonna kill you, if only because that's what you want me to do.
But you've done everything I've wanted so far.
Did you really think I'd let all this end in a parking garage?
What did you do?
I gave your girlfriend an exclusive.
Wait.
Are you still dating Susan Williams?
I got to tell you, buddy.
It's been a little hard to keep track.
What did you do to her?
She's fine.
Don't worry.
As long as I'm around to make sure she gets some food and water.
Starvation and dehydration-- terrible way to go.
Bottom line--I die, she dies.
I don't make it back to her in time, she dies.
Now you could try torturing me for her location.
We both know what you're capable of in that department, but...
I think that we both know what I'm capable of, so, Ollie, who do you think can last longer--
Susan or me?
Ohh.
I'm 10 steps ahead of you, and you haven't even figured out what game we're playing yet.
That son of a bitch.
Yeah, I'd say that pretty much covers it.
This is a hell of a city you got here.
District attorney's a serial killer.
He's way worse that that.
Infiltrating the government like that at the highest level right next to Oliver?
We underestimated this guy.
I underestimated him.
I trusted him.
Where is Felicity?
I've been texting her like crazy, but her phone's off.
You don't think that Prometheus has--
No.
No.
His game is Susan.
For now.
We have to make sure Thea's safe.
Lyla and J.J. are secure at Argus.
I got in touch with Thea.
She's fine...
B-but we have to find Susan.
We cannot make a move on Chase until we know she's safe, until we have her here.
Keep looking for Felicity.
You GPS her phone if you have to.
We should go to Pike, tell him Chase is the Throwing Star Killer.
And then he asks for evidence, and you say what?
Look.
Quentin's right.
Dinah, we keep the SCPD out of this until we have something.
This guy has us in check.
Yeah, for now.
Sent Curtis and Dinah to Opal City.
- For Chase's mother.
- He has leverage, we need some of our own.
That's not gonna work.
This guy always seems to be 10 steps ahead.
Well, Oliver, it's pretty easy, you confronting him in public like that.
What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't thinking.
Where you going now?
According to city records, Chase's house has a subbasement.
Chase does everything sideways, man.
I doubt he has Susan someplace obvious.
I don't know what's obvious anymore.
Oh, no.
I can't let you go out there alone.
- I'm going with you.
- I can handle it.
Never said you couldn't.
3 of us cannot defeat Gregor.
We need more men.
No.
We need a way to convince the Bratva that Gregor sold them out.
We had way.
Well, we don't have anyone that can pull data off a bullet-ridden laptop, so...
Without proof, Gregor will say we are traitors.
Rest of Bratva will believe them.
And then they will kill us.
So we've got to kill him first before he tells anyone.
Ok.
You've had enough to drink already.
Where would Gregor go--
I mean, where would he go right now?
He'd go to ground.
Bratva stronghold is hockey rink, but it's heavily protected.
Hmm.
We wouldn't even get through the door.
I think I know someone who can.
I guess Norma Bates got the hell out of Dodge.
Chase anticipated this play.
I never said that he wasn't clever.
So am I.
Um...
What's your toy doing?
It's detecting resonance frequencies upstairs.
It's not a toy.
It's a T-sphere.
Wait.
Every horror movie ever has basically said that you do not go upstairs at a creepy serial killer's mother's house.
Help!
Unh!
Excellent.
Now give us another scream.
So, what, we're supposed to just go to work like things are normal?
Because newsflash-- they ain't.
Tell me something I don't already know.
Ho ho!
I did think of one or two things.
This is nice, everything being out in the open now, all the cards on the table, as it were.
You got some nerve showing up here.
Why wouldn't I?
I take my job very seriously.
Speaking of, I thought my office had requested your verifications on the latest ComStat reports from the SCPD.
What you been doing?
I'm gonna kill you in ways that will hurt.
Threatening a city official's a felony, Mr. Ramirez.
You think you're so clever.
This isn't over, you son of a bitch!
I agree.
In fact, I think we're just getting started.
I want those ComStat verifications on my desk by tomorrow morning, Dog.
We can't just let that son of a bitch walk around here.
- We got to do something.
- We are doing something.
Yeah.
Rene and I have got eyes on Chase.
He's at city hall.
You got a green light to move on his house.
Roger that.
Ok, Spartan.
You check the upstairs and work your way down.
I'll sweep the basement.
We can meet in the middle.
Roger that.
- Please don't hurt me.
- Mrs. Chase.
What are you doing in my hou--
Mrs. Chase, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Get away from me.
Your husband isn't who you think he is.
Get out of my house.
Mrs. Chase, your husband is the Throwing Star Killer.
He's holding an innocent woman hostage, and I need your help to find her.
- You're insane.
- Doris, please.
You need to understand the truth.
You have to know at some level that your husband has been keeping something from you.
And police and the mayor say that you're the killer, you.
On the floor.
On the floor!
Get down on the floor!
On the floor.
Get down on the floor!
You all right, Mrs. Chase?
I'm--I'm fine.
We got a call from your husband.
Don't worry.
We got this handled.
Get her out of here.
Tell me what you want me to do.
I am not getting into a shootout with the SCPD.
Copy that.
I'm out.
Smart move, douchebag.
I wasn't talking to you.
Drop the bow and get on the ground!
Whole thing's about 30 seconds long.
I've been over every frame, and there's nothing to indicate a location.
At least it's proof of life.
Yeah.
She was alive when this video was made, but we don't know how long a--sorry.
It's fine.
He'll-- he'll keep her alive to keep me in check.
I never should have gotten involved with Susan.
I don't know what I was thinking.
You were thinking you were lonely, man.
Everyone needs somebody.
Yeah?
Well, maybe I gave up that right when I put on the hood.
Hi!
Oh!
Hi!
I'm sorry.
I know I'm late.
I'm sorry.
I got Curtis' messages.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm here now.
Sorry.
Can you give us the room, please?
Heh.
Much appreciated.
Yeah.
I usually like my tongue lashings to be done in private, so thank you.
Heh.
I'm...
Sorry.
I'm not angry.
You don't--you don't work for me.
You--
I'm worried.
Right.
Of course, for all you know,
Prometheus could have kkhhk--ooh.
Not...
I'm worried about you.
Oh.
Because you're into something, and you don't want to tell anyone about it, or maybe you just don't want to tell me.
I think we can both agree that keeping secrets doesn't end well, so...
Yeah, you're right.
It's just that right now is not really a good time with everything going on.
You just have to trust me on this one, ok?
- Ok.
- But speaking of the something that I'm into, it actually helped me go through the petabyte of data we took off of Chase's mother's computer.
- This
- Who's Simon Morrison?
- Adrian Chase.
- What?
Simon Morrison is his birth name.
That's his real identity.
But his mother's name is Amanda Westfield.
Yes.
Well, she changed her name when she went off the grid, so it runs in the family.
Well, if Adrian Chase is an alias-- then the proof that his background is fake would be enough for the ACU to arrest his ass.
However you did it, good work.
Let's put this all on the drive.
- I've got to get to city hall.
- Wait.
Oh.
Now?
I mean, it's past 10:00.
Yeah.
Before the 11:00 news,
I have to make a statement on the Green Arrow breaking into the D.A.'s house.
Obviously, this is a horrifying development.
Uh, we believe the Green Arrow was retaliating against this office for speaking out against his recent crimes.
Mr. Mayor.
Ahem.
This office is in complete agreement with D.A. Chase.
This situation has become untenable...
And I am determined to bring it to a just and successful end.
I will not let anyone, anyone...
Terrorize this city...
And so I am demanding that the Green Arrow turn himself in.
He has 24 hours before I am ordering the SCPD to shoot on sight.
That's all.
Thanks for seeing me.
I know it's late.
Uh, I think we both know our jobs don't recognize late and early.
What can I do for you?
What's this?
That is evidence that Adrian Chase is a false identity.
His real name is Simon Morrison.
In the midst of an investigation, you will learn that he is the Throwing Star Killer.
Oh.
That's one hell of an accusation.
That's why I'm giving you that.
And this evidence comes from where?
An investigation that I've been conducting off the books.
With what personnel?
Work the lead, Captain Pike.
Consider that an order if it helps.
One last thing.
You didn't get that from me.
I serve at the pleasure of the mayor.
There you are.
Viktor has confirmed Gregor's location, but tell me, why did you want him gone and why are you playing Robin Hood?
I met a woman.
She taught me how to give my darkness an identity so that it doesn't consume me.
And you believed her?
Oliver, whatever you think is inside you is inside you.
You--you cannot name it like that and keep it apart from you.
This woman's taught me differently.
This woman does not know what she is talking about, and if you're not careful, Oliver, one day she will be the source of your greatest pain.
Oh, my God.
And this is--
We've been calling him Prometheus, but you helped me I.D. him as Simon Morrison.
I've been striking out at getting a location off this, but someone with a cell phone at some point must have entered this room, which means there should be pictures of it on your database.
If I can cross-reference the images of your database with this video,
I should be able to help the police find her.
And that's, like, really cool and noble and all.
I mean, she definitely needs your help...
But?
But, Felicity, we gave you Pandora.
We helped you sort through that data pull, and now, well, people are starting to ask what you're doing for us.
I mean, we didn't invite you in just so you could check items off your to-do list.
Sorry.
It feels gross saying--
No.
Uh, no.
You're right.
Ok.
So quid pro quo.
I help you, you help me.
I was kind of hoping you'd say that.
We've been trying to break the encryption on a certain Homeland security drone.
- Why?
- Need to know, I'm afraid.
Question is what are you willing to quo in exchange for your quid?
Uh, can you check some files for me?
Any legal records you can find on a Simon Morrison.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hey.
You ok, buddy?
Need some medical attention or something?
Unh!
- What happened?
- Some lowlife attacked him outside the precinct.
SCPD's canvassing, but the security cameras, they did not get a shot of his face.
But...
How's Pike?
He's comatose.
This was Chase.
I don't know, Oliver.
Murder by lowlife is not exactly his style.
Earlier tonight, I gave Pike a lead connecting Chase to Prometheus.
I thought we didn't have any leads.
Felicity resurfaced with something.
Is Pike's family in there?
Nope, but somebody else is.
Life's just so fragile, isn't it?
Decades of hopes and dreams, and in one moment, one little mistake, and it all just goes away.
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.
Really?
Because so far, you haven't been able to do much to stop me.
Susan's fine by the way.
Well, alive at any rate.
Me and my team are gonna find her, and when we do, the second that we do...
I'm gonna put an arrow right through your heart.
You do realize how impotent you sound, right?
You think this is a game?
I don't feel like playing anymore.
You don't have a choice, Oliver.
If you kill me, you kill Susan, and she will be as dead as your mother, as Tommy, as Shado, as Laurel, as your friend Pike here probably-- all dead because of you.
So go ahead.
Kill me.
Let's find out how much more loss you can take because I don't think it's much.
I think that you're one loss away from being destroyed.
I guess we'll have to find another way to handle this then.
You see, that's the beautiful thing about all of this, Oliver.
If you kill me, you'll only really be killing yourself.
_
_
_
Thanks for the assist.
What is thing you are doing with your voice?
Ok.
Ok.
Ok.
Oh, oh!
I'm in.
Whoo!
We're in.
Yes.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did we just accidentally hack a DHS drone system?
Well, I wouldn't exactly say accidentally.
- Tch.
Am I right?
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Felicity, please explain to me why we're hacking Homeland security drones instead of finding Susan's location like you told me we would be!
Because hacking the drones is what's gonna lead us to Susan.
It's--it's...
So complicated.
Holy crap.
You just sent the receiver false data, and now you are spoofing the GPS system.
There's nothing slight about this.
This is just straight-up illegal.
Spill 100% deets right now.
- Right now!
- Ok, ok.
So I've--I've kind of made some--heh-- new friends.
Surprise.
And they have access to unaccessible amounts of data and Intel, tons of it.
They helped me get John out of prison, and now they're willing to help us find Susan.
That's all.
If you redirect a few U.S. border control drones.
Hey.
Don't look at me like that.
Ok.
I've already gotten chapter and verse from John and Oliver.
Please don't, please.
I can't imagine them signing off on you hacking Homeland Security.
They don't know, do they?
All they need to know is that I am a grown woman making my own grown-up decisions.
Hey.
Got anything for me?
Oliver.
What is it, man?
Is it Susan?
Not yet, but it's just a matter of time.
I don't know what I can do to stop it.
Well, Oliver, there are always options, and you're not alone.
Do you think that's the problem?
You've done a wonderful job of convincing me that I'm changing for the better...
With the recruits and the...
The transparency, more optimism, more--more trust.
You think none of this would have happened if you hadn't trusted Chase, right?
Trusted anyone.
Because I--I can't see anything past me just creating more targets.
Oliver.
We're not targets, man.
We're your teammates.
We're your strength.
You give me strength until Chase turns it into a weakness.
Look what happened with Susan.
I let myself get close to Susan, and in so doing, I gave Chase a way to get to me.
That could happen with you, with... with Felicity... with my son.
All of you make me vulnerable, John.
Maybe.
Maybe we do...
But caring about people, Oliver, that makes you human.
Being human's a luxury I might not get to have.
Yeah.
Ok.
Got it.
Tell Dinah and Rene.
Felicity found out where Chase is keeping Susan.
- Let's go!
- John.
There's something I need you to do for me.
If I'm gonna beat this guy, it'll be by playing his game...
And I know someone who makes him vulnerable.
This is where Prometheus is holding Susan?
Or at least he was when he shot that video.
I'm reading a few dozen heat signatures inside.
Chase brought backup?
Or he's using decoys.
It's decoys.
Prometheus works alone.
Problem is Susan could be any one of those heat signatures.
We should split up, canvass floor by floor.
Agreed.
Overwatch, any word on Spartan?
Uh, package is en route.
- ETA 5 minutes.
- Package?
Oliver's got something up his green sleeve.
These puppies should help double our search capabilities.
Next time, I get to kick the door in.
Yeah.
Whatever floats your boat, Lassie.
Get back!
What was that?
Some sort of explosion.
Dinah, Rene, do you copy?
Ow.
Yeah.
We copy.
But we're trapped in here.
- Oh.
Son of a bitch!
- Yeah.
What if those heat signatures are incendiary devices?
I think we can pretty much confirm that.
We got 5 minutes for search and rescue before this whole place comes down.
You get Dinah and Wild Dog out of here.
- I will find Susan.
- Assuming she's still here.
Which I'm totally sure she still is.
Unh!
Oliver!
Hey.
Are you ok?
- Yeah.
A-Adrian Chase is--
- I know!
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
What's happening?
Chase is controlling the elevator.
Susan, we need to get you out of here.
- This building is gonna explode.
- What about--
Chase wants me.
You're no longer his target.
I was gonna say what about you?
I'm gonna finish this.
Get to safety.
Hello, Oliver.
Can you guys hear me in there?
Yeah.
Just waiting on that rescue.
Good.
Step back!
I'm glad Talia told you.
I prefer it this way, face to face.
There's an honesty to it.
Well, honestly...
I'm gonna keep both of us here until this building comes down on top of us.
Then you'd be dead.
So would you.
Really?
You really think I'd let that happen, Oliver?
Remember, I'm always 10 steps ahead of you.
You know, if that were true, you probably would have seen this coming.
Adrian?
You shouldn't be here.
How else was I supposed to find out the truth?
You killed all those people.
It's not that simple.
You killed them.
It's simple.
I know, baby.
This can't be you.
It's not you.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Why did you make her come here?
To get you to stop.
You have to stop.
You have to--you have to turn yourself in.
I can't do that.
Please.
Whatever this is, whatever you're doing, it's over.
You'd tell the police?
No.
You tell them.
You're right.
I'm gonna take care of this.
John!
Rahhh!
I've got an ambulance en route to your position.
Oh, my God.
Oliver's in there with Chase.
Go help him now!
Go!
Agh!
Rah!
I told you, Oliver.
I'm not gonna kill you, and you can't kill me.
Yes, Adrian.
Yes, I can!
What's going on?
Guys, some sort of sitrep.
Chase is gone.
And so is Oliver.
Where's Oliver?
- Guys!
- We have to assume that Chase has him.
What about Susan and Chase's wife?
Susan's at the precinct.
Quentin is with her, um, but Doris passed away en route to Starling General.
We've got to work on finding Oliver.
Felicity, you found Susan.
You can find him.
You're right.
Felicity, please tell me you're not going to see them again.
Dinah's right.
They're the ones that found Susan.
Agh!
Gregor!
Unh!
Oliver, is that you?
No.
It's the man who's gonna kill you.
Agh!
You up for making a statement?
Yeah, I'm up for anything that puts Adrian Chase in the electric chair.
Actually, we only got lethal injection in this state, but I like your thinking.
Hello, Ms. Williams.
Long time, no see.
You get away from her.
Please don't threaten me.
I'm in mourning.
Haven't you heard?
The Green Arrow killed my wife earlier tonight, and apparently, the mayor's missing.
You wouldn't happen to know where he is, Quentin?
Honestly, it doesn't look good,
Oliver disappearing under these circumstances.
You give me one good reason why I shouldn't have you arrested right now.
Because you don't want your friend back in pieces.
Right?
Everyone's megaimpressed with the DHS hack you did for us.
That's great.
You've also been chosen as the first woman to go to Mars.
Sorry.
A friend of mine is missing.
The information we gave you didn't help?
Different friend.
You have a lot of missing friends.
Yeah, and this time, I have no leads whatsoever.
You guys have better resources than I do, and I have to use everything that I can to find him and do whatever you need me to do for you.
I don't believe I taught you how to escape from shackles, Oliver.
Your father was an honorable man.
You've allied with a psychopath, and he'd be ashamed of you.
Well, when it comes to the shame of fathers,
I shall bow to your superior expertise.
Just make sure he suffers.
That was always the plan.
My friends will find me.
They're my strength.
That's sweet, but I'm running out of ways to tell you, Oliver.
I'm not interested in killing you.
Then what the hell is this game that we're playing?
When I had Susan as my guest,
I confessed to her that you'd helped me discover who I really am.
That's what I'm gonna help you do, Oliver.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Greg!
Move your head.
Previously on "Arrow"...
This laptop contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from Kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.
This is most disappointing.
I liked many of you.
Oliver:
Prometheus surprised me with a very specific, unique move.
It was taught to me by a woman that I met in Russia.
You think you and Prometheus had the same teacher?
You're accepting the invitation to join Helix.
Full throttle.
What do I do with your secret?
I keep it.
I care about the city, and... and you're working double-time.
Can you talk some sense into him, please?
Mr. Mayor, Thea, meet my wife Doris.
I thought we could talk.
Can we set up a meeting tomorrow?
I'm late for a dinner.
It's important.
You could call it life or death.
You sure this is the place?
I don't see any other monasteries on this mountain.
Felicity's note said something about a demon... oh, wait, maybe that says, "lemon."
Anyway, I...
I texted her, but she has not hit me back.
It says, "demon."
Oliver, I'm losing you!
I'll see you back in Star City.
Where is she?
Who are you?
I'm a former student.
Former, which means you are not welcome here.
No!
Leave us.
I would apologize for my students' enthusiasm, but you should not have come to this place.
Well, Talia, it was difficult to find.
Our business together concluded 5 years ago.
No.
One of your former students is trying to kill me.
Oh, he doesn't want to kill you, Oliver.
He means to destroy you utterly.
You knew?
If you knew, then why would you train him?
Why wouldn't you warn me?
Two years ago, he sought me out.
He'd already learned much about you.
He's a man of remarkable capacity.
Talia, enough!
If you knew what he wanted, then why would you train him?
You killed his father, and I helped him in his pursuit of vengeance because by then you'd killed mine!
I never told you my full name, did I?
No, you didn't.
It's Talia al Ghul.
Ra's al Ghul was your father.
Yes.
My father and I came to be at odds, so I forged my own path...
But he was still my father when you put a sword through his chest.
So that's why you're not gonna help me.
That's why you won't tell who this...
Prometheus is.
Of course I will, Oliver, because I want you to suffer.
He calls himself...
Adrian Chase.
*ARROW Season 05 Episode 16 "Checkmate"
Everything ok?
Yes.
Peachy.
Heh.
Let's do this.
- Whoa.
- Yeah.
It's lit, right?
All these people, they're just...
You sound surprised.
Yeah.
I mean, I guess I just thought that a secret hacker organization would be a little bit more, well, I don't know, intimate.
Heh.
Well, Helix is a worldwide operation, kind of like the U.N.
If it actually accomplished things.
You have 3D nanoelectrics designed to interface with a neural network.
We were working on something like this at Palmer Tech, and...
Who do you think we stole the prototype from?
What is that?
Real-time feed from every cell phone camera in the world running through a pattern recognition algo.
Holy...
that's...
So much bigger than anything the NSA is doing.
I know.
That's a lot of power for someone to have who's not government.
Well, the fact that we're not government's not the point.
Power to the people, right?
Yeah.
Power to the people.
Heh.
Welcome to Helix, Felicity.
We're gonna change the world together.
Woman:
Mr. Queen, I've been
- trying to reach you...
- I need Captain Pike and Quentin Lance in my office, and I need to know where D.A. Chase is right now.
Right now, Mr. Chase is in the conference room.
Treatment for drug addicts over incarceration.
Mr. Mayor, I didn't think you'd be joining us this morning.
I guess you know what I've been up to, huh?
- Yeah.
- I've been working on addressing our sentencing policy for drug offenses.
Care to join?
I'd like to see you in my office, please.
Actually, can it wait?
The councilmen and I are on a clock.
Besides, you're looking a little ragged.
You tired...
Or is it that you've actually been asleep this whole time?
All the captains are dead.
Da.
Gregor will promote new ones loyal to him, and they will kill us all.
Gonna try it this way now.
I got to tell you, I don't know how that mask is gonna play here, especially since the city's not too fond of your alter ego these days.
I'll give them the Throwing Star Killer, see how they feel.
Wait.
That's your big plan, arresting me?
Oh, man, that's a bit of a letdown, I have to say.
Well, I'm not gonna kill you, if only because that's what you want me to do.
But you've done everything I've wanted so far.
Did you really think I'd let all this end in a parking garage?
What did you do?
I gave your girlfriend an exclusive.
Wait.
Are you still dating Susan Williams?
I got to tell you, buddy.
It's been a little hard to keep track.
What did you do to her?
She's fine.
Don't worry.
As long as I'm around to make sure she gets some food and water.
Starvation and dehydration... terrible way to go.
Bottom line...
I die, she dies.
I don't make it back to her in time, she dies.
Now you could try torturing me for her location.
We both know what you're capable of in that department, but...
I think that we both know what I'm capable of, so, Ollie, who do you think can last longer...
Susan or me?
Ohh.
I'm 10 steps ahead of you, and you haven't even figured out what game we're playing yet.
Quentin:
That son of a bitch.
Yeah, I'd say that pretty much covers it.
This is a hell of a city you got here.
District attorney's a serial killer.
He's way worse that that.
Infiltrating the government like that at the highest level right next to Oliver?
We underestimated this guy.
I underestimated him.
I trusted him.
Where is Felicity?
I've been texting her like crazy, but her phone's off.
You don't think that Prometheus has...
No.
No.
His game is Susan.
For now.
We have to make sure Thea's safe.
Lyla and J.J. are secure at Argus.
I got in touch with Thea.
She's fine...
B-but we have to find Susan.
We cannot make a move on Chase until we know she's safe, until we have her here.
Keep looking for Felicity.
You GPS her phone if you have to.
We should go to Pike, tell him Chase is the Throwing Star Killer.
And then he asks for evidence, and you say what?
Look.
Quentin's right.
Dinah, we keep the SCPD out of this until we have something.
This guy has us in check.
Yeah, for now.
John:
Sent Curtis and Dinah to Opal City.
- For Chase's mother.
- He has leverage,
- we need some of our own.
- That's not gonna work.
This guy always seems to be 10 steps ahead.
Well, Oliver, it's pretty easy, you confronting him in public like that.
What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't thinking.
Where you going now?
According to city records, Chase's house has a subbasement.
Chase does everything sideways, man.
I doubt he has Susan someplace obvious.
I don't know what's obvious anymore.
Oh, no.
I can't let you go out there alone.
- I'm going with you.
- I can handle it.
Never said you couldn't.
3 of us cannot defeat Gregor.
We need more men.
No.
We need a way to convince the Bratva that Gregor sold them out.
We had way.
Well, we don't have anyone that can pull data off a bullet-ridden laptop, so...
Without proof, Gregor will say we are traitors.
Rest of Bratva will believe them.
And then they will kill us.
So we've got to kill him first before he tells anyone.
Ok.
You've had enough to drink already.
Where would Gregor go...
I mean, where would he go right now?
He'd go to ground.
Bratva stronghold is hockey rink, but it's heavily protected.
Hmm.
We wouldn't even get through the door.
I think I know someone who can.
I guess Norma Bates got the hell out of Dodge.
Chase anticipated this play.
I never said that he wasn't clever.
So am I.
Um...
What's your toy doing?
It's detecting resonance frequencies upstairs.
It's not a toy.
It's a T-sphere.
Wait.
Every horror movie ever has basically said that you do not go upstairs at a creepy serial killer's mother's house.
Help!
Unh!
Adrian:
Excellent.
Now give us another scream.
So, what, we're supposed to just go to work like things are normal?
Because newsflash...
they ain't.
Tell me something I don't already know.
Chase:
Ho ho!
I did think of one or two things.
This is nice, everything being out in the open now, all the cards on the table, as it were.
You got some nerve showing up here.
Why wouldn't I?
I take my job very seriously.
Speaking of, I thought my office had requested your verifications on the latest ComStat reports from the SCPD.
What you been doing?
I'm gonna kill you in ways that will hurt.
Threatening a city official's a felony, Mr. Ramirez.
You think you're so clever.
This isn't over, you son of a bitch!
I agree.
In fact, I think we're just getting started.
I want those ComStat verifications on my desk by tomorrow morning, Dog.
We can't just let that son of a bitch walk around here.
- We got to do something.
- We are doing something.
Yeah.
Rene and I have got eyes on Chase.
He's at city hall.
You got a green light to move on his house.
Roger that.
Ok, Spartan.
You check the upstairs and work your way down.
I'll sweep the basement.
We can meet in the middle.
Roger that.
- Please don't hurt me.
- Mrs. Chase.
What are you doing in my hou...
Mrs. Chase, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Get away from me.
Your husband isn't who you think he is.
Get out of my house.
Mrs. Chase, your husband is the Throwing Star Killer.
He's holding an innocent woman hostage, and I need your help to find her.
- You're insane.
- Doris, please.
You need to understand the truth.
You have to know at some level that your husband has been keeping something from you.
And police and the mayor say that you're the killer, you.
Officer:
On the floor.
On the floor!
Get down on the floor!
On the floor.
Get down on the floor!
You all right, Mrs. Chase?
I'm...
I'm fine.
We got a call from your husband.
Don't worry.
We got this handled.
Get her out of here.
Tell me what you want me to do.
I am not getting into a shootout with the SCPD.
Copy that.
I'm out.
Smart move, douchebag.
I wasn't talking to you.
Drop the bow and get on the ground!
Whole thing's about 30 seconds long.
I've been over every frame, and there's nothing to indicate a location.
At least it's proof of life.
Yeah.
She was alive when this video was made, but we don't know how long a... sorry.
It's fine.
He'll... he'll keep her alive to keep me in check.
I never should have gotten involved with Susan.
I don't know what I was thinking.
You were thinking you were lonely, man.
Everyone needs somebody.
Yeah?
Well, maybe I gave up that right when I put on the hood.
Felicity:
Hi!
Oh!
Hi!
I'm sorry.
I know I'm late.
I'm sorry.
I got Curtis' messages.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm here now.
Sorry.
Can you give us the room, please?
Heh.
Much appreciated.
Yeah.
I usually like my tongue lashings to be done in private, so thank you.
Heh.
I'm...
Sorry.
I'm not angry.
You don't... you don't work for me.
You...
I'm worried.
Right.
Of course, for all you know,
Prometheus could have kkhhk... ooh.
Not...
I'm worried about you.
Oh.
Because you're into something, and you don't want to tell anyone about it, or maybe you just don't want to tell me.
I think we can both agree that keeping secrets doesn't end well, so...
Yeah, you're right.
It's just that right now is not really a good time with everything going on.
You just have to trust me on this one, ok?
- Ok.
- But speaking of the something that I'm into, it actually helped me go through the petabyte of data we took off of Chase's mother's computer.
- This
- Who's Simon Morrison?
- Adrian Chase.
- What?
Simon Morrison is his birth name.
That's his real identity.
But his mother's name is Amanda Westfield.
Yes.
Well, she changed her name when she went off the grid, so it runs in the family.
Well, if Adrian Chase is an alias... then the proof that his background is fake would be enough for the ACU to arrest his ass.
- However you did it, good work.
- Thank you.
Let's put this all on the drive.
- I've got to get to city hall.
- Wait.
Oh.
Now?
I mean, it's past 10:00.
Yeah.
Before the 11:00 news,
I have to make a statement on the Green Arrow breaking into the D.A.'s house.
Obviously, this is a horrifying development.
Uh, we believe the Green Arrow was retaliating against this office for speaking out against his recent crimes.
Mr. Mayor.
Ahem.
This office is in complete agreement with D.A. Chase.
This situation has become untenable...
And I am determined to bring it to a just and successful end.
I will not let anyone, anyone...
Terrorize this city...
And so I am demanding that the Green Arrow turn himself in.
He has 24 hours before I am ordering the SCPD to shoot on sight.
That's all.
Thank you.
Thanks for seeing me.
I know it's late.
Uh, I think we both know our jobs don't recognize late and early.
What can I do for you?
What's this?
That is evidence that Adrian Chase is a false identity.
His real name is Simon Morrison.
In the midst of an investigation, you will learn that he is the Throwing Star Killer.
Oh.
That's one hell of an accusation.
That's why I'm giving you that.
And this evidence comes from where?
An investigation that I've been conducting off the books.
With what personnel?
Work the lead, Captain Pike.
Consider that an order if it helps.
One last thing.
You didn't get that from me.
I serve at the pleasure of the Mayor.
There you are.
Viktor has confirmed Gregor's location, but tell me, why did you want him gone and why are you playing Robin Hood?
I met a woman.
She taught me how to give my darkness an identity so that it doesn't consume me.
And you believed her?
Oliver, whatever you think is inside you is inside you.
You... you cannot name it like that and keep it apart from you.
This woman's taught me differently.
This woman does not know what she is talking about, and if you're not careful, Oliver, one day she will be the source of your greatest pain.
Oh, my God.
And this is...
We've been calling him Prometheus, but you helped me I.D. him as Simon Morrison.
I've been striking out at getting a location off this, but someone with a cell phone at some point must have entered this room, which means there should be pictures of it on your database.
If I can cross-reference the images of your database with this video,
I should be able to help the police find her.
And that's, like, really cool and noble and all.
I mean, she definitely needs your help...
But?
But, Felicity, we gave you Pandora.
We helped you sort through that data pull, and now, well, people are starting to ask what you're doing for us.
I mean, we didn't invite you in just so you could check items off your to-do list.
Sorry.
It feels gross saying...
No.
Uh, no.
You're right.
Ok.
So quid pro quo.
I help you, you help me.
I was kind of hoping you'd say that.
We've been trying to break the encryption on a certain Homeland security drone.
- Why?
- Need to know, I'm afraid.
Question is what are you willing to quo in exchange for your quid?
Uh, can you check some files for me?
Any legal records you can find on a Simon Morrison.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hey.
You ok, buddy?
Need some medical attention or something?
Unh!
- What happened?
- Some lowlife attacked him outside the precinct.
SCPD's canvassing, but the security cameras, they did not get a shot of his face.
But...
How's Pike?
He's comatose.
This was Chase.
I don't know, Oliver.
Murder by lowlife is not exactly his style.
Earlier tonight, I gave Pike a lead connecting Chase to Prometheus.
I thought we didn't have any leads.
Felicity resurfaced with something.
Is Pike's family in there?
Nope, but somebody else is.
Life's just so fragile, isn't it?
Decades of hopes and dreams, and in one moment, one little mistake, and it all just goes away.
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.
Really?
Because so far, you haven't been able to do much to stop me.
Susan's fine by the way.
Well, alive at any rate.
Me and my team are gonna find her, and when we do, the second that we do...
I'm gonna put an arrow right through your heart.
You do realize how impotent you sound, right?
You think this is a game?
I don't feel like playing anymore.
You don't have a choice, Oliver.
If you kill me, you kill Susan, and she will be as dead as your mother, as Tommy, as Shado, as Laurel, as your friend Pike here probably... all dead because of you.
So go ahead.
Kill me.
Let's find out how much more loss you can take because I don't think it's much.
I think that you're one loss away from being destroyed.
I guess we'll have to find another way to handle this then.
You see, that's the beautiful thing about all of this, Oliver.
If you kill me, you'll only really be killing yourself.
Thanks for the assist.
What is thing you are doing with your voice?
Ok.
Ok.
Ok.
Oh, oh!
I'm in.
Whoo!
We're in.
Yes.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did we just accidentally hack a DHS drone system?
Well, I wouldn't exactly say accidentally.
- Tch.
Am I right?
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Felicity, please explain to me why we're hacking Homeland security drones instead of finding Susan's location like you told me we would be!
Because hacking the drones is what's gonna lead us to Susan.
It's... it's...
So complicated.
Holy crap.
You just sent the receiver false data, and now you are spoofing the GPS system.
There's nothing slight about this.
This is just straight-up illegal.
Spill 100% deets right now.
- Right now!
- Ok, ok.
So I've...
I've kind of made some... heh... new friends.
Surprise.
And they have access to unaccessible amounts of data and Intel, tons of it.
They helped me get John out of prison, and now they're willing to help us find Susan.
That's all.
If you redirect a few U.S. border control drones.
Hey.
Don't look at me like that.
Ok.
I've already gotten chapter and verse from John and Oliver.
Please don't, please.
I can't imagine them signing off on you hacking Homeland Security.
They don't know, do they?
All they need to know is that I am a grown woman making my own grown-up decisions.
Hey.
Got anything for me?
Oliver.
What is it, man?
Is it Susan?
Not yet, but it's just a matter of time.
I don't know what I can do to stop it.
Well, Oliver, there are always options, and you're not alone.
Do you think that's the problem?
You've done a wonderful job of convincing me that I'm changing for the better...
With the recruits and the...
The transparency, more optimism, more... more trust.
You think none of this would have happened if you hadn't trusted Chase, right?
Trusted anyone.
Because I...
I can't see anything past me just creating more targets.
Oliver.
We're not targets, man.
We're your teammates.
We're your strength.
You give me strength until Chase turns it into a weakness.
Look what happened with Susan.
I let myself get close to Susan, and in so doing, I gave Chase a way to get to me.
That could happen with you, with... with Felicity... with my son.
All of you make me vulnerable, John.
Maybe.
Maybe we do...
But caring about people, Oliver, that makes you human.
Being human's a luxury I might not get to have.
Yeah.
Ok.
Got it.
Tell Dinah and Rene.
Felicity found out where Chase is keeping Susan.
- Let's go!
- John.
There's something I need you to do for me.
If I'm gonna beat this guy, it'll be by playing his game...
And I know someone who makes him vulnerable.
Rene:
This is where Prometheus is holding Susan?
Or at least he was when he shot that video.
I'm reading a few dozen heat signatures inside.
Chase brought backup?
Or he's using decoys.
It's decoys.
Prometheus works alone.
Problem is Susan could be any one of those heat signatures.
We should split up, canvass floor by floor.
Agreed.
Overwatch, any word on Spartan?
Uh, package is en route.
- ETA 5 minutes.
- Package?
Oliver's got something up his green sleeve.
These puppies should help double our search capabilities.
Next time, I get to kick the door in.
Yeah.
Whatever floats your boat, Lassie.
Get back!
What was that?
Some sort of explosion.
Dinah, Rene, do you copy?
Ow.
Yeah.
We copy.
But we're trapped in here.
- Oh.
Son of a bitch!
- Yeah.
What if those heat signatures are incendiary devices?
I think we can pretty much confirm that.
We got 5 minutes for search and rescue before this whole place comes down.
You get Dinah and Wild Dog out of here.
- I will find Susan.
- Assuming she's still here.
Which I'm totally sure she still is.
Unh!
Oliver!
Hey.
Are you ok?
- Yeah.
A-Adrian Chase is...
- I know!
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
What's happening?
Chase is controlling the elevator.
Susan, we need to get you out of here.
- This building is gonna explode.
- What about...
Chase wants me.
You're no longer his target.
I was gonna say what about you?
I'm gonna finish this.
Get to safety.
Hello, Oliver.
Can you guys hear me in there?
Yeah.
Just waiting on that rescue.
Good.
Step back!
I'm glad Talia told you.
I prefer it this way, face to face.
There's an honesty to it.
Well, honestly...
I'm gonna keep both of us here until this building comes down on top of us.
Then you'd be dead.
So would you.
Really?
You really think I'd let that happen, Oliver?
Remember, I'm always 10 steps ahead of you.
You know, if that were true, you probably would have seen this coming.
Adrian?
You shouldn't be here.
How else was I supposed to find out the truth?
You killed all those people.
It's not that simple.
You killed them.
It's simple.
I know, baby.
This can't be you.
It's not you.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Why did you make her come here?
To get you to stop.
You have to stop.
You have to... you have to turn yourself in.
I can't do that.
Please.
Whatever this is, whatever you're doing, it's over.
You'd tell the police?
No.
You tell them.
You're right.
I'm gonna take care of this.
John!
Rahhh!
Felicity:
I've got an ambulance en route to your position.
Oh, my God.
Oliver's in there with Chase.
Go help him now!
Go!
Agh!
Rah!
I told you, Oliver.
I'm not gonna kill you, and you can't kill me.
Yes, Adrian.
Yes, I can!
Felicity:
What's going on?
Guys, some sort of sitrep.
Chase is gone.
And so is Oliver.
Where's Oliver?
- Guys!
- We have to assume that Chase has him.
What about Susan and Chase's wife?
Felicity:
Susan's at the precinct.
Quentin is with her, um, but Doris passed away en route to Starling General.
Rene:
We've got to work on finding Oliver.
Felicity, you found Susan.
You can find him.
You're right.
Felicity, please tell me you're not going to see them again.
Dinah's right.
They're the ones that found Susan.
Agh!
Gregor!
Unh!
Oliver, is that you?
No.
It's the man who's gonna kill you.
Agh!
You up for making a statement?
Yeah, I'm up for anything that puts Adrian Chase in the electric chair.
Actually, we only got lethal injection in this state, but I like your thinking.
Hello, Ms. Williams.
Long time, no see.
You get away from her.
Please don't threaten me.
I'm in mourning.
Haven't you heard?
The Green Arrow killed my wife earlier tonight, and apparently, the mayor's missing.
You wouldn't happen to know where he is, Quentin?
Honestly, it doesn't look good,
Oliver disappearing under these circumstances.
You give me one good reason why I shouldn't have you arrested right now.
Because you don't want your friend back in pieces.
Right?
Everyone's megaimpressed with the DHS hack you did for us.
That's great.
You've also been chosen as the first woman to go to Mars.
Sorry.
A friend of mine is missing.
The information we gave you didn't help?
Different friend.
You have a lot of missing friends.
Yeah, and this time, I have no leads whatsoever.
You guys have better resources than I do, and I have to use everything that I can to find him and do whatever you need me to do for you.
I don't believe I taught you how to escape from shackles, Oliver.
Your father was an honorable man.
You've allied with a psychopath, and he'd be ashamed of you.
Well, when it comes to the shame of fathers,
I shall bow to your superior expertise.
Just make sure he suffers.
That was always the plan.
My friends will find me.
They're my strength.
That's sweet, but I'm running out of ways to tell you, Oliver.
I'm not interested in killing you.
Then what the hell is this game that we're playing?
When I had Susan as my guest,
I confessed to her that you'd helped me discover who I really am.
That's what I'm gonna help you do, Oliver.
Greg!
Move your head.
Previously on "Arrow"...
This laptop contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from Kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.
This is most disappointing.
I liked many of you.
Prometheus surprised me with a very specific, unique move.
It was taught to me by a woman that I met in Russia.
You think you and Prometheus had the same teacher?
You're accepting the invitation to join Helix.
Full throttle.
What do I do with your secret?
I keep it.
I care about the city, and--and you're working double-time.
Can you talk some sense into him, please?
Mr. Mayor, Thea, meet my wife Doris.
I thought we could talk.
Can we set up a meeting tomorrow?
I'm late for a dinner.
It's important.
You could call it life or death.
You sure this is the place?
I don't see any other monasteries on this mountain.
Felicity's note said something about a demon-- oh, wait, maybe that says, "lemon."
Anyway, I--I texted her, but she has not hit me back.
It says, "demon."
Oliver, I'm losing you!
I'll see you back in Star City.
Where is she?
Who are you?
I'm a former student.
Former, which means you are not welcome here.
No!
Leave us.
I would apologize for my students' enthusiasm, but you should not have come to this place.
Well, Talia, it was difficult to find.
Our business together concluded 5 years ago.
No.
One of your former students is trying to kill me.
Oh, he doesn't want to kill you, Oliver.
He means to destroy you utterly.
You knew?
If you knew, then why would you train him?
Why wouldn't you warn me?
Two years ago, he sought me out.
He'd already learned much about you.
He's a man of remarkable capacity.
Talia, enough!
If you knew what he wanted, then why would you train him?
You killed his father, and I helped him in his pursuit of vengeance because by then you'd killed mine!
I never told you my full name, did I?
No, you didn't.
It's Talia al Ghul.
Ra's al Ghul was your father.
Yes.
My father and I came to be at odds, so I forged my own path...
But he was still my father when you put a sword through his chest.
So that's why you're not gonna help me.
That's why you won't tell who this...
Prometheus is.
Of course I will, Oliver, because I want you to suffer.
He calls himself...
Adrian Chase.

== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Everything ok?
Yes.
Peachy.
Heh.
Let's do this.
- Whoa.
- Yeah.
It's lit, right?
All these people, they're just...
You sound surprised.
Yeah.
I mean, I guess I just thought that a secret hacker organization would be a little bit more, well, I don't know, intimate.
Heh.
Well, Helix is a worldwide operation, kind of like the U.N.
If it actually accomplished things.
You have 3D nanoelectrics designed to interface with a neural network.
We were working on something like this at Palmer Tech, and--
Who do you think we stole the prototype from?
What is that?
Real-time feed from every cell phone camera in the world running through a pattern recognition algo.
Holy-- that's--
So much bigger than anything the NSA is doing.
I know.
That's a lot of power for someone to have who's not government.
Well, the fact that we're not government is the whole point.
Power to the people, right?
Yeah.
Power to the people.
Heh.
Welcome to Helix, Felicity.
We're gonna change the world together.
Mr. Queen, I've been trying to reach you--
I need Captain Pike and Quentin Lance in my office, and I need to know where D.A. Chase is right now.
Right now, Mr. Chase is in the conference room.
Treatment for drug addicts over incarceration.
Mr. Mayor, I didn't think you'd be joining us this morning.
I guess you know what I've been up to, huh?
- Yeah.
- I've been working on addressing our sentencing policy for drug offenses.
Care to join?
I'd like to see you in my office, please.
Actually, can it wait?
The councilmen and I are on a clock.
Besides, you're looking a little ragged.
You tired...
Or is it that you've actually been asleep this whole time?
All the captains are dead.
Da.
Gregor will promote new ones loyal to him, and they will kill us all.
Gonna try it this way now.
I got to tell you, I don't know how that mask is gonna play here, especially since the city's not too fond of your alter ego these days.
I'll give them the Throwing Star Killer, see how they feel.
Wait.
That's your big plan, arresting me?
Oh, man, that's a bit of a letdown, I have to say.
Well, I'm not gonna kill you, if only because that's what you want me to do.
But you've done everything I've wanted so far.
Did you really think I'd let all this end in a parking garage?
What did you do?
I gave your girlfriend an exclusive.
Wait.
Are you still dating Susan Williams?
I got to tell you, buddy.
It's been a little hard to keep track.
What did you do to her?
She's fine.
Don't worry.
As long as I'm around to make sure she gets some food and water.
Starvation and dehydration-- terrible way to go.
Bottom line--I die, she dies.
I don't make it back to her in time, she dies.
Now you could try torturing me for her location.
We both know what you're capable of in that department, but...
I think that we both know what I'm capable of, so, Ollie, who do you think can last longer--
Susan or me?
Ohh.
I'm 10 steps ahead of you, and you haven't even figured out what game we're playing yet.
That son of a bitch.
Yeah, I'd say that pretty much covers it.
This is a hell of a city you got here.
District attorney's a serial killer.
He's way worse that that.
Infiltrating the government like that at the highest level right next to Oliver?
We underestimated this guy.
I underestimated him.
I trusted him.
Where is Felicity?
I've been texting her like crazy, but her phone's off.
You don't think that Prometheus has--
No.
No.
His game is Susan.
For now.
We have to make sure Thea's safe.
Lyla and J.J. are secure at Argus.
I got in touch with Thea.
She's fine...
B-but we have to find Susan.
We cannot make a move on Chase until we know she's safe, until we have her here.
Keep looking for Felicity.
You GPS her phone if you have to.
We should go to Pike, tell him Chase is the Throwing Star Killer.
And then he asks for evidence, and you say what?
Look.
Quentin's right.
Dinah, we keep the SCPD out of this until we have something.
This guy has us in check.
Yeah, for now.
Sent Curtis and Dinah to Opal City.
- For Chase's mother.
- He has leverage, we need some of our own.
That's not gonna work.
This guy always seems to be 10 steps ahead.
Well, Oliver, it's pretty easy, you confronting him in public like that.
What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't thinking.
Where you going now?
According to city records, Chase's house has a subbasement.
Chase does everything sideways, man.
I doubt he has Susan someplace obvious.
I don't know what's obvious anymore.
Oh, no.
I can't let you go out there alone.
- I'm going with you.
- I can handle it.
Never said you couldn't.
3 of us cannot defeat Gregor.
We need more men.
No.
We need a way to convince the Bratva that Gregor sold them out.
We had way.
Well, we don't have anyone that can pull data off a bullet-ridden laptop, so...
Without proof, Gregor will say we are traitors.
Rest of Bratva will believe them.
And then they will kill us.
So we've got to kill him first before he tells anyone.
Ok.
You've had enough to drink already.
Where would Gregor go--
I mean, where would he go right now?
He'd go to ground.
Bratva stronghold is hockey rink, but it's heavily protected.
Hmm.
We wouldn't even get through the door.
I think I know someone who can.
I guess Norma Bates got the hell out of Dodge.
Chase anticipated this play.
I never said that he wasn't clever.
So am I.
Um...
What's your toy doing?
It's detecting resonance frequencies upstairs.
It's not a toy.
It's a T-sphere.
Wait.
Every horror movie ever has basically said that you do not go upstairs at a creepy serial killer's mother's house.
Help!
Unh!
Excellent.
Now give us another scream.
So, what, we're supposed to just go to work like things are normal?
Because newsflash-- they ain't.
Tell me something I don't already know.
Ho ho!
I did think of one or two things.
This is nice, everything being out in the open now, all the cards on the table, as it were.
You got some nerve showing up here.
Why wouldn't I?
I take my job very seriously.
Speaking of, I thought my office had requested your verifications on the latest ComStat reports from the SCPD.
What you been doing?
I'm gonna kill you in ways that will hurt.
Threatening a city official's a felony, Mr. Ramirez.
You think you're so clever.
This isn't over, you son of a bitch!
I agree.
In fact, I think we're just getting started.
I want those ComStat verifications on my desk by tomorrow morning, Dog.
We can't just let that son of a bitch walk around here.
- We got to do something.
- We are doing something.
Yeah.
Rene and I have got eyes on Chase.
He's at city hall.
You got a green light to move on his house.
Roger that.
Ok, Spartan.
You check the upstairs and work your way down.
I'll sweep the basement.
We can meet in the middle.
Roger that.
- Please don't hurt me.
- Mrs. Chase.
What are you doing in my hou--
Mrs. Chase, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Get away from me.
Your husband isn't who you think he is.
Get out of my house.
Mrs. Chase, your husband is the Throwing Star Killer.
He's holding an innocent woman hostage, and I need your help to find her.
- You're insane.
- Doris, please.
You need to understand the truth.
You have to know at some level that your husband has been keeping something from you.
And police and the mayor say that you're the killer, you.
On the floor.
On the floor!
Get down on the floor!
Did you hear me?
Get down on the floor!
Now!
You all right, Mrs. Chase?
I'm--I'm fine.
We got a call from your husband.
Don't worry.
We got this handled.
Get her out of here.
Tell me what you want me to do.
I am not getting into a shootout with the SCPD.
Copy that.
I'm out.
Smart move, douchebag.
I wasn't talking to you.
Drop the bow and get on the ground!
Whole thing's about 30 seconds long.
I've been over every frame, and there's nothing to indicate a location.
At least it's proof of life.
Yeah.
She was alive when this video was made, but we don't know how long a--sorry.
It's fine.
He'll-- he'll keep her alive to keep me in check.
I never should have gotten involved with Susan.
I don't know what I was thinking.
You were thinking you were lonely, man.
Everyone needs somebody.
Yeah?
Well, maybe I gave up that right when I put on the hood.
Hi!
Oh!
Hi!
I'm sorry.
I know I'm late.
I'm sorry.
I got Curtis' messages.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm here now.
Sorry.
Can you give us the room, please?
Heh.
Much appreciated.
Yeah.
I usually like my tongue lashings to be done in private, so thank you.
Heh.
I'm...
Sorry.
I'm not angry.
You don't--you don't work for me.
You--
I'm worried.
Right.
Of course, for all you know,
Prometheus could have kkhhk--ooh.
Not...
I'm worried about you.
Oh.
Because you're into something, and you don't want to tell anyone about it, or maybe you just don't want to tell me.
I think we can both agree that keeping secrets doesn't end well, so...
Yeah, you're right.
It's just that right now is not really a good time with everything going on.
You just have to trust me on this one, ok?
- Ok.
- But speaking of the something that I'm into, it actually helped me go through the petabyte of data we took off of Chase's mother's computer.
- This
- Who's Simon Morrison?
- Adrian Chase.
- What?
Simon Morrison is his birth name.
That's his real identity.
But his mother's name is Amanda Westfield.
Yes.
Well, she changed her name when she went off the grid, so it runs in the family.
Well, if Adrian Chase is an alias-- then the proof that his background is fake would be enough for the ACU to arrest his ass.
However you did it, good work.
Let's put this all on the drive.
- I've got to get to city hall.
- Wait.
Oh.
Now?
I mean, it's past 10:00.
Yeah.
Before the 11:00 news,
I have to make a statement on the Green Arrow breaking into the D.A.'s house.
Obviously, this is a horrifying development.
Uh, we believe the Green Arrow was retaliating against this office for speaking out against his recent crimes.
Mr. Mayor.
Ahem.
This office is in complete agreement with D.A. Chase.
This situation has become untenable...
And I am determined to bring it to a just and successful end.
I will not let anyone, anyone...
Terrorize this city...
And so I am demanding that the Green Arrow turn himself in.
He has 24 hours before I am ordering the SCPD to shoot on sight.
That's all.
Thank you.
Thanks for seeing me.
I know it's late.
Uh, I think we both know our jobs don't recognize late and early.
What can I do for you?
What's this?
That is evidence that Adrian Chase is a false identity.
His real name is Simon Morrison.
In the midst of an investigation, you will learn that he is the Throwing Star Killer.
Oh.
That's one hell of an accusation.
That's why I'm giving you that.
And this evidence comes from where?
An investigation that I've been conducting off the books.
With what personnel?
Work the lead, Captain Pike.
Consider that an order if it helps.
One last thing.
You didn't get that from me.
I serve at the pleasure of the mayor.
There you are.
Viktor has confirmed Gregor's location, but tell me, why did you want him gone and why are you playing Robin Hood?
I met a woman.
She taught me how to give my darkness an identity so that it doesn't consume me.
And you believed her?
Oliver, whatever you think is inside you is inside you.
You--you cannot name it like that and keep it apart from you.
This woman's taught me differently.
This woman does not know what she is talking about, and if you're not careful, Oliver, one day she will be the source of your greatest pain.
Oh, my God.
And this is--
We've been calling him Prometheus, but you helped me I.D. him as Simon Morrison.
I've been striking out at getting a location off this, but someone with a cell phone at some point must have entered this room, which means there should be pictures of it on your database.
If I can cross-reference the images of your database with this video,
I should be able to help the police find her.
And that's, like, really cool and noble and all.
I mean, she definitely needs your help...
But?
But, Felicity, we gave you Pandora.
We helped you sort through that data pull, and now, well, people are starting to ask what you're doing for us.
I mean, we didn't invite you in just so you could check items off your to-do list.
Sorry.
It feels gross saying--
No.
Uh, no.
You're right.
Ok.
So quid pro quo.
I help you, you help me.
I was kind of hoping you'd say that.
We've been trying to break the encryption on a certain Homeland security drone.
- Why?
- Need to know, I'm afraid.
Question is what are you willing to quo in exchange for your quid?
Uh, can you check some files for me?
Any legal records you can find on a Simon Morrison.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hey.
You ok, buddy?
Need some medical attention or something?
Unh!
- What happened?
- Some lowlife attacked him outside the precinct.
SCPD's canvassing, but the security cameras, they did not get a shot of his face.
But...
How's Pike?
He's comatose.
This was Chase.
I don't know, Oliver.
Murder by lowlife is not exactly his style.
Earlier tonight, I gave Pike a lead connecting Chase to Prometheus.
I thought we didn't have any leads.
Felicity resurfaced with something.
Is Pike's family in there?
Nope, but somebody else is.
Life's just so fragile, isn't it?
Decades of hopes and dreams, and in one moment, one little mistake, and it all just goes away.
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.
Really?
Because so far, you haven't been able to do much to stop me.
Susan's fine by the way.
Well, alive at any rate.
Me and my team are gonna find her, and when we do, the second that we do...
I'm gonna put an arrow right through your heart.
You do realize how impotent you sound, right?
You think this is a game?
I don't feel like playing anymore.
You don't have a choice, Oliver.
If you kill me, you kill Susan, and she will be as dead as your mother, as Tommy, as Shado, as Laurel, as your friend Pike here probably-- all dead because of you.
So go ahead.
Kill me.
Let's find out how much more loss you can take because I don't think it's much.
I think that you're one loss away from being destroyed.
I guess we'll have to find another way to handle this then.
You see, that's the beautiful thing about all of this, Oliver.
If you kill me, you'll only really be killing yourself.
_
_
_
Thanks for the assist.
What is thing you are doing with your voice?
Ok.
Ok.
Ok.
Oh, oh!
I'm in.
Whoo!
We're in.
Yes.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did we just accidentally hack a DHS drone system?
Well, I wouldn't exactly say accidentally.
- Tch.
Am I right?
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Felicity, please explain to me why we're hacking Homeland security drones instead of finding Susan's location like you told me we would be!
Because hacking the drones is what's gonna lead us to Susan.
It's--it's...
So complicated.
Holy crap.
You just sent the receiver false data, and now you are spoofing the GPS system.
There's nothing slight about this.
This is just straight-up illegal.
Spill 100% deets right now.
- Right now!
- Ok, ok.
So I've--I've kind of made some--heh-- new friends.
Surprise.
And they have access to inaccessible amounts of data and Intel, tons of it.
They helped me get John out of prison, and now they're willing to help us find Susan.
That's all.
If you redirect a few U.S. border control drones.
Hey.
Don't look at me like that.
Ok.
I've already gotten chapter and verse from John and Oliver.
Please don't, please.
I can't imagine them signing off on you hacking Homeland Security.
They don't know, do they?
All they need to know is that I am a grown woman making my own grown-up decisions.
Hey.
Got anything for me?
Oliver.
What is it, man?
Is it Susan?
Not yet, but it's just a matter of time.
I don't know what I can do to stop it.
Well, Oliver, there are always options, and you're not alone.
Do you think that's the problem?
You've done a wonderful job of convincing me that I'm changing for the better...
With the recruits and the...
The transparency, more optimism, more--more trust.
You think none of this would have happened if you hadn't trusted Chase, right?
Trusted anyone.
Because I--I can't see anything past me just creating more targets.
Oliver.
We're not targets, man.
We're your teammates.
We're your strength.
You give me strength until Chase turns it into a weakness.
Look what happened with Susan.
I let myself get close to Susan, and in so doing, I gave Chase a way to get to me.
That could happen with you, with... with Felicity... with my son.
All of you make me vulnerable, John.
Maybe.
Maybe we do...
But caring about people, Oliver, that makes you human.
Being human's a luxury I might not get to have.
Yeah.
Ok.
Got it.
Tell Dinah and Rene.
Felicity found out where Chase is keeping Susan.
- Let's go!
- No no.
John.
There's something I need you to do for me.
If I'm gonna beat this guy, it'll be by playing his game...
And I know someone who makes him vulnerable.
This is where Prometheus is holding Susan?
Or at least he was when he shot that video.
I'm reading a few dozen heat signatures inside.
Chase brought backup?
Or he's using decoys.
It's decoys.
Prometheus works alone.
Problem is Susan could be any one of those heat signatures.
We should split up, canvass floor by floor.
Agreed.
Overwatch, any word on Spartan?
Uh, package is en route.
- ETA 5 minutes.
- Package?
Oliver's got something up his green sleeve.
These puppies should help double our search capabilities.
Next time, I get to kick the door in.
Yeah.
Whatever floats your boat, Lassie.
Get back!
What was that?
Some sort of explosion.
Dinah, Rene, do you copy?
Ow.
Yeah.
We copy.
But we're trapped in here.
- Oh.
Son of a bitch!
- Yeah.
What if those heat signatures are incendiary devices?
I think we can pretty much confirm that.
We got 5 minutes for search and rescue before this whole place comes down.
You get Dinah and Wild Dog out of here.
- I will find Susan.
- Assuming she's still here.
Which I'm totally sure she still is.
Unh!
Oliver!
Hey.
Are you ok?
- Yeah.
A-Adrian Chase is--
- I know!
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
What's happening?
Chase is controlling the elevator.
Susan, we need to get you out of here.
- This building is gonna explode.
- What about--
Chase wants me.
You're no longer his target.
I was gonna say what about you?
I'm gonna finish this.
Get to safety.
Hello, Oliver.
Can you guys hear me in there?
Yeah.
Just waiting on that rescue.
Good.
Step back!
I'm glad Talia told you.
I prefer it this way, face to face.
There's an honesty to it.
Well, honestly...
I'm gonna keep both of us here until this building comes down on top of us.
Then you'd be dead.
So would you.
Really?
You really think I'd let that happen, Oliver?
Remember, I'm always 10 steps ahead of you.
You know, if that were true, you probably would have seen this coming.
Adrian?
You shouldn't be here.
How else was I supposed to find out the truth?
You killed all those people.
It's not that simple.
You killed them.
It's simple.
I know, baby.
This can't be you.
It's not you.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Why did you make her come here?
To get you to stop.
You have to stop.
You have to--you have to turn yourself in.
I can't do that.
Please.
Whatever this is, whatever you're doing, it's over.
You'd tell the police?
No.
You tell them.
You're right.
I'm gonna take care of this.
John!
Rahhh!
I've got an ambulance en route to your position.
Oh, my God.
Oliver's in there with Chase.
Go help him now!
Go!
Agh!
Rah!
I told you, Oliver.
I'm not gonna kill you, and you can't kill me.
Yes, Adrian.
Yes, I can!
What's going on?
Guys, some sort of sitrep.
Chase is gone.
And so is Oliver.
Where's Oliver?
- Guys!
- We have to assume that Chase has him.
What about Susan and Chase's wife?
Susan's at the precinct.
Quentin is with her, um, but Doris passed away en route to Starling General.
We've got to work on finding Oliver.
Felicity, you found Susan.
You can find him.
You're right.
Felicity, please tell me you're not going to see them again.
Dinah's right.
They're the ones that found Susan.
Agh!
Gregor!
Unh!
Oliver, is that you?
No.
It's the man who's gonna kill you.
Agh!
You up for making a statement?
Yeah, I'm up for anything that puts Adrian Chase in the electric chair.
Actually, we only got lethal injection in this state, but I like your thinking.
Hello, Ms. Williams.
Long time, no see.
You get away from her.
Please don't threaten me.
I'm in mourning.
Haven't you heard?
The Green Arrow killed my wife earlier tonight, and apparently, the mayor's missing.
You wouldn't happen to know where he is, Quentin?
Honestly, it doesn't look good,
Oliver disappearing under these circumstances.
You give me one good reason why I shouldn't have you arrested right now.
Because you don't want your friend back in pieces.
Right?
Everyone's megaimpressed with the DHS hack you did for us.
That's great.
You've also been chosen as the first woman to go to Mars.
Sorry.
A friend of mine is missing.
The information we gave you didn't help?
Different friend.
You have a lot of missing friends.
Yeah, and this time, I have no leads whatsoever.
You guys have better resources than I do, and I have to use everything that I can to find him and do whatever you need me to do for you.
I don't believe I taught you how to escape from shackles, Oliver.
Your father was an honorable man.
You've allied with a psychopath, and he'd be ashamed of you.
Well, when it comes to the shame of fathers,
I shall bow to your superior expertise.
Just make sure he suffers.
That was always the plan.
My friends will find me.
They're my strength.
That's sweet, but I'm running out of ways to tell you, Oliver.
I'm not interested in killing you.
Then what the hell is this game that we're playing?
When I had Susan as my guest,
I confessed to her that you'd helped me discover who I really am.
That's what I'm gonna help you do, Oliver.

Greg!
Move your head.
Previously on "Arrow"...
This laptop contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from Kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.
This is most disappointing.
I liked many of you.
Prometheus surprised me with a very specific, unique move.
It was taught to me by a woman that I met in Russia.
You think you and Prometheus had the same teacher?
You're accepting the invitation to join Helix.
Full throttle.
What do I do with your secret?
I keep it.
I care about the city, and... and you're working double-time.
Can you talk some sense into him, please?
Mr. Mayor, Thea, meet my wife Doris.
I thought we could talk.
Can we set up a meeting tomorrow?
I'm late for a dinner.
It's important.
You could call it life or death.
You sure this is the place?
I don't see any other monasteries on this mountain.
Felicity's note said something about a demon... oh, wait, maybe that says, "lemon."
Anyway, I...
I texted her, but she has not hit me back.
It says, "demon."
Oliver, I'm losing you!
I'll see you back in Star City.
Where is she?
Who are you?
I'm a former student.
Former, which means you are not welcome here.
No!
Leave us.
I would apologize for my students' enthusiasm, but you should not have come to this place.
Well, Talia, it was difficult to find.
Our business together concluded 5 years ago.
No.
One of your former students is trying to kill me.
Oh, he doesn't want to kill you, Oliver.
He means to destroy you utterly.
You knew?
If you knew, then why would you train him?
Why wouldn't you warn me?
Two years ago, he sought me out.
He'd already learned much about you.
He's a man of remarkable capacity.
Talia, enough!
If you knew what he wanted, then why would you train him?
You killed his father, and I helped him in his pursuit of vengeance because by then you'd killed mine!
I never told you my full name, did I?
No, you didn't.
It's Talia al Ghul.
Ra's al Ghul was your father.
Yes.
My father and I came to be at odds, so I forged my own path...
But he was still my father when you put a sword through his chest.
So that's why you're not gonna help me.
That's why you won't tell who this...
Prometheus is.
Of course I will, Oliver, because I want you to suffer.
He calls himself...
Adrian Chase.
*ARROW Season 05 Episode 16 "Checkmate"
Everything ok?
Yes.
Peachy.
Heh.
Let's do this.
- Whoa.
- Yeah.
It's lit, right?
All these people, they're just...
You sound surprised.
Yeah.
I mean, I guess I just thought that a secret hacker organization would be a little bit more, well, I don't know, intimate.
Heh.
Well, Helix is a worldwide operation, kind of like the U.N.
If it actually accomplished things.
You have 3D nanoelectrics designed to interface with a neural network.
We were working on something like this at Palmer Tech, and...
Who do you think we stole the prototype from?
What is that?
Real-time feed from every cell phone camera in the world running through a pattern recognition algo.
Holy...
that's...
So much bigger than anything the NSA is doing.
I know.
That's a lot of power for someone to have who's not government.
Well, the fact that we're not government's not the point.
Power to the people, right?
Yeah.
Power to the people.
Heh.
Welcome to Helix, Felicity.
We're gonna change the world together.
Mr. Queen, I've been
- trying to reach you...
- I need Captain Pike and Quentin Lance in my office, and I need to know where D.A. Chase is right now.
Right now, Mr. Chase is in the conference room.
Treatment for drug addicts over incarceration.
Mr. Mayor, I didn't think you'd be joining us this morning.
I guess you know what I've been up to, huh?
- Yeah.
- I've been working on addressing our sentencing policy for drug offenses.
Care to join?
I'd like to see you in my office, please.
Actually, can it wait?
The councilmen and I are on a clock.
Besides, you're looking a little ragged.
You tired...
Or is it that you've actually been asleep this whole time?
All the captains are dead.
Da.
Gregor will promote new ones loyal to him, and they will kill us all.
Gonna try it this way now.
I got to tell you, I don't know how that mask is gonna play here, especially since the city's not too fond of your alter ego these days.
I'll give them the Throwing Star Killer, see how they feel.
Wait.
That's your big plan, arresting me?
Oh, man, that's a bit of a letdown, I have to say.
Well, I'm not gonna kill you, if only because that's what you want me to do.
But you've done everything I've wanted so far.
Did you really think I'd let all this end in a parking garage?
What did you do?
I gave your girlfriend an exclusive.
Wait.
Are you still dating Susan Williams?
I got to tell you, buddy.
It's been a little hard to keep track.
What did you do to her?
She's fine.
Don't worry.
As long as I'm around to make sure she gets some food and water.
Starvation and dehydration... terrible way to go.
Bottom line...
I die, she dies.
I don't make it back to her in time, she dies.
Now you could try torturing me for her location.
We both know what you're capable of in that department, but...
I think that we both know what I'm capable of, so, Ollie, who do you think can last longer...
Susan or me?
Ohh.
I'm 10 steps ahead of you, and you haven't even figured out what game we're playing yet.
Quentin:
That son of a bitch.
Yeah, I'd say that pretty much covers it.
This is a hell of a city you got here.
District attorney's a serial killer.
He's way worse that that.
Infiltrating the government like that at the highest level right next to Oliver?
We underestimated this guy.
I underestimated him.
I trusted him.
Where is Felicity?
I've been texting her like crazy, but her phone's off.
You don't think that Prometheus has...
No.
No.
His game is Susan.
For now.
We have to make sure Thea's safe.
Lyla and J.J. are secure at Argus.
I got in touch with Thea.
She's fine...
B-but we have to find Susan.
We cannot make a move on Chase until we know she's safe, until we have her here.
Keep looking for Felicity.
You GPS her phone if you have to.
We should go to Pike, tell him Chase is the Throwing Star Killer.
And then he asks for evidence, and you say what?
Look.
Quentin's right.
Dinah, we keep the SCPD out of this until we have something.
This guy has us in check.
Yeah, for now.
Sent Curtis and Dinah to Opal City.
- For Chase's mother.
- He has leverage,
- we need some of our own.
- That's not gonna work.
This guy always seems to be 10 steps ahead.
Well, Oliver, it's pretty easy, you confronting him in public like that.
What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't thinking.
Where you going now?
According to city records, Chase's house has a subbasement.
Chase does everything sideways, man.
I doubt he has Susan someplace obvious.
I don't know what's obvious anymore.
Oh, no.
I can't let you go out there alone.
- I'm going with you.
- I can handle it.
Never said you couldn't.
3 of us cannot defeat Gregor.
We need more men.
No.
We need a way to convince the Bratva that Gregor sold them out.
We had way.
Well, we don't have anyone that can pull data off a bullet-ridden laptop, so...
Without proof, Gregor will say we are traitors.
Rest of Bratva will believe them.
And then they will kill us.
So we've got to kill him first before he tells anyone.
Ok.
You've had enough to drink already.
Where would Gregor go...
I mean, where would he go right now?
He'd go to ground.
Bratva stronghold is hockey rink, but it's heavily protected.
Hmm.
We wouldn't even get through the door.
I think I know someone who can.
I guess Norma Bates got the hell out of Dodge.
Chase anticipated this play.
I never said that he wasn't clever.
So am I.
Um...
What's your toy doing?
It's detecting resonance frequencies upstairs.
It's not a toy.
It's a T-sphere.
Wait.
Every horror movie ever has basically said that you do not go upstairs at a creepy serial killer's mother's house.
Help!
Unh!
Excellent.
Now give us another scream.
So, what, we're supposed to just go to work like things are normal?
Because newsflash...
they ain't.
Tell me something I don't already know.
Ho ho!
I did think of one or two things.
This is nice, everything being out in the open now, all the cards on the table, as it were.
You got some nerve showing up here.
Why wouldn't I?
I take my job very seriously.
Speaking of, I thought my office had requested your verifications on the latest ComStat reports from the SCPD.
What you been doing?
I'm gonna kill you in ways that will hurt.
Threatening a city official's a felony, Mr. Ramirez.
You think you're so clever.
This isn't over, you son of a bitch!
I agree.
In fact, I think we're just getting started.
I want those ComStat verifications on my desk by tomorrow morning, Dog.
We can't just let that son of a bitch walk around here.
- We got to do something.
- We are doing something.
Yeah.
Rene and I have got eyes on Chase.
He's at city hall.
You got a green light to move on his house.
Roger that.
Ok, Spartan.
You check the upstairs and work your way down.
I'll sweep the basement.
We can meet in the middle.
Roger that.
- Please don't hurt me.
- Mrs. Chase.
What are you doing in my hou...
Mrs. Chase, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Get away from me.
Your husband isn't who you think he is.
Get out of my house.
Mrs. Chase, your husband is the Throwing Star Killer.
He's holding an innocent woman hostage, and I need your help to find her.
- You're insane.
- Doris, please.
You need to understand the truth.
You have to know at some level that your husband has been keeping something from you.
And police and the mayor say that you're the killer, you.
On the floor.
On the floor!
Get down on the floor!
On the floor.
Get down on the floor!
You all right, Mrs. Chase?
I'm...
I'm fine.
We got a call from your husband.
Don't worry.
We got this handled.
Get her out of here.
Tell me what you want me to do.
I am not getting into a shootout with the SCPD.
Copy that.
I'm out.
Smart move, douchebag.
I wasn't talking to you.
Drop the bow and get on the ground!
Whole thing's about 30 seconds long.
I've been over every frame, and there's nothing to indicate a location.
At least it's proof of life.
Yeah.
She was alive when this video was made, but we don't know how long a... sorry.
It's fine.
He'll... he'll keep her alive to keep me in check.
I never should have gotten involved with Susan.
I don't know what I was thinking.
You were thinking you were lonely, man.
Everyone needs somebody.
Yeah?
Well, maybe I gave up that right when I put on the hood.
Hi!
Oh!
Hi!
I'm sorry.
I know I'm late.
I'm sorry.
I got Curtis' messages.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm here now.
Sorry.
Can you give us the room, please?
Heh.
Much appreciated.
Yeah.
I usually like my tongue lashings to be done in private, so thank you.
Heh.
I'm...
Sorry.
I'm not angry.
You don't... you don't work for me.
You...
I'm worried.
Right.
Of course, for all you know,
Prometheus could have kkhhk... ooh.
Not...
I'm worried about you.
Oh.
Because you're into something, and you don't want to tell anyone about it, or maybe you just don't want to tell me.
I think we can both agree that keeping secrets doesn't end well, so...
Yeah, you're right.
It's just that right now is not really a good time with everything going on.
You just have to trust me on this one, ok?
- Ok.
- But speaking of the something that I'm into, it actually helped me go through the petabyte of data we took off of Chase's mother's computer.
- This
- Who's Simon Morrison?
- Adrian Chase.
- What?
Simon Morrison is his birth name.
That's his real identity.
But his mother's name is Amanda Westfield.
Yes.
Well, she changed her name when she went off the grid, so it runs in the family.
Well, if Adrian Chase is an alias... then the proof that his background is fake would be enough for the ACU to arrest his ass.
- However you did it, good work.
- Thank you.
Let's put this all on the drive.
- I've got to get to city hall.
- Wait.
Oh.
Now?
I mean, it's past 10:00.
Yeah.
Before the 11:00 news,
I have to make a statement on the Green Arrow breaking into the D.A.'s house.
Obviously, this is a horrifying development.
Uh, we believe the Green Arrow was retaliating against this office for speaking out against his recent crimes.
Mr. Mayor.
Ahem.
This office is in complete agreement with D.A. Chase.
This situation has become untenable...
And I am determined to bring it to a just and successful end.
I will not let anyone, anyone...
Terrorize this city...
And so I am demanding that the Green Arrow turn himself in.
He has 24 hours before I am ordering the SCPD to shoot on sight.
That's all.
Thank you.
Thanks for seeing me.
I know it's late.
Uh, I think we both know our jobs don't recognize late and early.
What can I do for you?
What's this?
That is evidence that Adrian Chase is a false identity.
His real name is Simon Morrison.
In the midst of an investigation, you will learn that he is the Throwing Star Killer.
Oh.
That's one hell of an accusation.
That's why I'm giving you that.
And this evidence comes from where?
An investigation that I've been conducting off the books.
With what personnel?
Work the lead, Captain Pike.
Consider that an order if it helps.
One last thing.
You didn't get that from me.
I serve at the pleasure of the Mayor.
There you are.
Viktor has confirmed Gregor's location, but tell me, why did you want him gone and why are you playing Robin Hood?
I met a woman.
She taught me how to give my darkness an identity so that it doesn't consume me.
And you believed her?
Oliver, whatever you think is inside you is inside you.
You... you cannot name it like that and keep it apart from you.
This woman's taught me differently.
This woman does not know what she is talking about, and if you're not careful, Oliver, one day she will be the source of your greatest pain.
Oh, my God.
And this is...
We've been calling him Prometheus, but you helped me I.D. him as Simon Morrison.
I've been striking out at getting a location off this, but someone with a cell phone at some point must have entered this room, which means there should be pictures of it on your database.
If I can cross-reference the images of your database with this video,
I should be able to help the police find her.
And that's, like, really cool and noble and all.
I mean, she definitely needs your help...
But?
But, Felicity, we gave you Pandora.
We helped you sort through that data pull, and now, well, people are starting to ask what you're doing for us.
I mean, we didn't invite you in just so you could check items off your to-do list.
Sorry.
It feels gross saying...
No.
Uh, no.
You're right.
Ok.
So quid pro quo.
I help you, you help me.
I was kind of hoping you'd say that.
We've been trying to break the encryption on a certain Homeland security drone.
- Why?
- Need to know, I'm afraid.
Question is what are you willing to quo in exchange for your quid?
Uh, can you check some files for me?
Any legal records you can find on a Simon Morrison.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hey.
You ok, buddy?
Need some medical attention or something?
Unh!
- What happened?
- Some lowlife attacked him outside the precinct.
SCPD's canvassing, but the security cameras, they did not get a shot of his face.
But...
How's Pike?
He's comatose.
This was Chase.
I don't know, Oliver.
Murder by lowlife is not exactly his style.
Earlier tonight, I gave Pike a lead connecting Chase to Prometheus.
I thought we didn't have any leads.
Felicity resurfaced with something.
Is Pike's family in there?
Nope, but somebody else is.
Life's just so fragile, isn't it?
Decades of hopes and dreams, and in one moment, one little mistake, and it all just goes away.
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.
Really?
Because so far, you haven't been able to do much to stop me.
Susan's fine by the way.
Well, alive at any rate.
Me and my team are gonna find her, and when we do, the second that we do...
I'm gonna put an arrow right through your heart.
You do realize how impotent you sound, right?
You think this is a game?
I don't feel like playing anymore.
You don't have a choice, Oliver.
If you kill me, you kill Susan, and she will be as dead as your mother, as Tommy, as Shado, as Laurel, as your friend Pike here probably... all dead because of you.
So go ahead.
Kill me.
Let's find out how much more loss you can take because I don't think it's much.
I think that you're one loss away from being destroyed.
I guess we'll have to find another way to handle this then.
You see, that's the beautiful thing about all of this, Oliver.
If you kill me, you'll only really be killing yourself.
Thanks for the assist.
What is thing you are doing with your voice?
Ok.
Ok.
Ok.
Oh, oh!
I'm in.
Whoo!
We're in.
Yes.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did we just accidentally hack a DHS drone system?
Well, I wouldn't exactly say accidentally.
- Tch.
Am I right?
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Felicity, please explain to me why we're hacking Homeland security drones instead of finding Susan's location like you told me we would be!
Because hacking the drones is what's gonna lead us to Susan.
It's... it's...
So complicated.
Holy crap.
You just sent the receiver false data, and now you are spoofing the GPS system.
There's nothing slight about this.
This is just straight-up illegal.
Spill 100% deets right now.
- Right now!
- Ok, ok.
So I've...
I've kind of made some... heh... new friends.
Surprise.
And they have access to unaccessible amounts of data and Intel, tons of it.
They helped me get John out of prison, and now they're willing to help us find Susan.
That's all.
If you redirect a few U.S. border control drones.
Hey.
Don't look at me like that.
Ok.
I've already gotten chapter and verse from John and Oliver.
Please don't, please.
I can't imagine them signing off on you hacking Homeland Security.
They don't know, do they?
All they need to know is that I am a grown woman making my own grown-up decisions.
Hey.
Got anything for me?
Oliver.
What is it, man?
Is it Susan?
Not yet, but it's just a matter of time.
I don't know what I can do to stop it.
Well, Oliver, there are always options, and you're not alone.
Do you think that's the problem?
You've done a wonderful job of convincing me that I'm changing for the better...
With the recruits and the...
The transparency, more optimism, more... more trust.
You think none of this would have happened if you hadn't trusted Chase, right?
Trusted anyone.
Because I...
I can't see anything past me just creating more targets.
Oliver.
We're not targets, man.
We're your teammates.
We're your strength.
You give me strength until Chase turns it into a weakness.
Look what happened with Susan.
I let myself get close to Susan, and in so doing, I gave Chase a way to get to me.
That could happen with you, with... with Felicity... with my son.
All of you make me vulnerable, John.
Maybe.
Maybe we do...
But caring about people, Oliver, that makes you human.
Being human's a luxury I might not get to have.
Yeah.
Ok.
Got it.
Tell Dinah and Rene.
Felicity found out where Chase is keeping Susan.
- Let's go!
- John.
There's something I need you to do for me.
If I'm gonna beat this guy, it'll be by playing his game...
And I know someone who makes him vulnerable.
This is where Prometheus is holding Susan?
Or at least he was when he shot that video.
I'm reading a few dozen heat signatures inside.
Chase brought backup?
Or he's using decoys.
It's decoys.
Prometheus works alone.
Problem is Susan could be any one of those heat signatures.
We should split up, canvass floor by floor.
Agreed.
Overwatch, any word on Spartan?
Uh, package is en route.
- ETA 5 minutes.
- Package?
Oliver's got something up his green sleeve.
These puppies should help double our search capabilities.
Next time, I get to kick the door in.
Yeah.
Whatever floats your boat, Lassie.
Get back!
What was that?
Some sort of explosion.
Dinah, Rene, do you copy?
Ow.
Yeah.
We copy.
But we're trapped in here.
- Oh.
Son of a bitch!
- Yeah.
What if those heat signatures are incendiary devices?
I think we can pretty much confirm that.
We got 5 minutes for search and rescue before this whole place comes down.
You get Dinah and Wild Dog out of here.
- I will find Susan.
- Assuming she's still here.
Which I'm totally sure she still is.
Unh!
Oliver!
Hey.
Are you ok?
- Yeah.
A-Adrian Chase is...
- I know!
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
What's happening?
Chase is controlling the elevator.
Susan, we need to get you out of here.
- This building is gonna explode.
- What about...
Chase wants me.
You're no longer his target.
I was gonna say what about you?
I'm gonna finish this.
Get to safety.
Hello, Oliver.
Can you guys hear me in there?
Yeah.
Just waiting on that rescue.
Good.
Step back!
I'm glad Talia told you.
I prefer it this way, face to face.
There's an honesty to it.
Well, honestly...
I'm gonna keep both of us here until this building comes down on top of us.
Then you'd be dead.
So would you.
Really?
You really think I'd let that happen, Oliver?
Remember, I'm always 10 steps ahead of you.
You know, if that were true, you probably would have seen this coming.
Adrian?
You shouldn't be here.
How else was I supposed to find out the truth?
You killed all those people.
It's not that simple.
You killed them.
It's simple.
I know, baby.
This can't be you.
It's not you.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Why did you make her come here?
To get you to stop.
You have to stop.
You have to... you have to turn yourself in.
I can't do that.
Please.
Whatever this is, whatever you're doing, it's over.
You'd tell the police?
No.
You tell them.
You're right.
I'm gonna take care of this.
John!
Rahhh!
I've got an ambulance en route to your position.
Oh, my God.
Oliver's in there with Chase.
Go help him now!
Go!
Agh!
Rah!
I told you, Oliver.
I'm not gonna kill you, and you can't kill me.
Yes, Adrian.
Yes, I can!
What's going on?
Guys, some sort of sitrep.
Chase is gone.
And so is Oliver.
Where's Oliver?
- Guys!
- We have to assume that Chase has him.
What about Susan and Chase's wife?
Susan's at the precinct.
Quentin is with her, um, but Doris passed away en route to Starling General.
We've got to work on finding Oliver.
Felicity, you found Susan.
You can find him.
You're right.
Felicity, please tell me you're not going to see them again.
Dinah's right.
They're the ones that found Susan.
Agh!
Gregor!
Unh!
Oliver, is that you?
No.
It's the man who's gonna kill you.
Agh!
You up for making a statement?
Yeah, I'm up for anything that puts Adrian Chase in the electric chair.
Actually, we only got lethal injection in this state, but I like your thinking.
Hello, Ms. Williams.
Long time, no see.
You get away from her.
Please don't threaten me.
I'm in mourning.
Haven't you heard?
The Green Arrow killed my wife earlier tonight, and apparently, the mayor's missing.
You wouldn't happen to know where he is, Quentin?
Honestly, it doesn't look good,
Oliver disappearing under these circumstances.
You give me one good reason why I shouldn't have you arrested right now.
Because you don't want your friend back in pieces.
Right?
Everyone's megaimpressed with the DHS hack you did for us.
That's great.
You've also been chosen as the first woman to go to Mars.
Sorry.
A friend of mine is missing.
The information we gave you didn't help?
Different friend.
You have a lot of missing friends.
Yeah, and this time, I have no leads whatsoever.
You guys have better resources than I do, and I have to use everything that I can to find him and do whatever you need me to do for you.
I don't believe I taught you how to escape from shackles, Oliver.
Your father was an honorable man.
You've allied with a psychopath, and he'd be ashamed of you.
Well, when it comes to the shame of fathers,
I shall bow to your superior expertise.
Just make sure he suffers.
That was always the plan.
My friends will find me.
They're my strength.
That's sweet, but I'm running out of ways to tell you, Oliver.
I'm not interested in killing you.
Then what the hell is this game that we're playing?
When I had Susan as my guest,
I confessed to her that you'd helped me discover who I really am.
That's what I'm gonna help you do, Oliver.
Greg!
Move your head.
Oliver:
Previously on "Arrow"...
This laptop contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from Kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.
This is most disappointing.
I liked many of you.
Oliver:
Prometheus surprised me with a very specific, unique move.
It was taught to me by a woman that I met in Russia.
You think you and Prometheus had the same teacher?
You're accepting the invitation to join Helix.
Full throttle.
What do I do with your secret?
I keep it.
I care about the city, and--and you're working double-time.
Can you talk some sense into him, please?
Mr. Mayor, Thea, meet my wife Doris.
I thought we could talk.
Can we set up a meeting tomorrow?
I'm late for a dinner.
It's important.
You could call it life or death.
You sure this is the place?
Curtis:
I don't see any other monasteries on this mountain.
Felicity's note said something about a demon-- oh, wait, maybe that says, "lemon."
Anyway, I--I texted her, but she has not hit me back.
It says, "demon."
Oliver, I'm losing you!
I'll see you back in Star City.
[Typing]
[People grunting, trading blows]
Where is she?
Who are you?
I'm a former student.
Former, which means you are not welcome here.
Talia:
No!
Leave us.
I would apologize for my students' enthusiasm, but you should not have come to this place.
Well, Talia, it was difficult to find.
Our business together concluded 5 years ago.
No.
One of your former students is trying to kill me.
Oh, he doesn't want to kill you, Oliver.
He means to destroy you utterly.
You knew?
If you knew, then why would you train him?
Why wouldn't you warn me?
Two years ago, he sought me out.
He'd already learned much about you.
He's a man of remarkable capacity.
Talia, enough!
If you knew what he wanted, then why would you train him?
You killed his father, and I helped him in his pursuit of vengeance because by then you'd killed mine!
I never told you my full name, did I?
No, you didn't.
It's Talia al Ghul.
[Exhales]
Ra's al Ghul was your father.
Yes.
My father and I came to be at odds, so I forged my own path...
But he was still my father when you put a sword through his chest.
So that's why you're not gonna help me.
That's why you won't tell who this...
Prometheus is.
Of course I will, Oliver, because I want you to suffer.
He calls himself...
Adrian Chase.

Everything ok?
Yes.
Peachy.
Heh.
Let's do this.
- Whoa.
- Yeah.
It's lit, right?
All these people, they're just...
You sound surprised.
Yeah.
I mean, I guess I just thought that a secret hacker organization would be a little bit more, well, I don't know, intimate.
Heh.
Well, Helix is a worldwide operation, kind of like the U.N.
If it actually accomplished things.
You have 3D nanoelectrics designed to interface with a neural network.
We were working on something like this at Palmer Tech, and--
Who do you think we stole the prototype from?
What is that?
Real-time feed from every cell phone camera in the world running through a pattern recognition algo.
Holy-- that's--
So much bigger than anything the NSA is doing.
I know.
That's a lot of power for someone to have who's not government.
Well, the fact that we're not government's not the point.
Power to the people, right?
Yeah.
Power to the people.
Heh.
Welcome to Helix, Felicity.
We're gonna change the world together.
Woman:
Mr. Queen, I've been trying to reach you--
I need Captain Pike and Quentin Lance in my office, and I need to know where D.A. Chase is right now.
Right now, Mr. Chase is in the conference room.
Treatment for drug addicts over incarceration.
Mr. Mayor, I didn't think you'd be joining us this morning.
I guess you know what I've been up to, huh?
- Yeah.
- I've been working on addressing our sentencing policy for drug offenses.
Care to join?
I'd like to see you in my office, please.
Actually, can it wait?
The councilmen and I are on a clock.
Besides, you're looking a little ragged.
You tired...
Or is it that you've actually been asleep this whole time?
All the captains are dead.
Da.
Gregor will promote new ones loyal to him, and they will kill us all.
Gonna try it this way now.
I got to tell you, I don't know how that mask is gonna play here, especially since the city's not too fond of your alter ego these days.
I'll give them the Throwing Star Killer, see how they feel.
Wait.
That's your big plan, arresting me?
Oh, man, that's a bit of a letdown, I have to say.
Well, I'm not gonna kill you, if only because that's what you want me to do.
But you've done everything I've wanted so far.
Did you really think I'd let all this end in a parking garage?
What did you do?
I gave your girlfriend an exclusive.
Wait.
Are you still dating Susan Williams?
I got to tell you, buddy.
It's been a little hard to keep track.
What did you do to her?
She's fine.
Don't worry.
As long as I'm around to make sure she gets some food and water.
Starvation and dehydration-- terrible way to go.
Bottom line--I die, she dies.
I don't make it back to her in time, she dies.
Now you could try torturing me for her location.
We both know what you're capable of in that department, but...
I think that we both know what I'm capable of, so, Ollie, who do you think can last longer--
Susan or me?
Ohh.
I'm 10 steps ahead of you, and you haven't even figured out what game we're playing yet.
Quentin:
That son of a bitch.
Yeah, I'd say that pretty much covers it.
This is a hell of a city you got here.
District attorney's a serial killer.
He's way worse that that.
Infiltrating the government like that at the highest level right next to Oliver?
We underestimated this guy.
I underestimated him.
I trusted him.
Where is Felicity?
I've been texting her like crazy, but her phone's off.
You don't think that Prometheus has--
No.
No.
His game is Susan.
For now.
We have to make sure Thea's safe.
Lyla and J.J. are secure at Argus.
I got in touch with Thea.
She's fine...
B-but we have to find Susan.
We cannot make a move on Chase until we know she's safe, until we have her here.
Keep looking for Felicity.
You GPS her phone if you have to.
We should go to Pike, tell him Chase is the Throwing Star Killer.
And then he asks for evidence, and you say what?
Look.
Quentin's right.
Dinah, we keep the SCPD out of this until we have something.
This guy has us in check.
Yeah, for now.
John:
Sent Curtis and Dinah to Opal City.
- For Chase's mother.
- He has leverage, we need some of our own.
That's not gonna work.
This guy always seems to be 10 steps ahead.
Well, Oliver, it's pretty easy, you confronting him in public like that.
What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't thinking.
Where you going now?
According to city records, Chase's house has a subbasement.
Chase does everything sideways, man.
I doubt he has Susan someplace obvious.
I don't know what's obvious anymore.
Oh, no.
I can't let you go out there alone.
- I'm going with you.
- I can handle it.
Never said you couldn't.
3 of us cannot defeat Gregor.
We need more men.
No.
We need a way to convince the Bratva that Gregor sold them out.
We had way.
Well, we don't have anyone that can pull data off a bullet-ridden laptop, so...
Without proof, Gregor will say we are traitors.
Rest of Bratva will believe them.
And then they will kill us.
So we've got to kill him first before he tells anyone.
Ok.
You've had enough to drink already.
[Sighs]
Where would Gregor go--
I mean, where would he go right now?
He'd go to ground.
Bratva stronghold is hockey rink, but it's heavily protected.
Hmm.
We wouldn't even get through the door.
I think I know someone who can.
I guess Norma Bates got the hell out of Dodge.
Chase anticipated this play.
I never said that he wasn't clever.
So am I.
Um...
What's your toy doing?
It's detecting resonance frequencies upstairs.
It's not a toy.
It's a T-sphere.
Wait.
Every horror movie ever has basically said that you do not go upstairs at a creepy serial killer's mother's house.
[Susan screams]
Help!
[Sobbing]
Unh!
Adrian:
Excellent.
Now give us another scream.
So, what, we're supposed to just go to work like things are normal?
Because newsflash-- they ain't.
Tell me something I don't already know.
Chase:
Ho ho!
I did think of one or two things.
This is nice, everything being out in the open now, all the cards on the table, as it were.
You got some nerve showing up here.
Why wouldn't I?
I take my job very seriously.
Speaking of, I thought my office had requested your verifications on the latest ComStat reports from the SCPD.
What you been doing?
I'm gonna kill you in ways that will hurt.
Threatening a city official's a felony, Mr. Ramirez.
You think you're so clever.
This isn't over, you son of a bitch!
I agree.
In fact, I think we're just getting started.
I want those ComStat verifications on my desk by tomorrow morning, Dog.
We can't just let that son of a bitch walk around here.
- We got to do something.
- We are doing something.
Yeah.
Rene and I have got eyes on Chase.
He's at city hall.
You got a green light to move on his house.
Roger that.
Ok, Spartan.
You check the upstairs and work your way down.
I'll sweep the basement.
We can meet in the middle.
Roger that.
- Please don't hurt me.
- Mrs. Chase.
What are you doing in my hou--
Mrs. Chase, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Get away from me.
Your husband isn't who you think he is.
Get out of my house.
Mrs. Chase, your husband is the Throwing Star Killer.
He's holding an innocent woman hostage, and I need your help to find her.
- You're insane.
- Doris, please.
You need to understand the truth.
You have to know at some level that your husband has been keeping something from you.
And police and the mayor say that you're the killer, you.
Officer:
On the floor.
On the floor!
Get down on the floor!
On the floor.
Get down on the floor!
You all right, Mrs. Chase?
I'm--I'm fine.
We got a call from your husband.
Don't worry.
We got this handled.
Get her out of here.
Tell me what you want me to do.
I am not getting into a shootout with the SCPD.
Copy that.
I'm out.
Smart move, douchebag.
I wasn't talking to you.
Drop the bow and get on the ground!
[Groans]
Whole thing's about 30 seconds long.
I've been over every frame, and there's nothing to indicate a location.
At least it's proof of life.
Yeah.
She was alive when this video was made, but we don't know how long a--sorry.
It's fine.
He'll-- he'll keep her alive to keep me in check.
I never should have gotten involved with Susan.
I don't know what I was thinking.
You were thinking you were lonely, man.
Everyone needs somebody.
Yeah?
Well, maybe I gave up that right when I put on the hood.
Felicity:
Hi!
Oh!
Hi!
I'm sorry.
I know I'm late.
I'm sorry.
I got Curtis' messages.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm here now.
Sorry.
Can you give us the room, please?
Heh.
Much appreciated.
Yeah.
I usually like my tongue lashings to be done in private, so thank you.
Heh.
I'm...
Sorry.
I'm not angry.
You don't--you don't work for me.
You--
I'm worried.
Right.
Of course, for all you know,
Prometheus could have kkhhk--ooh.
Not...
I'm worried about you.
Oh.
Because you're into something, and you don't want to tell anyone about it, or maybe you just don't want to tell me.
I think we can both agree that keeping secrets doesn't end well, so...
Yeah, you're right.
It's just that right now is not really a good time with everything going on.
You just have to trust me on this one, ok?
- Ok.
- But speaking of the something that I'm into, it actually helped me go through the petabyte of data we took off of Chase's mother's computer.
- This
- Who's Simon Morrison?
- Adrian Chase.
- What?
Simon Morrison is his birth name.
That's his real identity.
But his mother's name is Amanda Westfield.
Yes.
Well, she changed her name when she went off the grid, so it runs in the family.
Well, if Adrian Chase is an alias-- then the proof that his background is fake would be enough for the ACU to arrest his ass.
However you did it, good work.
Let's put this all on the drive.
- I've got to get to city hall.
- Wait.
Oh.
Now?
I mean, it's past 10:00.
Yeah.
Before the 11:00 news,
I have to make a statement on the Green Arrow breaking into the D.A.'s house.
Obviously, this is a horrifying development.
Uh, we believe the Green Arrow was retaliating against this office for speaking out against his recent crimes.
Mr. Mayor.
[Camera shutters clicking]
Ahem.
This office is in complete agreement with D.A. Chase.
This situation has become untenable...
And I am determined to bring it to a just and successful end.
I will not let anyone, anyone...
Terrorize this city...
And so I am demanding that the Green Arrow turn himself in.
He has 24 hours before I am ordering the SCPD to shoot on sight.
[Reporters clamoring]
That's all.
[Clamoring continues]
Thanks for seeing me.
I know it's late.
Uh, I think we both know our jobs don't recognize late and early.
What can I do for you?
What's this?
That is evidence that Adrian Chase is a false identity.
His real name is Simon Morrison.
In the midst of an investigation, you will learn that he is the Throwing Star Killer.
Oh.
That's one hell of an accusation.
That's why I'm giving you that.
And this evidence comes from where?
An investigation that I've been conducting off the books.
With what personnel?
Work the lead, Captain Pike.
Consider that an order if it helps.
One last thing.
You didn't get that from me.
I serve at the pleasure of the mayor.
There you are.
Viktor has confirmed Gregor's location, but tell me, why did you want him gone and why are you playing Robin Hood?
I met a woman.
She taught me how to give my darkness an identity so that it doesn't consume me.
And you believed her?
[Speaks Russian]
Oliver, whatever you think is inside you is inside you.
You--you cannot name it like that and keep it apart from you.
This woman's taught me differently.
This woman does not know what she is talking about, and if you're not careful, Oliver, one day she will be the source of your greatest pain.
Oh, my God.
And this is--
We've been calling him Prometheus, but you helped me I.D. him as Simon Morrison.
I've been striking out at getting a location off this, but someone with a cell phone at some point must have entered this room, which means there should be pictures of it on your database.
If I can cross-reference the images of your database with this video,
I should be able to help the police find her.
And that's, like, really cool and noble and all.
I mean, she definitely needs your help...
But?
But, Felicity, we gave you Pandora.
We helped you sort through that data pull, and now, well, people are starting to ask what you're doing for us.
I mean, we didn't invite you in just so you could check items off your to-do list.
Sorry.
It feels gross saying--
No.
Uh, no.
You're right.
Ok.
So quid pro quo.
I help you, you help me.
I was kind of hoping you'd say that.
We've been trying to break the encryption on a certain Homeland security drone.
- Why?
- Need to know, I'm afraid.
Question is what are you willing to quo in exchange for your quid?
Uh, can you check some files for me?
Any legal records you can find on a Simon Morrison.
Thanks.
[Groaning]
Hey.
[Coughs]
Hey.
You ok, buddy?
Need some medical attention or something?
Unh!
- What happened?
- Some lowlife attacked him outside the precinct.
SCPD's canvassing, but the security cameras, they did not get a shot of his face.
But...
How's Pike?
He's comatose.
This was Chase.
I don't know, Oliver.
Murder by lowlife is not exactly his style.
Earlier tonight, I gave Pike a lead connecting Chase to Prometheus.
I thought we didn't have any leads.
Felicity resurfaced with something.
Is Pike's family in there?
Nope, but somebody else is.
Life's just so fragile, isn't it?
Decades of hopes and dreams, and in one moment, one little mistake, and it all just goes away.
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.
Really?
Because so far, you haven't been able to do much to stop me.
Susan's fine by the way.
Well, alive at any rate.
Me and my team are gonna find her, and when we do, the second that we do...
I'm gonna put an arrow right through your heart.
You do realize how impotent you sound, right?
You think this is a game?
I don't feel like playing anymore.
You don't have a choice, Oliver.
If you kill me, you kill Susan, and she will be as dead as your mother, as Tommy, as Shado, as Laurel, as your friend Pike here probably-- all dead because of you.
So go ahead.
Kill me.
Let's find out how much more loss you can take because I don't think it's much.
I think that you're one loss away from being destroyed.
I guess we'll have to find another way to handle this then.
You see, that's the beautiful thing about all of this, Oliver.
If you kill me, you'll only really be killing yourself.
_

[Gunfire]

[Arrow whooshes]
[Grunting]
[Deep voice] Thanks for the assist.
What is thing you are doing with your voice?
[Gunfire]
Ok.
[Both typing]
Ok.
Ok.
Oh, oh!
I'm in.
Whoo!
We're in.
Yes.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did we just accidentally hack a DHS drone system?
Well, I wouldn't exactly say accidentally.
- Tch.
Am I right?
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Felicity, please explain to me why we're hacking Homeland security drones instead of finding Susan's location like you told me we would be!
Because hacking the drones is what's gonna lead us to Susan.
It's--it's...
So complicated.
Holy crap.
You just sent the receiver false data, and now you are spoofing the GPS system.
There's nothing slight about this.
This is just straight-up illegal.
Spill 100% deets right now.
- Right now!
- Ok, ok.
So I've--I've kind of made some--heh-- new friends.
Surprise.
And they have access to unaccessible amounts of data and Intel, tons of it.
They helped me get John out of prison, and now they're willing to help us find Susan.
That's all.
If you redirect a few U.S. border control drones.
Hey.
Don't look at me like that.
Ok.
I've already gotten chapter and verse from John and Oliver.
Please don't, please.
I can't imagine them signing off on you hacking Homeland Security.
They don't know, do they?
All they need to know is that I am a grown woman making my own grown-up decisions.
Hey.
Got anything for me?
Oliver.
What is it, man?
Is it Susan?
Not yet, but it's just a matter of time.
I don't know what I can do to stop it.
Well, Oliver, there are always options, and you're not alone.
Do you think that's the problem?
You've done a wonderful job of convincing me that I'm changing for the better...
With the recruits and the...
[Sighs]
The transparency, more optimism, more--more trust.
You think none of this would have happened if you hadn't trusted Chase, right?
Trusted anyone.
Because I--I can't see anything past me just creating more targets.
Oliver.
We're not targets, man.
We're your teammates.
We're your strength.
You give me strength until Chase turns it into a weakness.
Look what happened with Susan.
I let myself get close to Susan, and in so doing, I gave Chase a way to get to me.
That could happen with you, with... with Felicity... with my son.
All of you make me vulnerable, John.
Maybe.
Maybe we do...
But caring about people, Oliver, that makes you human.
[Sighs]
Being human's a luxury I might not get to have.
[Cell phone vibrating]
Yeah.
Ok.
Got it.
Tell Dinah and Rene.
Felicity found out where Chase is keeping Susan.
- Let's go!
- John.
There's something I need you to do for me.
If I'm gonna beat this guy, it'll be by playing his game...
And I know someone who makes him vulnerable.
Rene:
This is where Prometheus is holding Susan?
Or at least he was when he shot that video.
I'm reading a few dozen heat signatures inside.
Chase brought backup?
Or he's using decoys.
It's decoys.
Prometheus works alone.
Problem is Susan could be any one of those heat signatures.
We should split up, canvass floor by floor.
Agreed.
Overwatch, any word on Spartan?
Uh, package is en route.
- ETA 5 minutes.
- Package?
Oliver's got something up his green sleeve.
These puppies should help double our search capabilities.
Next time, I get to kick the door in.
Yeah.
Whatever floats your boat, Lassie.
[Beeping]
Get back!
What was that?
Some sort of explosion.
Dinah, Rene, do you copy?
[Coughing]
Ow.
Yeah.
We copy.
But we're trapped in here.
- Oh.
Son of a bitch!
- Yeah.
What if those heat signatures are incendiary devices?
I think we can pretty much confirm that.
We got 5 minutes for search and rescue before this whole place comes down.
You get Dinah and Wild Dog out of here.
- I will find Susan.
- Assuming she's still here.
Which I'm totally sure she still is.
[Ding]
Unh!
Oliver!
Hey.
Are you ok?
- Yeah.
A-Adrian Chase is--
- I know!
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
[Elevator rumbling]
What's happening?
Chase is controlling the elevator.
Susan, we need to get you out of here.
- This building is gonna explode.
- What about--
Chase wants me.
You're no longer his target.
I was gonna say what about you?
I'm gonna finish this.
Get to safety.
Hello, Oliver.
Can you guys hear me in there?
Yeah.
Just waiting on that rescue.
Good.
Step back!
I'm glad Talia told you.
I prefer it this way, face to face.
There's an honesty to it.
Well, honestly...
I'm gonna keep both of us here until this building comes down on top of us.
Then you'd be dead.
So would you.
Really?
You really think I'd let that happen, Oliver?
[Beep]
Remember, I'm always 10 steps ahead of you.
You know, if that were true, you probably would have seen this coming.
Adrian?
You shouldn't be here.
How else was I supposed to find out the truth?
You killed all those people.
It's not that simple.
You killed them.
It's simple.
I know, baby.
This can't be you.
It's not you.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Why did you make her come here?
To get you to stop.
You have to stop.
You have to--you have to turn yourself in.
I can't do that.
Please.
Whatever this is, whatever you're doing, it's over.
You'd tell the police?
No.
You tell them.
You're right.
I'm gonna take care of this.
[Stab]
John!
[Both grunting]
Rahhh!
Felicity:
I've got an ambulance en route to your position.
Oh, my God.
Oliver's in there with Chase.
Go help him now!
Go!
Agh!
Rah!
[Adrian panting]
I told you, Oliver.
I'm not gonna kill you, and you can't kill me.
Yes, Adrian.
Yes, I can!
[Metal scrapes]
[Arrow whooshes]
Felicity:
What's going on?
Guys, some sort of sitrep.
Chase is gone.
And so is Oliver.
Where's Oliver?
- Guys!
- We have to assume that Chase has him.
What about Susan and Chase's wife?
Felicity:
Susan's at the precinct.
Quentin is with her, um, but Doris passed away en route to Starling General.
Rene:
We've got to work on finding Oliver.
Felicity, you found Susan.
You can find him.
You're right.
Felicity, please tell me you're not going to see them again.
Dinah's right.
They're the ones that found Susan.
Agh!
Gregor!
Unh!
[Panting]
Oliver, is that you?
No.
It's the man who's gonna kill you.
Agh!
You up for making a statement?
Yeah, I'm up for anything that puts Adrian Chase in the electric chair.
Actually, we only got lethal injection in this state, but I like your thinking.
Hello, Ms. Williams.
Long time, no see.
You get away from her.
Please don't threaten me.
I'm in mourning.
Haven't you heard?
The Green Arrow killed my wife earlier tonight, and apparently, the mayor's missing.
You wouldn't happen to know where he is, Quentin?
Honestly, it doesn't look good,
Oliver disappearing under these circumstances.
You give me one good reason why I shouldn't have you arrested right now.
Because you don't want your friend back in pieces.
Right?
Everyone's megaimpressed with the DHS hack you did for us.
That's great.
You've also been chosen as the first woman to go to Mars.
Sorry.
A friend of mine is missing.
The information we gave you didn't help?
Different friend.
You have a lot of missing friends.
Yeah, and this time, I have no leads whatsoever.
You guys have better resources than I do, and I have to use everything that I can to find him and do whatever you need me to do for you.
[Chains rattling]
[Metal door opens]
[Footsteps]
Talia:
I don't believe I taught you how to escape from shackles, Oliver.
Your father was an honorable man.
You've allied with a psychopath, and he'd be ashamed of you.
Well, when it comes to the shame of fathers,
I shall bow to your superior expertise.
Just make sure he suffers.
That was always the plan.
My friends will find me.
They're my strength.
That's sweet, but I'm running out of ways to tell you, Oliver.
I'm not interested in killing you.
Then what the hell is this game that we're playing?
When I had Susan as my guest,
I confessed to her that you'd helped me discover who I really am.
That's what I'm gonna help you do, Oliver.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Greg!
Move your head.
Oliver:
Previously on "Arrow"...
This laptop contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from Kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.
This is most disappointing.
I liked many of you.
Oliver:
Prometheus surprised me with a very specific, unique move.
It was taught to me by a woman that I met in Russia.
You think you and Prometheus had the same teacher?
You're accepting the invitation to join Helix.
Full throttle.
What do I do with your secret?
I keep it.
I care about the city, and... and you're working double-time.
Can you talk some sense into him, please?
Mr. Mayor, Thea, meet my wife Doris.
I thought we could talk.
Can we set up a meeting tomorrow?
I'm late for a dinner.
It's important.
You could call it life or death.
You sure this is the place?
Curtis:
I don't see any other monasteries on this mountain.
Felicity's note said something about a demon... oh, wait, maybe that says, "lemon."
Anyway, I...
I texted her, but she has not hit me back.
It says, "demon."
Oliver, I'm losing you!
I'll see you back in Star City.
[Typing]
[People grunting, trading blows]
Where is she?
Who are you?
I'm a former student.
Former, which means you are not welcome here.
Talia:
No!
Leave us.
I would apologize for my students' enthusiasm, but you should not have come to this place.
Well, Talia, it was difficult to find.
Our business together concluded 5 years ago.
No.
One of your former students is trying to kill me.
Oh, he doesn't want to kill you, Oliver.
He means to destroy you utterly.
You knew?
If you knew, then why would you train him?
Why wouldn't you warn me?
Two years ago, he sought me out.
He'd already learned much about you.
He's a man of remarkable capacity.
Talia, enough!
If you knew what he wanted, then why would you train him?
You killed his father, and I helped him in his pursuit of vengeance because by then you'd killed mine!
I never told you my full name, did I?
No, you didn't.
It's Talia al Ghul.
[Exhales]
Ra's al Ghul was your father.
Yes.
My father and I came to be at odds, so I forged my own path...
But he was still my father when you put a sword through his chest.
So that's why you're not gonna help me.
That's why you won't tell who this...
Prometheus is.
Of course I will, Oliver, because I want you to suffer.
He calls himself...
Adrian Chase.
*ARROW Season 05 Episode 16 "Checkmate" Synchronized by srjanapala
Everything ok?
Yes.
Peachy.
Heh.
Let's do this.
- Whoa.
- Yeah.
It's lit, right?
All these people, they're just...
You sound surprised.
Yeah.
I mean, I guess I just thought that a secret hacker organization would be a little bit more, well, I don't know, intimate.
Heh.
Well, Helix is a worldwide operation, kind of like the U.N.
If it actually accomplished things.
You have 3D nanoelectrics designed to interface with a neural network.
We were working on something like this at Palmer Tech, and...
Who do you think we stole the prototype from?
What is that?
Real-time feed from every cell phone camera in the world running through a pattern recognition algo.
Holy...
that's...
So much bigger than anything the NSA is doing.
I know.
That's a lot of power for someone to have who's not government.
Well, the fact that we're not government's not the point.
Power to the people, right?
Yeah.
Power to the people.
Heh.
Welcome to Helix, Felicity.
We're gonna change the world together.
Woman:
Mr. Queen, I've been
- trying to reach you...
- I need Captain Pike and Quentin Lance in my office, and I need to know where D.A. Chase is right now.
Right now, Mr. Chase is in the conference room.
Treatment for drug addicts over incarceration.
Mr. Mayor, I didn't think you'd be joining us this morning.
I guess you know what I've been up to, huh?
- Yeah.
- I've been working on addressing our sentencing policy for drug offenses.
Care to join?
I'd like to see you in my office, please.
Actually, can it wait?
The councilmen and I are on a clock.
Besides, you're looking a little ragged.
You tired...
Or is it that you've actually been asleep this whole time?
All the captains are dead.
Da.
Gregor will promote new ones loyal to him, and they will kill us all.
Gonna try it this way now.
I got to tell you, I don't know how that mask is gonna play here, especially since the city's not too fond of your alter ego these days.
I'll give them the Throwing Star Killer, see how they feel.
Wait.
That's your big plan, arresting me?
Oh, man, that's a bit of a letdown, I have to say.
Well, I'm not gonna kill you, if only because that's what you want me to do.
But you've done everything I've wanted so far.
Did you really think I'd let all this end in a parking garage?
What did you do?
I gave your girlfriend an exclusive.
Wait.
Are you still dating Susan Williams?
I got to tell you, buddy.
It's been a little hard to keep track.
What did you do to her?
She's fine.
Don't worry.
As long as I'm around to make sure she gets some food and water.
Starvation and dehydration... terrible way to go.
Bottom line...
I die, she dies.
I don't make it back to her in time, she dies.
Now you could try torturing me for her location.
We both know what you're capable of in that department, but...
I think that we both know what I'm capable of, so, Ollie, who do you think can last longer...
Susan or me?
Ohh.
I'm 10 steps ahead of you, and you haven't even figured out what game we're playing yet.
Quentin:
That son of a bitch.
Yeah, I'd say that pretty much covers it.
This is a hell of a city you got here.
District attorney's a serial killer.
He's way worse that that.
Infiltrating the government like that at the highest level right next to Oliver?
We underestimated this guy.
I underestimated him.
I trusted him.
Where is Felicity?
I've been texting her like crazy, but her phone's off.
You don't think that Prometheus has...
No.
No.
His game is Susan.
For now.
We have to make sure Thea's safe.
Lyla and J.J. are secure at Argus.
I got in touch with Thea.
She's fine...
B-but we have to find Susan.
We cannot make a move on Chase until we know she's safe, until we have her here.
Keep looking for Felicity.
You GPS her phone if you have to.
We should go to Pike, tell him Chase is the Throwing Star Killer.
And then he asks for evidence, and you say what?
Look.
Quentin's right.
Dinah, we keep the SCPD out of this until we have something.
This guy has us in check.
Yeah, for now.
John:
Sent Curtis and Dinah to Opal City.
- For Chase's mother.
- He has leverage,
- we need some of our own.
- That's not gonna work.
This guy always seems to be 10 steps ahead.
Well, Oliver, it's pretty easy, you confronting him in public like that.
What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't thinking.
Where you going now?
According to city records, Chase's house has a subbasement.
Chase does everything sideways, man.
I doubt he has Susan someplace obvious.
I don't know what's obvious anymore.
Oh, no.
I can't let you go out there alone.
- I'm going with you.
- I can handle it.
Never said you couldn't.
3 of us cannot defeat Gregor.
We need more men.
No.
We need a way to convince the Bratva that Gregor sold them out.
We had way.
Well, we don't have anyone that can pull data off a bullet-ridden laptop, so...
Without proof, Gregor will say we are traitors.
Rest of Bratva will believe them.
And then they will kill us.
So we've got to kill him first before he tells anyone.
Ok.
You've had enough to drink already.
[Sighs]
Where would Gregor go...
I mean, where would he go right now?
He'd go to ground.
Bratva stronghold is hockey rink, but it's heavily protected.
Hmm.
We wouldn't even get through the door.
I think I know someone who can.
I guess Norma Bates got the hell out of Dodge.
Chase anticipated this play.
I never said that he wasn't clever.
So am I.
Um...
What's your toy doing?
It's detecting resonance frequencies upstairs.
It's not a toy.
It's a T-sphere.
Wait.
Every horror movie ever has basically said that you do not go upstairs at a creepy serial killer's mother's house.
[Susan screams]
Help!
[Sobbing]
Unh!
Adrian:
Excellent.
Now give us another scream.
So, what, we're supposed to just go to work like things are normal?
Because newsflash...
they ain't.
Tell me something I don't already know.
Chase:
Ho ho!
I did think of one or two things.
This is nice, everything being out in the open now, all the cards on the table, as it were.
You got some nerve showing up here.
Why wouldn't I?
I take my job very seriously.
Speaking of, I thought my office had requested your verifications on the latest ComStat reports from the SCPD.
What you been doing?
I'm gonna kill you in ways that will hurt.
Threatening a city official's a felony, Mr. Ramirez.
You think you're so clever.
This isn't over, you son of a bitch!
I agree.
In fact, I think we're just getting started.
I want those ComStat verifications on my desk by tomorrow morning, Dog.
We can't just let that son of a bitch walk around here.
- We got to do something.
- We are doing something.
Yeah.
Rene and I have got eyes on Chase.
He's at city hall.
You got a green light to move on his house.
Roger that.
Ok, Spartan.
You check the upstairs and work your way down.
I'll sweep the basement.
We can meet in the middle.
Roger that.
- Please don't hurt me.
- Mrs. Chase.
What are you doing in my hou...
Mrs. Chase, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Get away from me.
Your husband isn't who you think he is.
Get out of my house.
Mrs. Chase, your husband is the Throwing Star Killer.
He's holding an innocent woman hostage, and I need your help to find her.
- You're insane.
- Doris, please.
You need to understand the truth.
You have to know at some level that your husband has been keeping something from you.
And police and the mayor say that you're the killer, you.
Officer:
On the floor.
On the floor!
Get down on the floor!
On the floor.
Get down on the floor!
You all right, Mrs. Chase?
I'm...
I'm fine.
We got a call from your husband.
Don't worry.
We got this handled.
Get her out of here.
Tell me what you want me to do.
I am not getting into a shootout with the SCPD.
Copy that.
I'm out.
Smart move, douchebag.
I wasn't talking to you.
Drop the bow and get on the ground!
[Groans]
Whole thing's about 30 seconds long.
I've been over every frame, and there's nothing to indicate a location.
At least it's proof of life.
Yeah.
She was alive when this video was made, but we don't know how long a... sorry.
It's fine.
He'll... he'll keep her alive to keep me in check.
I never should have gotten involved with Susan.
I don't know what I was thinking.
You were thinking you were lonely, man.
Everyone needs somebody.
Yeah?
Well, maybe I gave up that right when I put on the hood.
Felicity:
Hi!
Oh!
Hi!
I'm sorry.
I know I'm late.
I'm sorry.
I got Curtis' messages.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm here now.
Sorry.
Can you give us the room, please?
Heh.
Much appreciated.
Yeah.
I usually like my tongue lashings to be done in private, so thank you.
Heh.
I'm...
Sorry.
I'm not angry.
You don't... you don't work for me.
You...
I'm worried.
Right.
Of course, for all you know,
Prometheus could have kkhhk... ooh.
Not...
I'm worried about you.
Oh.
Because you're into something, and you don't want to tell anyone about it, or maybe you just don't want to tell me.
I think we can both agree that keeping secrets doesn't end well, so...
Yeah, you're right.
It's just that right now is not really a good time with everything going on.
You just have to trust me on this one, ok?
- Ok.
- But speaking of the something that I'm into, it actually helped me go through the petabyte of data we took off of Chase's mother's computer.
- This
- Who's Simon Morrison?
- Adrian Chase.
- What?
Simon Morrison is his birth name.
That's his real identity.
But his mother's name is Amanda Westfield.
Yes.
Well, she changed her name when she went off the grid, so it runs in the family.
Well, if Adrian Chase is an alias... then the proof that his background is fake would be enough for the ACU to arrest his ass.
- However you did it, good work.
- Thank you.
Let's put this all on the drive.
- I've got to get to city hall.
- Wait.
Oh.
Now?
I mean, it's past 10:00.
Yeah.
Before the 11:00 news,
I have to make a statement on the Green Arrow breaking into the D.A.'s house.
Obviously, this is a horrifying development.
Uh, we believe the Green Arrow was retaliating against this office for speaking out against his recent crimes.
Mr. Mayor.
[Camera shutters clicking]
Ahem.
This office is in complete agreement with D.A. Chase.
This situation has become untenable...
And I am determined to bring it to a just and successful end.
I will not let anyone, anyone...
Terrorize this city...
And so I am demanding that the Green Arrow turn himself in.
He has 24 hours before I am ordering the SCPD to shoot on sight.
[Reporters clamoring]
That's all.
Thank you.
[Clamoring continues]
Thanks for seeing me.
I know it's late.
Uh, I think we both know our jobs don't recognize late and early.
What can I do for you?
What's this?
That is evidence that Adrian Chase is a false identity.
His real name is Simon Morrison.
In the midst of an investigation, you will learn that he is the Throwing Star Killer.
Oh.
That's one hell of an accusation.
That's why I'm giving you that.
And this evidence comes from where?
An investigation that I've been conducting off the books.
With what personnel?
Work the lead, Captain Pike.
Consider that an order if it helps.
One last thing.
You didn't get that from me.
I serve at the pleasure of the Mayor.
There you are.
Viktor has confirmed Gregor's location, but tell me, why did you want him gone and why are you playing Robin Hood?
I met a woman.
She taught me how to give my darkness an identity so that it doesn't consume me.
And you believed her?
[Speaks Russian]
Oliver, whatever you think is inside you is inside you.
You... you cannot name it like that and keep it apart from you.
This woman's taught me differently.
This woman does not know what she is talking about, and if you're not careful, Oliver, one day she will be the source of your greatest pain.
Oh, my God.
And this is...
We've been calling him Prometheus, but you helped me I.D. him as Simon Morrison.
I've been striking out at getting a location off this, but someone with a cell phone at some point must have entered this room, which means there should be pictures of it on your database.
If I can cross-reference the images of your database with this video,
I should be able to help the police find her.
And that's, like, really cool and noble and all.
I mean, she definitely needs your help...
But?
But, Felicity, we gave you Pandora.
We helped you sort through that data pull, and now, well, people are starting to ask what you're doing for us.
I mean, we didn't invite you in just so you could check items off your to-do list.
Sorry.
It feels gross saying...
No.
Uh, no.
You're right.
Ok.
So quid pro quo.
I help you, you help me.
I was kind of hoping you'd say that.
We've been trying to break the encryption on a certain Homeland security drone.
- Why?
- Need to know, I'm afraid.
Question is what are you willing to quo in exchange for your quid?
Uh, can you check some files for me?
Any legal records you can find on a Simon Morrison.
Thanks.
[Groaning]
Hey.
[Coughs]
Hey.
You ok, buddy?
Need some medical attention or something?
Unh!
- What happened?
- Some lowlife attacked him outside the precinct.
SCPD's canvassing, but the security cameras, they did not get a shot of his face.
But...
How's Pike?
He's comatose.
This was Chase.
I don't know, Oliver.
Murder by lowlife is not exactly his style.
Earlier tonight, I gave Pike a lead connecting Chase to Prometheus.
I thought we didn't have any leads.
Felicity resurfaced with something.
Is Pike's family in there?
Nope, but somebody else is.
Life's just so fragile, isn't it?
Decades of hopes and dreams, and in one moment, one little mistake, and it all just goes away.
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.
Really?
Because so far, you haven't been able to do much to stop me.
Susan's fine by the way.
Well, alive at any rate.
Me and my team are gonna find her, and when we do, the second that we do...
I'm gonna put an arrow right through your heart.
You do realize how impotent you sound, right?
You think this is a game?
I don't feel like playing anymore.
You don't have a choice, Oliver.
If you kill me, you kill Susan, and she will be as dead as your mother, as Tommy, as Shado, as Laurel, as your friend Pike here probably... all dead because of you.
So go ahead.
Kill me.
Let's find out how much more loss you can take because I don't think it's much.
I think that you're one loss away from being destroyed.
I guess we'll have to find another way to handle this then.
You see, that's the beautiful thing about all of this, Oliver.
If you kill me, you'll only really be killing yourself.
[Gunfire]
[Arrow whooshes]
[Grunting]
[Deep voice] Thanks for the assist.
What is thing you are doing with your voice?
[Gunfire]
Ok.
[Both typing]
Ok.
Ok.
Oh, oh!
I'm in.
Whoo!
We're in.
Yes.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did we just accidentally hack a DHS drone system?
Well, I wouldn't exactly say accidentally.
- Tch.
Am I right?
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Felicity, please explain to me why we're hacking Homeland security drones instead of finding Susan's location like you told me we would be!
Because hacking the drones is what's gonna lead us to Susan.
It's... it's...
So complicated.
Holy crap.
You just sent the receiver false data, and now you are spoofing the GPS system.
There's nothing slight about this.
This is just straight-up illegal.
Spill 100% deets right now.
- Right now!
- Ok, ok.
So I've...
I've kind of made some... heh... new friends.
Surprise.
And they have access to unaccessible amounts of data and Intel, tons of it.
They helped me get John out of prison, and now they're willing to help us find Susan.
That's all.
If you redirect a few U.S. border control drones.
Hey.
Don't look at me like that.
Ok.
I've already gotten chapter and verse from John and Oliver.
Please don't, please.
I can't imagine them signing off on you hacking Homeland Security.
They don't know, do they?
All they need to know is that I am a grown woman making my own grown-up decisions.
Hey.
Got anything for me?
Oliver.
What is it, man?
Is it Susan?
Not yet, but it's just a matter of time.
I don't know what I can do to stop it.
Well, Oliver, there are always options, and you're not alone.
Do you think that's the problem?
You've done a wonderful job of convincing me that I'm changing for the better...
With the recruits and the...
[Sighs]
The transparency, more optimism, more... more trust.
You think none of this would have happened if you hadn't trusted Chase, right?
Trusted anyone.
Because I...
I can't see anything past me just creating more targets.
Oliver.
We're not targets, man.
We're your teammates.
We're your strength.
You give me strength until Chase turns it into a weakness.
Look what happened with Susan.
I let myself get close to Susan, and in so doing, I gave Chase a way to get to me.
That could happen with you, with... with Felicity... with my son.
All of you make me vulnerable, John.
Maybe.
Maybe we do...
But caring about people, Oliver, that makes you human.
[Sighs]
Being human's a luxury I might not get to have.
[Cell phone vibrating]
Yeah.
Ok.
Got it.
Tell Dinah and Rene.
Felicity found out where Chase is keeping Susan.
- Let's go!
- John.
There's something I need you to do for me.
If I'm gonna beat this guy, it'll be by playing his game...
And I know someone who makes him vulnerable.
Rene:
This is where Prometheus is holding Susan?
Or at least he was when he shot that video.
I'm reading a few dozen heat signatures inside.
Chase brought backup?
Or he's using decoys.
It's decoys.
Prometheus works alone.
Problem is Susan could be any one of those heat signatures.
We should split up, canvass floor by floor.
Agreed.
Overwatch, any word on Spartan?
Uh, package is en route.
- ETA 5 minutes.
- Package?
Oliver's got something up his green sleeve.
These puppies should help double our search capabilities.
Next time, I get to kick the door in.
Yeah.
Whatever floats your boat, Lassie.
[Beeping]
Get back!
What was that?
Some sort of explosion.
Dinah, Rene, do you copy?
[Coughing]
Ow.
Yeah.
We copy.
But we're trapped in here.
- Oh.
Son of a bitch!
- Yeah.
What if those heat signatures are incendiary devices?
I think we can pretty much confirm that.
We got 5 minutes for search and rescue before this whole place comes down.
You get Dinah and Wild Dog out of here.
- I will find Susan.
- Assuming she's still here.
Which I'm totally sure she still is.
[Ding]
Unh!
Oliver!
Hey.
Are you ok?
- Yeah.
A-Adrian Chase is...
- I know!
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
[Elevator rumbling]
What's happening?
Chase is controlling the elevator.
Susan, we need to get you out of here.
- This building is gonna explode.
- What about...
Chase wants me.
You're no longer his target.
I was gonna say what about you?
I'm gonna finish this.
Get to safety.
Hello, Oliver.
Can you guys hear me in there?
Yeah.
Just waiting on that rescue.
Good.
Step back!
I'm glad Talia told you.
I prefer it this way, face to face.
There's an honesty to it.
Well, honestly...
I'm gonna keep both of us here until this building comes down on top of us.
Then you'd be dead.
So would you.
Really?
You really think I'd let that happen, Oliver?
[Beep]
Remember, I'm always 10 steps ahead of you.
You know, if that were true, you probably would have seen this coming.
Adrian?
You shouldn't be here.
How else was I supposed to find out the truth?
You killed all those people.
It's not that simple.
You killed them.
It's simple.
I know, baby.
This can't be you.
It's not you.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Why did you make her come here?
To get you to stop.
You have to stop.
You have to... you have to turn yourself in.
I can't do that.
Please.
Whatever this is, whatever you're doing, it's over.
You'd tell the police?
No.
You tell them.
You're right.
I'm gonna take care of this.
[Stab]
John!
[Both grunting]
Rahhh!
Felicity:
I've got an ambulance en route to your position.
Oh, my God.
Oliver's in there with Chase.
Go help him now!
Go!
Agh!
Rah!
[Adrian panting]
I told you, Oliver.
I'm not gonna kill you, and you can't kill me.
Yes, Adrian.
Yes, I can!
[Metal scrapes]
[Arrow whooshes]
Felicity:
What's going on?
Guys, some sort of sitrep.
Chase is gone.
And so is Oliver.
Where's Oliver?
- Guys!
- We have to assume that Chase has him.
What about Susan and Chase's wife?
Felicity:
Susan's at the precinct.
Quentin is with her, um, but Doris passed away en route to Starling General.
Rene:
We've got to work on finding Oliver.
Felicity, you found Susan.
You can find him.
You're right.
Felicity, please tell me you're not going to see them again.
Dinah's right.
They're the ones that found Susan.
Agh!
Gregor!
Unh!
[Panting]
Oliver, is that you?
No.
It's the man who's gonna kill you.
Agh!
You up for making a statement?
Yeah, I'm up for anything that puts Adrian Chase in the electric chair.
Actually, we only got lethal injection in this state, but I like your thinking.
Hello, Ms. Williams.
Long time, no see.
You get away from her.
Please don't threaten me.
I'm in mourning.
Haven't you heard?
The Green Arrow killed my wife earlier tonight, and apparently, the mayor's missing.
You wouldn't happen to know where he is, Quentin?
Honestly, it doesn't look good,
Oliver disappearing under these circumstances.
You give me one good reason why I shouldn't have you arrested right now.
Because you don't want your friend back in pieces.
Right?
Everyone's megaimpressed with the DHS hack you did for us.
That's great.
You've also been chosen as the first woman to go to Mars.
Sorry.
A friend of mine is missing.
The information we gave you didn't help?
Different friend.
You have a lot of missing friends.
Yeah, and this time, I have no leads whatsoever.
You guys have better resources than I do, and I have to use everything that I can to find him and do whatever you need me to do for you.
[Chains rattling]
[Metal door opens]
[Footsteps]
Talia:
I don't believe I taught you how to escape from shackles, Oliver.
Your father was an honorable man.
You've allied with a psychopath, and he'd be ashamed of you.
Well, when it comes to the shame of fathers,
I shall bow to your superior expertise.
Just make sure he suffers.
That was always the plan.
My friends will find me.
They're my strength.
That's sweet, but I'm running out of ways to tell you, Oliver.
I'm not interested in killing you.
Then what the hell is this game that we're playing?
When I had Susan as my guest,
I confessed to her that you'd helped me discover who I really am.
That's what I'm gonna help you do, Oliver.
Greg!
Move your head.
Previously on "arrow"...
This laptop contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.
This is most disappointing.
I liked many of you.
Prometheus surprised me with a very specific, unique move.
It was taught to me by a woman that I met in Russia.
You think you and prometheus had the same teacher?
You're accepting the invitation to join helix.
Full throttle.
What do I do with your secret?
I keep it.
I care about the city, and... and you're working double-time.
Can you talk some sense into him, please?
Mr. mayor, thea, meet my wife Doris.
I thought we could talk.
Can we set up a meeting tomorrow?
I'm late for a dinner.
It's important.
You could call it life or death.
You sure this is the place?
I don't see any other monasteries on this mountain.
Felicity's note said something about a demon...
Wait, maybe that says, "lemon."
Anyway, I... i texted her, but she has not hit me back.
It says, "demon."
Oliver, I'm losing you!
I'll see you back in star city.
Where is she?
Who are you?
I'm a former student.
Former, which means you are not welcome here.
No!
Leave us.
I would apologize for my students' enthusiasm, but you should not have come to this place.
Well, Talia, it was difficult to find.
Our business together concluded 5 years ago.
No.
One of your former students is trying to kill me.
He doesn't want to kill you, Oliver.
He means to destroy you utterly.
You knew?
If you knew, then why would you train him?
Why wouldn't you warn me?
Two years ago, he sought me out.
He'd already learned much about you.
He's a man of remarkable capacity.
Talia, enough!
If you knew what he wanted, then why would you train him?
You killed his father, and I helped him in his pursuit of vengeance because by then you'd killed mine!
I never told you my full name, did I?
No, you didn't.
It's Talia al ghul.
Ra's al ghul was your father.
Yes.
My father and I came to be at odds, so I forged my own path...
But he was still my father when you put a sword through his chest.
So that's why you're not gonna help me.
That's why you won't tell who this...
Prometheus is.
Of course I will, Oliver, because I want you to suffer.
He calls himself...
Adrian chase.
Everything ok?
Yes.
Peachy.
Heh.
Let's do this.
- Whoa.
- Yeah.
It's lit, right?
All these people, they're just...
You sound surprised.
Yeah.
I mean, I guess I just thought that a secret hacker organization would be a little bit more, well, I don't know, intimate.
Heh.
Well, helix is a worldwide operation, kind of like the u.N.
If it actually accomplished things.
You have 3D nanoelectrics designed to interface with a neural network.
We were working on something like this at Palmer tech, and...
Who do you think we stole the prototype from?
What is that?
Real-time feed from every cell phone camera in the world running through a pattern recognition algo.
Holy... that's...
So much bigger than anything the NSA is doing.
I know.
That's a lot of power for someone to have who's not government.
Well, the fact that we're not government's not the point.
Power to the people, right?
Yeah.
Power to the people.
Heh.
Welcome to helix, Felicity.
We're gonna change the world together.
Mr. queen, I've been trying to reach you...
I need captain pike and Quentin Lance in my office, and I need to know where d.A. Chase is right now.
Right now, Mr. chase is in the conference room.
Treatment for drug addicts over incarceration.
Mr. mayor, I didn't think you'd be joining us this morning.
I guess you know what I've been up to?
- Yeah.
- I've been working on addressing our sentencing policy for drug offenses.
Care to join?
I'd like to see you in my office, please.
Actually, can it wait?
The councilmen and I are on a clock.
Besides, you're looking a little ragged.
You tired...
Or is it that you've actually been asleep this whole time?
All the captains are dead.
Da.
Gregor will promote new ones loyal to him, and they will kill us all.
Gonna try it this way now.
I got to tell you, I don't know how that mask is gonna play here, especially since the city's not too fond of your alter ego these days.
I'll give them the throwing star killer, see how they feel.
Wait.
That's your big plan, arresting me?
Man, that's a bit of a letdown, I have to say.
Well, I'm not gonna kill you, if only because that's what you want me to do.
But you've done everything I've wanted so far.
Did you really think I'd let all this end in a parking garage?
What did you do?
I gave your girlfriend an exclusive.
Wait.
Are you still dating Susan Williams?
I got to tell you, buddy.
It's been a little hard to keep track.
What did you do to her?
She's fine.
Don't worry.
As long as I'm around to make sure she gets some food and water.
Starvation and dehydration...
Terrible way to go.
Bottom line... i die, she dies.
I don't make it back to her in time, she dies.
Now you could try torturing me for her location.
We both know what you're capable of in that department, but...
I think that we both know what I'm capable of, so, Ollie, who do you think can last longer...
Susan or me?
I'm 10 steps ahead of you, and you haven't even figured out what game we're playing yet.
That son of a bitch.
Yeah, I'd say that pretty much covers it.
This is a hell of a city you got here.
District attorney's a serial killer.
He's way worse that that.
Infiltrating the government like that at the highest level right next to Oliver?
We underestimated this guy.
I underestimated him.
I trusted him.
Where is Felicity?
I've been texting her like crazy, but her phone's off.
You don't think that prometheus has...
No.
No.
His game is Susan.
For now.
We have to make sure thea's safe.
Lyla and j.J. Are secure at argus.
I got in touch with thea.
She's fine...
B-but we have to find Susan.
We cannot make a move on chase until we know she's safe, until we have her here.
Keep looking for Felicity.
You GPS her phone if you have to.
We should go to pike, tell him chase is the throwing star killer.
And then he asks for evidence, and you say what?
Look.
Quentin's right.
Dinah, we keep the scpd out of this until we have something.
This guy has us in check.
Yeah, for now.
Sent Curtis and dinah to opal city.
- For chase's mother.
- He has leverage, we need some of our own.
That's not gonna work.
This guy always seems to be 10 steps ahead.
Well, Oliver, it's pretty easy, you confronting him in public like that.
What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't thinking.
Where you going now?
According to city records, chase's house has a subbasement.
Chase does everything sideways, man.
I doubt he has Susan someplace obvious.
I don't know what's obvious anymore.
No.
I can't let you go out there alone.
- I'm going with you.
- I can handle it.
Never said you couldn't.
3 of us cannot defeat Gregor.
We need more men.
No.
We need a way to convince the bratva that Gregor sold them out.
We had way.
Well, we don't have anyone that can pull data off a bullet-ridden laptop, so...
Without proof, Gregor will say we are traitors.
Rest of bratva will believe them.
And then they will kill us.
So we've got to kill him first before he tells anyone.
Ok.
You've had enough to drink already.
Where would Gregor go...
I mean, where would he go right now?
He'd go to ground.
Bratva stronghold is hockey rink, but it's heavily protected.
We wouldn't even get through the door.
I think I know someone who can.
I guess Norma bates got the hell out of dodge.
Chase anticipated this play.
I never said that he wasn't clever.
So am I.
Um...
What's your toy doing?
It's detecting resonance frequencies upstairs.
It's not a toy.
It's a t-sphere.
Wait.
Every horror movie ever has basically said that you do not go upstairs at a creepy serial killer's mother's house.
Help!
Unh!
Excellent.
Now give us another scream.
So, what, we're supposed to just go to work like things are normal?
Because newsflash... they ain't.
Tell me something I don't already know.
Ho ho!
I did think of one or two things.
This is nice, everything being out in the open now, all the cards on the table, as it were.
You got some nerve showing up here.
Why wouldn't I?
I take my job very seriously.
Speaking of, I thought my office had requested your verifications on the latest comstat reports from the scpd.
What you been doing?
I'm gonna kill you in ways that will hurt.
Threatening a city official's a felony, Mr. Ramirez.
You think you're so clever.
This isn't over, you son of a bitch!
I agree.
In fact, I think we're just getting started.
I want those comstat verifications on my desk by tomorrow morning, dog.
We can't just let that son of a bitch walk around here.
- We got to do something.
- We are doing something.
Yeah.
Rene and I have got eyes on chase.
He's at city hall.
You got a green light to move on his house.
Roger that.
Ok, spartan.
You check the upstairs and work your way down.
I'll sweep the basement.
We can meet in the middle.
Roger that.
- Please don't hurt me.
- Mrs. chase.
What are you doing in my hou...
Mrs. chase, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Get away from me.
Your husband isn't who you think he is.
Get out of my house.
Mrs. chase, your husband is the throwing star killer.
He's holding an innocent woman hostage, and I need your help to find her.
- You're insane.
- Doris, please.
You need to understand the truth.
You have to know at some level that your husband has been keeping something from you.
And police and the mayor say that you're the killer, you.
On the floor.
On the floor!
Get down on the floor!
On the floor.
Get down on the floor!
You all right, Mrs. chase?
I'm...
I'm fine.
We got a call from your husband.
Don't worry.
We got this handled.
Get her out of here.
Tell me what you want me to do.
I am not getting into a shootout with the scpd.
Copy that.
I'm out.
Smart move, douchebag.
I wasn't talking to you.
Drop the bow and get on the ground!
Whole thing's about 30 seconds long.
I've been over every frame, and there's nothing to indicate a location.
At least it's proof of life.
Yeah.
She was alive when this video was made, but we don't know how long a... sorry.
It's fine.
He'll... he'll keep her alive to keep me in check.
I never should have gotten involved with Susan.
I don't know what I was thinking.
You were thinking you were lonely, man.
Everyone needs somebody.
Yeah?
Well, maybe I gave up that right when I put on the hood.
Hi!
Hi!
I'm sorry.
I know I'm late.
I'm sorry.
I got Curtis' messages.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm here now.
Sorry.
Can you give us the room, please?
Heh.
Much appreciated.
Yeah.
I usually like my tongue lashings to be done in private, so thank you.
Heh.
I'm...
Sorry.
I'm not angry.
You don't... you don't work for me.
You...
I'm worried.
Right.
Of course, for all you know, prometheus could have kkhhk... ooh.
Not...
I'm worried about you.
Because you're into something, and you don't want to tell anyone about it, or maybe you just don't want to tell me.
I think we can both agree that keeping secrets doesn't end well, so...
Yeah, you're right.
It's just that right now is not really a good time with everything going on.
You just have to trust me on this one, ok?
- Ok.
- But speaking of the something that I'm into, it actually helped me go through the petabyte of data we took off of chase's mother's computer.
This - who's Simon morrison?
- Adrian chase.
- What?
Simon morrison is his birth name.
That's his real identity.
But his mother's name is Amanda westfield.
Yes.
Well, she changed her name when she went off the grid, so it runs in the family.
Well, if Adrian chase is an alias...
Then the proof that his background is fake would be enough for the acu to arrest his ass.
However you did it, good work.
Let's put this all on the drive.
- I've got to get to city hall.
- Wait..
Now?
I mean, it's past 10:00.
Yeah.
Before the 11:00 news,
I have to make a statement on the green arrow breaking into the d.A.'S house.
Obviously, this is a horrifying development.
We believe the green arrow was retaliating against this office for speaking out against his recent crimes.
Mr. mayor.
Ahem.
This office is in complete agreement with d.A. Chase.
This situation has become untenable...
And I am determined to bring it to a just and successful end.
I will not let anyone, anyone...
Terrorize this city...
And so I am demanding that the green arrow turn himself in.
He has 24 hours before I am ordering the scpd to shoot on sight.
That's all.
Thanks for seeing me.
I know it's late.
I think we both know our jobs don't recognize late and early.
What can I do for you?
What's this?
That is evidence that Adrian chase is a false identity.
His real name is Simon morrison.
In the midst of an investigation, you will learn that he is the throwing star killer.
That's one hell of an accusation.
That's why I'm giving you that.
And this evidence comes from where?
An investigation that I've been conducting off the books.
With what personnel?
Work the lead, captain pike.
Consider that an order if it helps.
One last thing.
You didn't get that from me.
I serve at the pleasure of the mayor.
There you are.
Viktor has confirmed Gregor's location, but tell me, why did you want him gone and why are you playing Robin hood?
I met a woman.
She taught me how to give my darkness an identity so that it doesn't consume me.
And you believed her?
Oliver, whatever you think is inside you is inside you.
You... you cannot name it like that and keep it apart from you.
This woman's taught me differently.
This woman does not know what she is talking about, and if you're not careful, Oliver, one day she will be the source of your greatest pain.
My god.
And this is...
We've been calling him prometheus, but you helped me I.D. Him as Simon morrison.
I've been striking out at getting a location off this, but someone with a cell phone at some point must have entered this room, which means there should be pictures of it on your database.
If I can cross-reference the images of your database with this video,
I should be able to help the police find her.
And that's, like, really cool and noble and all.
I mean, she definitely needs your help...
But?
But, Felicity, we gave you pandora.
We helped you sort through that data pull, and now, well, people are starting to ask what you're doing for us.
I mean, we didn't invite you in just so you could check items off your to-do list.
Sorry.
It feels gross saying...
No.
No.
You're right.
Ok.
So quid pro quo.
I help you, you help me.
I was kind of hoping you'd say that.
We've been trying to break the encryption on a certain homeland security drone.
- Why?
- Need to know, I'm afraid.
Question is what are you willing to quo in exchange for your quid?
Can you check some files for me?
Any legal records you can find on a Simon morrison.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hey.
You ok, buddy?
Need some medical attention or something?
Unh!
- What happened?
- Some lowlife attacked him outside the precinct.
Scpd's canvassing, but the security cameras, they did not get a shot of his face.
But...
How's pike?
He's comatose.
This was chase.
I don't know, Oliver.
Murder by lowlife is not exactly his style.
Earlier tonight, I gave pike a lead connecting chase to prometheus.
I thought we didn't have any leads.
Felicity resurfaced with something.
Is pike's family in there?
Nope, but somebody else is.
Life's just so fragile, isn't it?
Decades of hopes and dreams, and in one moment, one little mistake, and it all just goes away.
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.
Really?
Because so far, you haven't been able to do much to stop me.
Susan's fine by the way.
Well, alive at any rate.
Me and my team are gonna find her, and when we do, the second that we do...
I'm gonna put an arrow right through your heart.
You do realize how impotent you sound, right?
You think this is a game?
I don't feel like playing anymore.
You don't have a choice, Oliver.
If you kill me, you kill Susan, and she will be as dead as your mother, as Tommy, as shado, as Laurel, as your friend pike here probably...
All dead because of you.
So go ahead.
Kill me.
Let's find out how much more loss you can take because I don't think it's much.
I think that you're one loss away from being destroyed.
I guess we'll have to find another way to handle this then.
You see, that's the beautiful thing about all of this, Oliver.
If you kill me, you'll only really be killing yourself.
Torrent downloaded from RARBG.
Thanks for the assist.
What is thing you are doing with your voice?
Ok.
Ok.
Ok.
I'm in.
Whoo!
We're in.
Yes.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did we just accidentally hack a dhs drone system?
Well, I wouldn't exactly say accidentally.
Tch.
Am I right?
Felicity, please explain to me why we're hacking homeland security drones instead of finding Susan's location like you told me we would be!
Because hacking the drones is what's gonna lead us to Susan.
It's... it's...
So complicated.
Holy crap.
You just sent the receiver false data, and now you are spoofing the GPS system.
There's nothing slight about this.
This is just straight-up illegal.
Spill 100% deets right now.
- Right now!
- Ok, ok.
So I've...
I've kind of made some... heh... new friends.
Surprise.
And they have access to unaccessible amounts of data and intel, tons of it.
They helped me get John out of prison, and now they're willing to help us find Susan.
That's all.
If you redirect a few U.S. border control drones.
Hey.
Don't look at me like that.
Ok.
I've already gotten chapter and verse from John and Oliver.
Please don't, please.
I can't imagine them signing off on you hacking homeland security.
They don't know, do they?
All they need to know is that I am a grown woman making my own grown-up decisions.
Hey.
Got anything for me?
Oliver.
What is it, man?
Is it Susan?
Not yet, but it's just a matter of time.
I don't know what I can do to stop it.
Well, Oliver, there are always options, and you're not alone.
Do you think that's the problem?
You've done a wonderful job of convincing me that I'm changing for the better...
With the recruits and the...
The transparency, more optimism, more... more trust.
You think none of this would have happened if you hadn't trusted chase, right?
Trusted anyone.
Because I... i can't see anything past me just creating more targets.
Oliver.
We're not targets, man.
We're your teammates.
We're your strength.
You give me strength until chase turns it into a weakness.
Look what happened with Susan.
I let myself get close to Susan, and in so doing, I gave chase a way to get to me.
That could happen with you, with...
With Felicity...
With my son.
All of you make me vulnerable, John.
Maybe.
Maybe we do...
But caring about people, Oliver, that makes you human.
Being human's a luxury I might not get to have.
Yeah.
Ok.
Got it.
Tell dinah and Rene.
Felicity found out where chase is keeping Susan.
- Let's go!
- John.
There's something I need you to do for me.
If I'm gonna beat this guy, it'll be by playing his game...
And I know someone who makes him vulnerable.
This is where prometheus is holding your lady?
Or at least he was when he shot that video.
I'm reading a few dozen heat signatures inside.
Chase brought backup?
Or he's using decoys.
It's decoys.
Prometheus works alone.
Problem is Susan could be any one of those heat signatures.
We should split up, canvass floor by floor.
Agreed.
Overwatch, any word on spartan?
Package is en route.
- Eta 5 minutes.
- Package?
Oliver's got something up his green sleeve.
These puppies should help double our search capabilities.
Next time, I get to kick the door in.
Yeah.
Whatever floats your boat, Lassie.
Get back!
What was that?
Some sort of explosion.
Dinah, Rene, do you copy?
Yeah.
We copy.
But we're trapped in here.
- Son of a bitch!
- Yeah.
What if those heat signatures are incendiary devices?
I think we can pretty much confirm that.
We got 5 minutes for search and rescue before this whole place comes down.
You get dinah and wild dog out of here.
- I will find Susan.
- Assuming she's still here.
Which I'm totally sure she still is.
Unh!
Oliver!
Hey.
Are you ok?
- Yeah.
A-Adrian chase is...
- I know!
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
What's happening?
Chase is controlling the elevator.
Susan, we need to get you out of here.
- This building is gonna explode.
- What about...
Chase wants me.
You're no longer his target.
I was gonna say what about you?
I'm gonna finish this.
Get to safety.
Hello, Oliver.
Can you guys hear me in there?
Yeah.
Just waiting on that rescue.
Good.
Step back!
I'm glad Talia told you.
I prefer it this way, face to face.
There's an honesty to it.
Well, honestly...
I'm gonna keep both of us here until this building comes down on top of us.
Then you'd be dead.
So would you.
Really?
You really think I'd let that happen, Oliver?
Remember, I'm always 10 steps ahead of you.
You know, if that were true, you probably would have seen this coming.
Adrian?
You shouldn't be here.
How else was I supposed to find out the truth?
You killed all those people.
It's not that simple.
You killed them.
It's simple.
I know, baby.
This can't be you.
It's not you.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Why did you make her come here?
To get you to stop.
You have to stop.
You have to... you have to turn yourself in.
I can't do that.
Please.
Whatever this is, whatever you're doing, it's over.
You'd tell the police?
No.
You tell them.
You're right.
I'm gonna take care of this.
John!
Rahhh!
I've got an ambulance en route to your position.
My god.
Oliver's in there with chase.
Go help him now!
Go!
Agh!
Rah!
I told you, Oliver.
I'm not gonna kill you, and you can't kill me.
Yes, Adrian.
Yes, I can!
What's going on?
Guys, some sort of sitrep.
Chase is gone.
And so is Oliver.
Where's Oliver?
- Guys!
- We have to assume that chase has him.
What about Susan and chase's wife?
Susan's at the precinct.
Quentin is with her, um, but Doris passed away en route to starling general.
We've got to work on finding Oliver.
Felicity, you found Susan.
You can find him.
You're right.
Felicity, please tell me you're not going to see them again.
Dinah's right.
They're the ones that found Susan.
Agh!
Gregor!
Unh!
Oliver, is that you?
No.
It's the man who's gonna kill you.
Agh!
You up for making a statement?
Yeah, I'm up for anything that puts Adrian chase in the electric chair.
Actually, we only got lethal injection in this state, but I like your thinking.
Hello, Ms. Williams.
Long time, no see.
You get away from her.
Please don't threaten me.
I'm in mourning.
Haven't you heard?
The green arrow killed my wife earlier tonight, and apparently, the mayor's missing.
You wouldn't happen to know where he is, Quentin?
Honestly, it doesn't look good,
Oliver disappearing under these circumstances.
You give me one good reason why I shouldn't have you arrested right now.
Because you don't want your friend back in pieces.
Right?
Everyone's megaimpressed with the dhs hack you did for us.
That's great.
You've also been chosen as the first woman to go to Mars.
Sorry.
A friend of mine is missing.
The information we gave you didn't help?
Different friend.
You have a lot of missing friends.
Yeah, and this time, I have no leads whatsoever.
You guys have better resources than I do, and I have to use everything that I can to find him and do whatever you need me to do for you.
I don't believe I taught you how to escape from shackles, Oliver.
Your father was an honorable man.
You've allied with a psychopath, and he'd be ashamed of you.
Well, when it comes to the shame of fathers,
I shall bow to your superior expertise.
Just make sure he suffers.
That was always the plan.
My friends will find me.
They're my strength.
That's sweet, but I'm running out of ways to tell you, Oliver.
I'm not interested in killing you.
Then what the hell is this game that we're playing?
When I had Susan as my guest,
I confessed to her that you'd helped me discover who I really am.
That's what I'm gonna help you do, Oliver.
Greg, move your head!
Oliver:
Previously on "Arrow"...
This laptop contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from Kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.
This is most disappointing.
I liked many of you.
Oliver:
Prometheus surprised me with a very specific, unique move.
It was taught to me by a woman that I met in Russia.
You think you and Prometheus had the same teacher?
You're accepting the invitation to join Helix.
Full throttle.
What do I do with your secret?
I keep it.
I care about the city, and--and you're working double-time.
Can you talk some sense into him, please?
Mr. Mayor, Thea, meet my wife Doris.
I thought we could talk.
Can we set up a meeting tomorrow?
I'm late for a dinner.
It's important.
You could call it life or death.
You sure this is the place?
Curtis:
I don't see any other monasteries on this mountain.
Felicity's note said something about a demon-- oh, wait, maybe that says, "lemon."
Anyway, I--I texted her, but she has not hit me back.
It says, "demon."
Oliver, I'm losing you!
I'll see you back in Star City.
[Typing]
[People grunting, trading blows]
Where is she?
Who are you?
I'm a former student.
Former, which means you are not welcome here.
Talia:
No!
Leave us.
I would apologize for my students' enthusiasm, but you should not have come to this place.
Well, Talia, it was difficult to find.
Our business together concluded 5 years ago.
No.
One of your former students is trying to kill me.
Oh, he doesn't want to kill you, Oliver.
He means to destroy you utterly.
You knew?
If you knew, then why would you train him?
Why wouldn't you warn me?
Two years ago, he sought me out.
He'd already learned much about you.
He's a man of remarkable capacity.
Talia, enough!
If you knew what he wanted, then why would you train him?
You killed his father, and I helped him in his pursuit of vengeance because by then you'd killed mine!
I never told you my full name, did I?
No, you didn't.
It's Talia al Ghul.
[Exhales]
Ra's al Ghul was your father.
Yes.
My father and I came to be at odds, so I forged my own path...
But he was still my father when you put a sword through his chest.
So that's why you're not gonna help me.
That's why you won't tell who this...
Prometheus is.
Of course I will, Oliver, because I want you to suffer.
He calls himself...
Adrian Chase.

Holy-- that's--
So much bigger than anything the NSA is doing.
I know.
That's a lot of power for someone to have who's not government.
Well, the fact that we're not government is the whole point.
Power to the people, right?
Yeah.
Power to the people.
Heh.
Welcome to Helix, Felicity.
We're gonna change the world together.
Woman:
Mr. Queen, I've been trying to reach you--
I need Captain Pike and Quentin Lance in my office, and I need to know where D.A. Chase is right now.
Right now, Mr. Chase is in the conference room.
Treatment for drug addicts over incarceration.
Mr. Mayor, I didn't think you'd be joining us this morning.
I guess you know what I've been up to, huh?
- Yeah.
- I've been working on addressing our sentencing policy for drug offenses.
Care to join?
I'd like to see you in my office, please.
Actually, can it wait?
The councilmen and I are on a clock.
Besides, you're looking a little ragged.
You tired...
Or is it that you've actually been asleep this whole time?
All the captains are dead.
Da.
Gregor will promote new ones loyal to him, and they will kill us all.
Gonna try it this way now.
I got to tell you, I don't know how that mask is gonna play here, especially since the city's not too fond of your alter ego these days.
I'll give them the Throwing Star Killer, see how they feel.
Wait.
That's your big plan, arresting me?
Oh, man, that's a bit of a letdown, I have to say.
Well, I'm not gonna kill you, if only because that's what you want me to do.
But you've done everything I've wanted so far.
Did you really think I'd let all this end in a parking garage?
What did you do?
I gave your girlfriend an exclusive.
Wait.
Are you still dating Susan Williams?
I got to tell you, buddy.
It's been a little hard to keep track.
What did you do to her?
She's fine.
Don't worry.
As long as I'm around to make sure she gets some food and water.
Starvation and dehydration-- terrible way to go.
Bottom line--I die, she dies.
I don't make it back to her in time, she dies.
Now you could try torturing me for her location.
We both know what you're capable of in that department, but...
I think that we both know what I'm capable of, so, Ollie, who do you think can last longer--
Susan or me?
Ohh.
I'm 10 steps ahead of you, and you haven't even figured out what game we're playing yet.
Quentin:
That son of a bitch.
Yeah, I'd say that pretty much covers it.
This is a hell of a city you got here.
District attorney's a serial killer.
He's way worse that that.
Infiltrating the government like that at the highest level right next to Oliver?
We underestimated this guy.
I underestimated him.
I trusted him.
Where is Felicity?
I've been texting her like crazy, but her phone's off.
You don't think that Prometheus has--
No.
No.
His game is Susan.
For now.
We have to make sure Thea's safe.
Lyla and J.J. are secure at Argus.
I got in touch with Thea.
She's fine...
B-but we have to find Susan.
We cannot make a move on Chase until we know she's safe, until we have her here.
Keep looking for Felicity.
You GPS her phone if you have to.
We should go to Pike, tell him Chase is the Throwing Star Killer.
And then he asks for evidence, and you say what?
Look.
Quentin's right.
Dinah, we keep the SCPD out of this until we have something.
This guy has us in check.
Yeah, for now.
John:
Sent Curtis and Dinah to Opal City.
- For Chase's mother.
- He has leverage, we need some of our own.
That's not gonna work.
This guy always seems to be 10 steps ahead.
Well, Oliver, it's pretty easy, you confronting him in public like that.
What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't thinking.
Where you going now?
According to city records, Chase's house has a subbasement.
Chase does everything sideways, man.
I doubt he has Susan someplace obvious.
I don't know what's obvious anymore.
Oh, no.
I can't let you go out there alone.
- I'm going with you.
- I can handle it.
Never said you couldn't.
3 of us cannot defeat Gregor.
We need more men.
No.
We need a way to convince the Bratva that Gregor sold them out.
We had way.
Well, we don't have anyone that can pull data off a bullet-ridden laptop, so...
Without proof, Gregor will say we are traitors.
Rest of Bratva will believe them.
And then they will kill us.
So we've got to kill him first before he tells anyone.
Ok.
You've had enough to drink already.
[Sighs]
Where would Gregor go--
I mean, where would he go right now?
He'd go to ground.
Bratva stronghold is hockey rink, but it's heavily protected.
Hmm.
We wouldn't even get through the door.
I think I know someone who can.
I guess Norma Bates got the hell out of Dodge.
Chase anticipated this play.
I never said that he wasn't clever.
So am I.
Um...
What's your toy doing?
It's detecting resonance frequencies upstairs.
It's not a toy.
It's a T-sphere.
Wait.
Every horror movie ever has basically said that you do not go upstairs at a creepy serial killer's mother's house.
[Susan screams]
Help!
[Sobbing]
Unh!
Adrian:
Excellent.
Now give us another scream.
So, what, we're supposed to just go to work like things are normal?
Because newsflash-- they ain't.
Tell me something I don't already know.
Chase:
Ho ho!
I did think of one or two things.
This is nice, everything being out in the open now, all the cards on the table, as it were.
You got some nerve showing up here.
Why wouldn't I?
I take my job very seriously.
Speaking of, I thought my office had requested your verifications on the latest ComStat reports from the SCPD.
What you been doing?
I'm gonna kill you in ways that will hurt.
Threatening a city official's a felony, Mr. Ramirez.
You think you're so clever.
This isn't over, you son of a bitch!
I agree.
In fact, I think we're just getting started.
I want those ComStat verifications on my desk by tomorrow morning, Dog.
We can't just let that son of a bitch walk around here.
- We got to do something.
- We are doing something.
Yeah.
Rene and I have got eyes on Chase.
He's at city hall.
You got a green light to move on his house.
Roger that.
Ok, Spartan.
You check the upstairs and work your way down.
I'll sweep the basement.
We can meet in the middle.
Roger that.
- Please don't hurt me.
- Mrs. Chase.
What are you doing in my hou--
Mrs. Chase, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Get away from me.
Your husband isn't who you think he is.
Get out of my house.
Mrs. Chase, your husband is the Throwing Star Killer.
He's holding an innocent woman hostage, and I need your help to find her.
- You're insane.
- Doris, please.
You need to understand the truth.
You have to know at some level that your husband has been keeping something from you.
And police and the mayor say that you're the killer, you.
Officer:
On the floor.
On the floor!
Get down on the floor!
Did you hear me?
Get down on the floor!
Now!
You all right, Mrs. Chase?
I'm--I'm fine.
We got a call from your husband.
Don't worry.
We got this handled.
Get her out of here.
Tell me what you want me to do.
I am not getting into a shootout with the SCPD.
Copy that.
I'm out.
Smart move, douchebag.
I wasn't talking to you.
Drop the bow and get on the ground!
[Groans]
Whole thing's about 30 seconds long.
I've been over every frame, and there's nothing to indicate a location.
At least it's proof of life.
Yeah.
She was alive when this video was made, but we don't know how long a--sorry.
It's fine.
He'll-- he'll keep her alive to keep me in check.
I never should have gotten involved with Susan.
I don't know what I was thinking.
You were thinking you were lonely, man.
Everyone needs somebody.
Yeah?
Well, maybe I gave up that right when I put on the hood.
Felicity:
Hi!
Oh!
Hi!
I'm sorry.
I know I'm late.
I'm sorry.
I got Curtis' messages.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm here now.
Sorry.
Can you give us the room, please?
Heh.
Much appreciated.
Yeah.
I usually like my tongue lashings to be done in private, so thank you.
Heh.
I'm...
Sorry.
I'm not angry.
You don't--you don't work for me.
You--
I'm worried.
Right.
Of course, for all you know,
Prometheus could have kkhhk--ooh.
Not...
I'm worried about you.
Oh.
Because you're into something, and you don't want to tell anyone about it, or maybe you just don't want to tell me.
I think we can both agree that keeping secrets doesn't end well, so...
Yeah, you're right.
It's just that right now is not really a good time with everything going on.
You just have to trust me on this one, ok?
- Ok.
- But speaking of the something that I'm into, it actually helped me go through the petabyte of data we took off of Chase's mother's computer.
- This
- Who's Simon Morrison?
- Adrian Chase.
- What?
Simon Morrison is his birth name.
That's his real identity.
But his mother's name is Amanda Westfield.
Yes.
Well, she changed her name when she went off the grid, so it runs in the family.
Well, if Adrian Chase is an alias-- then the proof that his background is fake would be enough for the ACU to arrest his ass.
However you did it, good work.
Let's put this all on the drive.
- I've got to get to city hall.
- Wait.
Oh.
Now?
I mean, it's past 10:00.
Yeah.
Before the 11:00 news,
I have to make a statement on the Green Arrow breaking into the D.A.'s house.
Obviously, this is a horrifying development.
Uh, we believe the Green Arrow was retaliating against this office for speaking out against his recent crimes.
Mr. Mayor.
[Camera shutters clicking]
Ahem.
This office is in complete agreement with D.A. Chase.
This situation has become untenable...
And I am determined to bring it to a just and successful end.
I will not let anyone, anyone...
Terrorize this city...
And so I am demanding that the Green Arrow turn himself in.
He has 24 hours before I am ordering the SCPD to shoot on sight.
[Reporters clamoring]
That's all.
Thank you.
[Clamoring continues]
Thanks for seeing me.
I know it's late.
Uh, I think we both know our jobs don't recognize late and early.
What can I do for you?
What's this?
That is evidence that Adrian Chase is a false identity.
His real name is Simon Morrison.
In the midst of an investigation, you will learn that he is the Throwing Star Killer.
Oh.
That's one hell of an accusation.
That's why I'm giving you that.
And this evidence comes from where?
An investigation that I've been conducting off the books.
With what personnel?
Work the lead, Captain Pike.
Consider that an order if it helps.
One last thing.
You didn't get that from me.
I serve at the pleasure of the mayor.
There you are.
Viktor has confirmed Gregor's location, but tell me, why did you want him gone and why are you playing Robin Hood?
I met a woman.
She taught me how to give my darkness an identity so that it doesn't consume me.
And you believed her?
[Speaks Russian]
Oliver, whatever you think is inside you is inside you.
You--you cannot name it like that and keep it apart from you.
This woman's taught me differently.
This woman does not know what she is talking about, and if you're not careful, Oliver, one day she will be the source of your greatest pain.
Oh, my God.
And this is--
We've been calling him Prometheus, but you helped me I.D. him as Simon Morrison.
I've been striking out at getting a location off this, but someone with a cell phone at some point must have entered this room, which means there should be pictures of it on your database.
If I can cross-reference the images of your database with this video,
I should be able to help the police find her.
And that's, like, really cool and noble and all.
I mean, she definitely needs your help...
But?
But, Felicity, we gave you Pandora.
We helped you sort through that data pull, and now, well, people are starting to ask what you're doing for us.
I mean, we didn't invite you in just so you could check items off your to-do list.
Sorry.
It feels gross saying--
No.
Uh, no.
You're right.
Ok.
So quid pro quo.
I help you, you help me.
I was kind of hoping you'd say that.
We've been trying to break the encryption on a certain Homeland security drone.
- Why?
- Need to know, I'm afraid.
Question is what are you willing to quo in exchange for your quid?
Uh, can you check some files for me?
Any legal records you can find on a Simon Morrison.
Thanks.
[Groaning]
Hey.
[Coughs]
Hey.
You ok, buddy?
Need some medical attention or something?
Unh!
- What happened?
- Some lowlife attacked him outside the precinct.
SCPD's canvassing, but the security cameras, they did not get a shot of his face.
But...
How's Pike?
He's comatose.
This was Chase.
I don't know, Oliver.
Murder by lowlife is not exactly his style.
Earlier tonight, I gave Pike a lead connecting Chase to Prometheus.
I thought we didn't have any leads.
Felicity resurfaced with something.
Is Pike's family in there?
Nope, but somebody else is.
Life's just so fragile, isn't it?
Decades of hopes and dreams, and in one moment, one little mistake, and it all just goes away.
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.
Really?
Because so far, you haven't been able to do much to stop me.
Susan's fine by the way.
Well, alive at any rate.
Me and my team are gonna find her, and when we do, the second that we do...
I'm gonna put an arrow right through your heart.
You do realize how impotent you sound, right?
You think this is a game?
I don't feel like playing anymore.
You don't have a choice, Oliver.
If you kill me, you kill Susan, and she will be as dead as your mother, as Tommy, as Shado, as Laurel, as your friend Pike here probably-- all dead because of you.
So go ahead.
Kill me.
Let's find out how much more loss you can take because I don't think it's much.
I think that you're one loss away from being destroyed.
I guess we'll have to find another way to handle this then.
You see, that's the beautiful thing about all of this, Oliver.
If you kill me, you'll only really be killing yourself.
_

[Gunfire]
_
[Arrow whooshes]
[Grunting]
[Deep voice] Thanks for the assist.
What is thing you are doing with your voice?
[Gunfire]
Ok.
[Both typing]
Ok.
Ok.
Oh, oh!
I'm in.
Whoo!
We're in.
Yes.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did we just accidentally hack a DHS drone system?
Well, I wouldn't exactly say accidentally.
- Tch.
Am I right?
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Felicity, please explain to me why we're hacking Homeland security drones instead of finding Susan's location like you told me we would be!
Because hacking the drones is what's gonna lead us to Susan.
It's--it's...
So complicated.
Holy crap.
You just sent the receiver false data, and now you are spoofing the GPS system.
There's nothing slight about this.
This is just straight-up illegal.
Spill 100% deets right now.
- Right now!
- Ok, ok.
So I've--I've kind of made some--heh-- new friends.
Surprise.
And they have access to inaccessible amounts of data and Intel, tons of it.
They helped me get John out of prison, and now they're willing to help us find Susan.
That's all.
If you redirect a few U.S. border control drones.
Hey.
Don't look at me like that.
Ok.
I've already gotten chapter and verse from John and Oliver.
Please don't, please.
I can't imagine them signing off on you hacking Homeland Security.
They don't know, do they?
All they need to know is that I am a grown woman making my own grown-up decisions.
Hey.
Got anything for me?
Oliver.
What is it, man?
Is it Susan?
Not yet, but it's just a matter of time.
I don't know what I can do to stop it.
Well, Oliver, there are always options, and you're not alone.
Do you think that's the problem?
You've done a wonderful job of convincing me that I'm changing for the better...
With the recruits and the...
[Sighs]
The transparency, more optimism, more--more trust.
You think none of this would have happened if you hadn't trusted Chase, right?
Trusted anyone.
Because I--I can't see anything past me just creating more targets.
Oliver.
We're not targets, man.
We're your teammates.
We're your strength.
You give me strength until Chase turns it into a weakness.
Look what happened with Susan.
I let myself get close to Susan, and in so doing, I gave Chase a way to get to me.
That could happen with you, with... with Felicity... with my son.
All of you make me vulnerable, John.
Maybe.
Maybe we do...
But caring about people, Oliver, that makes you human.
[Sighs]
Being human's a luxury I might not get to have.
[Cell phone vibrating]
Yeah.
Ok.
Got it.
Tell Dinah and Rene.
Felicity found out where Chase is keeping Susan.
- Let's go!
- No no.
John.
There's something I need you to do for me.
If I'm gonna beat this guy, it'll be by playing his game...
And I know someone who makes him vulnerable.
Rene:
This is where Prometheus is holding Susan?
Or at least he was when he shot that video.
I'm reading a few dozen heat signatures inside.
Chase brought backup?
Or he's using decoys.
It's decoys.
Prometheus works alone.
Problem is Susan could be any one of those heat signatures.
We should split up, canvass floor by floor.
Agreed.
Overwatch, any word on Spartan?
Uh, package is en route.
- ETA 5 minutes.
- Package?
Oliver's got something up his green sleeve.
These puppies should help double our search capabilities.
Next time, I get to kick the door in.
Yeah.
Whatever floats your boat, Lassie.
[Beeping]
Get back!
What was that?
Some sort of explosion.
Dinah, Rene, do you copy?
[Coughing]
Ow.
Yeah.
We copy.
But we're trapped in here.
- Oh.
Son of a bitch!
- Yeah.
What if those heat signatures are incendiary devices?
I think we can pretty much confirm that.
We got 5 minutes for search and rescue before this whole place comes down.
You get Dinah and Wild Dog out of here.
- I will find Susan.
- Assuming she's still here.
Which I'm totally sure she still is.
[Ding]
Unh!
Oliver!
Hey.
Are you ok?
- Yeah.
A-Adrian Chase is--
- I know!
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
[Elevator rumbling]
What's happening?
Chase is controlling the elevator.
Susan, we need to get you out of here.
- This building is gonna explode.
- What about--
Chase wants me.
You're no longer his target.
I was gonna say what about you?
I'm gonna finish this.
Get to safety.
Hello, Oliver.
Can you guys hear me in there?
Yeah.
Just waiting on that rescue.
Good.
Step back!
I'm glad Talia told you.
I prefer it this way, face to face.
There's an honesty to it.
Well, honestly...
I'm gonna keep both of us here until this building comes down on top of us.
Then you'd be dead.
So would you.
Really?
You really think I'd let that happen, Oliver?
[Beep]
Remember, I'm always 10 steps ahead of you.
You know, if that were true, you probably would have seen this coming.
Adrian?
You shouldn't be here.
How else was I supposed to find out the truth?
You killed all those people.
It's not that simple.
You killed them.
It's simple.
I know, baby.
This can't be you.
It's not you.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Why did you make her come here?
To get you to stop.
You have to stop.
You have to--you have to turn yourself in.
I can't do that.
Please.
Whatever this is, whatever you're doing, it's over.
You'd tell the police?
No.
You tell them.
You're right.
I'm gonna take care of this.
[Stab]
John!
[Both grunting]
Rahhh!
Felicity:
I've got an ambulance en route to your position.
Oh, my God.
Oliver's in there with Chase.
Go help him now!
Go!
Agh!
Rah!
[Adrian panting]
I told you, Oliver.
I'm not gonna kill you, and you can't kill me.
Yes, Adrian.
Yes, I can!
[Metal scrapes]
[Arrow whooshes]
Felicity:
What's going on?
Guys, some sort of sitrep.
Chase is gone.
And so is Oliver.
Where's Oliver?
- Guys!
- We have to assume that Chase has him.
What about Susan and Chase's wife?
Felicity:
Susan's at the precinct.
Quentin is with her, um, but Doris passed away en route to Starling General.
Rene:
We've got to work on finding Oliver.
Felicity, you found Susan.
You can find him.
You're right.
Felicity, please tell me you're not going to see them again.
Dinah's right.
They're the ones that found Susan.
Agh!
Gregor!
Unh!
[Panting]
Oliver, is that you?
No.
It's the man who's gonna kill you.
Agh!
You up for making a statement?
Yeah, I'm up for anything that puts Adrian Chase in the electric chair.
Actually, we only got lethal injection in this state, but I like your thinking.
Hello, Ms. Williams.
Long time, no see.
You get away from her.
Please don't threaten me.
I'm in mourning.
Haven't you heard?
The Green Arrow killed my wife earlier tonight, and apparently, the mayor's missing.
You wouldn't happen to know where he is, Quentin?
Honestly, it doesn't look good,
Oliver disappearing under these circumstances.
You give me one good reason why I shouldn't have you arrested right now.
Because you don't want your friend back in pieces.
Right?
Everyone's megaimpressed with the DHS hack you did for us.
That's great.
You've also been chosen as the first woman to go to Mars.
Sorry.
A friend of mine is missing.
The information we gave you didn't help?
Different friend.
You have a lot of missing friends.
Yeah, and this time, I have no leads whatsoever.
You guys have better resources than I do, and I have to use everything that I can to find him and do whatever you need me to do for you.
[Chains rattling]
[Metal door opens]
[Footsteps]
Talia:
I don't believe I taught you how to escape from shackles, Oliver.
Your father was an honorable man.
You've allied with a psychopath, and he'd be ashamed of you.
Well, when it comes to the shame of fathers,
I shall bow to your superior expertise.
Just make sure he suffers.
That was always the plan.
My friends will find me.
They're my strength.
That's sweet, but I'm running out of ways to tell you, Oliver.
I'm not interested in killing you.
Then what the hell is this game that we're playing?
When I had Susan as my guest,
I confessed to her that you'd helped me discover who I really am.
That's what I'm gonna help you do, Oliver.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Greg!
Move your head.
- Hello there, sexy.
- Oh...
No, don't touch the tie.
I had to watch a YouTube video to get the knot right.
We made it, brother.
Building a mini-mall.
What's bigger than that?
Well, a mall.
Yeah.
I love seeing you guys all fancy.
It's a big step up from the open robe
I usually see at breakfast.
You're welcome.
Hey, um, since you guys are so busy, why don't I take some personal days this week and fill in for you as room parent?
You can do that?
This will give me a chance to dazzle Mrs. Rodriguez so she'll recommend Emme to the good first grade teacher, and not the one that takes out her teeth during quiet time.
Yeah, well, good luck.
Rodriguez's bar for room parents is way too high.
I've done my best to bring it down, but it's still... (whistles) up there.
Okay, well, don't worry about me.
You know that bar that you haven't met?
I set it.
I'm just saying, she's not an easy woman to please.
Well, there's a reason she's good-looking, but not married.
There's trouble under the hood.
Come on.
We should get going.
Kids!
Time for school.
I'm gonna hit the bathroom first this time.
Good thinking.
(laughs):
Yeah.
Every office we go to has a different bathroom code.
I can't keep 'em all straight.
Last week, I had to pee in the parking garage.
I hit the car alarm when he was in mid-stream.
He looked like a lawn sprinkler.
LISA:
Okay, guys.
These bids look excellent.
And how are you coming with those 3-D models?
Good.
Yeah, we hired a computer guy, Lowell, he's great.
Yeah, yeah, nice having him around.
He smells better than any man
I've ever known. (chuckles)
Well, that's important, I suppose.
So let's talk about our meeting,
- uh, this week with the investors.
- DON:
Mm-hmm.
It's critical you appear professional.
Ooh, I'll wear my tie that looks like a fish.
It's a crowd-pleaser and very realistic.
A seagull attacked me once.
That's how you know it's a good one.
All right.
I think we said enough here.
Maybe too much.
Uh, Lisa, we'll let you get back to work.
Oh.
Okay, take care.
Uh-huh.
Adam, stick around for a second.
Oh?
- Yep, you're done.
- Oh.
Okay.
I don't want Don at the investors' meeting.
These people need to know their money is in serious hands, and Don's a fish tie guy.
Oh, I'll tell him to wear a regular tie.
Plus, I think he might have relieved himself in our parking garage last week.
I don't think it was him.
You don't have security cameras, do you?
You know... he just doesn't fit in a corporate environment.
So, take care of this for me.
Okay.
You're the boss.
Hey, I know it's tough, but welcome to the big leagues.
- Mm.
- I had to fire my mother on a Saturday, then take her out to Easter brunch the next morning.
That was a... quiet meal.
What'd she do, wear a fish tie?
(chuckles)
I'll, uh, I'll figure out a way to break it to Don.
Mm.
Word of advice:
when I'm giving someone bad news,
I always use the direct approach.
I look them in the eye, put my hand on their shoulder, and say, "Mom, you're fired."
You're right, it does get quiet after that.
So?
How'd the meeting with the developer go?
McCaffrey didn't know what hit her.
We blew that place up.
There's shrapnel all over her office.
What's he saying?
Is everything ruined?
No.
No, it went fine.
Hey, what did Lisa want to talk to you about?
Well, um... (sighs)
Okay, there's something I need to tell you.
Uh...
Lisa thinks that your fun personality might be too much for the investors.
And she, uh, she wants you to sit out the meeting.
(gasps)
Could you please not do that?
Well, I hope you told her to take a flying leap.
Don, we've given up all our other work for this job.
Okay?
Plus, she's the boss.
Well, she may be the boss, but I'm going to that meeting.
I'm gonna let her know exactly what I think of her.
(gasps) Sorry, that was me again.
I'm too mad to work.
I'm gonna sit in the truck and listen to Johnny Cash and eat my feelings.
And Lowell's candies.
It's a meeting, and you're not invited.
(sighs) Oh, man, I feel terrible.
Well, I'd offer you a butterscotch, but he took them all.
I've got to figure out a way to calm him down.
He cannot go yell at Lisa.
She fired her own mother.
She'll have no problem firing us.
You know, when I was in marketing and a client was upset, we would send them a gift basket.
It made them feel appreciated.
- A gift basket?
- They're doing some amazing stuff with fruit these days.
No.
Don hates fruit.
He says it's like eating a tree's baby.
And I'm not the one who needs to make him feel appreciated, Lisa is.
Ooh.
Wait, what about this:
I'll send Don a basket and say it's from Lisa.
I see what you did.
You took a nice idea and added a lie to it.
Morning, Alicia.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Oh, I'm covering for Adam this week.
Oh, thank God.
I know, right?
(chuckles)
And I just wanted to thank you for what a wonderful job you've done with Emme this year.
So here is a cup of coffee, and a muffin from your favorite bakery.
Oh. (chuckles)
And it doesn't have anything to do with hoping you'll help get Emme into the good first grade class.
Coffee's a large, by the way.
Andi, are you trying to influence me with gifts?
I don't know, am I?
I think you are.
And I like it.
(both laugh)
But honestly, a muffin?
(chuckles)
Okay.
I guess I'll just put it over here with all the others.
All right, so how do we get this done?
Huh?
Nice bottle of wine, spa day?
I drop a $20 and walk away?
(sighs) You know, if I was so overwhelmed by the amazing job you did with the kids' Spring Fling party this week...
I'm thinking Hawaiian luau...
I'd say we have a deal.
(laughs):
A Hawaiian luau for a bunch of kids?
Oh, you're serious.
Um, yeah.
All right, yeah.
I'm on it.
Surf's up.
(chuckles)
(softly):
Damn.
Yeah, I took your advice, what do you think?
Don's going to love it.
And he can repurpose this basket for so many things.
Picnics, an herb garden.
He could put it on the front of his bike and drive around with a little dog in there.
Lowell, you want the basket after he's done?
If you could put a good word in, I'd appreciate it.
Hey, Lowell.
Backstabber.
What's this?
Oh, yeah, that came for you today.
We don't know who it's from.
Eh, someone knows, but not the two of us.
(clicks tongue)
"Dear Don, between us,
"you're my favorite Burns brother.
Lisa."
Why would she send me this if she doesn't want me at the meeting?
Great question.
Lowell?
Me?
Yeah.
Go ahead.
It's because she appreciates you.
(snaps fingers)
I know what's going on here.
You do?
Mm-hmm.
She's into me.
Look at this stuff: wine, chocolates.
All aphrodisiacs.
This woman wants to lay with me.
What's that, now?
Yeah, that's-that's why she doesn't want me at the meeting.
She's worried she can't control herself around me.
She's a hungry bear, and I'm a pot of honey.
It wouldn't be right to yell at her now.
Yeah, you're-you're right.
He's right, it wouldn't be right.
Yes, I mean, uh, you can't yell at a woman in love.
That'd be mean.
And you're not mean, you're... a, uh... you're a...
- What is he, Lowell?
- Pot of honey.
You're a pot of honey.
That's right, yeah.
Yeah, okay, so you skip the meeting, I'll handle that.
And everybody will live happily ever after.
Right?
You take the things in the basket,
I'll take the basket, and it'll be like it never happened.
Thank you for volunteering to help me.
Rodriguez is out of her mind with this party.
Well, so just tell her it's too much.
Sounds like someone already got their daughter into the good first grade class.
Hmm?
I learned Spanish and picked her mother up from the airport.
Or aeropuerto.
Okay, well, I can't do that, so this party has to kick butt.
But, I mean, look at this list.
I mean, inflatable palm trees, grass skirts, virgin daiquiris?
Why don't I just resurrect Don Ho while I'm at it?
Don who?
Ho.
Don't get nasty.
(laughs):
No.
Don Ho was a ukulele player from the '70s.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Sometimes I forget how much older you guys are than me.
I worded that incorrectly.
Mm-hmm.
Wait, so Lisa McCaffrey's coming on to Don?
My husband has that effect on women.
Every time he leaves the house, it's like throwing a hunk of meat into an alligator pit.
I mean, some of this is my fault.
There I was, parading around her in my khaki Dockers
- like a Chippendale.
- (giggles)
I got an idea:
let's stop talking about this, and just build a mini-mall.
Hmm?
- Yeah.
- Well, hold on.
He can't act like nothing happened.
Don, you have to tell her that she needs to keep her horny mitts off of you.
What?
No, he doesn't.
Yeah, I'm with Marcy.
- What?
No, you're not.
- Ye-Yeah,
I mean, a woman doesn't write a guy a note like that if she's not interested.
I mean, is-isn't she recently divorced?
No, no, no.
It's been, like, three months.
Yeah, and now she wants to bounce back with a married guy, which is exactly how I'd play it.
Well, sounds like you put some thought into that.
Okay, everybody, just relax, all right?
She sent him a gift basket, not her underwear and a motel key.
Nobody needs to talk to Lisa.
Well, I think he needs to say something to her.
Don't you agree, Andi?
No, she doesn't agree.
Don't talk for me.
I thought you loved that.
I think you know I don't.
If I were talking for you right now,
I would say you love that.
Marcy, I-I think you're right.
I should let Lisa know that this pot of honey already has a mean, beautiful she-bear.
I'm gonna call her tomorrow.
What?
No, I don't think you should do that at all.
I think you should just let it go.
Drop it, choke it, put it in a sack, throw it in the river.
Nah, I'm gonna call her tomorrow.
Yeah, good boy.
Now, let's go home for your reward.
Ooh.
My she-bear's on the prowl.
You're a good husband, Don.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
If he calls Lisa, the mini-mall project is dead.
Why?
Because she didn't seduce my brother.
I did!
- So you sent Don a fancy gift basket?
- Right.
And for Mother's Day, you got me a Sausage McMuffin.
Can we stick to the problem at hand, huh?
Don is gonna call our boss and break off a relationship she doesn't know exists because it doesn't exist.
Okay?
And when that happens, the mini-mall is dead.
Well, then you need to do the right thing.
I agree.
What is that?
You have to keep lying.
(laughs) Is this one of those times where you say one thing, but you mean the opposite?
Huh?
Like when you said you'd never bring up the Mother's Day McMuffin again?
Look, right now, you need to protect both Don and the mini-mall job.
It's time to double down, babe.
I like this side of you.
Okay.
Here's how you handle it, all right?
You send Don another note from Lisa and say, "We have to keep our feelings a secret and never discuss them, not even with each other."
Ooh, that's clever.
- Mm.
- Yeah... wait.
Should I be worried about how good you are at manipulating people?
What?
Honey, you're way too smart for that.
All this party stuff looks great.
Do they even have monkeys in Hawaii?
Well, I almost passed out blowing them up, so they do now.
We may have overdone it with the virgin daiquiris.
- There's a ton left inside.
- Good.
Later, we'll mix in some rum and celebrate Emme getting the good first grade teacher.
"Dear Don, we have to keep our feelings a secret and never discuss them, not even with each other.
I know you may want to, but you shouldn't.
Lisa.
P.S. Don't talk to me about this."
And I may be reading between the lines, but sounds to me...
This is just me...
It sounds like you shouldn't call her.
Well, no need to.
Right before you got in,
I sent her some flowers with a steamy note.
You sent her flowers?
Why would you do that?
Because I got to thinking.
Why would you do that?
We can't afford to screw up this mini-mall gig, so I need to keep her on the hook.
It's a dance, Adam, and you're looking at Beyoncé.
No, I'm not!
Lowell?
You okay?
Hiya.
What's the matter with you?
I must've dozed off.
I had a few virgin daiquiris.
They made me happy.
Then dancy, then sleepy.
I've been every dwarf today.
Oh, my God.
There's alcohol in here.
That explains a lot.
How can that be?
I mean, t-the label says "virgin."
What?
Oh... it's Tropical Virgin brand daiquiri.
It's not tropical virgin daiquiri.
Okay, the kids are still at assembly.
I have 15 minutes before they get drunk and I get arrested.
Wait, Andi.
What?
On your way back, pick up some tacos.
Oh, my...
(whispers):
Okay.
Good morning.
What are you doing?
I'm just wishing everyone good morning.
Yeah.
Okay, got to go.
I'm off to accounting, then HR.
What a bunch of stiffs they are.
(laughs)
Are those flowers for me?
Uh, no, no, different Lisa. (chuckles)
Oh, so, you're in my office with flowers for a different person named Lisa?
Yes.
Lisa...
Marie Presley.
Yeah.
I'm a big fan, yeah.
Is she in yet?
Okay, everyone, it's time to start our Hawaiian luau.
CHILDREN:
Yay!
(distorted):
No!
Is there alcohol in this?
Yes, but... the good news is:
none of the kids are driving, so...
So, because of you, fish tie guy thinks I have the hots for him.
Do you have any idea how unprofessional all this is?
I have a sense.
Look, I was just trying to keep the project on track and protect my brother's feelings.
Well, turns out you can't do both.
Then you know what?
I get that this investor meeting's important, but here's the deal:
either Don and I do it together or we don't do it at all.
And that's your bottom line?
Yep.
I'll walk away.
Okay.
I'm walking.
Here I go.
- Don't try to stop me.
- (scoffs)
- You're barely moving.
- Well, I want you to get a good look at what you're losing.
Did you say something?
Nope.
Okay, look, I know business is business, but I have a family business.
My brother and I like each other.
Our brunches are very loud.
Well, I do appreciate your loyalty.
My therapist says it's good for me to be around people who experience real human emotions.
Had to have a therapist tell you that, huh?
Well, things have been quiet at my house since my mom moved out.
Yeah, I didn't just fire her, I also evicted her.
Ouch.
Tell you what:
because you guys are the best in the business, if we never have to talk about this ever again, we're good.
And Don can come to the meeting.
Thank you.
And don't worry, this is definitely over.
(mouths)
Look, baby, we got to call this thing off.
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm just hanging.
This is my hang now.
Look, I tried to play this game,
- but I'm a one-woman man.
- (groans)
Fact is, I'm not Beyoncé.
I'm Adele.
I rock the house, but I don't dance.
Okay, you know what, I've had enough.
This is getting ridiculous.
Don...
Did you say Don or Mom?
Don...
I want you real bad.
But I can't have you, so please leave.
Listen, you're a special lady.
If something should happen to my wife,
I'll put you on the list.
(mouths)
Okay, good-bye.
Playing the mom card was cold.
You're a good businessman.
But don't let it happen again.
You already have two strikes.
Two strikes?
We have security cameras in the parking garage.
So I'm guessing Emme's not getting the good first grade teacher?
No, she's in.
All I had to do was promise that neither of us would be room parent next year.
You got us banned from being room parents?
Mm-hmm.
I have never been more in love with you.
- (doorbell rings)
- Mm.
Will you grab that?
Mm-hmm.
What's this?
I don't know.
Read the card.
Okay.
"Thanks for your help this week.
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.
Love, Adam."
Aw.
(squeals)
It's a Sausage McMuffin.
You get it?
That's our thing now.
It is kind of cute.
(chuckles)
- And yum.
- (chuckles)
Wow, that smells good.
I should've sent two of those.
You're gonna have to fight me for it.
Well, you better start running.
(scoffs)
No, no!
Give me that muffin!
Yeah. (whoops)
- Hello there, sexy.
- Oh...
No, don't touch the tie.
I had to watch a YouTube video to get the knot right.
We made it, brother.
Building a mini-mall.
What's bigger than that?
Well, a mall.
Yeah.
I love seeing you guys all fancy.
It's a big step up from the open robe
I usually see at breakfast.
You're welcome.
Hey, um, since you guys are so busy, why don't I take some personal days this week and fill in for you as room parent?
You can do that?
This will give me a chance to dazzle Mrs. Rodriguez so she'll recommend Emme to the good first grade teacher, and not the one that takes out her teeth during quiet time.
Yeah, well, good luck.
Rodriguez's bar for room parents is way too high.
I've done my best to bring it down, but it's still... up there.
Okay, well, don't worry about me.
You know that bar that you haven't met?
I set it.
I'm just saying, she's not an easy woman to please.
Well, there's a reason she's good-looking, but not married.
There's trouble under the hood.
Come on.
We should get going.
Kids!
Time for school.
I'm gonna hit the bathroom first this time.
Good thinking.
Yeah.
Every office we go to has a different bathroom code.
I can't keep 'em all straight.
Last week, I had to pee in the parking garage.
I hit the car alarm when he was in mid-stream.
He looked like a lawn sprinkler.
Okay, guys.
These bids look excellent.
And how are you coming with those 3-D models?
Good.
Yeah, we hired a computer guy, Lowell, he's great.
Yeah, yeah, nice having him around.
He smells better than any man
I've ever known.
Well, that's important, I suppose.
So let's talk about our meeting,
- uh, this week with the investors.
- Mm-hmm.
It's critical you appear professional.
Ooh, I'll wear my tie that looks like a fish.
It's a crowd-pleaser and very realistic.
A seagull attacked me once.
That's how you know it's a good one.
All right.
I think we said enough here.
Maybe too much.
Uh, Lisa, we'll let you get back to work.
Oh.
Okay, take care.
Uh-huh.
Adam, stick around for a second.
Oh?
- Yep, you're done.
- Oh.
Okay.
I don't want Don at the investors' meeting.
These people need to know their money is in serious hands, and Don's a fish tie guy.
Oh, I'll tell him to wear a regular tie.
Plus, I think he might have relieved himself in our parking garage last week.
I don't think it was him.
You don't have security cameras, do you?
You know... he just doesn't fit in a corporate environment.
So, take care of this for me.
Okay.
You're the boss.
Hey, I know it's tough, but welcome to the big leagues.
- Mm.
- I had to fire my mother on a Saturday, then take her out to Easter brunch the next morning.
That was a... quiet meal.
What'd she do, wear a fish tie?
I'll, uh, I'll figure out a way to break it to Don.
Mm.
Word of advice:
when I'm giving someone bad news,
I always use the direct approach.
I look them in the eye, put my hand on their shoulder, and say, "Mom, you're fired."
You're right, it does get quiet after that.
So?
How'd the meeting with the developer go?
McCaffrey didn't know what hit her.
We blew that place up.
There's shrapnel all over her office.
What's he saying?
Is everything ruined?
No.
No, it went fine.
Hey, what did Lisa want to talk to you about?
Well, um...
Okay, there's something I need to tell you.
Uh...
Lisa thinks that your fun personality might be too much for the investors.
And she, uh, she wants you to sit out the meeting.
Could you please not do that?
Well, I hope you told her to take a flying leap.
Don, we've given up all our other work for this job.
Okay?
Plus, she's the boss.
Well, she may be the boss, but I'm going to that meeting.

Oh... it's Tropical Virgin brand daiquiri.
It's not tropical virgin daiquiri.
Okay, the kids are still at assembly.
I have 15 minutes before they get drunk and I get arrested.
Wait, Andi.
What?
On your way back, pick up some tacos.
Oh, my...
Okay.
Good morning.
What are you doing?
I'm just wishing everyone good morning.
Yeah.
Okay, got to go.
I'm off to accounting, then HR.
What a bunch of stiffs they are.
Are those flowers for me?
Uh, no, no, different Lisa.
Oh, so, you're in my office with flowers for a different person named Lisa?
Yes.
Lisa...
Marie Presley.
Yeah.
I'm a big fan, yeah.
Is she in yet?
Okay, everyone, it's time to start our Hawaiian luau.
Yay!
No!
Is there alcohol in this?
Yes, but... the good news is:
none of the kids are driving, so...
So, because of you, fish tie guy thinks I have the hots for him.
Do you have any idea how unprofessional all this is?
I have a sense.
Look, I was just trying to keep the project on track and protect my brother's feelings.
Well, turns out you can't do both.
Then you know what?
I get that this investor meeting's important, but here's the deal:
either Don and I do it together or we don't do it at all.
And that's your bottom line?
Yep.
I'll walk away.
Okay.
I'm walking.
Here I go.
Don't try to stop me.
- You're barely moving.
- Well, I want you to get a good look at what you're losing.
Did you say something?
Nope.
Okay, look, I know business is business, but I have a family business.
My brother and I like each other.
Our brunches are very loud.
Well, I do appreciate your loyalty.
My therapist says it's good for me to be around people who experience real human emotions.
Had to have a therapist tell you that, huh?
Well, things have been quiet at my house since my mom moved out.
Yeah, I didn't just fire her, I also evicted her.
Ouch.
Tell you what:
because you guys are the best in the business, if we never have to talk about this ever again, we're good.
And Don can come to the meeting.
Thank you.
And don't worry, this is definitely over.
Look, baby, we got to call this thing off.
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm just hanging.
This is my hang now.
Look, I tried to play this game, but I'm a one-woman man.
Fact is, I'm not Beyoncé.
I'm Adele.
I rock the house, but I don't dance.
Okay, you know what, I've had enough.
This is getting ridiculous.
Don...
Did you say Don or Mom?
Don...
I want you real bad.
But I can't have you, so please leave.
Listen, you're a special lady.
If something should happen to my wife,
I'll put you on the list.
Okay, good-bye.
Playing the mom card was cold.
You're a good businessman.
But don't let it happen again.
You already have two strikes.
Two strikes?
We have security cameras in the parking garage.
So I'm guessing Emme's not getting the good first grade teacher?
No, she's in.
All I had to do was promise that neither of us would be room parent next year.
You got us banned from being room parents?
Mm-hmm.
I have never been more in love with you.
Mm.
Will you grab that?
Mm-hmm.
What's this?
I don't know.
Read the card.
Okay.
"Thanks for your help this week.
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.
Love, Adam."
Aw.
It's a Sausage McMuffin.
You get it?
That's our thing now.
It is kind of cute.
And yum.
Wow, that smells good.
I should've sent two of those.
You're gonna have to fight me for it.
Well, you better start running.
No, no!
Give me that muffin!
Yeah.
- Hello there, sexy.
- Oh...
No, don't touch the tie.
I had to watch a YouTube video to get the knot right.
We made it, brother.
Building a mini-mall.
What's bigger than that?
Well, a mall.
Yeah.
I love seeing you guys all fancy.
It's a big step up from the open robe
I usually see at breakfast.
You're welcome.
Hey, um, since you guys are so busy, why don't I take some personal days this week and fill in for you as room parent?
You can do that?
This will give me a chance to dazzle Mrs. Rodriguez so she'll recommend Emme to the good first grade teacher, and not the one that takes out her teeth during quiet time.
Yeah, well, good luck.
Rodriguez's bar for room parents is way too high.
I've done my best to bring it down, but it's still... (whistles) up there.
Okay, well, don't worry about me.
You know that bar that you haven't met?
I set it.
I'm just saying, she's not an easy woman to please.
Well, there's a reason she's good-looking, but not married.
There's trouble under the hood.
Come on.
We should get going.
Kids!
Time for school.
I'm gonna hit the bathroom first this time.
Good thinking.
(laughs):
Yeah.
Every office we go to has a different bathroom code.
I can't keep 'em all straight.
Last week, I had to pee in the parking garage.
I hit the car alarm when he was in mid-stream.
He looked like a lawn sprinkler.
LISA:
Okay, guys.
These bids look excellent.
And how are you coming with those 3-D models?
Good.
Yeah, we hired a computer guy, Lowell, he's great.
Yeah, yeah, nice having him around.
He smells better than any man
I've ever known. (chuckles)
Well, that's important, I suppose.
So let's talk about our meeting,
- uh, this week with the investors.
- DON:
Mm-hmm.
It's critical you appear professional.
Ooh, I'll wear my tie that looks like a fish.
It's a crowd-pleaser and very realistic.
A seagull attacked me once.
That's how you know it's a good one.
All right.
I think we said enough here.
Maybe too much.
Uh, Lisa, we'll let you get back to work.
Oh.
Okay, take care.
Uh-huh.
Adam, stick around for a second.
Oh?
- Yep, you're done.
- Oh.
Okay.
I don't want Don at the investors' meeting.
These people need to know their money is in serious hands, and Don's a fish tie guy.
Oh, I'll tell him to wear a regular tie.
Plus, I think he might have relieved himself in our parking garage last week.
I don't think it was him.
You don't have security cameras, do you?
You know... he just doesn't fit in a corporate environment.
So, take care of this for me.
Okay.
You're the boss.
Hey, I know it's tough, but welcome to the big leagues.
- Mm.
- I had to fire my mother on a Saturday, then take her out to Easter brunch the next morning.
That was a... quiet meal.
What'd she do, wear a fish tie?
(chuckles)
I'll, uh, I'll figure out a way to break it to Don.
Mm.
Word of advice:
when I'm giving someone bad news,
I always use the direct approach.
I look them in the eye, put my hand on their shoulder, and say, "Mom, you're fired."
You're right, it does get quiet after that.
So?
How'd the meeting with the developer go?
McCaffrey didn't know what hit her.
We blew that place up.
There's shrapnel all over her office.
What's he saying?
Is everything ruined?
No.
No, it went fine.
Hey, what did Lisa want to talk to you about?
Well, um... (sighs)
Okay, there's something I need to tell you.
Uh...
Lisa thinks that your fun personality might be too much for the investors.
And she, uh, she wants you to sit out the meeting.
(gasps)
Could you please not do that?
Well, I hope you told her to take a flying leap.
Don, we've given up all our other work for this job.
Okay?
Plus, she's the boss.
Well, she may be the boss, but I'm going to that meeting.
I'm gonna let her know exactly what I think of her.
(gasps) Sorry, that was me again.
I'm too mad to work.
I'm gonna sit in the truck and listen to Johnny Cash and eat my feelings.
And Lowell's candies.
It's a meeting, and you're not invited.
(sighs) Oh, man, I feel terrible.
Well, I'd offer you a butterscotch, but he took them all.
I've got to figure out a way to calm him down.
He cannot go yell at Lisa.
She fired her own mother.
She'll have no problem firing us.
You know, when I was in marketing and a client was upset, we would send them a gift basket.
It made them feel appreciated.
- A gift basket?
- They're doing some amazing stuff with fruit these days.
No.
Don hates fruit.
He says it's like eating a tree's baby.
And I'm not the one who needs to make him feel appreciated, Lisa is.
Ooh.
Wait, what about this:
I'll send Don a basket and say it's from Lisa.
I see what you did.
You took a nice idea and added a lie to it.
Morning, Alicia.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Oh, I'm covering for Adam this week.
Oh, thank God.
I know, right?
(chuckles)
And I just wanted to thank you for what a wonderful job you've done with Emme this year.
So here is a cup of coffee, and a muffin from your favorite bakery.
Oh. (chuckles)
And it doesn't have anything to do with hoping you'll help get Emme into the good first grade class.
Coffee's a large, by the way.
Andi, are you trying to influence me with gifts?
I don't know, am I?
I think you are.
And I like it.
(both laugh)
But honestly, a muffin?
(chuckles)
Okay.
I guess I'll just put it over here with all the others.
All right, so how do we get this done?
Huh?
Nice bottle of wine, spa day?
I drop a $20 and walk away?
(sighs) You know, if I was so overwhelmed by the amazing job you did with the kids' Spring Fling party this week...
I'm thinking Hawaiian luau...
I'd say we have a deal.
(laughs):
A Hawaiian luau for a bunch of kids?
Oh, you're serious.
Um, yeah.
All right, yeah.
I'm on it.
Surf's up.
(chuckles)
(softly):
Damn.
Yeah, I took your advice, what do you think?
Don's going to love it.
And he can repurpose this basket for so many things.
Picnics, an herb garden.
He could put it on the front of his bike and drive around with a little dog in there.
Lowell, you want the basket after he's done?
If you could put a good word in, I'd appreciate it.
Hey, Lowell.
Backstabber.
What's this?
Oh, yeah, that came for you today.
We don't know who it's from.
Eh, someone knows, but not the two of us.
(clicks tongue)
"Dear Don, between us,
"you're my favorite Burns brother.
Lisa."
Why would she send me this if she doesn't want me at the meeting?
Great question.
Lowell?
Me?
Yeah.
Go ahead.
It's because she appreciates you.
(snaps fingers)
I know what's going on here.
You do?
Mm-hmm.
She's into me.
Look at this stuff: wine, chocolates.
All aphrodisiacs.
This woman wants to lay with me.
What's that, now?
Yeah, that's-that's why she doesn't want me at the meeting.
She's worried she can't control herself around me.
She's a hungry bear, and I'm a pot of honey.
It wouldn't be right to yell at her now.
Yeah, you're-you're right.
He's right, it wouldn't be right.
Yes, I mean, uh, you can't yell at a woman in love.
That'd be mean.
And you're not mean, you're... a, uh... you're a...
- What is he, Lowell?
- Pot of honey.
You're a pot of honey.
That's right, yeah.
Yeah, okay, so you skip the meeting, I'll handle that.
And everybody will live happily ever after.
Right?
You take the things in the basket,
I'll take the basket, and it'll be like it never happened.
Thank you for volunteering to help me.
Rodriguez is out of her mind with this party.
Well, so just tell her it's too much.
Sounds like someone already got their daughter into the good first grade class.
Hmm?
I learned Spanish and picked her mother up from the airport.
Or aeropuerto.
Okay, well, I can't do that, so this party has to kick butt.
But, I mean, look at this list.
I mean, inflatable palm trees, grass skirts, virgin daiquiris?
Why don't I just resurrect Don Ho while I'm at it?
Don who?
Ho.
Don't get nasty.
(laughs):
No.
Don Ho was a ukulele player from the '70s.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Sometimes I forget how much older you guys are than me.
I worded that incorrectly.
Mm-hmm.
Wait, so Lisa McCaffrey's coming on to Don?
My husband has that effect on women.
Every time he leaves the house, it's like throwing a hunk of meat into an alligator pit.
I mean, some of this is my fault.
There I was, parading around her in my khaki Dockers
- like a Chippendale.
- (giggles)
I got an idea:
let's stop talking about this, and just build a mini-mall.
Hmm?
- Yeah.
- Well, hold on.
He can't act like nothing happened.
Don, you have to tell her that she needs to keep her horny mitts off of you.
What?
No, he doesn't.
Yeah, I'm with Marcy.
- What?
No, you're not.
- Ye-Yeah,
I mean, a woman doesn't write a guy a note like that if she's not interested.
I mean, is-isn't she recently divorced?
No, no, no.
It's been, like, three months.
Yeah, and now she wants to bounce back with a married guy, which is exactly how I'd play it.
Well, sounds like you put some thought into that.
Okay, everybody, just relax, all right?
She sent him a gift basket, not her underwear and a motel key.
Nobody needs to talk to Lisa.
Well, I think he needs to say something to her.
Don't you agree, Andi?
No, she doesn't agree.
Don't talk for me.
I thought you loved that.
I think you know I don't.
If I were talking for you right now,
I would say you love that.
Marcy, I-I think you're right.
I should let Lisa know that this pot of honey already has a mean, beautiful she-bear.
I'm gonna call her tomorrow.
What?
No, I don't think you should do that at all.
I think you should just let it go.
Drop it, choke it, put it in a sack, throw it in the river.
Nah, I'm gonna call her tomorrow.
Yeah, good boy.
Now, let's go home for your reward.
Ooh.
My she-bear's on the prowl.
You're a good husband, Don.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
If he calls Lisa, the mini-mall project is dead.
Why?
Because she didn't seduce my brother.
I did!
- So you sent Don a fancy gift basket?
- Right.
And for Mother's Day, you got me a Sausage McMuffin.
Can we stick to the problem at hand, huh?
Don is gonna call our boss and break off a relationship she doesn't know exists because it doesn't exist.
Okay?
And when that happens, the mini-mall is dead.
Well, then you need to do the right thing.
I agree.
What is that?
You have to keep lying.
(laughs) Is this one of those times where you say one thing, but you mean the opposite?
Huh?
Like when you said you'd never bring up the Mother's Day McMuffin again?
Look, right now, you need to protect both Don and the mini-mall job.
It's time to double down, babe.
I like this side of you.
Okay.
Here's how you handle it, all right?
You send Don another note from Lisa and say, "We have to keep our feelings a secret and never discuss them, not even with each other."
Ooh, that's clever.
- Mm.
- Yeah... wait.
Should I be worried about how good you are at manipulating people?
What?
Honey, you're way too smart for that.
All this party stuff looks great.
Do they even have monkeys in Hawaii?
Well, I almost passed out blowing them up, so they do now.
We may have overdone it with the virgin daiquiris.
- There's a ton left inside.
- Good.
Later, we'll mix in some rum and celebrate Emme getting the good first grade teacher.
"Dear Don, we have to keep our feelings a secret and never discuss them, not even with each other.
I know you may want to, but you shouldn't.
Lisa.
P.S. Don't talk to me about this."
And I may be reading between the lines, but sounds to me...
This is just me...
It sounds like you shouldn't call her.
Well, no need to.
Right before you got in,
I sent her some flowers with a steamy note.
You sent her flowers?
Why would you do that?
Because I got to thinking.
Why would you do that?
We can't afford to screw up this mini-mall gig, so I need to keep her on the hook.
It's a dance, Adam, and you're looking at Beyoncé.
No, I'm not!
Lowell?
You okay?
Hiya.
What's the matter with you?
I must've dozed off.
I had a few virgin daiquiris.
They made me happy.
Then dancy, then sleepy.
I've been every dwarf today.
Oh, my God.
There's alcohol in here.
That explains a lot.
How can that be?
I mean, t-the label says "virgin."
What?
Oh... it's Tropical Virgin brand daiquiri.
It's not tropical virgin daiquiri.
Okay, the kids are still at assembly.
I have 15 minutes before they get drunk and I get arrested.
Wait, Andi.
What?
On your way back, pick up some tacos.
Oh, my...
(whispers):
Okay.
Good morning.
What are you doing?
I'm just wishing everyone good morning.
Yeah.
Okay, got to go.
I'm off to accounting, then HR.
What a bunch of stiffs they are.

I guess I'll just put it over here with all the others.
All right, so how do we get this done?
Huh?
Nice bottle of wine, spa day?
I drop a $20 and walk away?
You know, if I was so overwhelmed by the amazing job you did with the kids' Spring Fling party this week...
I'm thinking Hawaiian luau...
I'd say we have a deal.
A Hawaiian luau for a bunch of kids?
Oh, you're serious.
Um, yeah.
All right, yeah.
I'm on it.
Surf's up.
Damn.
Yeah, I took your advice, what do you think?
Don's going to love it.
And he can repurpose this basket for so many things.
Picnics, an herb garden.
He could put it on the front of his bike and drive around with a little dog in there.
Lowell, you want the basket after he's done?
If you could put a good word in, I'd appreciate it.
Hey, Lowell.
Backstabber.
What's this?
Oh, yeah, that came for you today.
We don't know who it's from.
Eh, someone knows, but not the two of us.
"Dear Don, between us,
"you're my favorite Burns brother.
Lisa."
Why would she send me this if she doesn't want me at the meeting?
Great question.
Lowell?
Me?
Yeah.
Go ahead.
It's because she appreciates you.
I know what's going on here.
You do?
Mm-hmm.
She's into me.
Look at this stuff: wine, chocolates.
All aphrodisiacs.
This woman wants to lay with me.
What's that, now?
Yeah, that's-that's why she doesn't want me at the meeting.
She's worried she can't control herself around me.
She's a hungry bear, and I'm a pot of honey.
It wouldn't be right to yell at her now.
Yeah, you're-you're right.
He's right, it wouldn't be right.
Yes, I mean, uh, you can't yell at a woman in love.
That'd be mean.
And you're not mean, you're... a, uh... you're a...
- What is he, Lowell?
- Pot of honey.
You're a pot of honey.
That's right, yeah.
Yeah, okay, so you skip the meeting, I'll handle that.
And everybody will live happily ever after.
Right?
You take the things in the basket,
I'll take the basket, and it'll be like it never happened.
Thank you for volunteering to help me.
Rodriguez is out of her mind with this party.
Well, so just tell her it's too much.
Sounds like someone already got their daughter into the good first grade class.
Hmm?
I learned Spanish and picked her mother up from the airport.
Or aeropuerto.
Okay, well, I can't do that, so this party has to kick butt.
But, I mean, look at this list.
I mean, inflatable palm trees, grass skirts, virgin daiquiris?
Why don't I just resurrect Don Ho while I'm at it?
Don who?
Ho.
Don't get nasty.
No.
Don Ho was a ukulele player from the '70s.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Sometimes I forget how much older you guys are than me.
I worded that incorrectly.
Mm-hmm.
Wait, so Lisa McCaffrey's coming on to Don?
My husband has that effect on women.
Every time he leaves the house, it's like throwing a hunk of meat into an alligator pit.
I mean, some of this is my fault.
There I was, parading around her in my khaki Dockers like a Chippendale.
I got an idea:
let's stop talking about this, and just build a mini-mall.
Hmm?
- Yeah.
- Well, hold on.
He can't act like nothing happened.
Don, you have to tell her that she needs to keep her horny mitts off of you.
What?
No, he doesn't.
Yeah, I'm with Marcy.
- What?
No, you're not.
- Ye-Yeah,
I mean, a woman doesn't write a guy a note like that if she's not interested.
I mean, is-isn't she recently divorced?
No, no, no.
It's been, like, three months.
Yeah, and now she wants to bounce back with a married guy, which is exactly how I'd play it.
Well, sounds like you put some thought into that.
Okay, everybody, just relax, all right?
She sent him a gift basket, not her underwear and a motel key.
Nobody needs to talk to Lisa.
Well, I think he needs to say something to her.
Don't you agree, Andi?
No, she doesn't agree.
Don't talk for me.
I thought you loved that.
I think you know I don't.
If I were talking for you right now,
I would say you love that.
Marcy, I-I think you're right.
I should let Lisa know that this pot of honey already has a mean, beautiful she-bear.
I'm gonna call her tomorrow.
What?
No, I don't think you should do that at all.
I think you should just let it go.
Drop it, choke it, put it in a sack, throw it in the river.
Nah, I'm gonna call her tomorrow.
Yeah, good boy.
Now, let's go home for your reward.
Ooh.
My she-bear's on the prowl.
You're a good husband, Don.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
If he calls Lisa, the mini-mall project is dead.
Why?
Because she didn't seduce my brother.
I did!
- So you sent Don a fancy gift basket?
- Right.
And for Mother's Day, you got me a Sausage McMuffin.
Can we stick to the problem at hand, huh?
Don is gonna call our boss and break off a relationship she doesn't know exists because it doesn't exist.
Okay?
And when that happens, the mini-mall is dead.
Well, then you need to do the right thing.
I agree.
What is that?
You have to keep lying.
Is this one of those times where you say one thing, but you mean the opposite?
Huh?
Like when you said you'd never bring up the Mother's Day McMuffin again?
Look, right now, you need to protect both Don and the mini-mall job.
It's time to double down, babe.
I like this side of you.
Okay.
Here's how you handle it, all right?
You send Don another note from Lisa and say, "We have to keep our feelings a secret and never discuss them, not even with each other."
Ooh, that's clever.
- Mm.
- Yeah... wait.
Should I be worried about how good you are at manipulating people?
What?
Honey, you're way too smart for that.
All this party stuff looks great.
Do they even have monkeys in Hawaii?
Well, I almost passed out blowing them up, so they do now.
We may have overdone it with the virgin daiquiris.
- There's a ton left inside.
- Good.
Later, we'll mix in some rum and celebrate Emme getting the good first grade teacher.
"Dear Don, we have to keep our feelings a secret and never discuss them, not even with each other.
I know you may want to, but you shouldn't.
Lisa.
P.S. Don't talk to me about this."
And I may be reading between the lines, but sounds to me...
This is just me...
It sounds like you shouldn't call her.
Well, no need to.
Right before you got in,
I sent her some flowers with a steamy note.
You sent her flowers?
Why would you do that?
Because I got to thinking.
Why would you do that?
We can't afford to screw up this mini-mall gig, so I need to keep her on the hook.
It's a dance, Adam, and you're looking at Beyoncé.
No, I'm not!
Lowell?
You okay?
Hiya.
What's the matter with you?
I must've dozed off.
I had a few virgin daiquiris.
They made me happy.
Then dancy, then sleepy.
I've been every dwarf today.
Oh, my God.
There's alcohol in here.
That explains a lot.
How can that be?
I mean, t-the label says "virgin."
What?
Oh... it's Tropical Virgin brand daiquiri.
It's not tropical virgin daiquiri.
Okay, the kids are still at assembly.
I have 15 minutes before they get drunk and I get arrested.
Wait, Andi.
What?
On your way back, pick up some tacos.
Oh, my...
Okay.
Good morning.
What are you doing?
I'm just wishing everyone good morning.
Yeah.
Okay, got to go.
I'm off to accounting, then HR.
What a bunch of stiffs they are.
Are those flowers for me?
Uh, no, no, different Lisa.
Oh, so, you're in my office with flowers for a different person named Lisa?
Yes.
Lisa...
Marie Presley.
Yeah.
I'm a big fan, yeah.
Is she in yet?
Okay, everyone, it's time to start our Hawaiian luau.
Yay!
No!
Is there alcohol in this?
Yes, but... the good news is:
none of the kids are driving, so...
So, because of you, fish tie guy thinks I have the hots for him.
Do you have any idea how unprofessional all this is?
I have a sense.
Look, I was just trying to keep the project on track and protect my brother's feelings.
Well, turns out you can't do both.
Then you know what?
I get that this investor meeting's important, but here's the deal:
either Don and I do it together or we don't do it at all.
And that's your bottom line?
Yep.
I'll walk away.
Okay.
I'm walking.
Here I go.
Don't try to stop me.
- You're barely moving.
- Well, I want you to get a good look at what you're losing.
Did you say something?
Nope.
Okay, look, I know business is business, but I have a family business.
My brother and I like each other.
Our brunches are very loud.
Well, I do appreciate your loyalty.
My therapist says it's good for me to be around people who experience real human emotions.
Had to have a therapist tell you that, huh?
Well, things have been quiet at my house since my mom moved out.
Yeah, I didn't just fire her, I also evicted her.
Ouch.
Tell you what:
because you guys are the best in the business, if we never have to talk about this ever again, we're good.
And Don can come to the meeting.
Thank you.
And don't worry, this is definitely over.
Look, baby, we got to call this thing off.
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm just hanging.
This is my hang now.
Look, I tried to play this game, but I'm a one-woman man.
Fact is, I'm not Beyoncé.
I'm Adele.
I rock the house, but I don't dance.
Okay, you know what, I've had enough.
This is getting ridiculous.
Don...
Did you say Don or Mom?
Don...
I want you real bad.
But I can't have you, so please leave.
Listen, you're a special lady.
If something should happen to my wife,
I'll put you on the list.
Okay, good-bye.
Playing the mom card was cold.
You're a good businessman.
But don't let it happen again.
You already have two strikes.
Two strikes?
We have security cameras in the parking garage.
So I'm guessing Emme's not getting the good first grade teacher?
No, she's in.
All I had to do was promise that neither of us would be room parent next year.
You got us banned from being room parents?
Mm-hmm.
I have never been more in love with you.
Mm.
Will you grab that?
Mm-hmm.
What's this?
I don't know.
Read the card.
Okay.
"Thanks for your help this week.
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.
Love, Adam."
Aw.
It's a Sausage McMuffin.
You get it?
That's our thing now.
It is kind of cute.
And yum.
Wow, that smells good.
I should've sent two of those.
You're gonna have to fight me for it.
Well, you better start running.
No, no!
Give me that muffin!
Yeah.
- What's cooking?
- My mother's recipe...
- guinea-pig pie.
- Smells good.
You just accept that?
It's pecan.
How cuckoo do you think my country is?
It's come to this...
"What's cooking" and "smells good"
gets me in trouble?
Mom, you're already cooking for tomorrow?
Don't make a big deal.
My baby's graduating.
He won the award for Integrity and Character.
"No absents, no tardies,
"respectful to students and teachers alike."
My school had an award like that, but instead of a sash, that kid got a punch in the mouth.
Proud of you, though.
Why do all your stories involve a punch in the face, a shifty European, or a broad who's been around the block?
That reminds me of when I had to rough up this Italian kid because he didn't want me dating his sister.
She was no nun!
Jay, can you please take care of the steaks?
Sure.
On the eve of your big day, we're celebrating with rib eyes, and you and I are gonna have our first scotch.
- Really?
!
- Yeah.
I've been waiting to open a special bottle.
Huh.
Looks like the mice got into it.
Hello, hello?
!
Where's my son?
- Dad!
- Ha ha ha!
What, did he hop the gate?
You came!
- I said I'd come.
- I know, but you came!
How could I miss it?
Manny, the first member of my family
- to ever graduate from high school.
- Wait a minute.
Don't you have a brother in Colombia
- who's a doctor?
- Yes.
He just does orthopedic surgery, no brain or heart.
Think of it... tomorrow,
I will watch you stride across the stage with a sash, like a rebel's bandolier telling the world "No absents, no tardies."
Manny and I were gonna grill some steaks and drink some, um, beers.
Thank you, Jay, but if it's all right with you,
I would like to take Manny out for a special father-son celebration.
- Is that okay?
- Ah, sure.
I mean, he... made the effort to come.
Didn't have time to button his shirt all the way up.
But... go ahead.
Perfect!
The night begins.
But first... here.
Walk through this.
I know that smells terrible, but I've never seen that man get a mosquito bite.
There he is... the graduate.
I have one word for you, Luke... plastics.
I don't think he knows that movie, honey.
Mrs. Dunphy, you're trying to seduce me.
Okay, let's just give him the gift, all right?
Okay, but first, gather around, everybody!
Riddle me this...
What has two hands, is wound tight, and has a lot of ticks?
Alex?
Good guess, but no.
This was made in Switzerland, not in the Disneyland Hotel.
Awesome!
A watch!
We wanted to give it to you early so you could wear it to graduation today.
Yeah.
It's shockproof.
Oh, good.
You can show it your grades.
- I love it.
- What time is it?
Time for my little man to go out in the world and make his mark like the tiny trouper he used to be.
Hold on.
I'll be right back.
I remember when he was so small, we'd give him a bath in the sink.
Here we go.
Dad, we really got to talk about the crying.
When we graduated, you were a mess, and it was humiliating.
Showing emotion is part of being a sexy modern man.
Ask anyone who was raised on Alan Alda.
I don't think we have to worry about him going anywhere anytime soon.
He just installed a mini fridge and a hammock in his room.
Mom, Dad, you did all the hard work getting me through high school.
You deserve a gift.
But what do you get the Cadillac of parents?
A Rolls-Royce.
Oh, my goodness!
How did you afford that?
- It was only $2,000.
- Huh.
Judge Thompson, from the club,
- got me into a police auction.
- Huh.
If I had 40 more dollars, you'd be looking at a speedboat.
So, what do you think?
It's... it's wow.
- Right?
!
- I loved the macaroni necklace he made me in first grade, and I even used the perfume he gave me in fifth grade, but this car is so gaudy.
People are gonna think I played for the Knicks in the '70s.
It's the most beautiful gesture
I have ever seen.
It's 100% class.
Hey, Mom, didn't you say you had some errands to run?
Oh.
I... in a little while.
Uh, yeah.
But... um, gosh, it's got fur.
Wow.
It's like driving a lion.
Hey, before you go, give us a honk.
All right.
The horn doesn't help, does it?
So, I've narrowed it down to
Swiss Coffee and Whispering White.
But I can't decide between matte or satin.
I thought we landed on Eggshell.
We decided against Eggshell.
W-why don't we just sell the house?
Why don't we just paint the floor Eggshell
- since that's what I'm walking on.
- Okay.
- I forgot to give this to you.
- Oh, thank you.
- Have a good day at school, sweetie.
- Bye, sweetie.
It's fourth grade.
We're all just treading water.
What is it?
Ah, well, it's... it's from the principal's office.
Is she in trouble?
No!
She's... smart.
- She is?
- That's what it says.
Are you sure it's not for Lily Rosen?
You were at that science fair.
She brought that frog back to life!
This is for our Lily.
T-they're suggesting that she skip fifth grade and go right into middle school next year.
"Lily is testing far above her grade level...
- What?
- "... and we feel she would benefit
"from a more challenging curriculum."
Huh.
I know!
All these years we thought that she was, uh...
- God, what's the word?
- Different?
Peculiar?
Odd?
- Mean?
- So many words.
But... she was just really smart.
Holed up in her room every day after school, she wasn't...
- Plotting to kill us?
- I was gonna say daydreaming.
They... they want us to tour the school today if possible.
- This is so exciting.
- I know.
Our little baby's a genius!
You know, um, I also skipped a grade.
I'm not saying I was a genius, but...
Good, because we're getting along so well right now.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Mwah!
- Hey.
- Here you go.
Yeah.
- Thanks so much.
- Hey, guess what.
- They want Lily to skip fifth grade.
Traditionally, the person who says "guess what"
also gets to say the what.
Wait a second.
Lily's smart?
- Look.
- I mean, there's proof of that?
- Yeah.
Right there.
- Yes.
Huh.
They asked Alex to skip a grade, too...
- It's not a competition, Claire.
- ... but we felt... that it would be too much stress to have her with kids so much older.
- Good for Lily!
- Yeah.
I just always thought she was, you know...
- So did we.
Yeah.
- Us too.
Yeah.
How was your big night with Javier?
I overindulged.
- Booze or burgers?
- Booze.
I drank so much, I had an angry slap fight with what turned out to be a mirror.
Do I hear my Manny?
!
When you're hungover, it's like a car alarm.
Ay. iHola, papi!
Happy graduation day!
That's delightful.
I need your sash and your gown.
So that I can press it.
I don't want anyone looking wrinkly.
I don't mean you, but it's fun that you're right there.
I, uh, left them at school.
I'll run over there.
Mama, I have a stomachache.
And my ankle is broken.
And you can walk with your broken ankle?
I had a cousin got out of Vietnam that way.
Whenever Manny's getting a lot of attention,
Joe gets very needy...
"my head," "my arm."
In Colombia, we say,
"If it's not bleeding, shut your guinea-pig hole."
We actually do eat guinea pig.
Call me back, Dad!
It's an emergency!
What's wrong?
I kind of misplaced my cap and gown and sash.
Maybe they're at that strip club you went to last night.
Shh!
How did you know?
- It's all over your face.
- My shame?
- Glitter.
- Ohh.
Tell me what happened.
We picked up my graduation stuff on the way, and...
I don't know.
I guess the tassel got my dad thinking.
Why didn't you leave them in the car?
I didn't want them to get stolen.
And I may have taken it out to impress a certain Chyna with a "Y."
I think she really liked me.
I'm not gonna spoil that one for ya.
I graduate in five hours!
We'll get you another cap and gown.
That sash has been worn by every honoree for decades.
I'm not gonna be the one to lose it after it's survived earthquakes and wars and the lunchroom gravy fire of '64!
Fine.
Where is this place?
I don't know!
I remember there was a lot of brass and mirrors and loud '80s music.
Well, that narrows it down.
Wait.
Uh, it was by the airport.
All right.
We'll find it.
I'll take you.
Don't worry.
It'll be our little secret.
Thank you, Jay.
What happened to him?
I'm back.
We need to talk to you.
Sit down.
- What's going on?
- Don't say anything.
Just watch.
Baby pictures of Luke?
More than baby pictures.
You're gonna watch Luke grow up to sappy music.
Why are you doing this?
To get all the crying out of your system so you don't melt down at the graduation.
It's like when you drink too much and your friends get you super-wasted so you never drink again for the rest of the week.
It's the first time he saw snow.
Oh, here, Dad.
Thank you.
His baby blanket?
!
Why?
!
Hey, nice car, Grey Gardens!
It was a gift from my son!
Ugh.
What the hell?
Rawrrr!
You call that a tiger?
R-a-a-a-awrrr!
_
And we're very proud of our state-of-the-art computer lab.
It's so weird... every time I step into a middle school,
I feel like I'm 14 ag-a-in.
That... was on me.
He wasn't gonna do anything.
How much is his therapy costing again?
We used to think that was snark.
- Now we know it's wit.
- Yeah.
Uh, Mr. Peterson, we just want to be certain that this environment's the right fit for Lily.
We have a lot of experience dealing with accelerated students.
But if Lily really is gifted, then maybe there's another path... private schools.
Although, I do love the diversity of a public school.
- On the other hand, I do wonder...
- Okay, you know what?
We're just deciding if she's gonna skip a grade.
We're not charting out the next 20 years of her life.
Well, no, choices have consequences.
If we don't do this right, she could lose all interest in school and drop out, and the next thing you know, we're supporting her and her deadbeat boyfriend and our savings are drained, and then we have to sell the house!
Okay, why do all your meltdowns have to do
- with us selling the house?
- I'm just saying...
- We're gonna give you guys a minute.
- Okay.
Lily, do you want to see the computer lab?
This feels like a good time to tell you I'm adopted.
Maybe Claire's right.
Maybe it's too much pressure for her to skip a grade.
I did it, and I'm fine.
Uh-huh.
I'm sorry.
Um...
Hey, w-what does "uh-huh" mean?
Well, perhaps you're not the... best advertisement for skipping a grade.
So, wait.
You're afraid Lily's gonna turn out like me?
I'm just saying that maybe you skipping a grade put too much pressure on you, and it exacerbated your neurotic tendencies, and now you can't even make a tiny, little decision about, you know... paint.
Wow!
I can...
Y-you...
I don't have to just st...
Oh, you think you are so s...
You can't decide how to storm off, can you?
I am...
Luke's first haircut.
He gave me bangs.
Well, that's it.
Hopefully you're all cried out.
You remember when he hid that mouse trap under the pillow to catch the tooth fairy?
Dad, we got to start getting ready for the graduation.
Yeah, so maybe splash some cold water on your face and wrap it up.
Do you guys remember that "Luke Loves Daddy" rap?
♪ My name is Luke Dunphy ♪
♪ And I'm here to say ♪
♪ I love Daddy ♪
I thought you said he'd be cried out by now.
Dad, please, you really got to stop.
That's what he said when I was the tickle monster!
Ohh!
Mama, now my tooth hurts.
Well, I guess you can't have cake today.
What if it's my leg?
Claire, I guess I'm picking up the cake myself, because you didn't answer my messages.
Grawr!
Gr-a-a-awr!
Hey, Claire, are you having fun at the Gym Town?
As a matter of fact, I am.
This is my new friend, Charlie.
He loves dinosaurs, and tomorrow we're both gonna have pink eye.
Hi, Charlie!
Can you go and find the negligent adult that brought you here?
Oh, do you have to go so soon?
He smells so good!
Yeah, you're like two sniffs away from a felony.
What is going on?
I gave Phil such a hard time for being too emotional about Luke's graduation, but I think it's hitting me more than I want to admit.
I know.
It happens so fast.
Luke used to love coming here.
Today he gave us a Rolls-Royce.
The one outside is yours?
I thought I was gonna be able to meet Mr. Burt Reynolds!
You're lucky.
When Manny goes, you still have Joe.
Yeah, but it doesn't make it hurt any less.
We just have face it...
They're not boys anymore.
They're men.
Luke has a job, and he's dating.
He can serve on a jury.
God, that's terrifying.
I know.
Manny ditched us last night to go drinking.
He thinks I don't know, but I know.
He smelled like a sweaty peppermint.
I saw the pictures that he texted Luke from the strip club.
Is that where Javier took him?
Oh.
You did not know that.
I'm sorry.
But it... it looked like one of the classier establishments.
The girl that was sitting on Manny's lap had on a really cute top, at... at least in the first picture.
The one time that I thought that he was going to be a good father, and he teaches Manny how to be a dog!
I'm gonna kill him!
Hey, look at me!
I'm about to talk to a stranger!
Oh, yes.
This is it.
This is the one.
Ugh.
It wasn't this depressing last night.
The lunch scene in a strip joint is like a refugee camp with less hope.
Excuse me.
Uh, my friend left some personal belongings here last night.
Anything left behind...
- goes in the lost and found.
- There we go.
Thank you.
There's a jacket... glasses... hairpiece, I hope...
- What about my stuff?
!
- Nope.
There's a lot of wedding rings in here, though.
Sir, we're in a big hurry.
Have you seen a cap and gown and sash?
Gentlemen, put your hands together for...
Val the Dictorian!
She definitely looks like she knows stuff.
Credit where credit is due.
She put together a pretty solid act in very little time.
Can you just please help me get my stuff back?
Miss?
Miss?
Val?
Hi.
Heh.
Here's the thing.
The gown, everything...
He actually left them here last night.
I was having a tête-à-tête with Chyna.
She probably mentioned me.
Hope I didn't lead her on.
See, I'm going to college soon, and I... and I don't want any loose ends.
I'm in the middle of my act.
Sure, but the thing is he's got to get it back, so if you could strip a little more in our direction...
I'm such a screw-up.
Huh. "Integrity."
It should say "Perverted Schnapps Maniac."
Oh, God.
It smells like Miss Dictorian's perfume.
I can't wear this.
I'm a fraud.
No absents?
Oh, I've got one big absent... my soul.
Manny, you've spent your whole life trying to be perfect, and this is throwing you for a loop...
I get it.
But if you just look around this room, you'll realize people make mistakes.
You could do way worse than you did last night, and it ain't gonna change a thing.
So my advice... try to be a little easier on yourself.
Thanks, Jay.
Oh, God, there's Chyna.
Pretending to ignore me!
She's as transparent as her pumps.
James Earl Carter.
Have you seen my booboo?
Ohh!
Poor baby!
Mwah.
Nicole Ingrid Cortez.
Can you please move over?
I have to kill someone.
Charles Mark Coleson.
I hope that you had fun last night.
Oh, I did.
It was a magical time.
- Lucy Coleson.
- I can't believe that you...
Me either.
Look at our son over there, eh?
- He's perfect.
- Yeah, and then you come along
- and you expose him to all this...
- Me?
It was you who exposed him to so many amazing things.
You raised him to be a wonderful man without my help.
Every single thing that is good about him is because of you.
- Henry Coruthers.
- I'm sorry?
I'm sorry.
Thank you for being the finest mother to our son.
Hmm?
Damn it.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry about earlier.
It's not that I don't want Lily to be like you...
No, no.
Hey.
You're right, okay?
I'm an indecisive mess.
Of course I don't want that for her.
And for the record, I don't want her to be like me, either.
- Ohh!
- It's not like I'm exactly an overachiever.
That's true.
Yeah, you jumped on that one pretty quick.
If you care about what I think...
- ...
I want to skip.
- Jacob Marcus Dalton.
Are you sure, sweetie?
Because it's a lot of pressure.
- I can handle it.
- But what about all your friends?
- I mean, look at...
look at these kids.
- Phillip Thomas Darrow.
A lot of them have known each other since kindergarten.
I'll make new friends.
Kids really like me.
So... she's popular?
Brittany Willa Darrow.
Phil, I'm sorry I gave you grief earlier.
Today has hit me much harder than I thought it would.
It's okay to be emotional.
It's too late.
I'm all cried out.
It's like there's no more moisture left in my body.
I'm afraid if I blink, my eyes will get stuck.
Hmm.
Really?
Do you remember that video where the lion greets the man... and hugs him 'cause he hasn't seen him in 20 years?
Yep.
I sure do.
I am... dead inside.
Manuel Alberto Delgado.
Bravo, Manny!
Baby!
- Mwah!
- You did it, buddy!
Lucas Phillip Dunphy.
Yeah!
- Whoo!
- My baby, my baby!
Well done, son.
Remember how cute he was in his little Buzz Lightyear costume?
Or how he used to say "burfday" and "Li-bary"?
He still does.
This is... tearing me up.
Congrats, buddy.
Why does your gown smell like Haley's perfume?
This is a fun game, isn't it?
But you know what?
Maybe one where we just sat at a table...
Hey.
Hey.
Congratulations on the first of what I'm sure will be many diplomas.
Unless you want to skip all that and move to Colombia and become a radiologist.
Thanks for helping me with the cap-and-gown mess.
I don't know what I would have done without you.
I'm just happy you and your dad got to have some father-son time last night.
Yeah.
What?
It's just... with me graduating and everything,
I kind of wanted to say... you and me today, you know, that's what I think of as father-son time.
Let me tell you something.
After my divorce, my rule for dating was no kids.
And then you and your mom came along, and... all of that went right out the window.
What I'm trying to say is... here's to you, son.
You know, I'm still kind of hungover.
You're a man now!
Power through!
The thing is, we love the car.
We were so moved by the gesture.
So moved.
Hey!
I'm back!
I guess I just needed to rehydrate.
Ohh.
But we can't keep it.
Honey, it's just... it's too generous.
But I love you guys so much.
You're the graduate.
You need the car.
It's yours.
I don't know what to say.
How 'bout "nailed it"?
I wanted that sweet ride from the moment I saw it, but I knew my parents would never let me get it.
I also knew they'd never keep it if I gave it to them, so...
If there were any S.A.T. questions about tricking your parents,
I'd be going to college.
Come on, you guys.
Let's roll.
You guys leaving already?
- Yeah, we all have plans.
- Wait.
Lily?
There are nine girls who will freak if I don't make an appearance at Jenna's.
I'm confused.
I-is she fun?
Hang on.
Ooh, nice ride!
Bye-bye!
- See ya later!
- Bye!
- Oh, my...
Bye!
- Bye!
Oh, my gosh!
Luke is driving!
They didn't even stay for dessert!
Oh, God.
They're really gone.
It's so sad.
But isn't it what we hoped for?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
A toast.
We raised them to be independent, and now they're out in the world having their own lives.
We did it.
- iSalud!
- To us!
Oh, sorry I missed the first part, but I'll drink to whatever you're toasting.
Top me off!
Um, what are you doing?
Well, I'm just trying to see if there's anything else about Lily we haven't noticed.
Like... she plays golf?
No, we would know.
Aren't there greens fees?
- And what about this?
- Huh?
"La Dolce Vita"?
She likes Italian films?
Well, no wonder she thought "Ice Age:
Collision Course" was boring.
- I liked it.
- What else?
A photo of Lily shaking hands with the governor?
!
What?
When?
!
Okay, maybe we need to start paying more attention.
Or if it ain't broke...
- Yeah, she's fine.
- She's fine.
- What's cooking?
- My mother's recipe...
- guinea-pig pie.
- Smells good.
You just accept that?
It's pecan.
How cuckoo do you think my country is?
It's come to this...
"What's cooking" and "smells good"
gets me in trouble?
Mom, you're already cooking for tomorrow?
Don't make a big deal.
My baby's graduating.
He won the award for Integrity and Character.
"No absents, no tardies,
"respectful to students and teachers alike."
My school had an award like that, but instead of a sash, that kid got a punch in the mouth.
Proud of you, though.
Why do all your stories involve a punch in the face, a shifty European, or a broad who's been around the block?
That reminds me of when I had to rough up this Italian kid because he didn't want me dating his sister.
She was no nun!
Jay, can you please take care of the steaks?
Sure.
On the eve of your big day, we're celebrating with rib eyes, and you and I are gonna have our first scotch.
- Really?
!
- Yeah.
I've been waiting to open a special bottle.
Huh.
Looks like the mice got into it.
Hello, hello?
!
Where's my son?
- Dad!
- Ha ha ha!
What, did he hop the gate?
You came!
- I said I'd come.
- I know, but you came!
How could I miss it?
Manny, the first member of my family
- to ever graduate from high school.
- Wait a minute.
Don't you have a brother in Colombia
- who's a doctor?
- Yes.
He just does orthopedic surgery, no brain or heart.
Think of it... tomorrow,
I will watch you stride across the stage with a sash, like a rebel's bandolier telling the world "No absents, no tardies."
Manny and I were gonna grill some steaks and drink some, um, beers.
Thank you, Jay, but if it's all right with you,
I would like to take Manny out for a special father-son celebration.
- Is that okay?
- Ah, sure.
I mean, he... made the effort to come.
Didn't have time to button his shirt all the way up.
But... go ahead.
Perfect!
The night begins.
But first... here.
(spritzing)
Walk through this.
(chuckles)
I know that smells terrible, but I've never seen that man get a mosquito bite.
(singsong voice) There he is... the graduate.
I have one word for you, Luke... plastics.
(normal voice) I don't think he knows that movie, honey.
Mrs. Dunphy, you're trying to seduce me.
Okay, let's just give him the gift, all right?
Okay, but first, gather around, everybody!
Riddle me this...
What has two hands, is wound tight, and has a lot of ticks?
Alex?
- (laughs)
- Good guess, but no.
This was made in Switzerland, not in the Disneyland Hotel.
Awesome!
A watch!
We wanted to give it to you early so you could wear it to graduation today.
Yeah.
It's shockproof.
Oh, good.
You can show it your grades.
- I love it.
- What time is it?
(voice breaking) Time for my little man to go out in the world and make his mark
- like the tiny trouper he used to be.
- (sighs)
Hold on.
I'll be right back.
I remember when he was so small, we'd give him a bath in the sink.
Here we go.
Dad, we really got to talk about the crying.
When we graduated, you were a mess, and it was humiliating.
Showing emotion is part of being a sexy modern man.
Ask anyone who was raised on Alan Alda.
I don't think we have to worry about him going anywhere anytime soon.
He just installed a mini fridge and a hammock in his room.
Mom, Dad, you did all the hard work getting me through high school.
You deserve a gift.
But what do you get the Cadillac of parents?
A Rolls-Royce.
Oh, my goodness!
How did you afford that?
- It was only $2,000.
- Huh.
Judge Thompson, from the club,
- got me into a police auction.
- Huh.
If I had 40 more dollars, you'd be looking at a speedboat.
So, what do you think?
It's... it's wow.
- Right?
!
- I loved the macaroni necklace he made me in first grade, and I even used the perfume he gave me in fifth grade, but this car is so gaudy.
People are gonna think I played for the Knicks in the '70s.
It's the most beautiful gesture
- I have ever seen.
- (car door opens)
It's 100% class.
Hey, Mom, didn't you say you had some errands to run?
Oh.
I... in a little while.
Uh, yeah.
But... um, gosh, it's got fur.
Wow.
It's like driving a lion.
Hey, before you go, give us a honk.
All right.
(horn honks to the tune of "We're in the Money")
The horn doesn't help, does it?
♪ ♪
So, I've narrowed it down to
Swiss Coffee and Whispering White.
But I can't decide between matte or satin.
I thought we landed on Eggshell.
We decided against Eggshell.
W-why don't we just sell the house?
Why don't we just paint the floor Eggshell
- since that's what I'm walking on.
- Okay.
- I forgot to give this to you.
- Oh, thank you.
- Have a good day at school, sweetie.
- Bye, sweetie.
It's fourth grade.
We're all just treading water.
What is it?
Ah, well, it's... it's from the principal's office.
- Is she in trouble?
- (door closes)
No!
She's... smart.
- She is?
- That's what it says.
Are you sure it's not for Lily Rosen?
You were at that science fair.
She brought that frog back to life!
This is for our Lily.
T-they're suggesting that she skip fifth grade and go right into middle school next year.
"Lily is testing far above her grade level...
- What?
- "... and we feel she would benefit
"from a more challenging curriculum."
- (laughs)
- Huh.
I know!
All these years we thought that she was, uh...
- God, what's the word?
- Different?
Peculiar?
Odd?
- Mean?
- So many words.
But... she was just really smart.
Holed up in her room every day after school, she wasn't...
- Plotting to kill us?
- I was gonna say daydreaming.
They... they want us to tour the school today if possible.
- This is so exciting.
- I know.
- Our little baby's a genius!
- (doorbell rings)
You know, um, I also skipped a grade.
I'm not saying I was a genius, but...
Good, because we're getting along so well right now.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Mwah!
- Hey.
- Here you go.
Yeah.
- Thanks so much.
- Hey, guess what.
- They want Lily to skip fifth grade.
Traditionally, the person who says "guess what"
also gets to say the what.
Wait a second.
Lily's smart?
- Look.
- I mean, there's proof of that?
- Yeah.
Right there.
- Yes.
Huh.
They asked Alex to skip a grade, too...
- It's not a competition, Claire.
- ... but we felt... that it would be too much stress to have her with kids so much older.
- Good for Lily!
- Yeah.
I just always thought she was, you know...
- So did we.
Yeah.
- Us too.
Yeah.
- How was your big night with Javier?
- (groans)
I overindulged.
- Booze or burgers?
- Booze.
I drank so much, I had an angry slap fight
- with what turned out to be a mirror.
- (chuckles)
Gloria:
Do I hear my Manny?
!
When you're hungover, it's like a car alarm.
Ay. iHola, papi!
Happy graduation day!
(party horn blowing, laughs)
That's delightful.
I need your sash and your gown.
So that I can press it.
I don't want anyone looking wrinkly.
(chuckles)
I don't mean you, but it's fun that you're right there.
I, uh, left them at school.
I'll run over there.
Mama, I have a stomachache.
And my ankle is broken.
(gasps) And you can walk with your broken ankle?
I had a cousin got out of Vietnam that way.
Whenever Manny's getting a lot of attention,
Joe gets very needy...
"my head," "my arm."
In Colombia, we say,
"If it's not bleeding, shut your guinea-pig hole."
We actually do eat guinea pig.
(beep)
Call me back, Dad!
It's an emergency!
What's wrong?
I kind of misplaced my cap and gown and sash.
Maybe they're at that strip club you went to last night.
Shh!
How did you know?
- It's all over your face.
- My shame?
- Glitter.
- Ohh.
Tell me what happened.
We picked up my graduation stuff on the way, and...
I don't know.
I guess the tassel got my dad thinking.
Why didn't you leave them in the car?
I didn't want them to get stolen.
And I may have taken it out to impress a certain Chyna with a "Y."
I think she really liked me.
I'm not gonna spoil that one for ya.
I graduate in five hours!
We'll get you another cap and gown.
That sash has been worn by every honoree for decades.
I'm not gonna be the one to lose it after it's survived earthquakes and wars and the lunchroom gravy fire of '64!
Fine.
Where is this place?
I don't know!
I remember there was a lot of brass and mirrors and loud '80s music.
Well, that narrows it down.
Wait.
Uh, it was by the airport.
All right.
We'll find it.
I'll take you.
Don't worry.
It'll be our little secret.
Thank you, Jay.
(sighs)
What happened to him?
I'm back.
We need to talk to you.
Sit down.
- What's going on?
- Don't say anything.
- Just watch.
- (tender music plays)
Baby pictures of Luke?
More than baby pictures.
You're gonna watch Luke grow up to sappy music.
Why are you doing this?
To get all the crying out of your system so you don't melt down at the graduation.
It's like when you drink too much and your friends get you super-wasted so you never drink again for the rest of the week.
(voice breaking) It's the first time he saw snow.
Oh, here, Dad.
Thank you.
(crying) His baby blanket?
!
Why?
!
(sobs)
Hey, nice car, Grey Gardens!
It was a gift from my son!
Ugh.
What the hell?
(sighs)
(tapping on glass)
(muffled) Rawrrr!
You call that a tiger?
R-a-a-a-awrrr!
_
And we're very proud of our state-of-the-art computer lab.
It's so weird... every time I step into a middle school,
I feel like I'm 14 (shudders) ag-a-in.
That... was on me.
He wasn't gonna do anything.
- How much is his therapy costing again?
- (sighs)
We used to think that was snark.
- Now we know it's wit.
- Yeah.
Uh, Mr. Peterson, we just want to be certain that this environment's the right fit for Lily.
We have a lot of experience dealing with accelerated students.
But if Lily really is gifted, then maybe there's another path... private schools.
Although, I do love the diversity of a public school.
- On the other hand, I do wonder...
- Okay, you know what?
We're just deciding if she's gonna skip a grade.
We're not charting out the next 20 years of her life.
Well, no, choices have consequences.
If we don't do this right, she could lose all interest in school and drop out, and the next thing you know, we're supporting her and her deadbeat boyfriend and our savings are drained, and then we have to sell the house!
Okay, why do all your meltdowns have to do
- with us selling the house?
- I'm just saying...
- We're gonna give you guys a minute.
- Okay.
Lily, do you want to see the computer lab?
This feels like a good time to tell you I'm adopted.
Maybe Claire's right.
Maybe it's too much pressure for her to skip a grade.
I did it, and I'm fine.
Uh-huh.
I'm sorry.
Um...
Hey, w-what does "uh-huh" mean?
Well, perhaps you're not the... best advertisement for skipping a grade.
So, wait.
You're afraid Lily's gonna turn out like me?
I'm just saying that maybe you skipping a grade put too much pressure on you, and it exacerbated your neurotic tendencies, and now you can't even make a tiny, little decision about, you know... paint.
Wow!
I can...
Y-you...
I don't have to just st...
Oh, you think you are so s...
You can't decide how to storm off, can you?
(exhales sharply) I am... (somber music plays)
(crying) Luke's first haircut.
He gave me bangs.
- Well, that's it.
- (music shuts off)
Hopefully you're all cried out.
You remember when he hid that mouse trap under the pillow to catch the tooth fairy?
(sobs)
Dad, we got to start getting ready for the graduation.
Yeah, so maybe splash some cold water on your face and wrap it up.
Do you guys remember that "Luke Loves Daddy" rap?
(rapping) ♪ My name is Luke Dunphy ♪
♪ And I'm here to say ♪
♪ I love Daddy ♪
(sobs)
I thought you said he'd be cried out by now.
Dad, please, you really got to stop.
That's what he said when I was the tickle monster!
(sobbing loudly)
Ohh!
(sobbing continues)
Mama, now my tooth hurts.
Well, I guess you can't have cake today.
What if it's my leg?
Claire, I guess I'm picking up the cake myself, because you didn't answer my messages.
Claire:
Grawr!
Gr-a-a-awr!
Hey, Claire, are you having fun at the Gym Town?
As a matter of fact, I am.
This is my new friend, Charlie.
He loves dinosaurs, and tomorrow we're both gonna have pink eye.
Hi, Charlie!
Can you go and find the negligent adult that brought you here?
Oh, do you have to go so soon?
He smells so good!
Yeah, you're like two sniffs away from a felony.
(sighs)
What is going on?
I gave Phil such a hard time for being too emotional about Luke's graduation, but I think it's hitting me more than I want to admit.
I know.
It happens so fast.
Luke used to love coming here.
Today he gave us a Rolls-Royce.
The one outside is yours?
I thought I was gonna be able to meet Mr. Burt Reynolds!
You're lucky.
When Manny goes, you still have Joe.
Yeah, but it doesn't make it hurt any less.
We just have face it...
They're not boys anymore.
They're men.
Luke has a job, and he's dating.
He can serve on a jury.
God, that's terrifying.
I know.
Manny ditched us last night to go drinking.
He thinks I don't know, but I know.
He smelled like a sweaty peppermint.
I saw the pictures that he texted Luke from the strip club.
Is that where Javier took him?
Oh.
You did not know that.
I'm sorry.
But it... it looked like one of the classier establishments.
The girl that was sitting on Manny's lap had on a really cute top, at... at least in the first picture.
The one time that I thought that he was going to be a good father, and he teaches Manny how to be a dog!
I'm gonna kill him!
Hey, look at me!
I'm about to talk to a stranger!
(exhales sharply)
(slow rock music plays)
Oh, yes.
This is it.
This is the one.
Ugh.
It wasn't this depressing last night.
The lunch scene in a strip joint is like a refugee camp with less hope.
Excuse me.
Uh, my friend left some personal belongings here last night.
Anything left behind...
- goes in the lost and found.
- There we go.
Thank you.
There's a jacket... glasses... hairpiece, I hope...
- What about my stuff?
!
- Nope.
There's a lot of wedding rings in here, though.
Sir, we're in a big hurry.
Have you seen a cap and gown and sash?
Man:
Gentlemen, put your hands together for...
Val the Dictorian!
(electronica version of "Pomp and Circumstance" plays)
She definitely looks like she knows stuff.
(sighs)
Credit where credit is due.
She put together a pretty solid act in very little time.
Can you just please help me get my stuff back?
Miss?
Miss?
Val?
Hi.
Heh.
Here's the thing.
The gown, everything...
He actually left them here last night.
Manny:
I was having a tête-à-tête with Chyna.
She probably mentioned me.
Hope I didn't lead her on.
See, I'm going to college soon, and I... and I don't want any loose ends.
I'm in the middle of my act.
Sure, but the thing is he's got to get it back, so if you could strip a little more in our direction...
I'm such a screw-up.
Huh. "Integrity."
It should say "Perverted Schnapps Maniac."
(sniffs) Oh, God.
It smells like Miss Dictorian's perfume.
I can't wear this.
I'm a fraud.
No absents?
Oh, I've got one big absent... my soul.
Manny, you've spent your whole life trying to be perfect, and this is throwing you for a loop...
I get it.
But if you just look around this room, you'll realize people make mistakes.
You could do way worse than you did last night, and it ain't gonna change a thing.
So my advice... try to be a little easier on yourself.
(man wolf-whistling)
Thanks, Jay.
Oh, God, there's Chyna.
Pretending to ignore me!
She's as transparent as her pumps.
- (applause)
- James Earl Carter.
Have you seen my booboo?
Ohh!
Poor baby!
Mwah.
Vice principal:
Nicole Ingrid Cortez.
(applause)
Can you please move over?
I have to kill someone.
Vice principal:
Charles Mark Coleson.
I hope that you had fun last night.
Oh, I did.
It was a magical time.
- Lucy Coleson.
- I can't believe that you...
Me either.
Look at our son over there, eh?
- He's perfect.
- Yeah, and then you come along
- and you expose him to all this...
- Me?
It was you who exposed him to so many amazing things.
You raised him to be a wonderful man without my help.
Every single thing that is good about him is because of you.
- Henry Coruthers.
- I'm sorry?
I'm sorry.
Thank you for being the finest mother to our son.
Hmm?
Damn it.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry about earlier.
It's not that I don't want Lily to be like you...
No, no.
Hey.
You're right, okay?
I'm an indecisive mess.
Of course I don't want that for her.
And for the record, I don't want her to be like me, either.
- Ohh!
- It's not like I'm exactly an overachiever.
That's true.
Yeah, you jumped on that one pretty quick.
If you care about what I think...
- ...
I want to skip.
- Vice principal:
Jacob Marcus Dalton.
Are you sure, sweetie?
Because it's a lot of pressure.
- I can handle it.
- But what about all your friends?
- I mean, look at...
look at these kids.
- Vice principal:
Phillip Thomas Darrow.
A lot of them have known each other since kindergarten.
I'll make new friends.
Kids really like me.
So... she's popular?
Vice principal:
Brittany Willa Darrow.
Phil, I'm sorry I gave you grief earlier.
Today has hit me much harder than I thought it would.
It's okay to be emotional.
It's too late.
I'm all cried out.
It's like there's no more moisture left in my body.
I'm afraid if I blink, my eyes will get stuck.
Hmm.
Really?
Do you remember that video where the lion greets the man... (voice breaking) and hugs him 'cause he hasn't seen him in 20 years?
Yep.
I sure do.
I am... dead inside.
Vice principal:
Manuel Alberto Delgado.
- Bravo, Manny!
Baby!
- (Javier whistling)
- Mwah!
- You did it, buddy!
Vice principal:
Lucas Phillip Dunphy.
Alex:
Yeah!
- Haley:
Whoo!
- Claire:
My baby, my baby!
Well done, son.
(voice breaking) Remember how cute he was in his little Buzz Lightyear costume?
(voice breaking) Or how he used to say "burfday" and "Li-bary"?
He still does.
This is... tearing me up.
Congrats, buddy.
Why does your gown smell like Haley's perfume?
Claire:
This is a fun game, isn't it?
But you know what?
Maybe one where we just sat at a table...
Hey.
Hey.
Congratulations on the first of what I'm sure will be many diplomas.
Unless you want to skip all that and move to Colombia and become a radiologist.
Thanks for helping me with the cap-and-gown mess.
I don't know what I would have done without you.
I'm just happy you and your dad got to have some father-son time last night.
Yeah.
What?
- (liquid pours)
- It's just... with me graduating and everything,
I kind of wanted to say... you and me today, you know, that's what I think of as father-son time.
Let me tell you something.
After my divorce, my rule for dating was no kids.
And then you and your mom came along, and... all of that went right out the window.
What I'm trying to say is... here's to you, son.
You know, I'm still kind of hungover.
You're a man now!
Power through!
The thing is, we love the car.
We were so moved by the gesture.
(voice breaking) So moved.
Hey!
I'm back!
I guess I just needed to rehydrate.
Ohh.
But we can't keep it.
Honey, it's just... it's too generous.
But I love you guys so much.
You're the graduate.
You need the car.
It's yours.
I don't know what to say.
How 'bout "nailed it"?
I wanted that sweet ride from the moment I saw it, but I knew my parents would never let me get it.
I also knew they'd never keep it if I gave it to them, so...
If there were any S.A.T. questions about tricking your parents,
I'd be going to college.
Come on, you guys.
Let's roll.
You guys leaving already?
- Yeah, we all have plans.
- Cam:
Wait.
Lily?
There are nine girls who will freak if I don't make an appearance at Jenna's.
I'm confused.
I-is she fun?
Hang on.

Suspect was covered in blood, armed with this.
Claimed he was NCIS, but no credentials.
Said he was working undercover.
I had to take him into custody.
Is he one of yours?
So they tell me.
You did the right thing, Pete.
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.
Pride.
We met over MTAC.
Nick Torres.
You make quite a first impression, Nick Torres.
Less than two hours in my city, and you get yourself arrested as a suspected murderer.
(whistles) That's got to be some kind of record.
(chuckles)
I got an explanation.
Yeah, you and Special Agent McGee were sent to New Orleans to recover stolen Intel, yes?
Yes.
It's called the Playbook.
It's a collection of scenarios for viable terrorist attacks against the U.S.
Stolen from Homeland Security.
I...
That much I know.
What I don't know is why you ran an operation without checking in first.
Tracking down a former contact of my undercover days.
That would be the murder victim.
Ferdinand Pisco.
Venezuelan operative.
Uh, he's in town to acquire the Playbook.
Had to handle it, um... delicately.
Ah.
That word must have a different meaning up in D.C.
But down here, in New Orleans, at Mardi Gras,
NCIS likes to keep a lower profile.
Pride, I was supposed to check in.
That's on me.
But all I did was follow the guy.
Someone else killed him.
Probably to make sure
Ferdinand didn't get the Playbook.
Probably.
Mm-hmm.
We have to find out who.
And here's a silly question-- um... you think you could take these, uh, handcuffs off me now?
Haven't decided yet.
Pride, I'm telling you, my second impression is so much better than the first.
One can only hope.
Loretta.
Dwayne.
This is not exactly how I expected to spend the weekend before Mardi Gras.
Imagine it wasn't how Ferdinand Pisco expected it would go either.
I don't think he even realized he was injured until it was too late.
It's a single stab wound, as far as I can tell.
Maximum damage in minimum time.
Anything on the killer?
GREGORIO:
Oh, yeah.
Spoke to multiple witnesses who positively I.D.'d the suspect.
Unfortunately, they all described him.
Nick Torres.
How you doing?
I'm Gregorio.
I'd be better if you had more on the murder suspect than just "wearing a harlequin costume."
So embarrassing.
I had no idea that was a common fashion statement here.
Krewe of Commedia.
They had their annual party here.
Uh, crew of what now?
It's a New Orleans thing I'm still not clear on.
It means there were over a hundred Harlequins dressed like that last night.
NOPD's interviewing as many as they can round up.
Anyone who can kill like this had an escape route-- long gone.
Oh, man, that's so gross.
What you got there, Sebastian?
Victim's cell phone.
And probably a case of hep C, considering this gutter I just pulled it out of.
I'm gonna need to go home and take, like, a long Silkwood shower.
Looks water damaged.
Can you retrieve the data?
Oh, yeah, I'm on it.
Gregorio, check surveillance.
We need something more on our killer other than he looks like
Torres here.
Mm-hmm.
So, Ferdinand was here to meet up with whoever stole the Playbook.
Any update on who that might be?
That would be McGee's department.
Where's McGee?
It is absolutely crazy out there.
(Sonja laughs)
LASALLE:
Agent McGee, finally in New Orleans.
How you doing?
And your first Mardi Gras in the quarter.
I see you've already caught on to the New Orleans vibe.
Day drinking is step one.
I-I am not day drinking.
Someone forced this into my hand.
Yeah, if you say so, glitter boo.
(laughs)
I do, uh, come bearing gifts, however.
Can I use your computer?
Absolutely.
Been tracking the digital trail of whoever stole the Playbook in the first place.
They've been making some moves the last couple days.
Yeah?
What kind of moves?
McGEE:
NSA's had an uptick in their chatter about the Playbook.
Thief is putting it up for auction.
It's going to the highest bidder.
SONJA:
So multiple bad actors from all over the globe trying to make a bid.
Timothy McGee.
Make yourself at home.
Hey.
How are you?
Good.
Morning.
So, New Orleans at Mardi Gras is perfect for an auction like this.
Million visitors in the city, half of them in masks.
Easy to slip in and out without being seen.
Well, then let's hit the streets.
Let's get that Playbook back.
Uh, you're not hitting anything after last night.
Hey, I took initiative to (phone ringing) contact Ferdinand Pisco.
I'm not the reason the operation went sour.
I'm not the one you need to convince.
Hey, boss.
Yeah.
He's right here.
Actually, he wants to talk to Pride.
Are you holding up okay, Dwayne?
Wish Homeland's mess hadn't ended up in our backyard, but we'll deal with it.
Got backup available if you want it.
More agents means more questions.
I want to keep this contained.
That's gonna be hard to do.
We've got a rogue's gallery of international operatives descending on New Orleans.
Every agency in D.C. wants in.
I just got through hand-holding the FBI on the Javier Garcia case.
Don't need a sequel.
Roger that.
I'll run interference.
Appreciate it, Jethro.
You always had a gentler way with the suits.
(laughs)
Sorry, that wasn't a joke?
Send Torres in.
We need to talk.
You got it, boss.
McGee.
Yeah, boss?
What is that around your neck?
Oh, uh, they're beads.
It's a festive thing.
Trying to get into the--
Never mind.
Wrong door.
(scanner beeps)
(chuckles)
So I was able to retrieve data off of Ferdinand Pisco's busted cell phone.
- What'd you get?
- Texts.
He was, uh, communicating with whoever stole the Playbook.
They were supposed to meet in the Quarter.
Yeah, someone killed Pisco before the meeting took place.
Well, able to get us anything on Pisco or the thief from the texts?
No.
But I was able to trace the serial number from the phone, and it was one of five burner phones purchased together at an airport kiosk a few days ago.
Five phones can mean five buyers.
All we have to do is track the phones, and we find all the buyers.
Tracking the phones isn't that easy.
Can't you just trace the ping from the cellular towers and triangulate or whatever?
No, it's-it's 2017 now, Sonja.
The era of the ping is long gone.
Even cheap burner phones are GPS enabled.
You know, the real GPS tracking expert is Patton, and he's off consulting JSOC on some online security issue.
Hey, you know, uh, I don't mean to brag, but I wrote an algorithm that is kind of a game changer in satellite circles.
- Geez.
- You're... you're, uh...
you're McGee, right?
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
I'm Sebastian.
I-I've heard so much about you.
Oh, you have?
Well, you went from tech support to special agent overnight.
Sort of a legend at FLETC.
At least, you know, to me.
It-it wasn't quite that simple.
But, uh, this is.
Oh.
Let me show you this.
All you need to do is enter the serial numbers.
(typing)
(computer beeping)
Whoa, this is, this is amazing.
There's no way that this is, uh, a rigid tracking algorithm.
No, no, no.
Rigid tracking's no good.
Satellite phones are always on the move, so this is a geosynchronous step track processing, with a little bit of pizzazz on the side.
Of course.
Yeah, makes total sense.
(chuckles) To who?
(computer beeps)
Oh, wait.
One of the burner phones just powered on.
Somewhere near Armstrong Park.
I'm getting the exact coordinates now.
Nice.
(band playing lively jazz music)
Got a lot of tourists and a bunch of drunks.
Not sure who we're looking for.
Any clues to help us out, Sebastian?
SEBASTIAN:
All I can tell you is that whoever is using that burner phone is actively texting right now.
Well, think I see our target.
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to turn around, put your hands in the air!
(grunts)
She's dead.
Stabbed just like Pisco.
It just happened.
Yeah, and whoever did it was just here.
(band playing lively jazz music)
According to DNA, this is Monica Grange.
U.S. citizen traveling under a Canadian alias.
Wanted in four different countries for ties to a Syrian terrorist group.
Yeah, been off the grid for years acting as a middleman, buying weapons, Intel, explosives.
Probably in town to bid for the Playbook, just like Ferdinand.
And just like Ferdinand, she got stabbed before she could make contact with whoever the seller is.
Two operatives in town murdered within a day.
Killer could be another buyer taking out the competition.
Easier to negotiate if everyone else is dead.
Well, Sebastian and McGee are tracking down the remaining burner phones and buyers.
GREGORIO:
Well, as for our killer, all we got is footage of the suspect running away last night.
PRIDE:
So how do we get the Playbook back?
Talk to me.
Monica Grange was corresponding with the killer before she died.
They were supposed to meet tonight.
TORRES:
We have Monica's phone.
I have a clean identity.
Set up a meet.
I'll go in in her place.
Seller's proven to be careful-- not gonna have the Playbook on him at the meeting.
Anyone but a woman shows up, seller could spook.
Well, what if I go in as Monica?
I mean, she's been off the grid, no current photo.
Seller will have no idea.
Seller will have every idea.
I'm sorry, but you reek of cop.
You trying to say I smell?
No, I'm saying that undercover work takes a certain flair.
Like the flair you had last night when you got arrested?
Oh, really?
We're gonna do that?
(phone beeps)
Look, all I'm trying to say is if we want to get the Playbook back quietly, then I'm your girl.
Gregorio's right.
Study up on Monica Grange until the seller reaches out.
I got to go to autopsy.
What'd you find, Loretta?
(sighs) Frightful symmetry, I'm afraid.
Both victims killed with a single stab between the ribs puncturing the heart, bled out within moments.
Probably didn't even realize they were stabbed before it was too late.
The weapon was thin-bladed.
Stiletto, most likely.
Killer's a skilled expert who can slip in and out of a crowd without being noticed.
Yeah, no sign of fibers,
DNA, fingerprints.
Trained intelligence agent?
Or an assassin.
Whoever the killer is, we need to contain him now.
A highly skilled assassin roaming the streets of New Orleans at Mardi Gras.
Dwayne.
Maybe it's time to call in the cavalry.
Well, if we do that, it won't just be the FBI coming.
Be CIA, too.
Yeah, and those guys suck.
Yeah, it'll be like the Wild West.
(monitor beeping)
Can't let that happen.
Sebastian, tell me you got good news.
McGee and I were able to hack the last three burner phones.
Means we can track their locations.
Yeah, well, we can do better than that.
We're gonna draw the buyers to us.
Send them text messages, pretending to be the seller, then sweep them up-- classic false flag operation.
And what does that mean, exactly?
I have no idea-- something that McGee said.
But it sounds really cool, right?
PRIDE:
Chris, Sonja, help McGee and Sebastian bring in the buyers.
And remember, any one of them could be our killer.
Need you to proceed with caution.
You got it.
TORRES:
That's the entirety of Interpol's file on Monica Grange.
It's barely a page long.
It'll have to do.
She's a lawyer by profession, so you're gonna have to pretend like you understand law.
Don't need to pretend.
I am a lawyer; went to law school before joining the FBI.
She's fluent in Arabic.
I'm assuming you're not.
No, but I dated an Egyptian once and learned a phrase or two.
You know, you're pretty cocky for someone that's never worked undercover before.
Oh, I've worked undercover ops before.
Yeah, well, I'm not talking about a couple of days of playing make-believe, take down a drug dealer.
I'm talking about spending years being another person.
So long that you...
(chuckles) you forget who you really are.
(whispers):
Fascinating.
But all I need is an hour or two to get the Playbook back, so...
And all you need is to screw up once, and this entire situation goes pear-shaped.
You know, I may not be fluent in Arabic, but I am fluent in body language, and it's killing you to ride the bench.
It's killing me to ride the bench.
You know, I'm not a bench guy;
I'm an on-the-field kind of guy.
Not much of a team player, huh?
No, this, uh... team thing has been pretty recent.
It's an adjustment.
I get it.
It's not easy being the new guy with a group that's worked so long together.
Yeah, I mean, inside jokes alone...
Yeah, and you're never fully confident that they actually need you, right?
It's, like, what am I doing?
Exactly.
Well, I'm gonna need you, Torres, 'cause I have no idea what I'm doing.
So let's just start there, all right?
(phone beeps)
It's the seller.
Meeting's at 8:00.
Sazerac Bar.
I'll let Pride know.
(mid-tempo music playing)
Not gonna want to do that, Sebastian.
Keep your eyes forward or on me.
Well, how-how will we know when the target's here?
Window reflections.
Got a security mirror up there.
There's about five other ways to know what's going on behind us.
What, I still got glitter in my hair?
No.
Well, yeah, but that's not it.
You're a nerd like me, you know?
But you're, like, this badass nerd.
You're so good at this.
Eh.
Just have more experience.
No, you-you make it look easy.
I just keep messing up.
Look... when I was a probie, I messed up all the time.
Okay?
I made a ton of mistakes.
But I was fortunate;
I had some key mentors that showed me the ropes.
Well, they must have been very patient and forgiving, then.
They were merciless.
Downright mean sometimes.
But you know what?
They always had my six, and I always had theirs.
(phone beeps)
Buyer's here.
The windbreaker, duck boots.
All right.
All right, I'll send him out to the alley away from everyone, so we can pick him up there.
All right.
All right, you zig, I zag.
What, now?
What's that?
Follow him.
Okay, yeah, all right.
(lively music playing)
Hi.
Uh...
I'm a federal agent...
Stop-stop resisting.
Stop resisting.
It's gonna be okay.
Just...
(man grunts)
We're all gonna be fine.
(Sebastian groaning)
What was that, like, a...
like, a Vulcan nerve pinch?
Mossad technique an old friend of mine taught me.
All right, we got to get him up here, get him in the car.
Yeah.
No problem.
Okay.
Kind of wish we didn't park so far away.

Yeah.
Guess she escaped, somehow got the Playbook.
Now she's trying to sell it.
Gregorio's made contact.
Well, hopefully, she gets the Playbook back before anyone else gets hurt.
Yeah.
Meanwhile, we've got two out of the three foreign buyers in custody.
Though ours isn't talking.
LASALLE:
Yeah, North Korean operative.
Just sits there like he doesn't understand a word we're saying, smiling and nodding.
You guys have any better luck?
No.
Although, oh, man, you guys should've been in interrogation to see McGee go to work.
He did this whole no-talking thing that completely freaked our guy out.
I mean, he ended up telling us his entire life story just to get McGee to speak.
So cool.
What?
You really like McGee, don't you?
Yeah, bit of a man crush, you ask me.
It's a total man crush, yeah.
Also, it's like looking into a crystal ball to see what I could potentially become.
You know?
I mean, McGee is basically future Sebastian.
Well, where's future Sebastian now?
He's in Patton's office trying to track the final burner phone.
No luck so far, though.
It hasn't even been turned on.
Well, two of the other buyers were murdered, so maybe whoever has the other phone is dead, too.
SONJA:
Or he could be the killer, take out the competition for the Playbook.
LASALLE:
Well, all we know about the killer is that he was wearing a Mardi Gras costume, and he's good with a knife.
I mean, we need more.
Well, that's what I've been working on.
So, we have about ten seconds of surveillance video from the night Ferdinand Pisco was killed.
I'm using a special computer program to analyze the suspect's gait-- stride length, height, measurements.
It can even predict gender.
Is this for real?
I'm gonna cross-check the results against our database, and hopefully come up with a viable suspect.
Yeah, well, keep at it, Past Sebastian.

SEBASTIAN:
Pride.
I just got a hit back on that gait analysis I was running.
What's gait analysis?
It's too complicated to explain right now.
Bottom line, we got an I.D. on our murder suspect.
Eva Azarova came back as a match.
Are you sure?
Program's not 100% accurate, but, yeah, I'm-I'm pretty damn sure.
Torres,
Gregorio's up there with our killer.
I got the room.
You cover the back in case she tries to escape.
TORRES:
Copy.
Gregorio, do you hear that?
Got confirmation that Eva's responsible for Ferdinand's murder.
I'm on my way, but you need to get out of there now.
Everything seems in order.
I'll reach out to my employer...
I know you're not Monica Grange, because I watched her die this morning.
I thought Victor may have sent you because you're definitely his type.
I don't even know who Victor is, but you got bigger problems 'cause you're pointing a knife at a federal agent.
Drop it!
Now!
(panting)
Pride, I got the suspect in custody.
PRIDE:
Copy that.
Almost there.
Pride?
You're NCIS.
Yeah.
And you're under arrest for espionage and the murder of Ferdinand Pisco and Monica Grange.
Well, you got me on espionage, but I didn't kill those people.
Oh, yeah?
Then who did?
(lights clack)
Same person who just did that.
(automatic gunfire)
You hit?
No.
Stay there.
PRIDE:
Gregorio?
You okay?
Two gunmen went out the balcony.
They have the Playbook.
Torres, two suspects headed your way, armed.
Torres, do you copy?
Agent Torres is unable to respond.
Who is this?
The man you'll be negotiating with if you want Torres back alive.
Ask Eva what happens if you don't comply.
I'll expect your call.
(engine starts)
(tires screeching)
Just got off the phone with Director Vance, who's ready to send the Marines down to get Torres back.
What do we know?
Not much.
Torres and the Playbook were taken last night by three gunmen in a black SUV at the Roosevelt Hotel.
Sebastian and McGee are trying to track the movements of that SUV, but it seems like it vanished into thin air.
This Victor's good at what he does, whoever he is.
Well, Eva seems to know exactly who he is.
It's like she was expecting him last night.
He could be the fifth buyer, responsible for killing the others.
Yeah, laying in wait at the hotel last night to grab the Playbook.
But Eva was there when Ferdinand Pisco and Monica Grange were killed.
Why?
It's a lot of unanswered questions.
Like, is Torres even still alive?
Torres is alive because Victor needs him as a bargaining chip.
GREGORIO:
Well, Playbook can't be opened without Eva's voice verification.
And Eva's the one person who might be able to fill in the rest of the blanks for us.
Let's go, Gregorio.
Keep digging.
I was hoping that my new friend would join us.
I didn't catch her real name.
That's too bad.
Never would have guessed that she was a federal agent.
Plus, she has a mean right hook.
PRIDE:
I'll let her know.
Right now, you need to tell me who Victor is.
Russian agent, vicious assassin, my mentor.
Taught me everything I know.
We think he's responsible... for these two murders.
Here we are again, Eva.
Yup.
You're accusing me of crimes I didn't commit.
But you did commit a crime.
You stole the Playbook from Homeland.
Sell to the highest bidder.
Never pegged you as an opportunist.
You're right.
I was using it as bait to draw Victor out.
Your mentor.
He recruited me when I was just a child.
He took me from my family.
He made me do...
terrible things.
He turned me into this.
Woman without a country.
I saw an opportunity to pay him back, 'cause I knew that he would come crawling out from under his rock if the Playbook was up for grabs.
It's too big a prize.
And then I would have justice.
Two people are dead because of your justice.
Victor has the Playbook and one of our agents.
You need me to get him back.
Trade me for your agent.
And we'll take Victor down together.
Well, problem is, the way you've acted... don't know how I can afford to trust you.
How can you afford not to?
Not sure we can take Eva at her word.
I'm sure we can't.
I know that look in her eyes.
She's hell-bent on revenge.
I get it.
If I had a chance to take down my ex-husband after all the crap he pulled, nothing would stop me.
We need a plan B to get Torres and the Playbook back safely.
McGee and I might have what you're looking for.
Hey.
GREGORIO:
Hey.
McGEE:
Got footage of Victor's SUV leaving the hotel late last night.
- Before it disappeared into thin air?
- Actually, it didn't.
The SUV passed a number of cameras while it fled the scene.
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, traffic cameras, security cameras, pedestrians' personal cameras...
If we can access that feed, we can piece together exactly where the SUV went.
We don't have the resources to consolidate footage from dozens of sources to find a single target.
The NSA does.
This case involves national security and international espionage.
I asked Bishop to call in some favors from her old bosses.
Yeah.
We track the SUV from here.
Lasalle and Percy, they're our boots on the ground while we gather Intel.
We're-we're gonna find Torres.
How legal is this, guys?
Well, strictly speaking, we're entering a bit of a gray zone.
One of my team was taken by a sociopathic Russian agent.
I say screw the gray zone.
We're with you, McGee.
If it'll get Torres back, get after it.
We need to buy them more time.
No way Victor's sitting around, waiting to get caught.
Well, there's only one way to keep Victor occupied while we search for him:
we need to put Eva into play.
I'll call Torres's phone.
See if I can make contact with Victor.
(phone ringing)
I was beginning to lose hope you'd ever call.
So was Agent Torres.
Is he all right?
He's fine.
I'll let you have him back in return for my agent.
The only reason you want Eva back is to access the Playbook.
Does it really matter, with Torres's life on the line?
I want to speak to him.
Speak.
Pride.
You okay, Nick?
Well, my allergies are acting up 'cause of all this drywall, but the view of the parade route from here, it's, uh...
No hints, Agent Torres.
Just say you're fine.
I'm fine.
I'll send a text where to bring Eva for the trade.
Once I have her, I'll tell you where Torres is.
No, no, no, no.
We do an even trade.
Terms are non-negotiable.
There's 50 ways this goes south.
That's optimistic.
I can think about 100.
(phone chimes)
He wants us at the Huey P. Long Bridge in 20 minutes.
GREGORIO:
Keep this very simple, and you don't go off book.
Understand?
Victor's gonna go off book.
He's gonna double-cross you.
That's what he does.
Yeah, well, that's why we have the tracking device.
Keep tabs on Victor.
Here I was thinking you were just looking for an excuse to get fresh.
PRIDE:
Lasalle, what's the update?
Good news and bad news.
Sebastian and McGee were able to track down
Victor's SUV till its final destination.
You got eyes on it?
SONJA:
Yeah.
It's parked outside an abandoned building in the CBD.
Bad news?
Well, the building's 30 stories tall.
Torres might be inside, and he might not.
It's gonna take time to search without alerting the Russians.
Yeah, well, time's something we're running out of.
Start searching.
I don't know about all this.
What, you worried about taking on some Russian spies who are probably armed to the teeth?
No.
But I hate stairs, and looks like we're about to take on a crapload of them.
Send Eva alone.
Two of you stay where you are.
Do what he says.
Be ready to take him out.
You'll be okay.
Eva, it's been too long.
Our turn now!
Where's Torres?
Once we're safely away, I'll text you the address.
Can't wait to catch up with you.
Play your cards right, you just might survive this mess.
(knife stabs, Victor grunts)
But you will not, Victor.
(panting)
What the hell did you just do?
Something I've been waiting for a long time.
You just killed the one person who could help us get Torres back.
You really screwed us here, Eva.
Victor's guys are waiting for his call.
Now they'll kill Torres.
He would've killed Torres anyway.
I did you a favor.
How's that?
I bought you time.
He would've slit your agent's throat the minute we pulled away.
GREGORIO:
Wait, Lasalle and Sonja are already near Victor's hideout.
We need to call them and give them the exact location so they can rescue Torres.
I got an idea.
But we're gonna need her help again.
(phone rings)
(speaking Russian)
She's stalling, but it's not gonna work for long.
What do you got?
I have a trace on the Russian's cell.
All right.
Connecting to the GPS.
Getting the exact coordinates now.
There it is.
Bull's-eye.
Guys!
Guys, we got a hit!
Okay, Sebastian.
Tell us where.
And tell us softly, please.
17th floor.
Northeast side.
You good?
I'm good.
What took you so long?
You do realize it was, like, 17 freakin' flights of stairs, right?
You know I had him, right?
Oh, yeah, you definitely had him.
Don't people usually just say thank you?
Oh, you're welcome.
LASALLE:
Should we leave him tied up?
Yes.
(lively jazz music playing in distance)
Special Agent Torres.
Glad to see you survived your ordeal.
Managed to get yourself in the game.
I told you I hate riding the bench.
You did good, too.
Not bad for a couple of new guys, right?
Well, it's not six months in an Ecuadorian prison just to set up cover, but, uh, yeah, not bad.
Shoving off in five.
(mouths)
Beautiful night.
It'll be your last for a while.
Right.
They don't have a lot of night activities in federal prison.
Yeah, well, you should've thought about that before your little adventure.
Believe it or not, this is exactly how I thought it would all end.
And it was completely worth it.
Getting revenge was worth a lifetime in prison?
Meeting you was nice, too.
Too bad we won't be able to get to know each other a little better...
Never say never.
(lively jazz music continues in distance)
You sure you got to go?
You're gonna miss Mardi Gras.
Hasn't this been Mardi Gras?
No, no, no, no.
This has been the lead-up to Mardi Gras.
Actual Mardi Gras day is when the city really goes off.
Oh.
You know what, I think I've had my share of New Orleans shenanigans.
Maybe next year.
Mm.
Uh... you think it's okay if maybe I call you from time to time?
Yeah, sure.
The way you, uh, just asked me made it sound a little weird.
Well, you know, I just, I might need some advice.
Get Future Sebastian's wisdom.
Okay.
But you got to stop calling me Future Sebastian.
The fact is, you are Past McGee.
And doing a real good job of it.
Ah, there you are, McGee.
I just dropped some food off with Torres in the car.
- A little snack for the road.
- Oh, appreciate that.
Thank you.
(phone ringing) Pleasure.
Listen, keep an eye on Eva, okay?
She's tricky.
You got it.
Jethro.
GIBBS:
Special Agent Pride.
You'll be happy to know I'm sending your team home mostly in one piece.
Eh, you pulled it off on your own.
Not bad.
I'm just glad we kept all of official Washington from flooding the city.
Yeah.
This time, at least.
Well, let's keep it that way.
What do you say?
Unless, of course, it's for a social visit.
Next time there's another party,
I might just pop down, surprise you, Dwayne.
This is New Orleans, my brother.
There's always another party going on.

Suspect was covered in blood, armed with this.
Claimed he was NCIS, but no credentials.
Said he was working undercover.
I had to take him into custody.
Is he one of yours?
So they tell me.
You did the right thing, Pete.
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.
Pride.
We met over MTAC.
Nick Torres.
You make quite a first impression, Nick Torres.
Less than two hours in my city, and you get yourself arrested as a suspected murderer.
That's got to be some kind of record.
I got an explanation.
Yeah, you and Special Agent McGee were sent to New Orleans to recover stolen Intel, yes?
Yes.
It's called the Playbook.
It's a collection of scenarios for viable terrorist attacks against the U.S.
Stolen from Homeland Security.
I...
That much I know.
What I don't know is why you ran an operation without checking in first.
Tracking down a former contact of my undercover days.
That would be the murder victim.
Ferdinand Pisco.
Venezuelan operative.
Uh, he's in town to acquire the Playbook.
Had to handle it, um... delicately.
Ah.
That word must have a different meaning up in D.C.
But down here, in New Orleans, at Mardi Gras,
NCIS likes to keep a lower profile.
Pride, I was supposed to check in.
That's on me.
But all I did was follow the guy.
Someone else killed him.
Probably to make sure
Ferdinand didn't get the Playbook.
Probably.
Mm-hmm.
We have to find out who.
And here's a silly question-- um... you think you could take these, uh, handcuffs off me now?
Haven't decided yet.
Pride, I'm telling you, my second impression is so much better than the first.
One can only hope.
Loretta.
Dwayne.
This is not exactly how I expected to spend the weekend before Mardi Gras.
Imagine it wasn't how Ferdinand Pisco expected it would go either.
I don't think he even realized he was injured until it was too late.
It's a single stab wound, as far as I can tell.
Maximum damage in minimum time.
- Anything on the killer?
- Oh, yeah.
Spoke to multiple witnesses who positively I.D.'d the suspect.
Unfortunately, they all described him.
Nick Torres.
How you doing?
I'm Gregorio.
I'd be better if you had more on the murder suspect than just "wearing a harlequin costume."
So embarrassing.
I had no idea that was a common fashion statement here.
Krewe of Commedia.
They had their annual party here.
Uh, crew of what now?
It's a New Orleans thing I'm still not clear on.
It means there were over a hundred Harlequins dressed like that last night.
NOPD's interviewing as many as they can round up.
Anyone who can kill like this had an escape route-- long gone.
Oh, man, that's so gross.
What you got there, Sebastian?
Victim's cell phone.
And probably a case of hep C, considering this gutter I just pulled it out of.
I'm gonna need to go home and take, like, a long Silkwood shower.
Looks water damaged.
Can you retrieve the data?
Oh, yeah, I'm on it.
Gregorio, check surveillance.
We need something more on our killer other than he looks like
Torres here.
Mm-hmm.
So, Ferdinand was here to meet up with whoever stole the Playbook.
Any update on who that might be?
That would be McGee's department.
Where's McGee?
It is absolutely crazy out there.
Agent McGee, finally in New Orleans.
How you doing?
And your first Mardi Gras in the quarter.
I see you've already caught on to the New Orleans vibe.
Day drinking is step one.
I-I am not day drinking.
Someone forced this into my hand.
Yeah, if you say so, glitter boo.
I do, uh, come bearing gifts, however.
Can I use your computer?
Absolutely.
Been tracking the digital trail of whoever stole the Playbook in the first place.
They've been making some moves the last couple days.
Yeah?
What kind of moves?
NSA's had an uptick in their chatter about the Playbook.
Thief is putting it up for auction.
It's going to the highest bidder.
So multiple bad actors from all over the globe trying to make a bid.
Timothy McGee.
Make yourself at home.
Hey.
How are you?
Good.
Morning.
So, New Orleans at Mardi Gras is perfect for an auction like this.
Million visitors in the city, half of them in masks.
Easy to slip in and out without being seen.
Well, then let's hit the streets.
Let's get that Playbook back.
Uh, you're not hitting anything after last night.
Hey, I took initiative to contact Ferdinand Pisco.
I'm not the reason the operation went sour.
I'm not the one you need to convince.
Hey, boss.
Yeah.
He's right here.
Actually, he wants to talk to Pride.
Are you holding up okay, Dwayne?
Wish Homeland's mess hadn't ended up in our backyard, but we'll deal with it.
Got backup available if you want it.
More agents means more questions.
I want to keep this contained.
That's gonna be hard to do.
We've got a rogue's gallery of international operatives descending on New Orleans.
Every agency in D.C. wants in.
I just got through hand-holding the FBI on the Javier Garcia case.
Don't need a sequel.
Roger that.
I'll run interference.
Appreciate it, Jethro.
You always had a gentler way with the suits.
Sorry, that wasn't a joke?
Send Torres in.
We need to talk.
You got it, boss.
McGee.
Yeah, boss?
What is that around your neck?
Oh, uh, they're beads.
It's a festive thing.
Trying to get into the--
Never mind.
Wrong door.
So I was able to retrieve data off of Ferdinand Pisco's busted cell phone.
- What'd you get?
- Texts.
He was, uh, communicating with whoever stole the Playbook.
They were supposed to meet in the Quarter.
Yeah, someone killed Pisco before the meeting took place.
Well, able to get us anything on Pisco or the thief from the texts?
No.
But I was able to trace the serial number from the phone, and it was one of five burner phones purchased together at an airport kiosk a few days ago.
Five phones can mean five buyers.
All we have to do is track the phones, and we find all the buyers.
Tracking the phones isn't that easy.
Can't you just trace the ping from the cellular towers and triangulate or whatever?
No, it's-it's 2017 now, Sonja.
The era of the ping is long gone.
Even cheap burner phones are GPS enabled.
You know, the real GPS tracking expert is Patton, and he's off consulting JSOC on some online security issue.
Hey, you know, uh, I don't mean to brag, but I wrote an algorithm that is kind of a game changer in satellite circles.
- Geez.
- You're... you're, uh...
you're McGee, right?
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
I'm Sebastian.
I-I've heard so much about you.
Oh, you have?
Well, you went from tech support to special agent overnight.
Sort of a legend at FLETC.
At least, you know, to me.
It-it wasn't quite that simple.
But, uh, this is.
Oh.
Let me show you this.
All you need to do is enter the serial numbers.
Whoa, this is, this is amazing.
There's no way that this is, uh, a rigid tracking algorithm.
No, no, no.
Rigid tracking's no good.
Satellite phones are always on the move, so this is a geosynchronous step track processing, with a little bit of pizzazz on the side.
Of course.
Yeah, makes total sense.
To who?
Oh, wait.
One of the burner phones just powered on.
Somewhere near Armstrong Park.
I'm getting the exact coordinates now.
Nice.
Got a lot of tourists and a bunch of drunks.
Not sure who we're looking for.
Any clues to help us out, Sebastian?
All I can tell you is that whoever is using that burner phone is actively texting right now.
Well, think I see our target.
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to turn around, put your hands in the air!
She's dead.
Stabbed just like Pisco.
It just happened.
Yeah, and whoever did it was just here.
According to DNA, this is Monica Grange.
U.S. citizen traveling under a Canadian alias.
Wanted in four different countries for ties to a Syrian terrorist group.
Yeah, been off the grid for years acting as a middleman, buying weapons, Intel, explosives.
Probably in town to bid for the Playbook, just like Ferdinand.
And just like Ferdinand, she got stabbed before she could make contact with whoever the seller is.
Two operatives in town murdered within a day.
Killer could be another buyer taking out the competition.
Easier to negotiate if everyone else is dead.
Well, Sebastian and McGee are tracking down the remaining burner phones and buyers.
Well, as for our killer, all we got is footage of the suspect running away last night.
So how do we get the Playbook back?
Talk to me.
Monica Grange was corresponding with the killer before she died.
They were supposed to meet tonight.
We have Monica's phone.
I have a clean identity.
Set up a meet.
I'll go in in her place.
Seller's proven to be careful-- not gonna have the Playbook on him at the meeting.
Anyone but a woman shows up, seller could spook.
Well, what if I go in as Monica?
I mean, she's been off the grid, no current photo.
Seller will have no idea.
Seller will have every idea.
I'm sorry, but you reek of cop.
You trying to say I smell?
No, I'm saying that undercover work takes a certain flair.
Like the flair you had last night when you got arrested?
Oh, really?
We're gonna do that?
Look, all I'm trying to say is if we want to get the Playbook back quietly, then I'm your girl.
Gregorio's right.
Study up on Monica Grange until the seller reaches out.
I got to go to autopsy.
What'd you find, Loretta?
Frightful symmetry, I'm afraid.
Both victims killed with a single stab between the ribs puncturing the heart, bled out within moments.
Probably didn't even realize they were stabbed before it was too late.
The weapon was thin-bladed.
Stiletto, most likely.
Killer's a skilled expert who can slip in and out of a crowd without being noticed.
Yeah, no sign of fibers,
DNA, fingerprints.
Trained intelligence agent?
Or an assassin.
Whoever the killer is, we need to contain him now.
A highly skilled assassin roaming the streets of New Orleans at Mardi Gras.
Dwayne.
Maybe it's time to call in the cavalry.
Well, if we do that, it won't just be the FBI coming.
Be CIA, too.
Yeah, and those guys suck.
Yeah, it'll be like the Wild West.
Can't let that happen.
Sebastian, tell me you got good news.
McGee and I were able to hack the last three burner phones.
Means we can track their locations.
Yeah, well, we can do better than that.
We're gonna draw the buyers to us.
Send them text messages, pretending to be the seller, then sweep them up-- classic false flag operation.
And what does that mean, exactly?
I have no idea-- something that McGee said.
But it sounds really cool, right?
Chris, Sonja, help McGee and Sebastian bring in the buyers.
And remember, any one of them could be our killer.
Need you to proceed with caution.
You got it.
That's the entirety of Interpol's file on Monica Grange.
It's barely a page long.
It'll have to do.
She's a lawyer by profession, so you're gonna have to pretend like you understand law.
Don't need to pretend.
I am a lawyer; went to law school before joining the FBI.
She's fluent in Arabic.
I'm assuming you're not.
No, but I dated an Egyptian once and learned a phrase or two.
You know, you're pretty cocky for someone that's never worked undercover before.
Oh, I've worked undercover ops before.
Yeah, well, I'm not talking about a couple of days of playing make-believe, take down a drug dealer.
I'm talking about spending years being another person.
So long that you... you forget who you really are.
Fascinating.
But all I need is an hour or two to get the Playbook back, so...
And all you need is to screw up once, and this entire situation goes pear-shaped.
You know, I may not be fluent in Arabic, but I am fluent in body language, and it's killing you to ride the bench.
It's killing me to ride the bench.
You know, I'm not a bench guy;
I'm an on-the-field kind of guy.
Not much of a team player, huh?
No, this, uh... team thing has been pretty recent.
It's an adjustment.
I get it.
It's not easy being the new guy with a group that's worked so long together.
Yeah, I mean, inside jokes alone...
Yeah, and you're never fully confident that they actually need you, right?
It's, like, what am I doing?
Exactly.
Well, I'm gonna need you, Torres, 'cause I have no idea what I'm doing.
So let's just start there, all right?
It's the seller.
Meeting's at 8:00.
Sazerac Bar.
I'll let Pride know.
Not gonna want to do that, Sebastian.
Keep your eyes forward or on me.
Well, how-how will we know when the target's here?
Window reflections.
Got a security mirror up there.
There's about five other ways to know what's going on behind us.
What, I still got glitter in my hair?
No.
Well, yeah, but that's not it.
You're a nerd like me, you know?
But you're, like, this badass nerd.
You're so good at this.
Eh.
Just have more experience.
No, you-you make it look easy.
I just keep messing up.
Look... when I was a probie, I messed up all the time.
Okay?
I made a ton of mistakes.
But I was fortunate;
I had some key mentors that showed me the ropes.
Well, they must have been very patient and forgiving, then.
They were merciless.
Downright mean sometimes.
But you know what?
They always had my six, and I always had theirs.
Buyer's here.
The windbreaker, duck boots.
All right.
All right, I'll send him out to the alley away from everyone, so we can pick him up there.
All right.
All right, you zig, I zag.
What, now?
What's that?
Follow him.
Okay, yeah, all right.
Hi.
Uh...
I'm a federal agent...
Stop-stop resisting.
Stop resisting.
It's gonna be okay.
Just...
We're all gonna be fine.
What was that, like, a...
like, a Vulcan nerve pinch?
Mossad technique an old friend of mine taught me.
All right, we got to get him up here, get him in the car.
Yeah.
No problem.
Okay.

Good.
Eva Azarova?
I thought we put her away last year for espionage.

Guess she escaped, somehow got the Playbook.
Now she's trying to sell it.
Gregorio's made contact.
Well, hopefully, she gets the Playbook back before anyone else gets hurt.
Yeah.
Meanwhile, we've got two out of the three foreign buyers in custody.
Though ours isn't talking.
Yeah, North Korean operative.
Just sits there like he doesn't understand a word we're saying, smiling and nodding.
You guys have any better luck?
No.
Although, oh, man, you guys should've been in interrogation to see McGee go to work.
He did this whole no-talking thing that completely freaked our guy out.
I mean, he ended up telling us his entire life story just to get McGee to speak.
So cool.
What?
You really like McGee, don't you?
Yeah, bit of a man crush, you ask me.
It's a total man crush, yeah.
Also, it's like looking into a crystal ball to see what I could potentially become.
You know?
I mean, McGee is basically future Sebastian.
Well, where's future Sebastian now?
He's in Patton's office trying to track the final burner phone.
No luck so far, though.
It hasn't even been turned on.
Well, two of the other buyers were murdered, so maybe whoever has the other phone is dead, too.
Or he could be the killer, take out the competition for the Playbook.
Well, all we know about the killer is that he was wearing a Mardi Gras costume, and he's good with a knife.
I mean, we need more.
Well, that's what I've been working on.
So, we have about ten seconds of surveillance video from the night Ferdinand Pisco was killed.
I'm using a special computer program to analyze the suspect's gait-- stride length, height, measurements.
It can even predict gender.
Is this for real?
I'm gonna cross-check the results against our database, and hopefully come up with a viable suspect.
Yeah, well, keep at it, Past Sebastian.
Yeah.
You're not at all what I was expecting, given who you represent.
♪ Oh, baby, we go together... ♪
Looking for a pantsuit and briefcase?
Or maybe an eye patch and a scar?
I don't know.
Just not you.
Hey, Gregorio, you think you might bring up the Playbook anytime soon, or is that a like a second date type of question?
Do I disappoint?
Not in the least.
Honestly, Pride, how long are we gonna go on with the foreplay?
Gregorio, you might want to give her a push.
Well, let's talk business.
My employer is eager to make an offer.
I haven't decided if I'm entertaining an offer.
Well, what else do I have to do to convince you?
Meet me at the elevator.
Where are we going?
My room.
And bring your drink.
'Cause it's the only way you're gonna get to see the Playbook.
I'll be on my best behavior.
Promise.
♪ But I wish, but I wish I was ♪
♪ Ooh, I wish, oh, wish I was... ♪
I'm heading up, boys.
One sideways glance, Gregorio, we shut this whole operation down.
Weapon on the table, please.
You, too.
Hmm.
Penthouse.
View of the Quarter.
Very nice.
Tenth floor, east side of the hotel.
You say the word, I'm on the move.
I didn't book the room because of the view.
Balcony gives me access to the roof.
Escape route if I need it.
Paranoid way of life.
Only way to survive in our line.
Gets tiring, though.
Why do it?
I've got my reasons.
Here's the Playbook.
Voice activation security needs my voice.
Have a look.
- Sebastian.
- Pride.
I just got a hit back on that gait analysis I was running.
What's gait analysis?
It's too complicated to explain right now.
Bottom line, we got an I.D. on our murder suspect.
Eva Azarova came back as a match.
Are you sure?
Program's not 100% accurate, but, yeah, I'm-I'm pretty damn sure.
Torres,
Gregorio's up there with our killer.
I got the room.
You cover the back in case she tries to escape.
Copy.
Gregorio, do you hear that?
Got confirmation that Eva's responsible for Ferdinand's murder.
I'm on my way, but you need to get out of there now.
Everything seems in order.
I'll reach out to my employer...
I know you're not Monica Grange, because I watched her die this morning.
I thought Victor may have sent you because you're definitely his type.
I don't even know who Victor is, but you got bigger problems 'cause you're pointing a knife at a federal agent.
Drop it!
Now!
Pride, I got the suspect in custody.
Copy that.
Almost there.
Pride?
You're NCIS.
Yeah.
And you're under arrest for espionage and the murder of Ferdinand Pisco and Monica Grange.
Well, you got me on espionage, but I didn't kill those people.
Oh, yeah?
Then who did?
Same person who just did that.
You hit?
No.
Stay there.
Gregorio?
You okay?
Two gunmen went out the balcony.
They have the Playbook.
Torres, two suspects headed your way, armed.
Torres, do you copy?
Agent Torres is unable to respond.
Who is this?
The man you'll be negotiating with if you want Torres back alive.
Ask Eva what happens if you don't comply.
I'll expect your call.
Just got off the phone with Director Vance, who's ready to send the Marines down to get Torres back.
What do we know?
Not much.
Torres and the Playbook were taken last night by three gunmen in a black SUV at the Roosevelt Hotel.
Sebastian and McGee are trying to track the movements of that SUV, but it seems like it vanished into thin air.
This Victor's good at what he does, whoever he is.
Well, Eva seems to know exactly who he is.
It's like she was expecting him last night.
He could be the fifth buyer, responsible for killing the others.
Yeah, laying in wait at the hotel last night to grab the Playbook.
But Eva was there when Ferdinand Pisco and Monica Grange were killed.
Why?
It's a lot of unanswered questions.
Like, is Torres even still alive?
Torres is alive because Victor needs him as a bargaining chip.
Well, Playbook can't be opened without Eva's voice verification.
And Eva's the one person who might be able to fill in the rest of the blanks for us.
Let's go, Gregorio.
Keep digging.
I was hoping that my new friend would join us.
I didn't catch her real name.
That's too bad.
Never would have guessed that she was a federal agent.
Plus, she has a mean right hook.
I'll let her know.
Right now, you need to tell me who Victor is.
Russian agent, vicious assassin, my mentor.
Taught me everything I know.
We think he's responsible... for these two murders.
Here we are again, Eva.
Yup.
You're accusing me of crimes I didn't commit.
But you did commit a crime.
You stole the Playbook from Homeland.
Sell to the highest bidder.
Never pegged you as an opportunist.
You're right.
I was using it as bait to draw Victor out.
Your mentor.
He recruited me when I was just a child.
He took me from my family.
He made me do...
terrible things.
He turned me into this.
Woman without a country.
I saw an opportunity to pay him back, 'cause I knew that he would come crawling out from under his rock if the Playbook was up for grabs.
It's too big a prize.
And then I would have justice.
Two people are dead because of your justice.
Victor has the Playbook and one of our agents.
You need me to get him back.
Trade me for your agent.
And we'll take Victor down together.
Well, problem is, the way you've acted... don't know how I can afford to trust you.
How can you afford not to?
Not sure we can take Eva at her word.
I'm sure we can't.
I know that look in her eyes.
She's hell-bent on revenge.
I get it.
If I had a chance to take down my ex-husband after all the crap he pulled, nothing would stop me.
We need a plan B to get Torres and the Playbook back safely.
McGee and I might have what you're looking for.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Got footage of Victor's SUV leaving the hotel late last night.
- Before it disappeared into thin air?
- Actually, it didn't.
The SUV passed a number of cameras while it fled the scene.
Yeah, traffic cameras, security cameras, pedestrians' personal cameras...
If we can access that feed, we can piece together exactly where the SUV went.
We don't have the resources to consolidate footage from dozens of sources to find a single target.
The NSA does.
This case involves national security and international espionage.
I asked Bishop to call in some favors from her old bosses.
Yeah.
We track the SUV from here.
Lasalle and Percy, they're our boots on the ground while we gather Intel.
We're-we're gonna find Torres.
How legal is this, guys?
Well, strictly speaking, we're entering a bit of a gray zone.
One of my team was taken by a sociopathic Russian agent.
I say screw the gray zone.
We're with you, McGee.
If it'll get Torres back, get after it.
We need to buy them more time.
No way Victor's sitting around, waiting to get caught.
Well, there's only one way to keep Victor occupied while we search for him:
we need to put Eva into play.
I'll call Torres's phone.
See if I can make contact with Victor.
I was beginning to lose hope you'd ever call.
So was Agent Torres.
Is he all right?
He's fine.
I'll let you have him back in return for my agent.
The only reason you want Eva back is to access the Playbook.
Does it really matter, with Torres's life on the line?
I want to speak to him.
Speak.
Pride.
You okay, Nick?
Well, my allergies are acting up 'cause of all this drywall, but the view of the parade route from here, it's, uh...
No hints, Agent Torres.
Just say you're fine.
I'm fine.
I'll send a text where to bring Eva for the trade.
Once I have her, I'll tell you where Torres is.
No, no, no, no.
We do an even trade.
Terms are non-negotiable.
There's 50 ways this goes south.
That's optimistic.
I can think about 100.
He wants us at the Huey P. Long Bridge in 20 minutes.
Keep this very simple, and you don't go off book.
Understand?
Victor's gonna go off book.
He's gonna double-cross you.
That's what he does.
Yeah, well, that's why we have the tracking device.
Keep tabs on Victor.
Here I was thinking you were just looking for an excuse to get fresh.
Lasalle, what's the update?
Good news and bad news.
Sebastian and McGee were able to track down
Victor's SUV till its final destination.
- You got eyes on it?
- Yeah.
It's parked outside an abandoned building in the CBD.
Bad news?
Well, the building's 30 stories tall.
Torres might be inside, and he might not.
It's gonna take time to search without alerting the Russians.
Yeah, well, time's something we're running out of.
Start searching.
I don't know about all this.
What, you worried about taking on some Russian spies who are probably armed to the teeth?
No.
But I hate stairs, and looks like we're about to take on a crapload of them.
Send Eva alone.
Two of you stay where you are.
Do what he says.
Be ready to take him out.
You'll be okay.
Eva, it's been too long.
Our turn now!
Where's Torres?
Once we're safely away, I'll text you the address.
Can't wait to catch up with you.
Play your cards right, you just might survive this mess.
But you will not, Victor.
What the hell did you just do?
Something I've been waiting for a long time.
You just killed the one person who could help us get Torres back.
You really screwed us here, Eva.
Victor's guys are waiting for his call.
Now they'll kill Torres.
He would've killed Torres anyway.
I did you a favor.
How's that?
I bought you time.
He would've slit your agent's throat the minute we pulled away.
Wait, Lasalle and Sonja are already near Victor's hideout.
We need to call them and give them the exact location so they can rescue Torres.
I got an idea.
But we're gonna need her help again.
She's stalling, but it's not gonna work for long.
What do you got?
I have a trace on the Russian's cell.
All right.
Connecting to the GPS.
Getting the exact coordinates now.
There it is.
Bull's-eye.
Guys!
Guys, we got a hit!
Okay, Sebastian.
Tell us where.
And tell us softly, please.
17th floor.
Northeast side.
You good?
I'm good.
What took you so long?
You do realize it was, like, 17 freakin' flights of stairs, right?
You know I had him, right?
Oh, yeah, you definitely had him.
Don't people usually just say thank you?
Oh, you're welcome.
Should we leave him tied up?
Yes.
Special Agent Torres.
Glad to see you survived your ordeal.
Managed to get yourself in the game.
I told you I hate riding the bench.
You did good, too.
Not bad for a couple of new guys, right?
Well, it's not six months in an Ecuadorian prison just to set up cover, but, uh, yeah, not bad.
Shoving off in five.
Beautiful night.
It'll be your last for a while.
Right.
They don't have a lot of night activities in federal prison.
Yeah, well, you should've thought about that before your little adventure.
Believe it or not, this is exactly how I thought it would all end.
And it was completely worth it.
Getting revenge was worth a lifetime in prison?
Meeting you was nice, too.
Too bad we won't be able to get to know each other a little better...
Never say never.
You sure you got to go?
You're gonna miss Mardi Gras.
Hasn't this been Mardi Gras?
No, no, no, no.
This has been the lead-up to Mardi Gras.
Actual Mardi Gras day is when the city really goes off.
Oh.
You know what, I think I've had my share of New Orleans shenanigans.
Maybe next year.
Mm.
Uh... you think it's okay if maybe I call you from time to time?
Yeah, sure.
The way you, uh, just asked me made it sound a little weird.
Well, you know, I just, I might need some advice.
Get Future Sebastian's wisdom.
Okay.
But you got to stop calling me Future Sebastian.
The fact is, you are Past McGee.
And doing a real good job of it.
Ah, there you are, McGee.
I just dropped some food off with Torres in the car.
- A little snack for the road.
- Oh, appreciate that.
Thank you.
Pleasure.
Listen, keep an eye on Eva, okay?
She's tricky.
You got it.
- Jethro.
- Special Agent Pride.
You'll be happy to know I'm sending your team home mostly in one piece.
Eh, you pulled it off on your own.
Not bad.
I'm just glad we kept all of official Washington from flooding the city.
Yeah.
This time, at least.
Well, let's keep it that way.
What do you say?
Unless, of course, it's for a social visit.
Next time there's another party,
I might just pop down, surprise you, Dwayne.
This is New Orleans, my brother.
There's always another party going on.

Great.
What's next?

The accident.
The accident was no accident.
SCOTTIE:
What the world knows... an ISAP plane carrying relief workers went down last night in a remote region of the Ural Mountains well inside the Russian border.
What the world doesn't know...
It was downed on purpose by us.
There were 17 fatalities.
No, there were 17 dead people.
- What's the difference?
- They were already dead...
John Does from a morgue in Estonia.
The crash took place near what we think is a secret Russian military base.
The reason we think but don't know is that the Ruskies are using some kind of ground-based signal to jam line-of-sight with our birds.
Since we can't see by air, we need boots on the ground.
So you downed a plane.
- Edgy.
- To avoid an international incident,
Russia has invited a go-team from NTSB to investigate in the hopes of ruling out an act of terror.
You and Tom are on that team.
You need to get eyes on that facility.
Any idea what we're gonna find?

Independence... population 216.
What is it?
During the Cold War, there were rumors that the Soviets built replicas of American towns to train their agents how to live like us.
No one ever proved they existed.
You know, a place to train sleeper agents made sense back in the day.
But today, when you can get a visa and send them to Disneyland?

You don't know the people involved.
Acquaint me.
They inserted agents at Three Mile Island, at O'Hare Airport before Flight 191 went down in Chicago, agents that were trained in towns like this to infiltrate America.
Then the wall fell, and the program stopped.
Mm.
Doesn't looked like it stopped to me.
No.
This new place is something else.
Agents trained not just to conceal themselves, but to... slivat'sya... to merge with their cover identities.
What does that mean?
I hear only rumors that this program is the next generation of what came before but even more dangerous.
People are afraid to talk about it, people who aren't afraid of much.
I need to get a look in there, Vadim.
It's important.
Occasionally, some of the new boys call me, ask for recommendations, agents or assets I may have had who are fluent in Russian or English.

It's a sleeper program.
It's one that trains agents, cuts them to look exactly like the people they're assigned to replace.
Oh.
- So it's true.
- What's true?
You know about this place?
Two months after your disappearance, your mother was in a terrible car accident.
Some thought she was trying to end her life, that the pain of losing you was too much.
She was in the hospital for four months.
After that, she was never the same.
I noticed the differences, but I assumed it was because no one is ever the same after the loss of a child.
It was only years later that I began to suspect that there was something more to it.
And when your mother learned of my suspicions,
- she tried to have me killed.
- You told me this part.
You came to suspect who she was working with,
- where her loyalties lie.
- I'm not talking about who she's working with.

The reason we think, but don't know, is that the russkis are using some kind of ground-based signal to jam line-of-sight with our birds.
Since we can't see it by air, we need boots on the ground.
So you downed a plane.
Edgy.
To avoid an international incident,
Russia has invited a go-team from NTSB to investigate, in the hopes of ruling out an act of terror.
You and Tom are on that team.

Intel indicates that whatever's going on there is specifically targeting the U.S.

And if she asks me to remove your head...
I'll do so without thinking twice.
So, let's get talking, or let's get surgical.
Who did Howard give that money to?
I don't know his name.
Howard never told me.
Then for the sake of your leather seats,
I hope Howard told you wherewecouldfindhim.
You made it!
Oh, my god, please tell me that's what I think it is.
Nana's tuna casserole, straight from the oven.
Happy birthday to me.
Come on.
Let me show you where to put it.
They offered me a full ride.
I could've gone pro.
The coach said I had the arm for it.
Stanley?
Hmm?
You remember Angela and David?
Uh-- no, I don't think we've met.
Of course I remember them.
She thinks I don't remember anything.
How was your trip?
Oh, great.
David's niece, joanne, just got married in boca.
Janelle.
And it was palm beach.
I think someone's had a little too much punch.
Well, I think weddings are forgettable.
Anyways, that's why we eloped after only three days.
Yup.
It was four years ago, in a blizzard, on February 2nd, the day of the hedge-- or the hog, or the, uh-- uh, groundhog.
It was, uh, groundhog day.
And, uh, the power was down, so I was bringing some ice cream out to the fire escape, 'cause it was melting.
And there she was, doing the exact same thing.
So we sat there and ate ice cream in the middle of a blizzard.
Uh, there was this moment when you...
Turned and looked at me, and you were surrounded by snow, and caught in the moonlight, and you smiled.
And I'll always remember it, because...
It was the moment I fell in love with you.
Based on the scale of downtown, we're looking at a community that's at least a square mile.
And grushenka's watching every inch of it.
There has to be an ops center.
If we can find it, we can figure out what's going on.
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ again?
How could you be so stupid?
You've been warned about this before.
I don't want to pretend anymore.
I just want to go home.
Don't do this.
Do what?
Act normal?
♪happy...♪
♪birthdayto you♪
hey.
Hi.
I thought you might want some company.
What are you doing?
Look, Cynthia-- whatever your real name is-- they can't hear us in here.
I know.
I'm not doing it for them.
No.
Stop.
I'm married.
We're not allowed to be married.
I know.
I lied.
Sorry.
You have a rash.
Oh, everybody does.
You do too.
What's this from?
No one knows.
If I leave now, they're going to see me and wonder why.
So don't get out.
I won't bite.
What's your wife's name?
Liz.
Tell me about her.
Your other wife.
Please.
I'm better now.
I'm afraid we both know that's not true.
No!
No!
No, please!
I can do better!
I can do better!
Please!
Aah!
Please!
Hey, Pete.
Going somewhere?
I've been transferred.
To America.
I leave in an hour.
Transferred.
That's great.
Isn't that what-- what we want?
Don't you get it?
I may not come back.
Chances are
I'll never come back.
Answer it.
Hello?
Lisa,thisis Mitchell withfirststreetbank.
I'mcallingto remindyou aboutourinterviewtoday.
Sorry about last night.
Can't really form attachments.
Stan, what are you talking about?
Sometimes you say the strangest things.
Nobody knows when they're sending us to America unless you know something I don't.
So where should we go for breakfast?
I'm famished.
Moved here recently, I see.
From Ohio, yeah.
What part of Ohio?
Canton.
Is that near akron at all?
It's about 40 minutes south.
You know anyone here?
Made any friends in town yet?
I'm sorry, what does that have to-- please answer the question.
No, I don't know anyone here.
You know...
I think you'd be a great fit at first street.
But the applicant pool is pretty...
Stiff, I'm afraid.
I would advise against that.
It's about who you know.
And since you need help meeting people--
Any more questions?
Just gonna grab a water.
Found the command center.
We should move tonight.
Uplink their system with Halcyon.
Yeah, and get the hell out.
My brother packed up and left this morning.
"Transfer," he said.
So they're moving them already?
Mm-hmm.
Any idea where they sent him?
No.
But he was terrified.
Don't drink that.
Why not?
'Cause I ran a six-minute mile and beat the hell out of a bank manager today.
We're being doped.
The rash.
How?
Something in the water.
Low doses.
Stimulant to enhance performance and lower inhibitions, relieve anxiety.
They want us compliant so we don't ask questions about this place.
How do you know all this?
Lisa, will you come with me?
If this is about the bank-- please, just come with me.
Do you know what this is?
No.
During the second world war, the red army carried these instead of standard tags.
It's an identity capsule.
A soldier's vitals are written on a slip of paper inside.
My grandfather's are in this one.
Hasn't been opened since it was used to identify his body.
A life he gave for Russia.
You know, most candidates react timid to that test, but not you.
You have an instinct that cannot be taught.
A capability.
I'm impressed.
You are needed for the next phase of our program here.
Wait.
My new identity?
Lisa's a real person?
This is Dr. Pirogov.
I'll be performing your reassignment.
She's a very close match, no?
She is.
Based on the target's medical files, we'll need a slight alteration of the mandible here...
And here...
And rhinoplasty to curve the nose.
Even I won't be able to tell the difference when we're through.
Are you ready...
To give a life for Russia and to take on another?
Whoa-ho-ho-ho.
You do not look like a man who should get behind the wheel.
Oh, yeah?
Who the hell are you?
Today?
Consider us your designated drivers.
"Us"?
You don't look like much for one of the agency's highest decorated non-official cover operatives.
James Bond borrowed my tux.
You know what I think?
I think somewhere under that 5h00 whisky stink, there's a sharp mind still at work.
I think that's why my husband paid you from a numbered account.
Yeah, I read about the funeral.
Forgot to send flowers.
Anyone can open the yellow pages and call a private detective.
Only my husband would hire a spy.
What do you want from me?
Same thing Howard did.
And I'll pay.
What was he looking for?
Not "what."
"Who."
Your son.
Surgery?
Like plastic surgery?
Yeah.
That explains the Tugenbergs' bandages the other night.
They're not touching me.
I like my chin.
It was my mother's.
Get down.
These people aren't being trained to impersonate Americans.
They're being trained to replace them.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Their command center's at city hall.
This is Cynthia stegner at 86 Maplewood drive.
I'm having an issue with my husband.
They made contact?
I'm into the crazy-town mainframe.
Tom patched us in.
Telluswhatwe'relookingat.
The names of real people they intend to replace.
Anelectrician,amechanic, aconstructionworker.
Why replace them?
What's the plan?
Wedon'tknow.
BobandLindaTugenberg?
I know them.
They're my neighbors.
Dumont?
We lost the link.
Dumont!
Tom, we got a problem.
Someone pulled the plug on their end.
I got nothing.
No, we have identities and addresses.
Go after the construction worker.
Get there fast.
Send a team to follow up on the others.
I'm there.
Take the tires.
What about Tom and Nez?
Alert the extraction team in Russia.
They'll be coming fast.
Our focus is the names on that screen.
We need to get to them before their doppelgangers do.
What the hell?
How much data you think Dumont got?
Not enough.
Well,well,well!
Iwonderwhoyou workfor.
MI6?
CIA?
Doesn'tmatter.
Fullofbullets, wealllookthe same.
Clear.
Oh, that's a shame.
Scottie baby, we got a corpse here, butnosign ofthepodpeople.
Sir?
Over here.
He left a note.
"At 6h15 P.M. today, we, the true nation brotherhood, reclaimed our freedom"-- blah, blah, blah-- "refreshing the tree of Liberty"-- blah, blah-- "rising against those who would hold us down..."
Hmm.
It'00.
Scottie, we got a suicide note here taking credit for an attack that hasn't happened yet.
Inadditionto thebody Solomonjustfound,
Robert and Linda Tugenberg.
He runs his own auto body shop in Linden, New Jersey.
She's a senior electrical engineer for the New York power authority.
They were both found with self-inflicted gunshot wounds by our team 11 minutes ago.
Andletme guess.
Suicidenotes taking credit for a crime that hasn't happened yet.
But what's the crime?
Peter Winstone.
He's a construction foreman with a company credit card.
He used said card an hour ago to purchase a large amount of dynex.
Ka-boom.
An electrician, a construction foreman with heavy explosives, anda mechanic.
They're building a rolling bomb.
I'm finding an online footprint shared by all three.
Message board postings for a homegrown militia outfit called--
Thetruenationbrotherhood.
This isn't about Russia attacking us.
It's about using their agents to make us think we've attacked ourselves.
With suicide notes and dead Americans to prove it.
The notes-- what time do they say the attack takes place?
6h15.
That's 17 minutes from now.
That's how long we have to find their target.
We need a way out of this room.
The extraction point is six miles away.
If they're gonna be on our heels, there's no way we're gonna make it on foot.
Maybe we don't have to.
They're gonna blow the door.
How about we blow it for 'em?
They're wiring those explosives with blasting caps, which are stable, but sensitive to stray electrical current.
I think 10,000 volts ought to do it.
Care to say good-bye?
First off, the stick?
I wasn't moved.
Youwannahonorgramps forgivinghislife formotherRussia?
We can arrange for you to do the same.
Oh, but before you go, we're Americans.
U.S. of "you have no idea what's about to happen to your tired, sadistic"-- all right.
She probably gets it.
Ready?
Mm-hmm.
Here we go.
Damn sirens are going to wake up the whole town.
Give me some over-watch while I hot-wire this thing.
Go.
What kind of man runs out on his family?
How'd you find me?
They have ways of tracking us.
Till death do us part, right?
Let's get the hell out of here.
You have a location?
An area, downtown.
The mechanic rented a truck this afternoon.
Rental company equips them with GPS.
We can track the truck.
Yeah, moving past Franklin and Broadway as we speak.
Get word to Solomon.
Okay, done and "doner."
It's like they want us to find them.
They do want us to find them.
Right.
If they're just passing Franklin and Broadway-- if they're posing as a militia, then they'll probably want to target a government building.
What's nearby?
State supreme court.
Bye!
I don't suppose it'd be too much to ask that you turn off the engine and drop the keys out the window?
We got 300 pounds of dynex in here.
Stay back or it blows.
Yeah, I don't think so.
Fall back, Mi Amigos.
I'm not really a negotiator.
I don't really know what people say right now.
You got so much to live for.
Think of your families.
I don't know.
I'll say...
That was a hell of a plot you guys almost pulled off.
It was elaborate.
So... elaborate.
But I bet you think this Van was not supposed to be the end of your life.
Am I right?
So why don't we keep it that way?
Nobody has to leave this square in a body bag.
Just hand us the detonator, and we can all go our separate ways.
What do you say, comrade?
I say, "screw you."
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I don't want to have to give the green light.
"Green light"?
Nice talking to you,
MiAmigos.
Hey, did you hear?
The, uh, satellites show nothing but a crater where the town was.
The Russians scrubbed the whole thing.
Scottie said she'll ask General Phillips to provide protection for every American we got off the drives.
They could still be targeted.
Hey, um, thank you.
You saved my life.
5-htp.
What?
The drug they put in the water destroyed your rem cycle.
Take 5-htp.
It's over the counter.
It'll help with the comedown.
How do you know so much about this?
After you've been a soldier-- wait.
No.
After you've seen what people do in war, they'll offer you every drug there is except the one you need to make it go away.
So you try all the others just in case.
How'd you get sober?
Howard.
This place.
He gave me a job.
He-- he helped me clean up.
He gave me a shot of something i--
I never tried before-- hope.
Do you wanna-- do you wanna grab a coffee?
Toast to a job well done?
Maybe next time.

Wealthy couple, a beautiful son, trip to ocean city.
Before he died, Howard hired someone to track down our son, Christopher.
Track him?
I don't understand.
I thought your son was dead.
I talked to the man.
He found a record of a child services in Wilmington, less than 20 miles from where Christopher disappeared.
A boy Chris's age.
Blue eyes, brown hair.
His name was Christopher.
A week after we lost our boy, that boy was brought to child services.
But you told me your husband was out of his mind-- that his search for Christopher was a delusion.
I thought he was.
Now I don't know.
But as the head of one of the largest intelligence operations in the world, if there is any chance he's out there,
I will find my son.
I'm telling you, she is coming for me.
Operation north star.
I need to know exactly what you found.
She knows about the investigator.
She knows that you hired him to find me.
She-- Tom, what did you learn?
It's a sleeper program.
It's one that trains agents-- cuts them to look exactly like the people they're assigned to replace.
Oh.
So it's true.
What's true?
You know about this place?
Two months after your disappearance...
Your mother was in a terrible car accident.
Some thought she was trying to end her life-- that the pain of losing you was too much.
She was in the hospital for four months.
After that, she was never the same.
I noticed the differences, but I assumed it was because no one is ever the same after the loss of a child.
It was only years later that I began to suspect that there was something more to it.
And when your mother learned of my suspicions, she tried to have me killed.
You told me this part.
You came to suspect who she was working with, where her loyalties lie--
I'm not talking about who she's working with.
I'm talking about her.
I wasn't going to tell you this until after it was confirmed, but I believe that Scottie Hargrave is a sleeper agent.
Wha-- n-no.
No, that can't be true.
It is.
And that program-- the doubles, the town, the people who ran it...
I believe that 30 years ago, they murdered your mother.
Care package entering impact zone.
30 seconds to delivery, sir.
So sorry.
I... tried texting.
It's fine.
He's paid for all night, so come in.
- Kat, this is...
- Trevor.
How you doing?
Yes, it's what you're thinking.
There are worse ways to mourn.
I could be sitting at home eating ice cream.
It's General Phillips.
He says it's urgent.
I've seen you somewhere.
- It's a big city.
I doubt it.
- In the paper, the cover of The Wall Street Journal.
You read The Wall Street Journal?
You were at funeral, looked really nice.
Whose funeral was it?
My husband's.
I should be back in an hour.
General Phillips.
To what do I owe this pleasure?
Operation North Star.
I'm giving it the green light.
Operation North Star?
The humanitarian workers, the plane crash...
I worked this out with Howard months ago.
Well, then, a plan is already in place.
Tell me about it.
The care package has been delivered.
Great.
What's next?
- You really don't know, do you?
- No, which is why...
We should postpone.
General, Howard's gone, and now I'm in charge of the company he built.
So whether I like it or not,
I have to stand out, stand up.
And I can't do that without therapy, antidepressants, and people like you, who Howard confided in... sometimes more than he confided in me.
You're unprepared.
So?
Prepare me.
The accident.
The accident was no accident.
What the world knows... an ISAP plane carrying relief workers went down last night in a remote region of the Ural Mountains well inside the Russian border.
What the world doesn't know...
It was downed on purpose by us.
There were 17 fatalities.
No, there were 17 dead people.
- What's the difference?
- They were already dead...
John Does from a morgue in Estonia.
The crash took place near what we think is a secret Russian military base.
The reason we think but don't know is that the Ruskies are using some kind of ground-based signal to jam line-of-sight with our birds.
Since we can't see by air, we need boots on the ground.
So you downed a plane.
- Edgy.
- To avoid an international incident,
Russia has invited a go-team from NTSB to investigate in the hopes of ruling out an act of terror.
You and Tom are on that team.
You need to get eyes on that facility.
Any idea what we're gonna find?
Intel indicates that whatever's going on there is specifically targeting the U.S.
That's it.
Howard didn't tell me about this operation with the Pentagon.
I want to know if he was hiding anything else.
You're one of the few people who knew that before Howard died, he went off his meds, that he'd become paranoid.
- I haven't told anyone.
- Which is why
I need you to handle this personally.
And confidentially.
I want an internal audit... every contract or financial transaction.
Leave no stone unturned.
I wasn't notified.
You are going to have to talk to my superior.
Come on.
Loo...
You have our credentials.
I'm sorry.
It's a restricted area.
Guys, we were invited here to do our job.
Now, we can only do that on our own with complete access to the entire debris field.
And if that's gonna be a problem, we're gonna have to call the embassy.
Take nothing.
Touch nothing.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me.
On my signal.
Fuel leak!
Fuel leak!
It's not secure!
Everybody back!
Okay, I'm on the move.
- Where am I headed?
- Northeast, over the ridge.
Half a klick to the clearing.
You're moments away, Tom-Tom.
Now make a left.
You get there, you snap some photos, and you get out before anyone misses you at the crash site.
- You find it?
- I found something.
Sure as hell isn't a weapons facility.
What is it?
Come on.
Don't leave the D-man out of this.
I don't know.
I think you're gonna have to see this one to believe it.
- Hey!
- _
I don't...
I-I don't know what you're saying!
Hey, hey!
Why didn't anybody tell us there was an active fuel leak?
Now I got to report this to your superiors in Moscow.
So, what's over the hill and through the woods?
Grandma's house, if she lived in Topeka.
I guess we're not in Kansas anymore, Toto.
I wouldn't bet on it.
What's this?
A numbered account in the Dutch Antilles registered to an I.P. address matching Howard's computer at your house.
Did you find anything else?
No, except for a troubling line item listed only as "Iran-Contra."
- What was the account used for?
- I don't know.
Briar Metcalf might.
He's the one who set it up.
Briar.
Of course.
Would you like me to go see him?
Desperately.
But I need to do it.
Where are we?
Independence... population 216.
What is it?
During the Cold War, there were rumors that the Soviets built replicas of American towns to train their agents how to live like us.
No one ever proved they existed.
You know, a place to train sleeper agents made sense back in the day.
But today, when you can get a visa and send them to Disneyland?
What are they up to?
Should we inform General Phillips?
No.
Not until we know what we're dealing with.
Seems like maybe you already do.
I don't, but I know someone who might.
Hey, hey.
Men only!
I'll let you know if I see any.
I said I couldn't help you.
Yes, but you didn't mean it, not after Riga.
Please, don't push me on this.
You don't know the people involved.
Acquaint me.
They inserted agents at Three Mile Island, at O'Hare Airport before Flight 191 went down in Chicago, agents that were trained in towns like this to infiltrate America.
Then the wall fell, and the program stopped.
Doesn't looked like it stopped to me.
No.
This new place is something else.
Agents trained not just to conceal themselves, but to... slivat'sya... to merge with their cover identities.
What does that mean?
I hear only rumors that this program is the next generation of what came before but even more dangerous.
People are afraid to talk about it, people who aren't afraid of much.
I need to get a look in there, Vadim.
It's important.
Occasionally, some of the new boys call me, ask for recommendations, agents or assets I may have had who are fluent in Russian or English.
For assignment in Independence.
You don't want to do this.
I have two agents for you to recommend.
Listen to what I'm telling you.
I send agents in, but they never come out... ever.
I'll have two dossiers for you within the hour.
You think Scottie knows more than she's saying?
Every day of the week and twice on Sunday.
I hope you're a quick study.
- What's this?
- Your cover.
You and Nez are FSB agents being transferred to Independence.
Nez?
What about Solomon?
I have another assignment for him.
You're wheels-up in an hour.
Two hours.
I have an appointment.
Cancel it.
- I can't do that.
- Of course you can.
Clearly you don't want to.
Why?
Who are you meeting with that's so important?
It's personal.
Two hours, not a minute more.
She's doing a complete audit.
Tell me about Operation North Star.
Accounts, case files, everything.
The relief workers, the plane crash.
- Has she taken the contract?
- She knows you hid things from her, and if she looks closely enough, she's gonna find out it's me.
Let me worry about her.
You worry about the op.
Whoa.
What is all this?
It doesn't...
It doesn't matter, not now.
Look, if I'm gonna work with you, I need to know that you have a clear head, that you're not...
- that you're focused.
- I've never been more focused.
Says the manic depressive who's off his meds.
She told you that?
Clearly, you're not taking them.
Which is why I can see the truth, Tom, for the first time.
What truth?
Did you hear what I said?
She's looking into what you're hiding.
She is gonna find me out.
You're telling me that's not important, but some village in Siberia is?
Yeah, it's critical.
Critical to what?
To everything.
To the whole picture.
That's what she doesn't want me to see.
It's why she kept me medicated... to keep me from finding the truth.
You have to get on that plane.
You have to go to Russia and see this through.
From this moment on, you will only speak English.
No exceptions.
This complex was built on the site of a former missile facility.
Ground water was polluted.
Be aware of it.
Short showers.
Bottled water only.
No exceptions.
You will be given a new identity.
Study it.
Become it.
It is you.
Do not break character for anything or anyone.
You will be tested.
You will be pushed.
You will become someone new.
You will receive your assignment and will take our fight to America.
I'm Lisa.
I'm an unemployed bank teller.
And I live with my brother.
Who's in construction.
What fight could we possibly bring to America?
One no one will see coming.
Who are you?
I'm Stan.
I'm a janitor, and...
I live with my wife.
Hello?
Anyone home?
In here, sweetie.
I was wondering where you were.
Hey.
Hi, there.
- Sam, leave Daddy alone.
- That's okay.
Hi, boy.
I'm just finishing up the tuna casserole.
I'll need about 15 minutes or so.
You better change, or we'll be late.
Late...
late for what?
The Tugenbergs.
Linda's birthday?
Right.
I swear you'd forget we were married if you didn't wake up next to me every day.
Yep.
Smells great.
Don't even think about it.
Now shoo.
Go on.
Go put on the sweater I got you for Christmas.
Right.
The, sweater.
- I laid it out on the bed.
- Of course you did.
Along with your khakis and your penny loafers.
What would I do without you?
Honestly, I shudder to think.
Hey, I am on my way home now.
Open a bottle of Beaujolais and let it breathe a while.
Sorry, Briar.
You're gonna be late for that Beaujolais.
- Scottie, what are you d...
- Briar, if I were you,
I'd talk little and listen big.
I don't want Mr. Solomon to have to get bloodstains all over these aniline leather seats.
The account in the Antilles, the one you set up for Howard without telling me?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Howard was making secret payments to someone.
You would know who.
I want a name.
Effective immediately, you're out as CFO of Halcyon.
What you say next will determine if that's the worst thing that happens to you today.
Scottie, I would...
Honestly.
But Howard was like a brother to me.
You know, funny thing.
Most people think only men can be brothers.
I used to think that, too, until I stood face-to-face with my executioner.
Hand to God, I was a dead man.
And that part where you're supposed to see your life flash before your eyes, you know what I saw instead?
I saw the most beautiful pair of legs staying the hand of my executioner.
This woman, she's my brother.
Owe her my life, really.
And if she asks me to remove your head,
I'll do so without thinking twice.
So...
let's get talking.
Or...
let's get surgical.
Who did Howard give that money to?
I-I-I don't know his name.
Howard never told me.
Then for the sake of your leather seats,
I hope Howard told you where we could find him.
You made it!
My God.
Please tell me that's what I think it is.
Nana's tuna casserole straight from the oven.
Happy birthday to me.
Come on.
Let me show you where to put it.
They offered me a full ride.
I-I could've gone pro.
The coach said I had the arm for it.
Stanley.
You remember Angela and David.
No, I don't think we've met.
Of course I remember them.
She thinks I don't remember anything.
- How was your trip?
- Great.
David's niece Joanne just got married in Boca.
Janelle.
And it was Palm Beach.
I think someone's had a little too much punch.
Well, I think weddings are forgettable anyways.
That's why we eloped after only three days.
Yep, it was four years ago in a blizzard on February 2nd, the day of the hedge.
Or the hog.
- Or the, um...
- Groundhog.
- The...
The groundhog.
- It was, Groundhog Day.
And, the power was down, so I was bringing some ice cream out to the fire escape 'cause it was melting.
And, there she was, doing the exact same thing.
So we sat there and ate ice cream in the middle of a blizzard.
There was this moment where you... turned and looked at me.
And you were surrounded by snow, and you were caught in the moonlight, and you smiled.
I'll always remember it, because... it was the moment I fell in love with you.
Based on the scale of downtown, we're looking at a community that's at least a square mile.
And Grushenka's watching every inch of it.
There has to be an op center.
If we can find it, we can figure out what's going on.
How could you be so stupid?
You've been warned about this before.
I don't want to pretend anymore.
- I just want to go home.
- Don't do this.
Don't do what?
Act normal?
- Hey.
- I thought you might want some company.
What are you doing?
Look, Cynthia...
Whatever your real name is, they can't hear us in here.
I know.
I'm not doing it for them.
No, stop.
I'm married.
We're not allowed to be married.
I know.
I lied.
Sorry.
You have a rash.
Everybody does.
You do, too.
What is this from?
No one knows.
If I leave now, they're gonna see me and wonder why.
So don't get out.
I don't bite.
What's your wife's name?
Liz.
Tell me about her, your other wife.
Please.
I'm better now.
I'm afraid we both know that's not true.
No!
No, no!
Please!
I can do better!
I can do better!
Please!
Please!
Aah!
Hey, Pete.
You going somewhere?
I've been transferred.
To America.
I leave in an hour.
Transferred?
That's great.
Isn't that what... what we want?
Don't you get it?
I may not come back.
Chances are I'll never come back.
_
Answer it.
Hello.
Lisa, this is Mitchell with First Street Bank.
I'm calling to remind you about our interview today.
Sorry about last night.
Can't really form attachments.
Stan, what are you talking about?
Sometimes you say the strangest things.
Nobody knows when they're sending us to America, unless you know something I don't.
So, where should we go for breakfast?
I'm famished.
Moved here recently, I see.
From Ohio, yeah.
What part of Ohio?
Canton.
Is that near Akron at all?
It's about 40 minutes south.
You know anyone here, made any friends in town yet?
I'm sorry, what does that have to...
Please answer the question.
No, I don't know anyone here.
You know,
I think you'd be a great fit at First Street.
But the applicant pool is pretty... stiff, I'm afraid.
I would advise against that.
It's about who you know.
And since you need help meeting people...
Any more questions?
Just gonna grab a water.
Found the command center.
We should move tonight, uplink their system with Halcyon.
Yeah, and get the hell out.
My brother packed up and left this morning.
Transfer, he said.
So they're moving him already?
- Any idea where they sent him?
- No.
But he was terrified.
Don't drink that.
- Why not?
- 'Cause I ran a 6-minute mile and beat the hell out of a bank manager today.
We're being doped.
The rash.
How?
Something in the water.
Low doses.
Stimulant to enhance performance and lower inhibitions, relieve anxiety.
They want us compliant so we don't ask questions about this place.
- How do you know all this?
- Lisa.
Will you come with me?
If this is about the bank, I...
Please, just come with me.
Do you know what this is?
No.
During the Second World War, the Red Army carried these instead of standard tags.
It's an identity capsule.
A soldier's vitals are written on a slip of paper inside.
My grandfather's are in this one.
Hasn't been opened since it was used to identify his body, a life he gave for Russia.
You know, most candidates react timid to that test, but not you.
You have an instinct that cannot be taught, a capability.
I'm impressed.
You are needed for the next phase of our program here.
Wait, my new identity?
Lisa is a real person?
This is Dr. Pirogov.
I'll be performing your reassignment.
She's a very close match, no?
She is.
Based on the target's medical files, we'll need a slight alteration of the mandible here and here, and a rhinoplasty to curve the nose.
Even I won't be able to tell the difference when we're through.
Are you ready to give a life for Russia and to take on another?
Whoa-ho-ho.
You do not look like a man who should get behind the wheel.
Yeah?
Who the hell are you?
Today?
Consider us your designated drivers.
Us?
You don't look like much for one of the agency's highest decorated non-official cover operatives.
James Bond borrowed my tux.
You know what I think?
I think somewhere under that 5:00 whiskey stink, there's a sharp mind still at work.
I think that's why my husband paid you from a numbered account.
I read about the funeral.
Forgot to send flowers.
Anyone can open the Yellow Pages and call a private detective.
Only my husband would hire a spy.
What do you want from me?
Same thing Howard did.
And I'll pay.
What was he looking for?
Not what.
Who.
Your son.
Surgery?
- Like plastic surgery?
- Yeah.
That explains the Tugenbergs' bandages the other night.
They're not touching me.
I like my chin.
It was my mother's.
Get down.
These people aren't being trained to impersonate Americans.
They're being trained to replace them.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Their command center is at City Hall.
This is Cynthia Stegner at 86 Maplewood Drive.
I'm having an issue with my husband.
They made contact?
I'm into the Crazytown mainframe.
Tom patched us in.
Tell us what we're looking at.
The names of real people they intend to replace.
An electrician, a mechanic, a construction worker.
Why replace them?
What's the plan?
- We don't know.
- Bob and Linda Tugenberg...
I know them.
They're my neighbors.
- Dumont?
- We lost the link.
Dumont.
Tom, we got a problem.
Someone pulled the plug on their end.
I got nothing.
No, we have identities and addresses.
Go after the construction worker.
Get there fast.
Send a team to follow up on the others.
I'm there.
Kick the tires.
- What about Tom and Nez?
- Alert the extraction team in Russia.
They'll be coming fast.
Our focus is the names on that screen.
We need to get to them before their doppelgangers do.
What the hell?
How much data you think Dumont got?
Not enough.
Well, well, well.
I wonder who you work for.
MI6?
CIA?
Doesn't matter.
Full of bullets, we all look the same.
Clear.
That's a shame.
Scottie, baby, we got a corpse here with no sign of the pod people.
Sir?
Over here.
He left a note.
"At 6:15 p.m. today, we, the True Nation Brotherhood reclaimed our freedom..." Blah, blah, blah.
"Refreshing the tree of liberty..."
Blah, blah. "...
Rising against those who would hold us down..."
It's 5 of 6:00.
Scottie, we got a suicide note here taking credit for an attack that hasn't happened yet.
In addition to the body Solomon just found,
Robert and Linda Tugenberg...
He runs his own auto-body shop in Linden, New Jersey.
She's a senior electrical engineer for the New York Power Authority.
They were both found with self-inflicted gunshot wounds by our team 11 minutes ago.
And let me guess.
Suicide notes?
Taking credit for a crime that hasn't happened yet.
- But what's the crime?
- Peter Winstone...
He's a construction foreman with a company credit card.
He used said card an hour ago to purchase a large amount of Dynex.
Ka-boom.
An electrician, a construction foreman with heavy explosives, and a mechanic.
They're building a rolling bomb.
I'm finding an online footprint shared by all three.
Message board postings for a homegrown militia outfit
- called...
- The True Nation Brotherhood.
This isn't about Russia attacking us.
It's about using their agents to make us think we've attacked ourselves.
With suicide notes and dead Americans to prove it.
The notes...
What time do they say the attack takes place?
6:15.
That's 17 minutes from now.
That's how long we have to find their target.
We need a way out of this room.
The extraction point is 6 miles away.
If they're gonna be on our heels, there's no way we're gonna make it on foot.
Maybe we don't have to.
They're gonna blow the door.
How about we blow it for them?
They're wiring those explosives with blasting caps, which are stable but sensitive to stray electrical current.
I think 10,000 volts ought to do it.
Care to say goodbye?
First off, the stick?
I wasn't moved.
You want to honor Gramps for giving his life for Mother Russia, we can arrange for you to do the same.
But before you go, we're Americans,
U.S. of "you have no idea what's about to happen"
to your tired, sadistic..."
All right, I think she probably gets it.
Ready?
Here we go.
Damn sirens are gonna wake up the whole town.
Give me some overwatch while I hotwire this thing.
Go.
What kind of man runs out on his family?
How'd you find me?
They have ways of tracking us.
Till death do us part, right?
Let's get the hell out of here.
- Do you have a location?
- An area, downtown.
The mechanic rented a truck this afternoon.
Rental company equips them with GPS.
- We can track the truck.
- Yeah, moving past Franklin and Broadway as we speak.
- Get word to Solomon.
- Okay, done and doner.
It's like they want us to find them.
- They do want us to find them.
- Right.
If they're just passing Franklin and Broadway...
If they're posing as militia, they'll probably want to target a government building.
- What's nearby?
- State Supreme Court.
Bye!
I don't suppose it'd be too much to ask that you turn off the engine and drop the keys out the window.
We've got 300 pounds of Dynex in here.
Stay back, or it blows.
Yeah, I don't think so.
Fall back, mi amigos.
I'm not really a negotiator.
I don't really know what people say right now.
You got so much to live for?
Think of your families?
I don't know.
I'll say that was a hell of plot you guys almost pulled off.
It was elaborate, so... elaborate.
But I bet you that this van was not supposed to be the end of your life.
Am I right?
So why don't we keep it that way?
Nobody has to leave this square in a body bag.
Just hand us the detonator, and we can all go our separate ways.
What do you say, comrade?
I say screw you.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I didn't want to have to give the green light.
Green light?
Nice talking to you.
Mi amigos.
Hey, did you hear?
The, satellites show nothing but a crater where the town was.
The Russians scrubbed the whole thing.
Scottie said she'll ask General Phillips to provide protection for every American we got off the drives.
They could still be targeted.
Hey, um...
Thank you.
You saved my life.
- What?
- The drug they put in the water destroyed your REM cycle.
Take 5-HTP.
It's over-the-counter.
It'll help with the comedown.
How do you know so much about this?
After you've been a soldier...
Well, no.
After you've seen what people do in war, they'll offer you every drug there is except the one you need to make it go away.
So you try all the others just in case.
How'd you get sober?
Howard.
This place.
He gave me a job.
He...
He helped me clean up.
He gave me a shot at something I-I never tried before.
Hope.
Do you want...
Do you want to grab a coffee?
Toast to a job well done?
Maybe next time.
Damn, girl.
I was hoping you'd be one of the ones who stayed gone.
Reading a bedtime story?
Read it a thousand times...
Wealthy couple, beautiful son, trip to Ocean City.
Before he died, Howard hired someone to track down our son, Christopher.
Track him?
I don't understand.
I thought your son was dead.
I talked to the man.
He found a record of a child services in Wilmington, less than 20 miles from where Christopher disappeared.
A boy Chris' age.
Blue eyes, brown hair.
His name was Christopher.
A week after we lost our boy, that boy was brought to child services.
But you told me your husband was out of his mind, that his search for Christopher was a delusion.
I thought he was.
Now I don't know.
But as the head of one of the largest intelligence operations in the world, if there is any chance he's out there,
I will find my son.
I'm telling you, she is coming for me.
Operation North Star...
I need to know exactly what you found.
She knows about the investigator.
She knows that, you hired him to find me.
- She...
- Tom.
What did you learn?
It's a sleeper program.
It's one that trains agents, cuts them to look exactly like the people they're assigned to replace.
- So it's true.
- What's true?
You know about this place?
Two months after your disappearance, your mother was in a terrible car accident.
Some thought she was trying to end her life, that the pain of losing you was too much.
She was in the hospital for four months.
After that, she was never the same.
I noticed the differences, but I assumed it was because no one is ever the same after the loss of a child.
It was only years later that I began to suspect that there was something more to it.
And when your mother learned of my suspicions,
- she tried to have me killed.
- You told me this part.
You came to suspect who she was working with,
- where her loyalties lie.
- I'm not talking about who she's working with.
I'm talking about her.
I wasn't gonna tell you this until after it was confirmed.
But I believe that Scottie Hargrave is a sleeper agent.
Wha...
N-No.
- No, that can't be true.
- It is.
That program, the doubles, the town, the people who ran it...
I believe that 30 years ago, they murdered your mother.
Care package entering impact zone.
30 seconds to delivery, sir.
So sorry.
I... tried texting.
Oh, it's fine.
He's paid for all night, so come in.
- Uh, Kat, this is...
- Trevor.
How you doing?
Yes, it's what you're thinking.
There are worse ways to mourn.
I could be sitting at home eating ice cream.
It's General Phillips.
He says it's urgent.
I've seen you somewhere.
- It's a big city.
I doubt it.
- In the paper, the cover of The Wall Street Journal.
You read The Wall Street Journal?
You were at funeral, looked really nice.
Whose funeral was it?
My husband's.
I should be back in an hour.
General Phillips.
To what do I owe this pleasure?
Operation North Star.
I'm giving it the green light.
Operation North Star?
The humanitarian workers, the plane crash...
I worked this out with Howard months ago.
Oh, well, then, a plan is already in place.
Tell me about it.
The care package has been delivered.
Great.
What's next?
- You really don't know, do you?
- No, which is why...
We should postpone.
General, Howard's gone, and now I'm in charge of the company he built.
So whether I like it or not,
I have to stand out, stand up.
And I can't do that without therapy, antidepressants, and people like you, who Howard confided in... sometimes more than he confided in me.
You're unprepared.
So?
Prepare me.
The accident.
The accident was no accident.
What the world knows... an ISAP plane carrying relief workers went down last night in a remote region of the Ural Mountains well inside the Russian border.
What the world doesn't know...
It was downed on purpose by us.
There were 17 fatalities.
No, there were 17 dead people.
- What's the difference?
- They were already dead...
John Does from a morgue in Estonia.
The crash took place near what we think is a secret Russian military base.
The reason we think but don't know is that the Ruskies are using some kind of ground-based signal to jam line-of-sight with our birds.
Since we can't see by air, we need boots on the ground.
So you downed a plane.
- Edgy.
- To avoid an international incident,
Russia has invited a go-team from NTSB to investigate in the hopes of ruling out an act of terror.
You and Tom are on that team.
You need to get eyes on that facility.
Any idea what we're gonna find?
Intel indicates that whatever's going on there is specifically targeting the U.S.
That's it.
Howard didn't tell me about this operation with the Pentagon.
I want to know if he was hiding anything else.
You're one of the few people who knew that before Howard died, he went off his meds, that he'd become paranoid.
- I haven't told anyone.
- Which is why
I need you to handle this personally.
And confidentially.
I want an internal audit... every contract or financial transaction.
Leave no stone unturned.
I wasn't notified.
You are going to have to talk to my superior.
Come on.
Loo...
You have our credentials.
I'm sorry.
It's a restricted area.
Guys, we were invited here to do our job.
Now, we can only do that on our own with complete access to the entire debris field.
And if that's gonna be a problem, we're gonna have to call the embassy.
Take nothing.
Touch nothing.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me.
On my signal.
Fuel leak!
Fuel leak!
It's not secure!
Everybody back!
Okay, I'm on the move.
- Where am I headed?
- Northeast, over the ridge.
Half a klick to the clearing.
You're moments away, Tom-Tom.
Now make a left.
You get there, you snap some photos, and you get out before anyone misses you at the crash site.
- You find it?
- I found something.
Sure as hell isn't a weapons facility.
What is it?
Come on.
Don't leave the D-man out of this.
I don't know.
I think you're gonna have to see this one to believe it.
- Hey!
- _
I don't...
I-I don't know what you're saying!
_
_
Hey, hey!
Why didn't anybody tell us there was an active fuel leak, huh?
Now I got to report this to your superiors in Moscow.
So, what's over the hill and through the woods?
Grandma's house, if she lived in Topeka.
I guess we're not in Kansas anymore, Toto.
I wouldn't bet on it.
What's this?
A numbered account in the Dutch Antilles registered to an I.P. address matching Howard's computer at your house.
Did you find anything else?
No, except for a troubling line item listed only as "Iran-Contra."
- What was the account used for?
- I don't know.
Briar Metcalf might.
He's the one who set it up.
Briar.
Of course.
Would you like me to go see him?
Desperately.
But I need to do it.
Where are we?
Independence... population 216.
What is it?
During the Cold War, there were rumors that the Soviets built replicas of American towns to train their agents how to live like us.
No one ever proved they existed.
You know, a place to train sleeper agents made sense back in the day.
But today, when you can get a visa and send them to Disneyland?
What are they up to?
Should we inform General Phillips?
No.
Not until we know what we're dealing with.
Seems like maybe you already do.
I don't, but I know someone who might.
Hey, hey.
Men only!
I'll let you know if I see any.
I said I couldn't help you.
Yes, but you didn't mean it, not after Riga.
Please, don't push me on this.
You don't know the people involved.
Acquaint me.
They inserted agents at Three Mile Island, at O'Hare Airport before Flight 191 went down in Chicago, agents that were trained in towns like this to infiltrate America.
Then the wall fell, and the program stopped.
Mm.
Doesn't looked like it stopped to me.
No.
This new place is something else.
Agents trained not just to conceal themselves, but to... slivat'sya... to merge with their cover identities.
What does that mean?
I hear only rumors that this program is the next generation of what came before but even more dangerous.
People are afraid to talk about it, people who aren't afraid of much.
I need to get a look in there, Vadim.
It's important.
Occasionally, some of the new boys call me, ask for recommendations, agents or assets I may have had who are fluent in Russian or English.
For assignment in Independence.
You don't want to do this.
I have two agents for you to recommend.
Listen to what I'm telling you.
I send agents in, but they never come out... ever.
I'll have two dossiers for you within the hour.
You think Scottie knows more than she's saying?
Every day of the week and twice on Sunday.
I hope you're a quick study.
- What's this?
- Your cover.
You and Nez are FSB agents being transferred to Independence.
Nez?
What about Solomon?
I have another assignment for him.
You're wheels-up in an hour.
Two hours.
I have an appointment.
Cancel it.
- I can't do that.
- Of course you can.
Clearly you don't want to.
Why?
Who are you meeting with that's so important?
It's personal.
Two hours, not a minute more.
She's doing a complete audit.
Tell me about Operation North Star.
Accounts, case files, everything.
The relief workers, the plane crash.
- Has she taken the contract?
- She knows you hid things from her, and if she looks closely enough, she's gonna find out it's me.
Let me worry about her.
You worry about the op.
Whoa.
What is all this?
It doesn't...
It doesn't matter, not now.
Look, if I'm gonna work with you, I need to know that you have a clear head, that you're not...
- that you're focused.
- I've never been more focused.
Says the manic depressive who's off his meds.
She told you that?
Clearly, you're not taking them.
Which is why I can see the truth, Tom, for the first time.
What truth?
Did you hear what I said?
She's looking into what you're hiding.
She is gonna find me out.
You're telling me that's not important, but some village in Siberia is?
Yeah, it's critical.
Critical to what?
To everything.
To the whole picture.
That's what she doesn't want me to see.
It's why she kept me medicated... to keep me from finding the truth.
You have to get on that plane.
You have to go to Russia and see this through.

From this moment on, you will only speak English.
No exceptions.
This complex was built on the site of a former missile facility.
Ground water was polluted.
Be aware of it.
Short showers.
Bottled water only.
No exceptions.
You will be given a new identity.
Study it.
Become it.
It is you.
Do not break character for anything or anyone.
You will be tested.
You will be pushed.
You will become someone new.
You will receive your assignment and will take our fight to America.
I'm Lisa.
I'm an unemployed bank teller.
Oh, and I live with my brother.
Hmm.
Who's in construction.
What fight could we possibly bring to America?
One no one will see coming.
Who are you?
Uh, I'm Stan.
I'm a janitor, and...
I live with my wife.
Hello?
Anyone home?
In here, sweetie.
I was wondering where you were.
Hey.
Hi, there.
- Oh, Sam, leave Daddy alone.
- Oh, that's okay.
Hi, boy.
I'm just finishing up the tuna casserole.
I'll need about 15 minutes or so.
You better change, or we'll be late.
Uh, late...
late for what?
The Tugenbergs.
Linda's birthday?
Right.
I swear you'd forget we were married if you didn't wake up next to me every day.
Yep.
Uh, smells great.
Don't even think about it.
Now shoo.
Go on.
Go put on the sweater I got you for Christmas.
Right.
The, uh, sweater.
- I laid it out on the bed.
- Of course you did.
Along with your khakis and your penny loafers.
What would I do without you?
Honestly, I shudder to think.
Hey, I am on my way home now.
Open a bottle of Beaujolais and let it breathe a while.
Sorry, Briar.
You're gonna be late for that Beaujolais.
- Scottie, what are you d...
- Briar, if I were you,
I'd talk little and listen big.
I don't want Mr. Solomon to have to get bloodstains all over these aniline leather seats.
The account in the Antilles, the one you set up for Howard without telling me?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Howard was making secret payments to someone.
You would know who.
I want a name.
Effective immediately, you're out as CFO of Halcyon.
What you say next will determine if that's the worst thing that happens to you today.
Scottie, I would...
Honestly.
But Howard was like a brother to me.
You know, funny thing.
Most people think only men can be brothers.
I used to think that, too, until I stood face-to-face with my executioner.
Hand to God, I was a dead man.
And that part where you're supposed to see your life flash before your eyes, you know what I saw instead?
I saw the most beautiful pair of legs staying the hand of my executioner.
This woman, she's my brother.
Owe her my life, really.
And if she asks me to remove your head,
I'll do so without thinking twice.
So...
let's get talking.
Or...
let's get surgical.
Who did Howard give that money to?
I-I-I don't know his name.
Howard never told me.
Then for the sake of your leather seats,
I hope Howard told you where we could find him.
You made it!
Oh, my God.
Please tell me that's what I think it is.
Nana's tuna casserole straight from the oven.
Happy birthday to me.
Come on.
Let me show you where to put it.
They offered me a full ride.
I-I could've gone pro.
The coach said I had the arm for it.
- Stanley.
- Hmm?
You remember Angela and David.
Uh, no, I don't think we've met.
Of course I remember them.
She thinks I don't remember anything.
- How was your trip?
- Oh, great.
David's niece Joanne just got married in Boca.
Janelle.
And it was Palm Beach.
I think someone's had a little too much punch.
Well, I think weddings are forgettable anyways.
That's why we eloped after only three days.
Yep, it was four years ago in a blizzard on February 2nd, the day of the hedge.
Or the hog.
- Or the, um...
- Uh, groundhog.
- The...
The groundhog.
- It was, uh, Groundhog Day.
And, uh, the power was down, so I was bringing some ice cream out to the fire escape 'cause it was melting.
And, uh, there she was, doing the exact same thing.
So we sat there and ate ice cream in the middle of a blizzard.
Uh, there was this moment where you... turned and looked at me.
And you were surrounded by snow, and you were caught in the moonlight, and you smiled.
I'll always remember it, because... it was the moment I fell in love with you.
Based on the scale of downtown, we're looking at a community that's at least a square mile.
And Grushenka's watching every inch of it.
There has to be an op center.
If we can find it, we can figure out what's going on.
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
How could you be so stupid?
You've been warned about this before.
I don't want to pretend anymore.
- I just want to go home.
- Don't do this.
Don't do what?
Act normal?

♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
- Hey.
- I thought you might want some company.
What are you doing?
Look, uh, Cynthia...
Whatever your real name is, they can't hear us in here.
I know.
I'm not doing it for them.
No, stop.
I'm married.
We're not allowed to be married.
I know.
I lied.
Sorry.
You have a rash.
Oh, everybody does.
You do, too.
What is this from?
No one knows.
If I leave now, they're gonna see me and wonder why.
So don't get out.
I don't bite.
What's your wife's name?
Liz.
Tell me about her, your other wife.
Please.
I'm better now.
I'm afraid we both know that's not true.
_
No!
No, no!
Please!
I can do better!
I can do better!
Please!
Please!
Aah!
Hey, Pete.
You going somewhere?
I've been transferred.
To America.
I leave in an hour.
Transferred?
That's great.
Isn't that what... what we want?
Don't you get it?
I may not come back.
Chances are I'll never come back.
_
Answer it.
Hello.
Lisa, this is Mitchell with First Street Bank.
I'm calling to remind you about our interview today.
Sorry about last night.
Can't really form attachments.
Stan, what are you talking about?
Sometimes you say the strangest things.
Nobody knows when they're sending us to America, unless you know something I don't.
_
_
So, where should we go for breakfast?
I'm famished.
Moved here recently, I see.
From Ohio, yeah.
What part of Ohio?
Canton.
Is that near Akron at all?
It's about 40 minutes south.
You know anyone here, made any friends in town yet?
I'm sorry, what does that have to...
Please answer the question.
No, I don't know anyone here.
You know,
I think you'd be a great fit at First Street.
But the applicant pool is pretty... stiff, I'm afraid.
I would advise against that.
It's about who you know.
And since you need help meeting people...
Ohh!
Any more questions?
Just gonna grab a water.
Found the command center.
We should move tonight, uplink their system with Halcyon.
Yeah, and get the hell out.
My brother packed up and left this morning.
Transfer, he said.
- So they're moving him already?
- Mm-hmm.
- Any idea where they sent him?
- No.
But he was terrified.
Don't drink that.
- Why not?
- 'Cause I ran a 6-minute mile and beat the hell out of a bank manager today.
We're being doped.
The rash.
How?
Something in the water.
Low doses.
Stimulant to enhance performance and lower inhibitions, relieve anxiety.
They want us compliant so we don't ask questions about this place.
- How do you know all this?
- Lisa.
Will you come with me?
If this is about the bank, I...
Please, just come with me.
Do you know what this is?
No.
During the Second World War, the Red Army carried these instead of standard tags.
It's an identity capsule.
A soldier's vitals are written on a slip of paper inside.
My grandfather's are in this one.
Hasn't been opened since it was used to identify his body, a life he gave for Russia.
You know, most candidates react timid to that test, but not you.
You have an instinct that cannot be taught, a capability.
I'm impressed.
You are needed for the next phase of our program here.
Wait, my new identity?
Lisa is a real person?
This is Dr. Pirogov.
I'll be performing your reassignment.
She's a very close match, no?
She is.
Based on the target's medical files, we'll need a slight alteration of the mandible here and here, and a rhinoplasty to curve the nose.
Even I won't be able to tell the difference when we're through.
Are you ready to give a life for Russia and to take on another?
Whoa-ho-ho.
Oh, you do not look like a man who should get behind the wheel.
Oh, yeah?
Who the hell are you?
Today?
Consider us your designated drivers.
Us?
You don't look like much for one of the agency's highest decorated non-official cover operatives.
James Bond borrowed my tux.
You know what I think?
I think somewhere under that 5:00 whiskey stink, there's a sharp mind still at work.
I think that's why my husband paid you from a numbered account.
I read about the funeral.
Forgot to send flowers.
Anyone can open the Yellow Pages and call a private detective.
Only my husband would hire a spy.
What do you want from me?
Same thing Howard did.
And I'll pay.
What was he looking for?
Not what.
Who.
Your son.
Surgery?
- Like plastic surgery?
- Yeah.
That explains the Tugenbergs' bandages the other night.
They're not touching me.
I like my chin.
It was my mother's.
Get down.
These people aren't being trained to impersonate Americans.
They're being trained to replace them.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Their command center is at City Hall.
_
Hmm?
_
This is Cynthia Stegner at 86 Maplewood Drive.
I'm having an issue with my husband.
They made contact?
I'm into the Crazytown mainframe.
Tom patched us in.
Tell us what we're looking at.
The names of real people they intend to replace.
An electrician, a mechanic, a construction worker.
Why replace them?
What's the plan?
- We don't know.
- Bob and Linda Tugenberg...
I know them.
They're my neighbors.
- Dumont?
- We lost the link.
Dumont.
Tom, we got a problem.
Someone pulled the plug on their end.
I got nothing.
No, we have identities and addresses.
Go after the construction worker.
Get there fast.
Send a team to follow up on the others.
I'm there.
Kick the tires.
- What about Tom and Nez?
- Alert the extraction team in Russia.
They'll be coming fast.
Our focus is the names on that screen.
We need to get to them before their doppelgangers do.
What the hell?
How much data you think Dumont got?
Not enough.
Well, well, well.
I wonder who you work for.
MI6?
CIA?
Doesn't matter.
Full of bullets, we all look the same.
Clear.
Ohh.
That's a shame.
Scottie, baby, we got a corpse here with no sign of the pod people.
Sir?
Over here.
He left a note.
"At 6:15 p.m. today, we, the True Nation Brotherhood reclaimed our freedom..." Blah, blah, blah.
"refreshing the tree of liberty..."
Blah, blah. "...rising against those who would hold us down..."
Hmm.
It's 5 of 6:00.
Scottie, we got a suicide note here taking credit for an attack that hasn't happened yet.
In addition to the body Solomon just found,
Robert and Linda Tugenberg...
He runs his own auto-body shop in Linden, New Jersey.
She's a senior electrical engineer for the New York Power Authority.
They were both found with self-inflicted gunshot wounds by our team 11 minutes ago.
And let me guess.
Suicide notes?
Taking credit for a crime that hasn't happened yet.
- But what's the crime?
- Peter Winstone...
He's a construction foreman with a company credit card.
He used said card an hour ago to purchase a large amount of Dynex.
Ka-boom.
An electrician, a construction foreman with heavy explosives, and a mechanic.
They're building a rolling bomb.
I'm finding an online footprint shared by all three.
Message board postings for a homegrown militia outfit
- called...
- The True Nation Brotherhood.
This isn't about Russia attacking us.
It's about using their agents to make us think we've attacked ourselves.
With suicide notes and dead Americans to prove it.
The notes...
What time do they say the attack takes place?
6:15.
That's 17 minutes from now.
That's how long we have to find their target.
We need a way out of this room.
The extraction point is 6 miles away.
If they're gonna be on our heels, there's no way we're gonna make it on foot.
Maybe we don't have to.
They're gonna blow the door.
How about we blow it for them?
They're wiring those explosives with blasting caps, which are stable but sensitive to stray electrical current.
I think 10,000 volts ought to do it.
Care to say goodbye?
First off, the stick?
I wasn't moved.
You want to honor Gramps for giving his life for Mother Russia, we can arrange for you to do the same.
Oh, but before you go, we're Americans,
U.S. of "you have no idea what's about to happen to your tired, sadistic..."
All right, I think she probably gets it.
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.
Here we go.
Damn sirens are gonna wake up the whole town.
Give me some overwatch while I hotwire this thing.
Go.
What kind of man runs out on his family?
How'd you find me?
They have ways of tracking us.
Till death do us part, right?
_
Let's get the hell out of here.
- Do you have a location?
- An area, downtown.
The mechanic rented a truck this afternoon.
Rental company equips them with GPS.
- We can track the truck.
- Yeah, moving past Franklin and Broadway as we speak.
- Get word to Solomon.
- Okay, done and doner.
It's like they want us to find them.
- They do want us to find them.
- Right.
If they're just passing Franklin and Broadway...
If they're posing as militia, they'll probably want to target a government building.
- What's nearby?
- State Supreme Court.
Bye!
I don't suppose it'd be too much to ask that you turn off the engine and drop the keys out the window.
We've got 300 pounds of Dynex in here.
Stay back, or it blows.
Yeah, I don't think so.
Fall back, mi amigos.
I'm not really a negotiator.
I don't really know what people say right now.
You got so much to live for?
Think of your families?
I don't know.
I'll say that was a hell of plot you guys almost pulled off.
It was elaborate, so... elaborate.
But I bet you that this van was not supposed to be the end of your life.
Am I right?
So why don't we keep it that way?
Nobody has to leave this square in a body bag.
Just hand us the detonator, and we can all go our separate ways.
What do you say, comrade?
I say screw you.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I didn't want to have to give the green light.
Green light?
Nice talking to you.
Mi amigos.
Hey, did you hear?
The, uh, satellites show nothing but a crater where the town was.
The Russians scrubbed the whole thing.
Scottie said she'll ask General Phillips to provide protection for every American we got off the drives.
They could still be targeted.
Hey, um...
Thank you.
You saved my life.
- What?
- The drug they put in the water destroyed your REM cycle.
Take 5-HTP.
It's over-the-counter.
It'll help with the comedown.
How do you know so much about this?
After you've been a soldier...
Uh, well, no.
After you've seen what people do in war, they'll offer you every drug there is except the one you need to make it go away.
So you try all the others just in case.
How'd you get sober?
Howard.
This place.
He gave me a job.
He...
He helped me clean up.
He gave me a shot at something I-I never tried before.
Hope.
Do you want...
Do you want to grab a coffee?
Toast to a job well done?
Maybe next time.
- Yeah.
- ♪ Can you pull me up?
Damn, girl.
I was hoping you'd be one of the ones who stayed gone.
Reading a bedtime story?
Read it a thousand times...
Wealthy couple, beautiful son, trip to Ocean City.
Before he died, Howard hired someone to track down our son, Christopher.
Track him?
I don't understand.
I thought your son was dead.
I talked to the man.
He found a record of a child services in Wilmington, less than 20 miles from where Christopher disappeared.
A boy Chris' age.
Blue eyes, brown hair.
His name was Christopher.
A week after we lost our boy, that boy was brought to child services.
But you told me your husband was out of his mind, that his search for Christopher was a delusion.
I thought he was.
Now I don't know.
But as the head of one of the largest intelligence operations in the world, if there is any chance he's out there,
I will find my son.
I'm telling you, she is coming for me.
Operation North Star...
I need to know exactly what you found.
She knows about the investigator.
She knows that, uh, you hired him to find me.
- She...
- Tom.
What did you learn?
It's a sleeper program.
It's one that trains agents, cuts them to look exactly like the people they're assigned to replace.
Oh.
- So it's true.
- What's true?
You know about this place?
Two months after your disappearance, your mother was in a terrible car accident.
Some thought she was trying to end her life, that the pain of losing you was too much.
She was in the hospital for four months.
After that, she was never the same.
I noticed the differences, but I assumed it was because no one is ever the same after the loss of a child.
It was only years later that I began to suspect that there was something more to it.
And when your mother learned of my suspicions,
- she tried to have me killed.
- You told me this part.
You came to suspect who she was working with,
- where her loyalties lie.
- I'm not talking about who she's working with.
I'm talking about her.
I wasn't gonna tell you this until after it was confirmed.
But I believe that Scottie Hargrave is a sleeper agent.
Wha...
N-No.
- No, that can't be true.
- It is.
That program, the doubles, the town, the people who ran it...
I believe that 30 years ago, they murdered your mother.
[horse hooves cloping]
[MOBLIT] The report was right.
The whole village has been devastated.
But there's not a drop of blood, let alone any bodies.
It's eerie.
Still, maybe they got out?
It's not unheard of.
In theory, I suppose.
But then the question becomes why Titans would smash up empty houses?
Bit difficult to believe.
What's more, how far were these people hoping to get by leaving their horses here?
That's a good point.
So what do you think happened?
Moblit, I found it!
Look!
There you are.
[MALE SOLDIER 35B] You, uh...
you should see this.
[MOBLIT] A portrait of Conny Springer's parents, I presume?
Seems very likely, sir.
[MOBLIT, SOLDIERS gasp]
It's alive!
No!
Stand down!

Episode Title: "Children"
[REINER] It's your call.
What's it gonna be?
Is it Christa's future?
Or your own petty existence?
Hey!
Talk!
Who's the real enemy here?
Tell me!
[YMIR sighs]
- Couldn't say.
- [EREN grunts]
[REINER] All right, then.
Sorry, Eren.
[distant gunshot]
[REINER] You're kidding.
[BERTHOLDT] The Scouts are here?
Already?
Son of a bitch!
Talk to me, Reiner.
What are you right now?
A warrior.
Calm down.
Do you really think it's wise for us to trust Ymir?
Even though she's the one who devoured Marcel?
Sure.
Don't you see?
We have a handle on her motives.
When she turned human again, odds are she just wandered around aimlessly only giving a damn about herself.
But then Christa came into the picture.
That's the kind of girl that can change your whole world.
We need her, and not just because she's cute.
The people she comes from are an important family within the church.
Plus, suppose Eren's not the coordinate?
Our job wouldn't be over.
If it comes to that, having Christa around will make the search a lot easier.
[gasps]
They're close.
[EREN] What are they talking about?
They still plan on clearing out before sundown or not?
Please, let's just be done.
The next time we come, we'll take all three.
Annie, Christa, and that.
It'll be clean and simple.
Then we won't have to come here anymore.
Right.
And we'll have completed our damn mission.
Just do me a favor, huh?
Once we're home, try telling Annie how you really feel.
What's that supposed to mean?
Ugh.
Come on.
I've seen the way you stare at her.
I don't stare!
Bertholdt, please, life's short enough as it is.
Just go for it.
Besides, you're both killers so she understands where your head is.
What're you two doing now?
I thought we were waiting till dark.
There's been a slight change of plans.
I'm gonna ask you nicely not to try to put up a fight.
Easy.
There's no need for us to get all violent.
It's not like I can resist like this.
I mean, take a look at me.
Just, calm down, okay?
[EREN grunts]
Die!
Die!
Die!
Die!
Die, you evil...!
[REINER grunts]
[REINER, EREN grunting]
Bastard!
I'll...
I'll kill you!
I'll rip you apart!
Explain to me why we're leaving early.
Ymir.
When you changed back into a human, d'you have any memory of the person you ate?
[gasps]
Huh.
No, not really.
We're talking about something that happened five years ago.
But the way you're asking, I'm guessing that it was someone you knew?
[EREN yelling, groaning]
I see.
Then I'm, uh, sorry for not remembering.
[yelling]
Hey, it's not your fault that you don't.
It was the same for Reiner and me.
[YMIR] Yeah?
[BERTHOLDT] Eren doesn't remember either.
[YMIR] Is that how it works?
You hold that against me?
I don't think so.
I mean.
I don't know.
Suppose I have to believe you didn't want to eat anyone.
How, uh, how long were you wandering outside the walls?
Oh, about sixty years.
Hell on earth.
Every day was like waking up into a nightmare.
[gunshot]
Red smoke signal, sir.
The hell?
[gasps]
Commander Erwin, we're surrounded!
There is a way around.
Should we head towards it?
[ERWIN] No.
We don't have time for a detour.
We'll forge ahead!
Soldiers!
Prepare to fight!
[REINER] For now, we find a place without Titans!
As far away as possible!
I haven't recovered enough to outrun these guys.
They surround us, there's jack shit my Titan form can do right now.
Then why the hell didn't we just wait for the sun to go down?
[gasps]
Smoke signals?
Did the Scouts come to save us?
Damn it.
That Formation wouldn't work unless they hoisted a bunch of horses over the wall.
Who gave that order?
I honestly thought we had more time than this.
It's gotta be Commander Erwin.
Hard as nails, that one.
[distant gunshot]
[REINER] Damn.
They're already that close?
It's Eren's fault for losing his cool.
[YMIR] Wait.
Is she...?
Christa's here.
Reiner!
We have to go back!
Now!
Christa's with them!
- What?
- This is our best chance!
You're full of it!
No way you can see that far!
Look, I just know!
Think about it, okay?
She's a big softie, right?
Stupid girl's come to rescue me!
She had to!
Yeah, well so what?
I'm sorry!
It'll have to wait!
[YMIR] What?
We can't grab her the way things are now!
There's no way to bust up that formation!
Another time!
How long you want me to wait?
Maybe I should just hold off on that until I've been gobbled up by one of your warrior pals?
Oh no!
I don't think so!
Don't be that way!
Nobody's trying to trick you, I swear it!
[YMIR] Prove it, then!
There's no time like the present, asshole!
Damn you!
Get down there and bring her with us!
I need to see her!
You don't understand.
The way things are going, she... will.
[BERTHOLDT] We can't.
Let it go, Ymir.
Who knows whether we'll even manage to survive this.
Sorry.
It's just too risky.
Listen to me.
You have my word.
I want her out of this as much as you do.
Bear with me.
You have to trust us!
This is what's best for Christa!
Do you understand?
Yes, I understand.
Real question is, do you?
Of course!
All right, then.
Thank you for that.
[YMIR] It's happening again.
I've come so far.
Done so much.
And still wound up falling for my own bullshit.
[MAN 35A] Well.
They look promising.
[MAN 35A] What about this one?
[MAN 35B] Mm.
[MAN 35A] Hello there.
How would you feel about coming to live with us?
Think of it as the start of a brand-new life.
Of course, a brand-new life needs a brand-new name.
Don't you agree?
[YMIR] Huh?
[YMIR] That day...
That was the first time I lied to myself.
Told myself I had no say in the matter.
That I never had a choice.
But...
[MAN 35A] It is this Lady Ymir that inherits the blood of His Majesty the king.
So long as she graces us with her presence, immortality shall be ours.
[clapping]
[YMIR] To be fair, it wasn't all that bad.
[gasps]
[YMIR] My food wasn't cold.
I no longer slept in the dirt.
[SISTER] Lady Ymir.
[YMIR] Best of all, I knew what it meant to feel needed.
For the first time in my life,
I actually meant something to someone else.
That, by far, was more precious than anything.
Then, one day...
[BELIEVERS holler]
[MAN 35A] It's her fault!
The girl's to blame!
She said the blood of the king flowed in her veins!
We're only guilty of believing her!
[YMIR] I was cruelly reminded that everything
I clung to was an act.
Is that so?
I-I only...
It's true.
I am Ymir!
The king's blood runs through me!
[BELIEVERS gasp]
[YMIR] Lie once, the rest follow easy.
[YMIR gasps]
If it saved their necks, so be it.
Trouble was, things didn't quite work out that way.
[breathes rapidly] [screams] Help me!
[coughs, screams]
Stop this!
I'm begging you!
It's not right!
[squelch]
[YMIR yelps]
[YMIR] That's when I realized I'd had it coming all along.
I'd deceived those gullible bastards, but that wasn't what I was being punished for really.
It was for deceiving myself into thinking someone needed me.
What else did I expect?
That's what comes of looking at the world through a veil.
[YMIR TITAN growls]
[ALL gasp]
[MARCEL] Titan!
Run!
[MARCEL grunts]
[MARCEL hollers]
No!
[screams]
[YMIR gasps]
[YMIR] When I opened my eyes, the first thing I saw was freedom.
The first thing I thought was if there's such thing as fate, she's a fickle little whore.
[laughs]
Right then and there
I made a vow.
No more deceiving myself.
No more falling for my own line.
From then on, I'd be real.
[MALE ORDER OF THE WALLS 35A] So, how did that play out?
[MALE ORDER OF THE WALLS 35B] Ah, the child was given the name "Christa Lenz."
Then, she was packed off to the Cadet Corps.
That is a pity.
Poor wretch.
Would've been better were she never born.
Are you trying to pick a fight?
All right, sure.
Makes no difference to me.
[YMIR] And then...
What do we have here?
This your idea of trying to be nice?
[BOTH gasp]
Well, uh.
[YMIR] And then I met you.
Immediately, I could tell.
You and I were the same.
You nourished yourself on lies.
Together, we give our hearts!
[CADETS] Sir!
[YMIR] Here was someone desperately trying to convince herself of something she knew wasn't true.
I get it.
Believe me.
And don't worry.
I'm not asking you to understand.
No.
What I want is very simple.
Just let me be honest with myself one last time.
That's all.
Let's face it, guys.
I'm the one best suited for this.
[BERTHOLDT hollers]
What are you doing?
Hey, shut the hell up and use your head for a second.
In a forest like this I'm the one who can shine.
Right?
[yells]
[BERTHOLDT] Ymir!
Knock it off!
We'll fall!
Do you think that I give a damn?
I have the advantage.
Any other time you two would outclass me.
But my Titan form's more agile.
I could leap through the trees, grab Eren, and rendezvous with the Scouts before you knew what hit you.
Wouldn't be that hard.
Either you agree to take Christa with us today, right now, or so help me I will throw your whole plan out of whack!
Uh!
Are you completely insane?
That doesn't help her!
I thought that you genuinely cared!
I do.
In my way.
If it robs her of a future, then life's a bitch, but... by god I will live to see her again!
I've made my peace with what that says about me.
You guys have no idea what it's like.
She knows what a shitty person I am, but she still smiles at me.
I can't...
Damn it.
[YMIR] Don't be pissed.
I have a fairly decent plan.
Besides, if I stay and fight, it'll be easier for you three to get away.
Then again, if you don't like it, we can always tear each other apart like animals!
[SOLDIERS screaming] [gasps] That light.
You saw it, too, huh?
It's coming from the forest!
I think someone's transforming into a Titan!
We're out of time.
Soldiers, disperse!
The enemy has assumed Titan form!
Find Eren and get him out of there!
[SOLDIERS gasp] [screams]
Another MP.
[ERWIN] Battle is not our objective!
Locate, recover, and retreat!
Round up the horses!
Right away, sir!
[HANNES] First thing we do is pinpoint the enemy and tell the others!
They're fleeing through the woods, so stay sharp!
Break!
[MIKASA] Eren.
[ARMIN] Where are you?
[YMIR TITAN roars]
That's the scream of a Titan!
It came from just up ahead!
I can see you!
No, wait a second!
It's actually Ymir!
This is her Titan form.
She's one of the people they took!
What the hell happened?
Where is everybody else?
Is Eren okay?
What about Bertholdt and Reiner?
So this is Ymir.
Did she assume Titan form to take on
Reiner and escape?
Ymir!
What's the deal?
Did you manage to get away from them?
What direction did they go?
Give us something to go on!
Anything!
[CONNY] Say something already!
C'mon, ugly!
We're kinda in a rush!
Is she keeping an eye out for Reiner?
[gasps]
Something isn't right.
Why...
Why is she looking at us one by one?
[CHRISTA] Ymir!
There you are!
Thank goodness you're all right!
[BOTH gasp]
What?
Did she just...?
Ymir, what are you doing?
Don't just stand there!
Move your asses!
[JEAN] She's fast!
We're losing her!
Why would she do that?
What's wrong with you people?
Am I seriously the only one who saw this coming?
Well, it's clear where her loyalties are now!
She and Reiner are on the same side!
We were lured into a trap!
[BERTHOLDT] Heads up.
She's back.
Good.
Oh, no!
[ARMIN] No!
They're getting away with Eren!
[HANNES] Move it!
Get on your damn horses!
This ain't over, y'hear me?
I'll get him back if it costs me my life!

The report was right.
The whole village has been devastated.
But there's not a drop of blood, let alone any bodies.
It's eerie.
Still, maybe they got out?
It's not unheard of.
In theory, I suppose.
But then the question becomes why Titans would smash up empty houses?
Bit difficult to believe.
What's more, how far were these people hoping to get by leaving their horses here?
That's a good point.
So what do you think happened?
Moblit, I found it!
Look!
There you are.
You, uh...
you should see this.
A portrait of Conny Springer's parents, I presume?
Seems very likely, sir.
It's alive!
No!
Stand down!
What the hell is going on?

Episode Title: "Children"
It's your call.
What's it gonna be?
Is it Christa's future?
Or your own petty existence?
Hey!
Talk!
Who's the real enemy here?
Tell me!
Couldn't say.
All right, then.
Sorry, Eren.
You're kidding.
The Scouts are here?
Already?
Son of a bitch!
Talk to me, Reiner.
What are you right now?
A warrior.
Calm down.
Do you really think it's wise for us to trust Ymir?
Even though she's the one who devoured Marcel?
Sure.
Don't you see?
We have a handle on her motives.
When she turned human again, odds are she just wandered around aimlessly only giving a damn about herself.
But then Christa came into the picture.
That's the kind of girl that can change your whole world.
We need her, and not just because she's cute.
The people she comes from are an important family within the church.
Plus, suppose Eren's not the coordinate?
Our job wouldn't be over.
If it comes to that, having Christa around will make the search a lot easier.
They're close.
What are they talking about?
They still plan on clearing out before sundown or not?
Please, let's just be done.
The next time we come, we'll take all three.
Annie, Christa, and that.
It'll be clean and simple.
Then we won't have to come here anymore.
Right.
And we'll have completed our damn mission.
Just do me a favor, huh?
Once we're home, try telling Annie how you really feel.
What's that supposed to mean?
Ugh.
Come on.
I've seen the way you stare at her.
I don't stare!
Bertholdt, please, life's short enough as it is.
Just go for it.
Besides, you're both killers so she understands where your head is.
What're you two doing now?
I thought we were waiting till dark.
There's been a slight change of plans.
I'm gonna ask you nicely not to try to put up a fight.
Easy.
There's no need for us to get all violent.
It's not like I can resist like this.
I mean, take a look at me.
Just, calm down, okay?
Die!
Die!
Die!
Die!
Die, you evil...!
Bastard!
I'll...
I'll kill you!
I'll rip you apart!
Explain to me why we're leaving early.
Ymir.
When you changed back into a human, d'you have any memory of the person you ate?
Huh.
No, not really.
We're talking about something that happened five years ago.
But the way you're asking, I'm guessing that it was someone you knew?
I see.
Then I'm, uh, sorry for not remembering.
Hey, it's not your fault that you don't.
It was the same for Reiner and me.
Yeah?
Eren doesn't remember either.
Is that how it works?
You hold that against me?
I don't think so.
I mean.
I don't know.
Suppose I have to believe you didn't want to eat anyone.
How, uh, how long were you wandering outside the walls?
Oh, about sixty years.
Hell on earth.
Every day was like waking up into a nightmare.
Red smoke signal, sir.
The hell?
Commander Erwin, we're surrounded!
There is a way around.
Should we head towards it?
No.
We don't have time for a detour.
We'll forge ahead!
Soldiers!
Prepare to fight!
For now, we find a place without Titans!
As far away as possible!
I haven't recovered enough to outrun these guys.
They surround us, there's jack shit my Titan form can do right now.
Then why the hell didn't we just wait for the sun to go down?
Smoke signals?
Did the Scouts come to save us?
Damn it.
That Formation wouldn't work unless they hoisted a bunch of horses over the wall.
Who gave that order?
I honestly thought we had more time than this.
It's gotta be Commander Erwin.
Hard as nails, that one.
Damn.
They're already that close?
It's Eren's fault for losing his cool.
Wait.
Is she...?
Christa's here.
Reiner!
We have to go back!
Now!
Christa's with them!
- What?
- This is our best chance!
You're full of it!
No way you can see that far!
Look, I just know!
Think about it, okay?
She's a big softie, right?
Stupid girl's come to rescue me!
She had to!
Yeah, well so what?
I'm sorry!
It'll have to wait!
What?
We can't grab her the way things are now!
There's no way to bust up that formation!
Another time!
How long you want me to wait?
Maybe I should just hold off on that until I've been gobbled up by one of your warrior pals?
Oh no!
I don't think so!
Don't be that way!
Nobody's trying to trick you, I swear it!
Prove it, then!
There's no time like the present, asshole!
Damn you!
Get down there and bring her with us!
I need to see her!
You don't understand.
The way things are going, she... will.
We can't.
Let it go, Ymir.
Who knows whether we'll even manage to survive this.
Sorry.
It's just too risky.
Listen to me.
You have my word.
I want her out of this as much as you do.
Bear with me.
You have to trust us!
This is what's best for Christa!
Do you understand?
Yes, I understand.
Real question is, do you?
Of course!
All right, then.
Thank you for that.
It's happening again.
I've come so far.
Done so much.
And still wound up falling for my own bullshit.
Well.
They look promising.
What about this one?
Mm.
Hello there.
How would you feel about coming to live with us?
Think of it as the start of a brand-new life.
Of course, a brand-new life needs a brand-new name.
Don't you agree?
Huh?
That day...
That was the first time I lied to myself.
Told myself I had no say in the matter.
That I never had a choice.
But...
It is this Lady Ymir that inherits the blood of His Majesty the king.
So long as she graces us with her presence, immortality shall be ours.
To be fair, it wasn't all that bad.
My food wasn't cold.
I no longer slept in the dirt.
Lady Ymir.
Best of all, I knew what it meant to feel needed.
For the first time in my life,
I actually meant something to someone else.
That, by far, was more precious than anything.
Then, one day...
It's her fault!
The girl's to blame!
She said the blood of the king flowed in her veins!
We're only guilty of believing her!
I was cruelly reminded that everything
I clung to was an act.
Is that so?
I-I only...
It's true.
I am Ymir!
The king's blood runs through me!
Lie once, the rest follow easy.
If it saved their necks, so be it.
Trouble was, things didn't quite work out that way.
Help me!
Stop this!
I'm begging you!
It's not right!
That's when I realized I'd had it coming all along.
I'd deceived those gullible bastards, but that wasn't what I was being punished for really.
It was for deceiving myself into thinking someone needed me.
What else did I expect?
That's what comes of looking at the world through a veil.
Titan!
Run!
No!
When I opened my eyes, the first thing I saw was freedom.
The first thing I thought was if there's such thing as fate, she's a fickle little whore.
Right then and there
I made a vow.
No more deceiving myself.
No more falling for my own line.
From then on, I'd be real.
So, how did that play out?
Ah, the child was given the name "Christa Lenz."
Then, she was packed off to the Cadet Corps.
That is a pity.
Poor wretch.
Would've been better were she never born.
Are you trying to pick a fight?
All right, sure.
Makes no difference to me.
And then...
What do we have here?
This your idea of trying to be nice?
Well, uh.
And then I met you.
Immediately, I could tell.
You and I were the same.
You nourished yourself on lies.
Together, we give our hearts!
Sir!
Here was someone desperately trying to convince herself of something she knew wasn't true.
I get it.
Believe me.
And don't worry.
I'm not asking you to understand.
No.
What I want is very simple.
Just let me be honest with myself one last time.
That's all.
Let's face it, guys.
I'm the one best suited for this.
What are you doing?
Hey, shut the hell up and use your head for a second.
In a forest like this I'm the one who can shine.
Right?
Ymir!
Knock it off!
We'll fall!
Do you think that I give a damn?
I have the advantage.
Any other time you two would outclass me.
But my Titan form's more agile.
I could leap through the trees, grab Eren, and rendezvous with the Scouts before you knew what hit you.
Wouldn't be that hard.
Either you agree to take Christa with us today, right now, or so help me I will throw your whole plan out of whack!
Uh!
Are you completely insane?
That doesn't help her!
I thought that you genuinely cared!
I do.
In my way.
If it robs her of a future, then life's a bitch, but... by god I will live to see her again!
I've made my peace with what that says about me.
You guys have no idea what it's like.
She knows what a shitty person I am, but she still smiles at me.
I can't...
Damn it.
Don't be pissed.
I have a fairly decent plan.
Besides, if I stay and fight, it'll be easier for you three to get away.
Then again, if you don't like it, we can always tear each other apart like animals!
That light.
You saw it, too, huh?
It's coming from the forest!
I think someone's transforming into a Titan!
We're out of time.
Soldiers, disperse!
The enemy has assumed Titan form!
Find Eren and get him out of there!
Another MP.
Battle is not our objective!
Locate, recover, and retreat!
Round up the horses!
Right away, sir!
First thing we do is pinpoint the enemy and tell the others!
They're fleeing through the woods, so stay sharp!
Break!
- Eren.
- Where are you?
That's the scream of a Titan!
It came from just up ahead!
I can see you!
No, wait a second!
It's actually Ymir!
This is her Titan form.
She's one of the people they took!
What the hell happened?
Where is everybody else?
Is Eren okay?
What about Bertholdt and Reiner?
So this is Ymir.
Did she assume Titan form to take on
Reiner and escape?
Ymir!
What's the deal?
Did you manage to get away from them?
What direction did they go?
Give us something to go on!
Anything!
Say something already!
C'mon, ugly!
We're kinda in a rush!
Is she keeping an eye out for Reiner?
Something isn't right.
Why...
Why is she looking at us one by one?
Ymir!
There you are!
Thank goodness you're all right!
What?
Did she just...?
Ymir, what are you doing?
Don't just stand there!
Move your asses!
She's fast!
We're losing her!
Why would she do that?
What's wrong with you people?
Am I seriously the only one who saw this coming?
Well, it's clear where her loyalties are now!
She and Reiner are on the same side!
We were lured into a trap!
Heads up.
She's back.
Good.
Oh, no!
No!
They're getting away with Eren!
Move it!
Get on your damn horses!
This ain't over, y'hear me?
I'll get him back if it costs me my life!

It's like the report said...
The entire village is devastated, and yet there's not a drop of blood, let alone any bodies here.
Then... the villagers of Ragako were able to safely evacuate?
If that's the case, then the Titans were having a field day in a completely empty village.
That's hard to believe.
Furthermore... why would they evacuate without even taking a single horse?
Then what happened?
What could this mean?
Moblit, I found one!
This way!
There you are...
Moblit, look at this.
This is a portrait of Conny Springer's parents?
It's a strong possibility.
Kill it!
Wait!
Hold up!
Unbelievable...
"Children"
Will it be your petty life...
or Christa's future?
It's up to you to decide.
Hey, say something!
Who's the enemy?
!
Ymir!
Who knows...
It's settled then.
Too bad, Eren.
You're kidding...
The Scouts... are already...
Dammit!
Reiner.
What are you right now?
Relax, I'm a warrior.
You're saying to trust Ymir as a warrior?
Isn't she the one who ate Marcel?
Yeah, that's my point.
Ymir's motive is clear.
Once she turned human again, she probably roamed around and lived only caring about herself.
Until she met Christa...
And as cute as Christa is, we have other reasons to bring her to our side.
She's an important person in a family of the Church.
If Eren turns out not to be the Coordinate, our job isn't over yet.
Having Christa with us at that point will make our search much easier.
They're close.
What are they talking about?
Are they planning to leave before the sun sets?
Let's bring an end to it.
The next time we come here, we can take Annie, Christa, and that back home.
That way we won't have to come here anymore.
Right.
And our mission will be over.
But as for you...
When we get to our hometown, tell Annie how you feel.
Huh?
Wh-What do you mean?
You stare too much.
Enough that everyone can tell.
But I--
You should go for it.
You're both murderers with short lives ahead.
Who better to understand what we've gone through than one of us?
What's going on, Reiner?
Aren't we waiting until night?
Nope.
We're leaving now.
Eren, don't try to resist.
Come on, don't get violent with me.
Look at the shape that I'm in.
Does it look like I can resist?
Please, gimme a break.
Die!
Die!
Die!
Die!
Die!
Die!
I'll kill you!
I'll slaughter you!
--I'll kill you!
--Hey.
Why are we leaving already?
--Let go!
--Ymir.
When you turned back into a human, do you remember the person you ate?
No, I don't remember...
But if it was five years ago...
Was it one of your comrades?
I see...
Sorry... for not even remembering.
It's not your fault for forgetting.
It was the same for us, too.
I see...
Eren doesn't seem to remember either.
Is that how it works?
Do you resent me for it?
I'm not sure...
I... don't know.
You probably didn't want to eat a human either...
How long were you wandering outside the walls for?
About 60 years.
It was like...
I was stuck in a nightmare that would never end.
A red smoke signal.
What?
Commander!
We're surrounded!
There's a way around!
Should we head towards it?
No...
Any detours and we'll be too late.
We'll force our way through!
All soldiers, prepare for battle!
For now, let's get to a place without Titans!
We need to get as far away as possible!
My Titan form isn't very fast.
If I get surrounded, I won't be able to protect you guys!
Then why didn't we just wait until nightfall?
!
Smoke signals?
Did the Scouts come to rescue us?
Unless they brought loads of horses over the wall, that scouting formation won't work.
Someone made that call...
I didn't think it would happen so soon.
It must be Commander Erwin.
A tough opponent!
Shit...
They're already that close?
It's Eren's fault for going berserk.
It can't be...
She's...
No, she is!
Reiner!
Christa's here!
Christa came with them!
Huh?
!
If you want her, now's the chance!
How do you know?
You can't see her from here!
I just know it!
She's such a good-natured person, it's stupid!
I guarantee she came to save me!
I know it!
Even if that's true, it's no use!
We'll do it later!
Huh?
!
Our chance of succeeding is way too low!
How will you get Christa out of that formation?
Wait for a chance!
Wait for a chance?
Seriously?
Will that be after I'm eaten by one of your warriors?
No!
I don't trust you!
Trust me!
Christa is indispensable to us, too!
Then get her now!
Go prove it to me this instant!
It has to be now or never!
I want to see her right now!
At this rate...
I'll never get a chance... to see her again.
"Information Available for Public Disclosure" "Ymir's Hometown"
"It is not known where Ymir's hometown is located.
However, its location is most certainly outside the confines of the walls."
It's impossible.
I'm sorry, Ymir.
We don't even know if we can escape ourselves, let alone go back for her.
I promise you!
If anyone, it's Christa I want to save from this conflict!
You have to trust us!
So just bear with it!
This is for Christa's own sake!
Got it, Ymir?
!
Is it... really for Christa's sake?
Yeah!
Fine...
Thank you.
It's happening again, Christa...
I've come this far and yet it seems...
Will I have to lie to myself again?
Hey...
Here's a promising one.
How's this kid?
Yeah.
Hey, you there.
You're going to come live with us from now on.
You'll be able to live a brand-new life now.
A brand-new life... needs a brand-new name.
Understand?
That day... was the first time I lied to myself.
From that point on, I convinced myself...
that I never had a choice.
But...
It is this Lady Ymir who inherits the blood of the king.
As long as Lady Ymir is with us, we will be blessed with immortality.
Lady Ymir!
To be honest... it wasn't all that bad.
My food wasn't cold anymore...
And neither was my bed off the ground.
Lady Ymir.
But more than all... was the feeling of being needed by someone.
I served a purpose in someone's life for the first time ever.
To me, that was more precious than anything else.
But then, one day...
It's her!
She's the one who did it!
She told us she has the blood of the king!
All we did was believe her!
I was cruelly reminded that everything in my life was a lie.
Is that right?
N-N--
It's true.
I am Ymir!
The blood of the king runs through me!
And once again...
I told more lies.
If that's what it took to save everyone else...
However...
Things didn't work that way.
No!
Stop...
Please, stop!
I'm begging you!
That's when I knew...
This was my punishment.
It's not that I was being punished for deceiving all those people.
It was for convincing myself to believe...
to feel needed by someone.
It's what I deserved for continuing to lie to myself.
This was my punishment.
It's a Titan!
Run!
When I opened my eyes what I saw was freedom spread out before me.
If there was such a thing as fate, I can only laugh at how fickle it can be.
And in that moment I made a promise to myself.
I was done with telling lies.
I wasn't going to lie to myself anymore.
From then on, I'd live honest to myself.
So?
What ever happened with that?
She was given the name Christa Lenz and sent off to become a cadet.
What a pity.
She would have been better off not being born.
Are you talking about me?
!
Come on, now.
It makes no difference to me.
And then...
Hey, you.
So you're trying to do something "nice," huh?
Uh...
And then I met you.
I could tell right away...
...that you were the same as me...
That you fed yourself lies...
Give your hearts!
Yes, Sir!
That you were someone desperately trying to convince yourself...
But you know, Christa...
That's why...
I won't ask you to understand.
Just that that you give me one last time to be honest with myself.
I'm sorry...
In this environment, I'm the strongest one here.
Q-Quit it, Ymir!
Don't you think a forest like this is where I can shine the most?
Well?
Ymir!
Stop!
We'll fall!
Do you think I care?
If I became a Titan, I might be powerless compared to you, but I can jump through the trees and move swiftly.
I could snatch Eren away from you and go back to meet up with the Scouts and probably succeed.
If you don't agree to take Christa with you right now,
I'll get in your way and fight you right here.
Wh-What are you saying?
!
Don't you care what happens to her?
!
We can't help her that way!
Yeah, that's fine.
Even if it means taking her future away, I'll do what it takes to live and meet her.
I might be the shittiest person there ever was.
You guys don't know what it's like.
She knows how awful I am, and yet she still smiles at me... that girl.
You...
Don't be mad at me.
I have a plan for it.
If I stay and fight, it should be easier for you to escape anyways!
Or would you rather stay and kill each other?
!
Do you want me to prove how crazy I am?
!
A light?
Straight ahead in the forest!
I saw a light!
It's the light that appears when a Titan transforms!
Then we're just in time.
Soldiers, disperse!
We believe the enemy has already transformed!
Locate Eren and recover him!
Another one of the Police!
Battle is not our objective!
Prioritize recovery and retreat!
Phil!
Round up the horses!
Yes, Sir!
First thing is to find the enemy and let the others know!
They should be fleeing from the forest!
Break!
Eren.
Where are you?
!
Is that the scream of a Titan?
It came from ahead!
You can't hide from me!
Wait!
This is Ymir!
She's the one they took!
In Titan form!
Hey, Ymir!
Why are you the only one here?
!
Where's Eren?
!
What about Reiner!
?
Bertholdt?
!
So that's Ymir?
Did she turn into a Titan and fight with Reiner?
!
Ymir?
Did you get away from Reiner?
!
Where are they?
!
Tell us anything, Ymir!
Say something already!
Hey, ugly!
We're in a hurry!
Is she keeping an eye out for Reiner?
Something's not right.
Why... is she looking at everybody one by one?
Ymir!
Thank goodness!
You're all right!
Huh?
No...
She...
She ate Christa!
Don't just stand there!
Chase her!
She's fast!
We're losing her!
Why would Ymir do that?
!
I can't be the only one who could've guessed it would turn out this way!
Yeah!
She's clearly hostile to us now!
Looks like she's cooperating with Reiner!
She lured us right in!
Here she comes, Reiner.
Right.
Oh no...
Eren's being taken away!
Don't stop!
Get on your horse and chase!
I'm getting him back no matter what!
Even if it means trading my life for it!
The battle of pursuit begins.
The hunters and the hunted.
The intense emotions of friends made foe...
spill and clash on the battlefield.
But soldiers are falling far too quickly.
In a gamble waging the fate of humanity, Erwin executes a do-or-die strategy.
"Charge"
Next episode:
"Charge."
The Tesla factory...
America's largest industrial plant.
Behind me is one of the largest hydraulic stamping presses in north America.
It's actually seven stories high.
For this cutting-edge facility to build electric cars...
Suddenly, science fiction isn't tomorrow, it is today.
...engineers had to look to the past...
This beautiful machine, it's one of the world's first electric cars.
Brilliant engineering.
...to make the impossible possible. captions paid for by discovery communications
since the industrial revolution, factories have often been portrayed as dirty and dangerous places...
Churning out products at the expense of the work force.
But one American factory is challenging this view the Tesla factory.
Located in Fremont, California, this state-of-the-art automotive manufacturing facility is kick-starting a new technological era.
And Tesla's Alexis Georgeson has witnessed the birth of this giant industrial machine.
The processes here, in this factory, are designed to be as efficient as possible.
It's a 5.3 million square-foot facility.
This American car manufacturer revolutionized the industry with the world's first electric sports car.
But producing hundreds of thousands of electric cars for mass consumption required an even greater scale of engineering.
That's one of the biggest challenges ahead, as our CEO Elon Musk has said, is really building the machine that makes the machine.
Starting production in 2012, this machine is the biggest factory in the western hemisphere.
The 5.3 million square-foot factory employs 6,000 workers and state-of-the-art robots to transform raw materials into high-tech vehicles in just a few days.
Here, the staff and some of the world's mightiest machines come together to cast, stamp, paint, and assemble component parts into 2,000 cars every week.
That's before they go through the final lap on the factory's dedicated test track.
But making this many cars in a factory this big would have been impossible without mass production.
We're rethinking the way that the automotive industry has approached production in the past, through first principles of physics and through vertical integration and just really treating this as an engineering problem, first and foremost.
Once upon a time, there was no such thing as mass production.
Sword, please.
Everything was made by artisans.
Thanks, peasant.
Though charming and unique...
Tada!
hmm.
...the process was inconsistent...
What a chopper.
Mine's a tiddler.
...expensive...
More.
More.
More!
...and slow.
With this approach, making mass quantities of products was impossible.
What's this?
!
Gah!
But a revolutionary change was on the horizon.
Architect and historian Benedetto Camerana is in the iconic city of Venice, Italy, to reveal where mass production got its start.
In the middle ages, the Republic of Venice was a political power with a strong reputation for war and conquest.
The strength of the venetian empire was based on naval muscle and commercial trade.
Both needed ships and lots of them.
Naval boat building had been carried out in different shipyards sprawled throughout the city.
That could take weeks to produce a single galley.
And that was not fast enough.
In the 12th century, the Venetians developed a game-changing solution.
And this is it... the Venice arsenale.
Here, they completely re-imagined the way that ships were built.
For the first time in history, each individual component of a ship was mast produced...
Across a centralized row of specialized workshops.
The ships were moved around the dockyard to different workshops.
Each focused on pre-fabricating the different elements of the ship.
Hulls were made and launched as shells.
They were then towed across the shipyard and equipped with ready-made masts, rudders, and anchors.
At the final workshop, they were rigged and set up with oars and armaments.
At its height, they could assemble a galley per day here, which is truly incredible.
At the arsenale, venetian shipbuilders invented the production line.
And bringing this production line into the 20th century, engineer Giacomo matte-Trucco designed another one-of-a-kind factory in Turin, Italy, for the car company fiat, called the lingotto.
When it was completed in 1923, this was the largest car factory in the world... five stories high.
For the first time, all aspects of production came together in a single building.
Specialized workshops were placed strategically on each floor, producing parts that would be fitted to the vehicles as they progressed through the 1,600-foot-long factory.
Raw materials would arrive by rail to the ground floor of the building.
Here, they would fashion the car components.
On the second floor, the engines and bodies of the car were made.
One story up, gearboxes and steering were added.
The fourth floor specialized in brakes and upholstery.
And on the fifth floor, finishing touches were made.
Finally, the completed cars would emerge on the roof... the most iconic feature of the building.
All the cars coming off the lingotto production line came here, a purpose-built rooftop test track.
For nearly 60 years, this phenomenal test track high above the Turin skyline would have been witness to the birth of hundreds of thousands of cars.
For over 50 years, the lingotto factory produced countless vehicles until 1979.
But its tremendous legacy lives on.
At the Tesla factory in Fremont, California, the principles of mass production, first applied at the Venice arsenale and further developed at the lingotto, are getting a 21st-century makeover.
We move cars from one end to another.
So much of the factory is vertically integrated.
We're actually producing so many components here, in house, rather than shipping them from other parts of the world or other parts of the country.
While the production line principles remain the same, compared to factories of the past, the Tesla factory is practically unrecognizable.
We wanted this, first and foremost, to be a beautiful working environment that really was a testament to the quality of the products that we were building here.
So we came in, we repainted the entire space, we put sunlights in the roof.
We wanted a lot of natural light and a place where workers could come and be proud of the craftsmanship and the space where they were creating these products.
But to create a truly futuristic factory, filled with cutting-edge robots, the engineers had to draw on the great innovations of the past...
The robot is correcting itself to achieve its objective.
...to deliver more impossible engineering.
The Tesla factory.
As the largest industrial plant in America, this cutting-edge electric car company has one of the most advanced production lines on the planet.
The 5. 3 million square-foot factory takes raw materials in at one end, and in as little as three days, transforms them into cars.
6,000 workers interact with the most futuristic technologies to produce a staggering 2,000 electric cars a week, all of which go through the final lap on the dedicated test track.
But to produce vehicles on this vast and ever-growing scale, engineers had to design with extreme economy.
How do we streamline this?
How do we ramp production?
How do we keep the costs down?
And how to do we make this manufacturing process as efficient as possible?
To be ultra efficient, the engineers looked to one of modern history's great breakthroughs robots.
Science communicator Kate Mulcahy is in southwest England to find out how a scientific investigation into brain function actually led to a breakthrough in robotics.
Oh, lord, alive!
As I attempt to cross this beam, signals are being sent to my brain through my eyes, my inner ears, and my sensory systems.
This feedback helps me to correct my weight distribution, and, hopefully, I won't fall.
Each time Kate feels herself losing her balance, he senses warn her.
This sensation is something that scientists call negative feedback.
Yes!
For decades, scientists tried to incorporate this negative feedback into robots so that they could direct themselves.
And in 1948,
American-born neuroscientist William Grey Walter had a breakthrough and invented a truly pioneering robot.
And here it is!
Each machine contains two valves, two relays, two motors, and two sensors... one for light, and one for movement.
So, essentially, it's a two-cell nervous system, which, when you think about it, compared to the billions of nerve cells that are in our brain, isn't that many.
But it still did something really amazing.
Grey Walter called his device the tortoise.
The tortoise's sensors are designed to sense the light and move towards it.
So...
You can see it heading towards the light bulb right now.
The tortoise uses a photo-electric cell to detect the light.
That's the sensor you can see on top of it, moving back and forth.
When it registers the light, it stops the steering and moves towards it.
Because there are different light sources in the room, the tortoise regularly stops to check its position before adjusting its direction to move closer to the brightest light.
So, that's negative feedback.
Just like when I was balancing on the beam and adjusting myself, the robot is correcting itself to achieve its objective.
Now, if we put obstacles in its way, things get really interesting.
The shell of the robot now acts as a bump sensor.
So it's making decisions based on two sensors... one is sensing the light, and the other is detecting the obstacles.
Though it may look simple, this is actually complex behavior.
The tortoise has a different solution ever time the experiment is run, and each path it takes involves a multitude of different corrections and movements.
Every reaction they make is a result of sensing the environment around them.
Then, they react and create a new path.
Amazing!
For the first time, a machine could demonstrate a complex decision-making process, and this discovery paved the way for a revolution in robotics.
Autonomous machines have come to replace humans in many realms, from the domestic to outer space.
And they've revolutionized the industrial world.
But at the Tesla factory in California, engineers are integrating robots and workers to a much greater degree than the factories of the past...
Making it one of the most automated facilities on earth.
Some robots here even resemble Grey Walter's breakthrough tortoises.
We've solved a tough logistics problem in the factory, too, with the use of robots.
So our cars actually move around several sections of the process of production on these little smart carts.
Their robots that actually follow these magnetic strips in the floor, and they move from one section to the next, following these little strips.
Also using negative feedback, these robotic vehicles use sensors to spot people or objects in their way and wait until the path is clear.
Incredibly, they take themselves out of rotation when their batteries run low and put themselves back when fully recharged.
And this simple guidance system allows their routes to be adapted instantly.
But these carts are relatively primitive compared with most of the factory's robots.
The robots behind me are kuka robots.
They're actually trained to do up to five tasks.
They rivet, they weld, they glue, they move pieces from one part of the line to the other.
So they're incredibly smart robots.
Hundreds of the kuka robots perform amazingly complex but repetitive tasks with incredible precision...
And without ever getting bored.
But when it comes to heavy lifting and carrying 5,000-pound cars dynamically, engineers at the Tesla factory had to develop even more serious heavyweights...
So most conventional robotic arms that you'd find on the market wouldn't be able to lift weights nearly as close to this one.
...to make the impossible possible.
The Tesla factory.
As the largest industrial plant in the western hemisphere this technologically- advanced facility uses cutting-edge robots to help produce an astonishing
2,000 electric cars every week.
But for robots to actually lift and rotate 5,000-pound cars, engineers had to rely on a breakthrough innovation.
This is one seriously impressive robot.
This is the Fanuk M-2000ia/1200 multi-arm manipulator.
Now, this robot is so strong, it's capable of doing four times the work of a conventional robot.
It's able to lift a really impressive 1.2 tons, and it's used on the Tesla assembly line.
But its bigger brother, which is also in use on the Tesla assembly line, can lift a huge 2.3 tons.
Now, that's really useful if you want to move a car in a single lift.
So most conventional robotic arms that you'd find on the market wouldn't be able to lift weights nearly as close to this one.
On top of that, this robot is capable of running 24 hours a day and seven days a week.
Yes!
it's working!
Traditional ways of moving heavy weights, such as lifts or hoists, can only go up and down, whereas this, because of its six different axes, allow this robot to move with unbelievable accuracy.
And it's exactly this that Tesla uses to save them both time and money, and to ensure that cars can keep rolling off their production line.
And all of that make this a truly incredible feat of robotic engineering.
12 of these heavyweight robotic arms use the six different axes to provide both flexibility and sheer power to keep the car production going.
Named after superheroes, the likes of Wolverine and ice man continually lift up these heavy cars without breaking a sweat.
Robots are incredibly valuable in the automation of this process at helping us to ramp production and to make this process as seamless as possible.
But robots aren't the only remarkable machines required for a 21st-century car factory.
To produce hundreds of thousands of electric cars,
Tesla's engineers must continually satisfy a very modern challenge.
All of this is an effort to indulge as many electric vehicles and get them on the road as quick and seamless as possible.
The state-of-the-art Tesla factory is capable of producing electric cars in the kind of quantities once reserved for vehicles that use gasoline.
But to produce electric cars quickly, efficiently, and economically, engineers had to invent a completely new way of building them.
The way that other manufacturers have built electric vehicles in the past was to basically gut internal-combustion engine vehicles and put battery packs wherever they would fit.
But we've built the car from the ground up.
And this new process starts with the basics.
Behind me are giant coils of aluminum.
This is the start of production for these vehicles.
It's the raw material that comes through this end of the factory.
They're 20,000 pounds of aluminum coils.
Traditionally, most automobiles are made with steel.
But because the batteries that power electric motors are so heavy...
Manufacturers had to use a different material aluminum, which is more commonly used in the aerospace industry.
Aluminum is incredibly light weight, very durable, and safe.
We've really designed these cars from the ground up to maximize safety and efficiency, and aluminum helps us do that.
But how can you turn aluminum sheets into car body parts quickly and accurately enough and still make production cost-effective?
To do this, engineers had to look to another manufacturing breakthrough from the past...
And his methods were picked up and used by Henry Ford and other pioneers of the automotive industry.
...to make the impossible possible.
The Tesla factory in Fremont, California, is the largest industrial plant in the western hemisphere.
This futuristic facility produces over 2,000 electric cars every week made of aluminum.
But to shape the vehicles with this material, engineers had to rely on an inventive manufacturing process from the past... the industrial press.
Today, bicycles are everywhere.
But when they first appeared, they were strictly for the rich.
Historian Chris sweet is on the trail of the industrial innovation that brought bicycles to everyone.
Late-19th century bikes were luxury items, costing up to $100 each.
That was as much as an average worker would make in six months.
But all that changed here, in Chicago.
In the late 19th century, entrepreneur Adolph Schoeninger revolutionized how bicycles were made.
Because early metal bicycles were manufactured using a cumbersome process,
Schoeninger hoped to improve the building technique.
Traditional method of making bicycle components was known as drop forging.
It involved taking a chunk of metal and heating it till it was malleable, like this chunk of Clay, and forging it into shape by repeated pounding.
It was a long, labor-intensive, and expensive process.
That is what Schoeninger wanted to change.
And this is what he did.
He came up with an industrial press to shape cold steel.
Imagine this sandwich maker is our press.
You put in a sheet of cold steel...
Press it.
Out comes a three-dimensional bicycle component ready to be assembled and painted.
By pressing bicycle components with an industrial press instead of forging them,
Schoeninger slashed the prices of its bicycles, finally making them affordable to the general public.
Soon, Schoeninger's western wheel works was turning out 70,000 bikes a year, with markets as far away as Europe, transforming Chicago into the bike capital of the world.
And his methods were picked up and used by Henry Ford and other pioneers of the automotive industry.
The mass stamping of parts revolutionized manufacturing in America and around the world.
At the Tesla factory, engineers have super-sized
Schoeninger's revolutionary industrial press to shape the cars.
This is one of the largest hydraulic stamping presses in north America.
It's actually seven stories high.
We can only see four stories.
Three of them are actually underground.
There are five main sections of this press, each one weighing up to about a million pounds.
The giant stamping press uses a variety of heads to turn the flat sheets of aluminum into all kinds of ultra-lightweight car body parts.
And cold-forming the aluminum helps preserve the physical strength of each component.
You need a machine that can exert a ton of pressure and force down on those panels without a lot of heat.
That's what this hydraulic press is capable of doing.
We take those sheets of aluminum that you saw, and they're actually stamped between four to five times as they move down here.
This powerful press is capable of exerting around 9,000 tons of pressure per square inch, the equivalent of having 3,000 cars pressing down on your thumbnail.
The seven-story-tall monster press can create strong, complex shapes quickly and at a much lower cost than other techniques like hot forming or machining.
This is an incredibly important machine to us to help stamp the individual parts for model S and model X.
They're electric vehicles, and they're already very heavy cars because battery packs weight a lot.
So it was important that the other parts of the vehicle be as light-weight as possible for efficiency.
The aluminum panels make the range and the safety very, very possible in these cars.
But these fresh-pressed panels must also be painted.
So how do you efficiently paint 2,000 cars a week without waste?
This would have been impossible without the innovation of electrostatic painting.
To reveal the origins of industrial painting, physicist Suzie Sheehy is visiting an inner-city graffiti workshop where the inefficient use of paint is clear.
Spray painting is a brilliant way to cover a surface area with an even coat of paint.
But as any graffiti artist can tell you, it's pretty messy and inexact.
As the paint particles are released from the pressurized canister, they have a tendency to go everywhere, all over your hands and the floor.
That's leads to a lot of wasted and scattered paint, which is both costly and inefficient.
During the depression of the 1930s,
Harold Ransburg was working at his father's house ware factory when he saw how much industrial paint was simply getting wasted.
This salt shaker is exactly the kind of article that Ransburg was trying to paint.
So if I try and paint it you can see there's a lot of mess and a lot of wastage, and I haven't even really achieved a very good finish.
And you can imagine on an industrial scale how expensive that would be.
So with lab assistant Harry green,
Ransburg experimented with electrical currents.
Because negative and positive charges attract each other,
Ransburg and green introduced an electrical charge to the painting line in order to attract all the paint to the product without waste.
And in 1938,
Ransburg spent all the money he had, $35, to buy a high-voltage transformer typically used in hospital X-ray machines.
I'm gonna use a Van Der Graaf generator instead, but the principle is more or less the same.
This generator uses a moving belt to build up an electrical charge in a hollow metal globe.
To if I connect this up, that will give a positive charge to the shaker and then the paint, which is still neutral, is gonna become attracted to it... at least, that's the theory.
All right.
So, if I just ground the paint tin.
Switch it on.
Let's see.
Oh, that's great.
So it's actually coating all around the sides.
It's actually pulling the paint all around, onto the back.
It's got a really good coverage, and, actually, there's a lot less paint wasted, as well.
Called electrostatic painting,
Ransburg's pioneering technique transformed industrial painting across the world.
You might not realize it, but electrostatic painting is used to decorate all kinds of everyday objects... from shop fronts to railings, lamp posts to bicycles.
We are surrounded by the fruits of Harold Ransburg's innovative approach to painting.
80 years on, the Tesla factory has taken electrostatic painting to a level that Harold Ransburg could only have dreamed of.
In a state-of-the-art paint shop, each car is attached to an electricity source and grounded.
Robots spray positively-charge paint that is electrostatically attracted to the car.
Primer, color, and, finally, a clear coat are efficiently applied with very little waste to create a completely flawless finish.
But mass producing electric cars effectively and efficiently isn't the only challenge the factory faces.
To surpass the high expectations of the car-driving public,
Tesla's engineers had to overcome the historic problems of the electric car... 20 miles an hour.
I'd say that's about as fast as I'd like to go.
...to create even more impossible engineering.
In California, Tesla's engineering innovators are in the process of creating the factory of the future, attempting to turn the more-than-century-old automobile industry on its head.
They're using advanced robotics and technology to bring back the electric car and transform it from a niche item to an everyday mass-produced product.
Everything about the 5.3 million-square-foot facility is designed for speed, accuracy, and efficiency.
But technical advances aren't the only challenges the factory faces.
It must also turn out a vehicle that the public, who are used to the speeds and distances that internal-combustion engines provide, will actually want.
Hmm.
In 1908, Henry Ford had a bright idea...
Aha!
...to bring the internal-combustion engine to the people.
The revolutionary technology changed the world...
Demand for gasoline went through the roof.
I'm rich!
Cities swelled as new suburbs within reach of the workplace grew.
Hi, honey!
I'm home!
Modern life quickly centered around the internal-combustion engine.
And people could go faster...
And further than ever before.
But once upon a time, the combustion engine had a surprising rival... the electric car.
This is a pope-waverley.
Built in 1901, it's one of the world's first electric cars.
And this particular one was used by Harrods for deliveries.
Physicist Suzie Sheehy is taking a ride on this classic piece of American engineering.
It's a little-known fact that at the turn of the century, about a third of all cars were electric powered.
When the automobile was first invented, there were three main forms of propulsion... internal combustion, steam-driven, and the popular battery-powered engines.
Now, this beautiful machine, in its day, would have had a range of about 20 miles and a top speed of a whopping 20 miles an hour.
But having driven in it for a while,
I'd say that's about as fast as I'd like to go.
But electric cars were soon eclipsed because automobiles running on gasoline developed a longer range, became more reliable, and got much faster, leaving the electric car in the dust.
But Tesla's designers and engineers believe they've overcome the problems that held the electric car back.
To see how, rally race driver Alex Roy is taking the model S out for a test drive.
Earlier generations of electric vehicles didn't have the benefit of batteries with decent power density.
It is the first time that you have an electric vehicle that's a genuine sports car.
With the model S...
You can do this.
And that is Ferrari-level acceleration.
It's...
It's impressive.
The beating heart of the design is the powerful electric motor.
And it couldn't be more different from a traditional internal-combustion engine.
The standard gasoline engine has hundreds of moving parts.
But the motor on the model S and model X only has one moving piece...
the rotor.
Powering it are nearly 7,000 small lithium-ion batteries packed into a tray that fits in the floor of the vehicle.
And to produce these batteries,
Tesla is doing something extraordinary creating an even bigger factory, the size of which has never been seen before on planet earth.
It's still under construction.
We're building it in phases so that we can actually start production of battery cells and packs inside while we continue construction outside.
That factory will, once complete, be the largest building in the world by footprint.
Called the Giga-factory, this enormous solar-powered facility in Nevada will take the mass production of batteries for electric cars to an unprecedented scale.
Within a couple of years, we'll be putting hundreds of thousands of battery packs out every year.
These powerful batteries, combined with radical automotive design, allow the electric car to drive much further distances.
But to compete with the hundreds of miles that gasoline-powered vehicles can go on a single tank of gas,
Tesla's engineers had to give the electric car yet another source of power.
It's an absolutely brilliant piece of engineering.
And, suddenly...
Science fiction isn't tomorrow, it is today.
...to make the impossible electric car...
Possible.
The Tesla factory... as the largest industrial plant in America, this facility has produced and sold over 200,000 electric cars worldwide.
But making a battery-powered vehicle that can drive as far and as fast as gas-powered cars would have been impossible without giving it more power.
Anyone who's ever ridden a bicycle...
Whoo-hoo!
...knows how much power is wasted when you brake.
The kinetic energy from the bike's forward motion is thrown away as the brake pads rub against the tires, converting that energy to heat.
Just how much energy is lost becomes painfully obvious when you start pedaling again.
Determined to use the energy normally lost in braking,
Tesla's engineers have coordinated the motor to work with the brakes.
When the brakes slow the vehicle, the motor also acts as a generator and converts the otherwise wasted energy into electricity, returning it to the batteries.
This energy recycling process is called regenerative braking.
Regenerative braking is a technology that grew out of racing.
And in formula 1, regenerative braking was developed to make cars go faster.
In a Tesla, that extends the car's range, and it's one of the reasons the Tesla has a range of 300 miles as opposed to earlier generations of electric cars, which were restricted to 250, 200, even 150.
All this means electric cars can now match the distances of gasoline-powered vehicles.
If you didn't have a regenerative braking system dumping power back into the battery,
I would imagine you'd have somewhere between a, you know, 10% and 30% drop in range.
It's an absolutely brilliant piece of engineering.
And, suddenly...
Science fiction isn't tomorrow, it is today.
These trailblazing engineering innovations would not be possible without the giant cutting-edge factory that builds them.
This extraordinary engineering process begins with humble coils of aluminum sheets...
And ends just a few days later on the test track.
That can-do, think-outside-the-box is really something that informs both the vehicle and the factory side of the equation here at Tesla.
You'll see that both in the engineering of our products, as well as the engineering and in our approach to manufacturing and production within this facility.
By drawing from the great innovators of the past...
This was the largest car factory in the world.
Oh, that's great!
Amazing!
...adapting their ideas, and making trailblazing discoveries of their own...
Every single manufacturer will be making a car just like this with their own brand on it within five years.
Things can be done better.
You don't have to be trapped in the past.
...the planners, designers, and engineers behind this futuristic factory are succeeding in making the impossible possible.
Being in this factory, certainly, is something that, I think, every employee can agree is something they're incredibly proud of.
She's messing with some pretty powerful people here.
They wanna shut her up, they can.
This was Linda's boyfriend.
He was with US Air Force.
I didn't hurt Linda.
I could never hurt her.
We were in love.
Bradley's a sideshow here, you know that.
Don't make the cover-up worse than the crime.
He's done it.
The Iraq veteran, the young backbencher, has just won!
He's the real thing, where your investment should lie.
How did you even get to know Linda?
Her uncle.
Phil Simms.
You saw Linda that night, didn't you?
I dropped him off.
I drove away.
Who else?
Linda's friend.
Rachel Leigh.
Do you remember the autopsy report?
She was buried here.
If you were exposed, you and your bloody sinister cabal...
Why would we kill a girl, even by accident, then conceal the facts?
You're scared.
Is it for yourself, or is it for someone else?
Get out!
Met the love of my life here.
And then I lost him.
You were 18.
It would have ruined your life.
Now how do we know what it would have done to my life?
They're trying to hide something that happened weeks before the war.
There was security business on the base that night.
Private planes landing.
VIPs.
Why did they come to the UK?
There is no interest in investigating what happened 14 years ago.
We need to find Rachel Leigh.
She told a big fat lie.
Oh, God!
Way down in the water
Way down in the hole
Far away from any soul
'Where there is discord, may we bring harmony.
And where there is despair, may we bring hope.'
I'm coming back from the fire
Put your trust in us.
Crawling back from the flames
We shall repay that trust for you.
Coming back from the fire, not burning down
Turn it!
Spin it!
Spin the camera.
Spin the camera!
I'm so sorry.
I should have left him in jail, then he'd still be alive.
All the fuss I made, what did it do?
It proved he was innocent.
It proved nothing.
I'm sorry, Kevin.
You said you'd found something.
Well, I...
I had, erm...
I have.
So what are you going to do with it?
Well, it's difficult.
Why?
If you've found something.
I can't get anyone to listen.
I tried, I really did.
And now he's dead... so who cares, right?
And he's still guilty.
Forever.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Fuck it!
I...
I killed him because I took a deal.
I promised I'd prove him innocent.
Annie was right.
I should have left him in jail.
Sssh.
You did everything you could.
No, no, no, no, no.
Dreaming of glory?
Still a long way to go and a great deal to be done.
Alastair told me that Banville knows, that she worked it out.
How?
It doesn't matter.
She can't do anything about it, because A... nobody cares and B... she can't connect it to the girl.
Nothing connects to the girl.
Not quite nothing.
That's another issue, isn't it?
You, at least, are in the clear, as long as you hold your nerve.
Do you think Banville will just give up?
Her client's dead, her credibility's shot.
Any normal person would.
So, will you head back to the States?
Mm-mm.
Not yet.
I think you should.
You think I don't want to?
That I wouldn't rather be with my children, instead of wading through all this... this shit?
You still need me.
What if she doesn't give up?
Then I'll drop a fucking rock on her head.
The Kevin Russell case is now closed.
Give Maggie what she needs to present the bill by the end of the week.
That includes you, Emma.
Yes.
As far the Attars are concerned...
I assume we'll just take the loss?
Emma?
Emma?
Emma?
Sorry.
Em?
Is that you, love?
Yeah.
'February '03, I was working in the Cabinet Office.'
'I met a chap called Kretchmer from the US Department of Defense and an Iraqi scientist, he had information about Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons.'
'Who else was there that evening?
'
'There were some British and American intelligence officers.
Even if I knew their names, I wouldn't tell you.'
'You're still missing someone.'
'Why would we?
Kill a girl, even by accident, and then conceal the facts, lie about it?
Tell me, why?
'
'You're scared.
Why?
Get out!
Is it for yourself or is it for someone else?
Get out!
'
'Who else was there that evening?
'
'I'm scared, Daddy, really scared.'
'It's OK.
Trust me.'
Daddy, I'm scared.
I'm so scared, Daddy.
Daddy, what is it?
'
'Oh, Daddy!
'
'Trust me.'
'You can't keep the baby now, you can't.'
'Trust me.'
I had the dream again.
Me on the wall.
My dad.
The photograph.
How did it end?
It didn't.
It never does.
And he's gonna die soon and it's all gonna be left unsaid.
Then why don't you talk to him, have it out?
Yeah, but it's gonna upset him too much.
Well, not doing it is gonna be worse, for both of you.
Yeah.
This is just silly.
Come to bed.
The best sausages you've ever ever had!
I'll be the judge of that.
Thank you.
Ignore that.
Thank you.
I knew it.
Typical.
Yeah?
'It's Olivia Greenwood.'
What do you want?
'I heard about Kevin Russell.'
I'm sorry.
Look, I know this is probably irrelevant.
because you'll have moved on...
No.
It was you who moved on.
I tried to find you, I only got that fool Staines.
Do you want to hear what I've got?
OK.
I found Rachel Leigh's mother.
A nursing home in Finchley.
Are you gonna go and talk to her?
I can't.
I've been suspended.
Do you want the address or not?
Yeah.
St Agatha's, Milburn Road, Finchley.
Just so you know, the home said she has dementia.
It may be a waste of time.
If I find anything, do you want me to call you?
Yeah.
Keep me informed.
I'm sorry about all this.
What do you want?
I had an odd conversation with that American woman, Heather Myles.
What was odd about it?
Her interest in Banville.
In the threat that Miriam Attar made against Banville.
She seemed to take it seriously, but we haven't, it just didn't seem...
So maybe you should just be honest with me for once.
Why is this woman so interested in Banville?
Does she have many visitors?
Not while I've been here, which is more than three years.
And does she ever mention her family?
She hasn't mentioned anyone.
She's in her own world.
Not more than ten minutes.
OK?
Maureen?
'.. tonight's programme, Matthew Wild, the man everyone is saying could be...'
Hello, Maureen, I'm Emma Banville.
Why has she taken my breakfast?
Erm...
Can I talk to you?
She did, you know.
Every last...
last bit, the greedy beast.
I'd like to show you something.
No, no.
Not hungry.
A photo.
Do you recognise either of these girls?
That's your daughter Rachel, with the dark hair.
Do you know where she is?
Do you... '..
I would stop us ever making the same mistake again.'
When did you last see Rachel?
Sssh.
Sssh.
Sssh.
Sssh.
' Well, the day I first met my wife.
My whole life changed.'
'Do you remember that day?
'
Why?
Why?
Why?
'Yeah.
Absolutely.
She was handing out leaflets and knocking on doors in the pouring rain...'
Why has she changed her hair?
'Well, I did win and Laura and I are in it together now for the long haul.
For better or for worse.'
'So that's where we leave them, the new leader and his family, in a brief moment of relaxation before he starts the biggest battle of his career.'
How did you become her?
Douglas, it's Emma.
Yeah.
I'm sorry to call you so late.
I've got another favour.
Matthew Wild.
Now, I know he was in the Army in 2003, but where was he?
Hello, Heather.
Laura, this is not a good idea.
Banville knows.
She went to see my mother.
Well, your mother is hardly in a state to talk...
I have security software which monitors searches in my name.
After she saw her, she went online.
She searched for me.
You said you'd look after me.
Remember?
My silence... your protection.
We gave you a new life abroad, away from all this.
You've made protecting you more difficult, haven't you, by diving right back into it?
I'd been away ten years.
I wanted to come home.
Did "home" have to include throwing yourself in front of Matthew Wild?
I fell in love.
Love?
Don't make me laugh.
You saw your meal ticket and you grabbed it.
The cute little party worker, you just fell right at his feet with your legs wide open.
Did you tell him who you were before or after you fucked him?
I'm not the problem.
OK?
The problem is Banville.
So... what are you going to do?
I'll have people watching her.
Don't worry.
She may call you.
If she does, call me with this.
Stay calm.
Keep your nerve.
The souls of the just are in the hand of God.
They seemed to be dead and their passing away was an affliction and their going from us utter destruction.
But they are in peace.
For if before men they be punished, yet is their hope full of immortality.
Because God tried them and found them worthy of himself.
I told you we should have kept her locked up in the States.
If we'd kept her here, she would have become the story.
Which would have meant even more questions, wouldn't it?
You heard she got to Alastair?
Yes.
To what effect?
None.
Alastair kept his nerve.
Everyone has to keep their nerve, including you.
My nerve is fine, thank you.
It's others whom I can't guarantee.
And she's sniffing around them now.
So, what's the answer?
Why don't you tell me, sir?
This is your area, Heather, damage control.
So control the damage.
'.. then five minutes later, he was arrested by the terrorist police.'
'Emma always warned Yusef he was running a huge risk.'
'But I'm telling you what they say.
Now Emma is the one who's running the risk.'
It's me.
That extra resource I requested at GCHQ?
Not necessary any more.
This is huge, Em.
Are you gonna confront her?
Not yet.
I'm still waiting for a piece of the puzzle.
We've got company.
My condolences.
He's over there.
Why don't you give them to him yourself?
I will.
What is it?
We're aware of a threat made against you.
Miriam Attar.
I told her.
What are you doing about it?
Nothing.
I represent child killers, terrorists, rapists.
I get shit through my letter box, I get bricks through the window.
Have you noticed anyone following you or watching you?
You mean, apart from the police?
I'll deny ever saying this, but if you were surveilled that one time, that is no longer the case.
What are you saying?
You need to be careful.
Check your car before you drive.
Vary your routes.
And don't open any unexpected packages.
You're saying Yusef Attar's people would follow through on this?
I'm saying it would be made to look like them.
So watch yourself.
For how long?
That depends.
On what?
Have you really buried Russell?
I don't know.
Then be careful.
What's going on?
I'm off.
Back to the Middle East desk.
What about Ruby?
Well, she's off the list.
No longer a person of interest, apparently.
And now there's no one watching over her.
Not even us.
I'm sending you a file.
Start laying a trail.
Get on it now.
Are you guys outside her house?
'Yeah.
For now.'
Poor Kev.
I liked him, you know.
What do you think they're gonna put on his gravestone?
Annie hasn't decided yet.
Is that the time?
Nearly kick-off.
I was gonna see the lads in the pub, but...
I'm not that bothered, really.
Go on.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
You're ace.
Douglas?
'You asked about Matthew Wild in 2003.'
Yeah.
What did you find?
In February 2003, his unit, the Royal Anglians, was in Kuwait, getting ready for the big fuck-up.
So he was nowhere near the UK?
Wrong.
His unit was in Kuwait.
But he was in London, working for the Ministry of Defence.
Doing what?
In charge of the MOD unit evaluating the battlefield threat of Saddam's WMD programmes.
He was the liaison between the MOD and MI6.
He would have seen all the intel MI6 was developing.
And the CIA.
He was there, that night at the base.
He was the one with the expertise.
'Not necessarily.'
'I know they were protecting someone.
This is who...
Matthew Wild.'
You don't know that and you certainly can't prove it.
I can't prove it, but there's other stuff I know that makes it more than likely.
How did you find this?
The Government would never reveal this.
I spoke to a mate in the Anglians.
He served with Wild in Iraq.
Wild told him what he did before the war.
He could have stayed in London but he wanted to be with his unit.
Maybe he felt guilty.
Why would he?
Emma?
'Yeah.'
Wild was the one with the expertise, wasn't he?
Must have known the WMD story was crap, but he kept his mouth shut in exchange for a glittering political career.
Funny thing about being a soldier, you obey orders.
My friend spoke highly of Wild, said he was the real deal.
So whatever happened at that airbase, whoever was there, is he the man you want to go after?
Douglas, this isn't a bunch of people having a chat.
Someone died.
I know you do a lot of good things, Emma.
But this... these people you're going up against... they're very dangerous.
Yeah.
'I'll be fine.'
Aye, I know, it's been a long time.
Hang on.
I'll just get this.
Emma, what's up?
I think Greenwood was right.
I AM being followed.
A van, two men in it, outside my house.
And at the cemetery.
Think the spooks are still after you?
I don't know.
'Is it outside your place now?
'
No, not now.
But it was there ten minutes ago.
'Jesus, what's going on?
' You should call Greenwood.
Tell her.
No.
'Em, if you're being followed, call the cops.'
No.
Look...
I'm just going nuts.
I'm just imagining things.
Kevin's dead.
Whatever stones you've turned over... whatever's crawled out, won't bring him back.
'So putting your life in danger is really not worth it.'
Do you hear me?
Yeah.
Thanks, Dom.
Oh, Jason!
Dad told me about coming here.
He said he liked your house.
He said it was crazy.
Is it really over?
You said you were close.
I am, but as a lawyer, I have to take concrete evidence to the police, so they can... well, so they have to investigate.
Why can't you get the evidence?
Well, because to do that, I'd have to get smart people... really smart people to incriminate themselves.
And they won't.
So these smart people... you know who they are but you can't get them?
And that's it?
You're giving up?
Well, it's more complicated than that.
What do you mean?
I can't say.
Um... does your mum know where you are?
No.
OK, well, it's too late to go home.
So let's call her and you can stay the night.
I'm just gonna go and get you a sleeping bag.
Why are you scared of them?
'You're a warrior.'
'Nathan...'
'Never stop fighting.
Never stop.'
Hello, Zeinab, it's Emma.
'It's a bit late, babes.
What's up?
'
Do you have a number for Matthew Wild?
'What left-wing do-gooder doesn't?
'
Even better, do you have a number for his wife?
Banville just called.
'Did you speak with her?
'
I let it go to voicemail.
But she wants to meet with me tonight.
What do I do, ignore it?
Where are you?
'London...
Matthew's house in Bermondsey.'
'Where's he?
' Out.
A National Committee meeting.
Call her.
Say you'll meet tonight.
No.
No, I won't.
Yes.
Yes, you will.
'I hoped she'd quit but she won't.
Wait 30 minutes, then call her.'
Understood.
Bye.
'Are you set?
'
Yeah.
'You're clear to go.' What's the address?
Target on site.
Ms Banville.
Come in.
Thank you.
She's inside.
We a go?
Yeah.
I've got a story to tell... about a secret meeting before the Iraq War.
About falsified intelligence, about lies that were told to Parliament, to the country.
Mm... sounds... very exciting.
And it's about the people who were at this meeting, one of whom, I believe, was your husband.
It doesn't sound very likely.
Matthew was against the war... even when he was in the Army.
Where was this meeting?
Oh, an airbase in East Anglia, the night of 1st February, 2003.
Do you recognise the date?
No, it was before I met Matthew.
So why are you telling me this and not him?
Well, that's the thing.
I mean, no-one cares about this story.
It's old.
We all know what happens in the end.
We were deceived into fighting a war.
Thousands of people died, it was all a horrible mistake.
So what difference does one more detail make?
You're probably right.
But again... why are you telling me?
Because I think if I add you to the story... the beautiful wife of the new Leader of the Opposition,
I think people WILL care.
What on earth are you talking about?
You were on the base that night...
Rachel... with your friend.
What friend?
Her.
Linda Simms.
We're set.
There were two girls on the base that night.
One died, one got away.
I never went near the base.
Linda's uncle, Phil Simms, swears he dropped you there.
The only time I ever met Phil Simms was about six weeks ago, with Matthew.
I agreed to meet you because Matthew and I admire your work.
But in this case, you're so wide of the mark, it's embarrassing.
Now I want you to leave.
Do you know the thing that I think the media will find most intriguing, most entertaining?
It's how Rachel Leigh, ordinary schoolgirl... vanished for ten years.
And then reappears...
Bam!
as Laura Wild.
I mean, that's a story.
That's front page.
Girl goes abroad to learn a language.
Girl comes home.
Gets married.
If you think that's a story, well, good luck.
Now I want you to leave.
Linda nearly got clear.
She had a chance of another life and I'm sure she told you about it, about Logan, and that's why you went to the base.
You wanted the same.
Just go.
And I understand why you did it.
What else was there for a girl like you in a place like that?
You saw your opportunity and you grabbed it.
Get out!
What I don't understand and what I can't forgive you for is for Kevin.
You knew he was innocent and you dragged him in and you destroyed him.
What's she doing here?
Going on about Linda Simms, making ridiculous accusations.
What's wrong with you?
Coming to my home, upsetting my wife?
Just telling her my story.
What story?
Why don't you ask her?
Come away from the windows.
What?
Why?
Because she said so.
Please.
She?
Who?
Heather.
Oh, no.
No!
How?
The car.
Banville's been threatened by one of her terrorist clients.
She had it coming.
But here, outside our home?
She's trying to destroy us.
Her car!
Stop!
Don't do that.
What are you talking about?
You've been threatened.
People you represented.
How do you know?
I don't.
But you do, don't you?
Oh, my God.
They'd kill me to protect you.
Are you that important?
You know what?
Sod it.
Emma, for Christ's sake!
Are you scared for me or for yourself?
I'm trying to help you.
So you just tell me what happened that night.
Now, I know you were there, with Alastair McKinnon, with Kretchmer, with the Iraqi.
I know.
Just tell me what happened.
Don't!
I'll stand down.
I'll resign.
Tell me what happened.
I'm offering to give up my entire life.
Well, Linda never had a life.
Neither did Kevin.
Now, you tell me what happened and I will walk away, I will leave you alone.
It was an accident!
Tell me.
There was a meeting.
All the people you said.
We were leaving.
'Suddenly there was a girl, she was coming towards us.
She was smiling.'
Stop!
I said, stop right there!
Stop, or we will fire!
'We weren't who she was expecting.
She panicked.'
Get in the car quickly!
'We got the principals out of there.
We were clear.'
There was no way she could recognise any of us, not in the glare from the lights.
So what happened?
She ran out in front of me.
I couldn't stop.
Well, then it was an accident.
It was a bloody accident!
Why didn't you just say?
It was the wrong time, the wrong people.
If it had come out...
It was a secret meeting.
'The Iraqi scientist... his lies.'
Everyone's lies.
And your wife?
How was she involved?
She was there.
She saw everything.
So she lied too?
God, you people!
You just think you can change reality, don't you?
I was never one of those people!
I have been making up for this ever since!
And I will go on making up for it!
So you should just go free because you've got good intentions?
Well, Kevin's dead.
And Kevin spent 14 years in prison for your crime!
For YOUR crime!
It was an accident.
Should there be no accountability?
You said you'd walk away.
Please.
Jesus!
I lied.
You got everything?
Yeah, we got it all.
Could you give us a moment, please?
Glad you got your job back.
I'm glad you called.
Well done.
That was quite the catch.
A little bit late.
For Kevin, yes.
I'm sorry.
Not just for Kevin.
For everyone.
So you'll do what you promised?
I'll try.
No, you'll succeed.
Miriam Attar released, all charges against her dropped.
Don't let another innocent person suffer.
OK.
You need to come with me.
I have diplomatic immunity.
No, you don't.
Hello, little man.
Thank you, Emma.
You did good.
'I'm here.
I'll catch you.
Come on.
Trust me.'
Why did you believe he didn't do it?
It was more that I didn't trust the other side.
At first, anyway.
Then I got to know him, then I believed him.
Why didn't you trust the other side?
Oh, I learnt a long time ago not to trust what people tell me.
Especially from people in authority.
Why?
Because you never know their reasons.
When I was young, I was shown a piece of evidence by people I trusted.
What was it?
A photo.
A photo that seemed to show that the man I was in love with... was a liar and a cheat.
What was in the photo?
Him and another woman, with the same last name, holding a baby.
So I thought it was his wife and his child because that's how it had been presented.
But it wasn't.
It was his sister?
Yeah, it was his sister and HER child... which I learned four years later.
Four years too late.
So I lost him.
And I lost a whole lot more than that.
And it changed my life.
And it broke my heart.
I misread the evidence.
I was too angry and upset to question it.
But question.
That's the point.
Always question.
Your mum's here.
Make him proud.
They wanna shut her up.
This was Linda's boyfriend.
He was with US Air Force.
I didn't hurt Linda.
I could never hurt her.
We were in love.
Bradley's a sideshow here.
Don't make the coverup worse than the crime.
He's done it.
The Iraq veteran, the young backbencher, has just won!
He's the real thing, where your investment should lie.
- How did you get to know Linda?
- Her uncle introduced us.
Phil Simms.
You saw Linda that night, didn't you?
I dropped him off.
I drove away.
- Who else?
- Linda's friend.
Rachel Leigh.
Do you remember the autopsy report?
She was buried here.
If you were exposed, you and your bloody sinister cabal...
Why would we kill a girl, even by accident, then conceal the facts?
You're scared.
Is it for yourself or for someone else?
Get out!
Met the love of my life here.
Then I lost him.
18.
It would have ruined your life.
How do we know what it would have done to my life?
They're trying to hide something that happened weeks before the war.
There was security business on the base.
Private planes landing.
VIPs.
Why did they come to the UK?
There is no interest in investigating what happened 14 years ago.
We need to find Rachel Leigh.
She told a big fat lie.
God!
'Where there is discord, may we bring harmony.
And where there is despair, may we bring hope.'
Put your trust in us.
We shall repay that trust for you.
Turn it!
Spin it!
Spin the camera.
Spin the camera!
I'm so sorry.
I should have left him in jail, then he'd still be alive.
All the fuss I made, what did it do?
It proved he was innocent.
It proved nothing.
I'm sorry, Kevin.
You said you'd found something.
Well, I...
I had, erm...
I have.
So what are you going to do with it?
Well, it's difficult.
Why?
If you've found something.
I can't get anyone to listen.
I tried, I really did.
And now he's dead... so who cares, right?
And he's still guilty.
Forever.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Fuck it!
I...
I killed him because I took a deal.
I promised I'd prove him innocent.
Annie was right.
I should have left him in jail.
Sssh.
You did everything you could.
No, no, no, no, no.
Dreaming of glory?
Still a long way to go and a great deal to be done.
Alastair told me that Banville knows, that she worked it out.
How?
It doesn't matter.
She can't do anything about it, because A:
Nobody cares she can't connect it to the girl.
Nothing connects to the girl.
Not quite nothing.
That's another issue, isn't it?
You, at least, are in the clear, as long as you hold your nerve.
Do you think Banville will just give up?
Her client's dead, her credibility's shot.
Any normal person would.
So, will you head back to the States?
-.
- Not yet.
- I think you should.
You think I don't want to?
That I wouldn't rather be with my children, instead of wading through all this... this shit?
You still need me.
What if she doesn't give up?
Then I'll drop a fucking rock on her head.
The Kevin Russell case is now closed.
Give Maggie what she needs to present the bill by the end of the week.
That includes you, Emma.
Yes.
As far the Attars are concerned...
I assume we'll just take the loss?
Emma?
Emma?
Emma?
Sorry.
Em?
Is that you, love?
Yeah.
'February '03, I was working in the Cabinet Office.'
'I met a chap called Kretchmer from the US Department of Defense and an Iraqi scientist, he had information about Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons.'
'Who else was there that evening?
'
'There were some British and American intelligence officers.
Even if I knew their names, I wouldn't tell you.'
'You're still missing someone.'
'Why would we?
Kill a girl, even by accident, and then conceal the facts, lie about it?
Tell me, why?
'
'You're scared.
- Why?
- Get out!
Is it for yourself or is it for someone else?
Get out!
'
'Who else was there that evening?
'
'I'm scared, Daddy, really scared.'
'It's OK.
Trust me.'
Daddy, I'm scared.
I'm so scared, Daddy.
Daddy, what is it?
'
'Daddy!
'
'Trust me.'
'You can't keep the baby now, you can't.'
'Trust me.'
I had the dream again.
Me on the wall.
My dad.
The photograph.
How did it end?
It didn't.
It never does.
And he's gonna die soon and it's all gonna be left unsaid.
Then why don't you talk to him, have it out?
Yeah, but it's gonna upset him too much.
Well, not doing it is gonna be worse, for both of you.
Yeah.
This is just silly.
Come to bed.
The best sausages you've ever ever had!
- I'll be the judge of that.
- Thank you.
Ignore that.
I knew it.
Typical.
- Yeah?
- 'It's Olivia Greenwood.'
- What do you want?
- 'I heard about Kevin Russell.'
I'm sorry.
Look, I know this is probably irrelevant.
Because you'll have moved on...
No.
It was you who moved on.
I tried to find you, I only got that fool Staines.
Do you want to hear what I've got?
OK.
I found Rachel Leigh's mother.
A nursing home in Finchley.
- Are you gonna go and talk to her?
- I can't.
I've been suspended.
- Do you want the address or not?
- Yeah.
St Agatha's, Milburn Road, Finchley.
Just so you know, the home said she has dementia.
It may be a waste of time.
If I find anything, do you want me to call you?
Yeah.
Keep me informed.
I'm sorry about all this.
What do you want?
I had an odd conversation with that American woman, Heather Myles.
What was odd about it?
Her interest in Banville.
In the threat that Miriam Attar made against Banville.
She seemed to take it seriously, but we haven't, it just didn't seem...
So maybe you should just be honest with me for once.
Why is this woman so interested in Banville?
Does she have many visitors?
Not while I've been here, which is more than three years.
And does she ever mention her family?
She hasn't mentioned anyone.
She's in her own world.
Not more than ten minutes.
OK?
Maureen?
'..
Tonight's programme, Matthew Wild, the man everyone is saying could be...'
Hello, Maureen, I'm Emma Banville.
Why has she taken my breakfast?
Erm...
Can I talk to you?
She did, you know.
Every last...
last bit, the greedy beast.
I'd like to show you something.
No, no.
Not hungry.
A photo.
Do you recognise either of these girls?
That's your daughter Rachel, with the dark hair.
Do you know where she is?
Do you... '..
I would stop us ever making the same mistake again.'
- When did you last see Rachel?
- Sssh.
Sssh.
Sssh.
Sssh.
' Well, the day I first met my wife.
My whole life changed.'
'Do you remember that day?
'
- Why?
Why?
Why?
- 'Yeah.
Absolutely.
She was handing out leaflets and knocking on doors in the pouring rain...'
Why has she changed her hair?
'Well, I did win and Laura and I are in it together now for the long haul.
For better or for worse.'
'So that's where we leave them, the new leader and his family, in a brief moment of relaxation before he starts the biggest battle of his career.'
How did you become her?
Douglas, it's Emma.
Yeah.
I'm sorry to call you so late.
I've got another favour.
Matthew Wild.
Now, I know he was in the Army in 2003, but where was he?
- Hello, Heather.
- Laura, this is not a good idea.
Banville knows.
She went to see my mother.
Well, your mother is hardly in a state to talk...
I have security software which monitors searches in my name.
After she saw her, she went online.
She searched for me.
You said you'd look after me.
Remember?
My silence... your protection.
We gave you a new life abroad, away from all this.
You've made protecting you more difficult, haven't you, by diving right back into it?
I'd been away ten years.
I wanted to come home.
Did "home" have to include throwing yourself in front of Matthew Wild?
- I fell in love.
- Love?
Don't make me laugh.
You saw your meal ticket and you grabbed it.
The cute little party worker, you just fell right at his feet with your legs wide open.
Did you tell him who you were before or after you fucked him?
I'm not the problem.
OK?
The problem is Banville.
So... what are you going to do?
I'll have people watching her.
Don't worry.
She may call you.
If she does, call me with this.
Stay calm.
Keep your nerve.
The souls of the just are in the hand of God.
They seemed to be dead and their passing away was an affliction and their going from us utter destruction.
But they are in peace.
For if before men they be punished, yet is their hope full of immortality.
Because God tried them and found them worthy of himself.
I told you we should have kept her locked up in the States.
If we'd kept her here, she would have become the story.
Which would have meant even more questions, wouldn't it?
- You heard she got to Alastair?
- Yes.
To what effect?
None.
Alastair kept his nerve.
Everyone has to keep their nerve, including you.
My nerve is fine, thank you.
It's others whom I can't guarantee.
- And she's sniffing around them now.
- So, what's the answer?
Why don't you tell me, sir?
This is your area, Heather, damage control.
So control the damage.
'..
Then five minutes later, he was arrested by the terrorist police.'
'Emma always warned Yusef he was running a huge risk.'
'But I'm telling you what they say.
Now Emma is the one who's running the risk.'
It's me.
That extra resource I requested at GCHQ?
Not necessary any more.
This is huge, Em.
Are you gonna confront her?
Not yet.
I'm still waiting for a piece of the puzzle.
We've got company.
My condolences.
He's over there.
Why don't you give them to him yourself?
I will.
What is it?
We're aware of a threat made against you.
Miriam Attar.
I told her.
What are you doing about it?
Nothing.
I represent child killers, terrorists, rapists.
I get shit through my letter box, I get bricks through the window.
Have you noticed anyone following you or watching you?
You mean, apart from the police?
I'll deny ever saying this, but if you were surveilled that one time, that is no longer the case.
What are you saying?
You need to be careful.
Check your car before you drive.
Vary your routes.
And don't open any unexpected packages.
You're saying Yusef Attar's people would follow through on this?
I'm saying it would be made to look like them.
So watch yourself.
For how long?
- That depends.
- On what?
Have you really buried Russell?
I don't know.
Then be careful.
- What's going on?
- I'm off.
- Back to the Middle East desk.
- What about Ruby?
Well, she's off the list.
No longer a person of interest, apparently.
And now there's no one watching over her.
Not even us.
I'm sending you a file.
Start laying a trail.
Get on it now.
Are you guys outside her house?
'Yeah.
For now.'
Poor Kev.
I liked him, you know.
What do you think they're gonna put on his gravestone?
Annie hasn't decided yet.
Is that the time?
Nearly kickoff.
I was gonna see the lads in the pub, but...
I'm not that bothered, really.
Go on.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
You're ace.
Douglas?
'You asked about Matthew Wild in 2003.'
Yeah.
- What did you find?
- In February 2003, his unit, the Royal Anglians, was in Kuwait, getting ready for the big fuckup.
So he was nowhere near the UK?
Wrong.
His unit was in Kuwait.
But he was in London, working for the Ministry of Defence.
Doing what?
In charge of the MOD unit evaluating the battlefield threat of Saddam's WMD programmes.
He was the liaison between the MOD and MI6.
He would have seen all the intel MI6 was developing.
And the CIA.
He was there, that night at the base.
- He was the one with the expertise.
- 'Not necessarily.'
'I know they were protecting someone.
This is who...
Matthew Wild.'
You don't know that and you certainly can't prove it.
I can't prove it, but there's other stuff I know that makes it more than likely.
How did you find this?
The Government would never reveal this.
I spoke to a mate in the Anglians.
He served with Wild in Iraq.
Wild told him what he did before the war.
He could have stayed in London but he wanted to be with his unit.
- Maybe he felt guilty.
- Why would he?
- Emma?
- 'Yeah.'
Wild was the one with the expertise, wasn't he?
Must have known the WMD story was crap, but he kept his mouth shut in exchange for a glittering political career.
Funny thing about being a soldier, you obey orders.
My friend spoke highly of Wild, said he was the real deal.
So whatever happened at that airbase, whoever was there, is he the man you want to go after?
Douglas, this isn't a bunch of people having a chat.
Someone died.
I know you do a lot of good things, Emma.
But this... these people you're going up against... they're very dangerous.
Yeah.
'I'll be fine.'
Aye, I know, it's been a long time.
Hang on.
I'll just get this.
Emma, what's up?
I think Greenwood was right.
I AM being followed.
A van, two men in it, outside my house.
And at the cemetery.
Think the spooks are still after you?
- I don't know.
- 'Is it outside your place now?
'
No, not now.
But it was there ten minutes ago.
- 'Jesus, what's going on?
'
- You should call Greenwood.
Tell her.
No. - 'Em, if you're being followed, call the cops.'
No.
Look...
I'm just going nuts.
I'm just imagining things.
Kevin's dead.
Whatever stones you've turned over... whatever's crawled out, won't bring him back.
'So putting your life in danger is really not worth it.'
Do you hear me?
Yeah.
'Thanks, Dom.'
Jason!
Dad told me about coming here.
He said he liked your house.
He said it was crazy.
Is it really over?
You said you were close.
I am, but as a lawyer, I have to take concrete evidence to the police, so they can... well, so they have to investigate.
Why can't you get the evidence?
Well, because to do that, I'd have to get smart people... really smart people to incriminate themselves.
And they won't.
So these smart people... you know who they are but you can't get them?
And that's it?
You're giving up?
Well, it's more complicated than that.
What do you mean?
I can't say.
Um... does your mum know where you are?
No.
OK, well, it's too late to go home.
So let's call her and you can stay the night.
I'm just gonna go and get you a sleeping bag.
Why are you scared of them?
'You're a warrior.'
'Nathan...'
'Never stop fighting.
Never stop.'
Hello, Zeinab, it's Emma.
'It's a bit late, babes.
What's up?
'
Do you have a number for Matthew Wild?
'What leftwing dogooder doesn't?
'
Even better, do you have a number for his wife?
- Banville just called.
- 'Did you speak with her?
'
I let it go to voicemail.
But she wants to meet with me tonight.
What do I do, ignore it?
Where are you?
'London...
Matthew's house in Bermondsey.'
- 'Where's he?
'
- Out.
A National Committee meeting.
Call her.
Say you'll meet tonight.
No.
No, I won't.
Yes.
Yes, you will.
'I hoped she'd quit but she won't.
Wait 30 minutes, then call her.'
Understood.
Bye.
'Are you set?
'
Yeah.
- 'You're clear to go.'
- What's the address?
Target on site.
Ms Banville.
Come in.
Thank you.
She's inside.
We a go?
Yeah.
I've got a story to tell... about a secret meeting before the Iraq War.
About falsified intelligence, about lies that were told to Parliament, to the country.
Sounds... very exciting.
And it's about the people who were at this meeting, one of whom, I believe, was your husband.
It doesn't sound very likely.
Matthew was against the war... even when he was in the Army.
Where was this meeting?
An airbase in East Anglia, the night of 1st February, 2003.
Do you recognise the date?
No, it was before I met Matthew.
So why are you telling me this and not him?
Well, that's the thing.
I mean, no one cares about this story.
It's old.
We all know what happens in the end.
We were deceived into fighting a war.
Thousands of people died, it was all a horrible mistake.
So what difference does one more detail make?
You're probably right.
But again... why are you telling me?
Because I think if I add you to the story... the beautiful wife of the new Leader of the Opposition,
I think people WILL care.
What on earth are you talking about?
You were on the base that night...
Rachel... with your friend.
What friend?
Her.
Linda Simms.
We're set.
There were two girls on the base that night.
One died, one got away.
I never went near the base.
Linda's uncle, Phil Simms, swears he dropped you there.
The only time I ever met Phil Simms was about six weeks ago, with Matthew.
I agreed to meet you because Matthew and I admire your work.
But in this case, you're so wide of the mark, it's embarrassing.
Now I want you to leave.
Do you know the thing that I think the media will find most intriguing, most entertaining?
It's how Rachel Leigh, ordinary schoolgirl... vanished for ten years.
And then reappears...
bam!
As Laura Wild.
I mean, that's a story.
That's front page.
Girl goes abroad to learn a language.
Girl comes home.
Gets married.
If you think that's a story, well, good luck.
Now I want you to leave.
Linda nearly got clear.
She had a chance of another life and I'm sure she told you about it, about Logan, and that's why you went to the base.
- You wanted the same.
- Just go.
And I understand why you did it.
What else was there for a girl like you in a place like that?
You saw your opportunity and you grabbed it.
Get out!
What I don't understand and what I can't forgive you for is for Kevin.
You knew he was innocent and you dragged him in and you destroyed him.
What's she doing here?
Going on about Linda Simms, making ridiculous accusations.
What's wrong with you?
Coming to my home, upsetting my wife?
Just telling her my story.
What story?
Why don't you ask her?
What?
Why?
Because she said so.
Please.
- She?
Who?
- Heather.
No.
- No!
How?
- The car.
Banville's been threatened by one of her terrorist clients.
She had it coming.
But here, outside our home?
She's trying to destroy us.
Her car!
Stop!
Don't do that.
What are you talking about?
You've been threatened.
People you represented.
How do you know?
I don't.
But you do, don't you?
My God.
They'd kill me to protect you.
Are you that important?
You know what?
Sod it.
Emma, for Christ's sake!
Are you scared for me or for yourself?
I'm trying to help you.
So you just tell me what happened that night.
Now, I know you were there, with Alastair McKinnon, with Kretchmer, with the Iraqi.
I know.
Just tell me what happened.
Don't!
I'll stand down.
I'll resign.
Tell me what happened.
I'm offering to give up my entire life.
Well, Linda never had a life.
Neither did Kevin.
Now, you tell me what happened and I will walk away, I will leave you alone.
It was an accident!
Tell me.
There was a meeting.
All the people you said.
We were leaving.
'Suddenly there was a girl, she was coming towards us.
She was smiling.'
Stop!
I said, stop right there!
Stop, or we will fire!
'We weren't who she was expecting.
She panicked.'
Get in the car quickly!
'We got the principals out of there.
We were clear.'
There was no way she could recognise any of us, not in the glare from the lights.
So what happened?
She ran out in front of me.
I couldn't stop.
Well, then it was an accident.
It was a bloody accident!
Why didn't you just say?
It was the wrong time, the wrong people.
If it had come out...
It was a secret meeting.
'The Iraqi scientist... his lies.'
Everyone's lies.
And your wife?
How was she involved?
'She was there.
She saw everything.'
'So she lied too?
'
God, you people!
You just think you can change reality, don't you?
I was never one of those people!
I have been making up for this ever since!
And I will go on making up for it!
So you should just go free because you've got good intentions?
Well, Kevin's dead.
And Kevin spent 14 years in prison for your crime!
For YOUR crime!
It was an accident.
Should there be no accountability?
You said you'd walk away.
Please.
Jesus!
I lied.
You got everything?
Yeah, we got it all.
Could you give us a moment, please?
Glad you got your job back.
I'm glad you called.
Well done.
That was quite the catch.
A little bit late.
For Kevin, yes.
I'm sorry.
Not just for Kevin.
For everyone.
So you'll do what you promised?
I'll try.
No, you'll succeed.
Miriam Attar released, all charges against her dropped.
Don't let another innocent person suffer.
OK.
You need to come with me.
I have diplomatic immunity.
No, you don't.
Hello, little man.
Thank you, Emma.
You did good.
'I'm here.
I'll catch you.
Come on.
Trust me.'
Why did you believe he didn't do it?
It was more that I didn't trust the other side.
At first, anyway.
Then I got to know him, then I believed him.
Why didn't you trust the other side?
I learnt a long time ago not to trust what people tell me.
Especially from people in authority.
Why?
Because you never know their reasons.
When I was young, I was shown a piece of evidence by people I trusted.
- What was it?
- A photo.
A photo that seemed to show that the man I was in love with... was a liar and a cheat.
What was in the photo?
Him and another woman, with the same last name, holding a baby.
So of course I thought it was his wife and his child because that's how it had been presented.
But it wasn't.
It was his sister?
Yeah, it was his sister and HER child... which I learned four years later.
Four years too late.
So I lost him.
And I lost a whole lot more than that.
And it changed my life.
And it broke my heart.
I misread the evidence.
I was too angry and upset to question it.
But question.
That's the point.
Always question.
Your mum's here.
Make him proud.
She's messing with some pretty powerful people here.
They wanna shut her up, they can.
This was Linda's boyfriend.
He was with US Air Force.
I didn't hurt Linda.
I could never hurt her.
We were in love.
Bradley's a sideshow here, you know that.
Don't make the cover-up worse than the crime.
He's done it.
The Iraq veteran, the young backbencher, has just won!
He's the real thing, where your investment should lie.
How did you even get to know Linda?
Her uncle.
Phil Simms.
You saw Linda that night, didn't you?
I dropped him off.
I drove away.
Who else?
Linda's friend.
Rachel Leigh.
Do you remember the autopsy report?
She was buried here.
If you were exposed, you and your bloody sinister cabal...
Why would we kill a girl, even by accident, then conceal the facts?
You're scared.
Is it for yourself, or is it for someone else?
Get out!
Met the love of my life here.
And then I lost him.
You were 18.
It would have ruined your life.
Now how do we know what it would have done to my life?
They're trying to hide something that happened weeks before the war.
There was security business on the base that night.
Private planes landing.
VIPs.
Why did they come to the UK?
There is no interest in investigating what happened 14 years ago.
We need to find Rachel Leigh.
She told a big fat lie.
Oh, God!
Way down in the water
Way down in the hole
Far away from any soul
'Where there is discord, may we bring harmony.
And where there is despair, may we bring hope.'
I'm coming back from the fire
Put your trust in us.
Crawling back from the flames
We shall repay that trust for you.
Coming back from the fire, not burning down
Turn it!
Spin it!
Spin the camera.
Spin the camera!
I'm so sorry.
I should have left him in jail, then he'd still be alive.
All the fuss I made, what did it do?
It proved he was innocent.
It proved nothing.
I'm sorry, Kevin.
You said you'd found something.
Well, I...
I had, erm...
I have.
So what are you going to do with it?
Well, it's difficult.
Why?
If you've found something.
I can't get anyone to listen.
I tried, I really did.
And now he's dead... so who cares, right?
And he's still guilty.
Forever.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Fuck it!
I...
I killed him because I took a deal.
I promised I'd prove him innocent.
Annie was right.
I should have left him in jail.
Sssh.
You did everything you could.
No, no, no, no, no.
Dreaming of glory?
Still a long way to go and a great deal to be done.
Alastair told me that Banville knows, that she worked it out.
How?
It doesn't matter.
She can't do anything about it, because A... nobody cares and B... she can't connect it to the girl.
Nothing connects to the girl.
Not quite nothing.
That's another issue, isn't it?
You, at least, are in the clear, as long as you hold your nerve.
Do you think Banville will just give up?
Her client's dead, her credibility's shot.
Any normal person would.
So, will you head back to the States?
Mm-mm.
Not yet.
I think you should.
You think I don't want to?
That I wouldn't rather be with my children, instead of wading through all this... this shit?
You still need me.
What if she doesn't give up?
Then I'll drop a fucking rock on her head.
The Kevin Russell case is now closed.
Give Maggie what she needs to present the bill by the end of the week.
That includes you, Emma.
Yes.
As far the Attars are concerned...
I assume we'll just take the loss?
Emma?
Emma?
Emma?
Sorry.
Em?
Is that you, love?
Yeah.
'February '03, I was working in the Cabinet Office.'
'I met a chap called Kretchmer from the US Department of Defense and an Iraqi scientist, he had information about Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons.'
'Who else was there that evening?
'
'There were some British and American intelligence officers.
Even if I knew their names, I wouldn't tell you.'
'You're still missing someone.'
'Why would we?
Kill a girl, even by accident, and then conceal the facts, lie about it?
Tell me, why?
'
'You're scared.
Why?
Get out!
Is it for yourself or is it for someone else?
Get out!
'
'Who else was there that evening?
'
'I'm scared, Daddy, really scared.'
'It's OK.
Trust me.'
Daddy, I'm scared.
I'm so scared, Daddy.
Daddy, what is it?
'
'Oh, Daddy!
'
'Trust me.'
'You can't keep the baby now, you can't.'
'Trust me.'
I had the dream again.
Me on the wall.
My dad.
The photograph.
How did it end?
It didn't.
It never does.
And he's gonna die soon and it's all gonna be left unsaid.
Then why don't you talk to him, have it out?
Yeah, but it's gonna upset him too much.
Well, not doing it is gonna be worse, for both of you.
Yeah.
This is just silly.
Come to bed.
The best sausages you've ever ever had!
I'll be the judge of that.
Thank you.
Ignore that.
Thank you.
I knew it.
Typical.
Yeah?
'It's Olivia Greenwood.'
What do you want?
'I heard about Kevin Russell.'
I'm sorry.
Look, I know this is probably irrelevant.
because you'll have moved on...
No.
It was you who moved on.
I tried to find you, I only got that fool Staines.
Do you want to hear what I've got?
OK.
I found Rachel Leigh's mother.
A nursing home in Finchley.
Are you gonna go and talk to her?
I can't.
I've been suspended.
Do you want the address or not?
Yeah.
St Agatha's, Milburn Road, Finchley.
Just so you know, the home said she has dementia.
It may be a waste of time.
If I find anything, do you want me to call you?
Yeah.
Keep me informed.
I'm sorry about all this.
What do you want?
I had an odd conversation with that American woman, Heather Myles.
What was odd about it?
Her interest in Banville.
In the threat that Miriam Attar made against Banville.
She seemed to take it seriously, but we haven't, it just didn't seem...
So maybe you should just be honest with me for once.
Why is this woman so interested in Banville?
Does she have many visitors?
Not while I've been here, which is more than three years.
And does she ever mention her family?
She hasn't mentioned anyone.
She's in her own world.
Not more than ten minutes.
OK?
Maureen?
'.. tonight's programme, Matthew Wild, the man everyone is saying could be...'
Hello, Maureen, I'm Emma Banville.
Why has she taken my breakfast?
Erm...
Can I talk to you?
She did, you know.
Every last...
last bit, the greedy beast.
I'd like to show you something.
No, no.
Not hungry.
A photo.
Do you recognise either of these girls?
That's your daughter Rachel, with the dark hair.
Do you know where she is?
Do you... '..
I would stop us ever making the same mistake again.'
When did you last see Rachel?
Sssh.
Sssh.
Sssh.
Sssh.
' Well, the day I first met my wife.
My whole life changed.'
'Do you remember that day?
'
Why?
Why?
Why?
'Yeah.
Absolutely.
She was handing out leaflets and knocking on doors in the pouring rain...'
Why has she changed her hair?
'Well, I did win and Laura and I are in it together now for the long haul.
For better or for worse.'
'So that's where we leave them, the new leader and his family, in a brief moment of relaxation before he starts the biggest battle of his career.'
How did you become her?
Douglas, it's Emma.
Yeah.
I'm sorry to call you so late.
I've got another favour.
Matthew Wild.
Now, I know he was in the Army in 2003, but where was he?
Hello, Heather.
Laura, this is not a good idea.
Banville knows.
She went to see my mother.
Well, your mother is hardly in a state to talk...
I have security software which monitors searches in my name.
After she saw her, she went online.
She searched for me.
You said you'd look after me.
Remember?
My silence... your protection.
We gave you a new life abroad, away from all this.
You've made protecting you more difficult, haven't you, by diving right back into it?
I'd been away ten years.
I wanted to come home.
Did "home" have to include throwing yourself in front of Matthew Wild?
I fell in love.
Love?
Don't make me laugh.
You saw your meal ticket and you grabbed it.
The cute little party worker, you just fell right at his feet with your legs wide open.
Did you tell him who you were before or after you fucked him?
I'm not the problem.
OK?
The problem is Banville.
So... what are you going to do?
I'll have people watching her.
Don't worry.
She may call you.
If she does, call me with this.
Stay calm.
Keep your nerve.
The souls of the just are in the hand of God.
They seemed to be dead and their passing away was an affliction and their going from us utter destruction.
But they are in peace.
For if before men they be punished, yet is their hope full of immortality.
Because God tried them and found them worthy of himself.
I told you we should have kept her locked up in the States.
If we'd kept her here, she would have become the story.
Which would have meant even more questions, wouldn't it?
You heard she got to Alastair?
Yes.
To what effect?
None.
Alastair kept his nerve.
Everyone has to keep their nerve, including you.
My nerve is fine, thank you.
It's others whom I can't guarantee.
And she's sniffing around them now.
So, what's the answer?
Why don't you tell me, sir?
This is your area, Heather, damage control.
So control the damage.
'.. then five minutes later, he was arrested by the terrorist police.'
'Emma always warned Yusef he was running a huge risk.'
'But I'm telling you what they say.
Now Emma is the one who's running the risk.'
It's me.
That extra resource I requested at GCHQ?
Not necessary any more.
This is huge, Em.
Are you gonna confront her?
Not yet.
I'm still waiting for a piece of the puzzle.
We've got company.
My condolences.
He's over there.
Why don't you give them to him yourself?
I will.
What is it?
We're aware of a threat made against you.
Miriam Attar.
I told her.
What are you doing about it?
Nothing.
I represent child killers, terrorists, rapists.
I get shit through my letter box, I get bricks through the window.
Have you noticed anyone following you or watching you?
You mean, apart from the police?
I'll deny ever saying this, but if you were surveilled that one time, that is no longer the case.
What are you saying?
You need to be careful.
Check your car before you drive.
Vary your routes.
And don't open any unexpected packages.
You're saying Yusef Attar's people would follow through on this?
I'm saying it would be made to look like them.
So watch yourself.
For how long?
That depends.
On what?
Have you really buried Russell?
I don't know.
Then be careful.
What's going on?
I'm off.
Back to the Middle East desk.
What about Ruby?
Well, she's off the list.
No longer a person of interest, apparently.
And now there's no one watching over her.
Not even us.
I'm sending you a file.
Start laying a trail.
Get on it now.
Are you guys outside her house?
'Yeah.
For now.'
Poor Kev.
I liked him, you know.
What do you think they're gonna put on his gravestone?
Annie hasn't decided yet.
Is that the time?
Nearly kick-off.
I was gonna see the lads in the pub, but...
I'm not that bothered, really.
Go on.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
You're ace.
Douglas?
'You asked about Matthew Wild in 2003.'
Yeah.
What did you find?
In February 2003, his unit, the Royal Anglians, was in Kuwait, getting ready for the big fuck-up.
So he was nowhere near the UK?
Wrong.
His unit was in Kuwait.
But he was in London, working for the Ministry of Defence.
Doing what?
In charge of the MOD unit evaluating the battlefield threat of Saddam's WMD programmes.
He was the liaison between the MOD and MI6.
He would have seen all the intel MI6 was developing.
And the CIA.
He was there, that night at the base.
He was the one with the expertise.
'Not necessarily.'
'I know they were protecting someone.
This is who...
Matthew Wild.'
You don't know that and you certainly can't prove it.
I can't prove it, but there's other stuff I know that makes it more than likely.
How did you find this?
The Government would never reveal this.
I spoke to a mate in the Anglians.
He served with Wild in Iraq.
Wild told him what he did before the war.
He could have stayed in London but he wanted to be with his unit.
Maybe he felt guilty.
Why would he?
Emma?
'Yeah.'
Wild was the one with the expertise, wasn't he?
Must have known the WMD story was crap, but he kept his mouth shut in exchange for a glittering political career.
Funny thing about being a soldier, you obey orders.
My friend spoke highly of Wild, said he was the real deal.
So whatever happened at that airbase, whoever was there, is he the man you want to go after?
Douglas, this isn't a bunch of people having a chat.
Someone died.
I know you do a lot of good things, Emma.
But this... these people you're going up against... they're very dangerous.
Yeah.
'I'll be fine.'
Aye, I know, it's been a long time.
Hang on.
I'll just get this.
Emma, what's up?
I think Greenwood was right.
I AM being followed.
A van, two men in it, outside my house.
And at the cemetery.
Think the spooks are still after you?
I don't know.
'Is it outside your place now?
'
No, not now.
But it was there ten minutes ago.
'Jesus, what's going on?
' You should call Greenwood.
Tell her.
No.
'Em, if you're being followed, call the cops.'
No.
Look...
I'm just going nuts.
I'm just imagining things.
Kevin's dead.
Whatever stones you've turned over... whatever's crawled out, won't bring him back.
'So putting your life in danger is really not worth it.'
Do you hear me?
Yeah.
'Thanks, Dom.'
Oh, Jason!
Dad told me about coming here.
He said he liked your house.
He said it was crazy.
Is it really over?
You said you were close.
I am, but as a lawyer, I have to take concrete evidence to the police, so they can... well, so they have to investigate.
Why can't you get the evidence?
Well, because to do that, I'd have to get smart people... really smart people to incriminate themselves.
And they won't.
So these smart people... you know who they are but you can't get them?
And that's it?
You're giving up?
Well, it's more complicated than that.
What do you mean?
I can't say.
Um... does your mum know where you are?
No.
OK, well, it's too late to go home.
So let's call her and you can stay the night.
I'm just gonna go and get you a sleeping bag.
Why are you scared of them?
'You're a warrior.'
'Nathan...'
'Never stop fighting.
Never stop.'
Hello, Zeinab, it's Emma.
'It's a bit late, babes.
What's up?
'
Do you have a number for Matthew Wild?
'What left-wing do-gooder doesn't?
'
Even better, do you have a number for his wife?
Banville just called.
'Did you speak with her?
'
I let it go to voicemail.
But she wants to meet with me tonight.
What do I do, ignore it?
Where are you?
'London...
Matthew's house in Bermondsey.'
'Where's he?
' Out.
A National Committee meeting.
Call her.
Say you'll meet tonight.
No.
No, I won't.
Yes.
Yes, you will.
'I hoped she'd quit but she won't.
Wait 30 minutes, then call her.'
Understood.
Bye.
'Are you set?
'
Yeah.
'You're clear to go.' What's the address?
Target on site.
Ms Banville.
Come in.
Thank you.
She's inside.
We a go?
Yeah.
I've got a story to tell... about a secret meeting before the Iraq War.
About falsified intelligence, about lies that were told to Parliament, to the country.
Mm... sounds... very exciting.
And it's about the people who were at this meeting, one of whom, I believe, was your husband.
It doesn't sound very likely.
Matthew was against the war... even when he was in the Army.
Where was this meeting?
Oh, an airbase in East Anglia, the night of 1st February, 2003.
Do you recognise the date?
No, it was before I met Matthew.
So why are you telling me this and not him?
Well, that's the thing.
I mean, no-one cares about this story.
It's old.
We all know what happens in the end.
We were deceived into fighting a war.
Thousands of people died, it was all a horrible mistake.
So what difference does one more detail make?
You're probably right.
But again... why are you telling me?
Because I think if I add you to the story... the beautiful wife of the new Leader of the Opposition,
I think people WILL care.
What on earth are you talking about?
You were on the base that night...
Rachel... with your friend.
What friend?
Her.
Linda Simms.
We're set.
There were two girls on the base that night.
One died, one got away.
I never went near the base.
Linda's uncle, Phil Simms, swears he dropped you there.
The only time I ever met Phil Simms was about six weeks ago, with Matthew.
I agreed to meet you because Matthew and I admire your work.
But in this case, you're so wide of the mark, it's embarrassing.
Now I want you to leave.
Do you know the thing that I think the media will find most intriguing, most entertaining?
It's how Rachel Leigh, ordinary schoolgirl... vanished for ten years.
And then reappears...
Bam!
as Laura Wild.
I mean, that's a story.
That's front page.
Girl goes abroad to learn a language.
Girl comes home.
Gets married.
If you think that's a story, well, good luck.
Now I want you to leave.
Linda nearly got clear.
She had a chance of another life and I'm sure she told you about it, about Logan, and that's why you went to the base.
You wanted the same.
Just go.
And I understand why you did it.
What else was there for a girl like you in a place like that?
You saw your opportunity and you grabbed it.
Get out!
What I don't understand and what I can't forgive you for is for Kevin.
You knew he was innocent and you dragged him in and you destroyed him.
What's she doing here?
Going on about Linda Simms, making ridiculous accusations.
What's wrong with you?
Coming to my home, upsetting my wife?
Just telling her my story.
What story?
Why don't you ask her?
Come away from the windows.
What?
Why?
Because she said so.
Please.
She?
Who?
Heather.
Oh, no.
No!
How?
The car.
Banville's been threatened by one of her terrorist clients.
She had it coming.
But here, outside our home?
She's trying to destroy us.
Her car!
Stop!
Don't do that.
What are you talking about?
You've been threatened.
People you represented.
How do you know?
I don't.
But you do, don't you?
Oh, my God.
They'd kill me to protect you.
Are you that important?
You know what?
Sod it.
Emma, for Christ's sake!
Are you scared for me or for yourself?
I'm trying to help you.
So you just tell me what happened that night.
Now, I know you were there, with Alastair McKinnon, with Kretchmer, with the Iraqi.
I know.
Just tell me what happened.
Don't!
