- Ah, yes, the day Al Capone originally went down for tax evasion, only in this version of history, he becomes something far worse than a criminal, he becomes a politician.
Al Capone becomes mayor?
Okay, I take it back.
Ness probably is screwed.
Well, let's find out where they took him, so we can unscrew him before this happens.
Special agent Ness, you're having a hell of a first day.
How do you know who I am?
And when I was coming to town?
Some new friends of mine, they whispered in my ear, so me and the boys decided we would get you a nice welcome present.
Cement galoshes.
Very popular in Chicago these days, and I have a feeling these will be just your size.
Now, come on, try 'em on.
- Any luck finding Ness?
- By the time you find Ness, he'll be swimming with the fishes.
Mick, you beautiful genius, that's it.
About time someone noticed.
Gideon, set the course to shipping harbor dock 39.
What makes you so sure he'll be there?
In the '20s, dock 39 was where Capone brought all of his enemies and tied cinderblocks to their feet and tossed them in the harbor.
It became known as Cadaver's Cove.
This isn't personal.
I'm a businessman, and the Feds, well, they're bad for business.
The Bureau of Investigation will never stop fighting, not until the fight is done.
Poetic.
I hope you wrote that down somewhere.
Welcome to Chicago, Mr. Ness.
All this for some booze?
I like it.
Nice getups.
Seems our new friends have got some friends of their own.
Get 'em, boys.
I'm going after Capone.
Let 'em go, we got Ness.
- Is he dead?
- Unconscious.
He took on a lot of water.
Merlyn was right.
They took the bait.
Special agent Ness has suffered severe hypoxia.
It will take some time to reverse his brain damage.
You can undo brain damage?
Why haven't you helped Rory out?
Who says I haven't?
All right, let's get serious.
Obviously, Capone somehow knew that Ness would be the one
- to take him down.
- When we were at the docks,
Capone said something about having new friends.
But we have a bigger problem.
I mean, another problem.
This week, Ness and his team are supposed to obtain
Capone's ledger from his bookkeeper.
Now the IRS's case against Capone for tax evasion is completely dependent on that ledger.
Which Ness can't grab while he's lying here with brain damage.
Exactly, which means one of us has to take his place.
- That's a stupid idea.
- It's pre-Internet.
Nobody knows what Ness looks like.
Nate's right, I got this.
Actually, I was thinking I got this.
Well, yeah, I mean, if the mission was impersonating Brad Pitt, you'd be the man, but I think we can all agree if anyone here looks like a G-man here, it's me.
Well, we're in this situation, because you learned history
- from a movie.
- All right, enough.
Ray, I'm sorry, but Nate knows more about this area than any of us.
- What's the plan?
- Okay.
So if Capone's ledger is anywhere, it's probably at his primary speakeasy, the Chelsea Club, so Ray and I will go to the Bureau, assemble Ness's team, lead him to bust the place up,
- grab the ledger.
- Great, take Rory with you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Does this face look like a cop to you?
If this were a JSA mission, we'd probably also send someone undercover at the club.
Well, I'm not doing that either.
I'm done playing dress-up.
Fine.
I'll go the club with Jax and Stein, and you can stay here, drink your beers, and watch over Ness.
What about me?
- You can watch over him.
- What?
Sorry.
Beer.
- There he is.
- Ah.
- Special agent Cole Bennett.
- Yes, and you are?
Special agent Eliot Ness.
This is my associate,
- Bob De Niro.
- Well, I've assembled the team your telegram specified, Mr. Ness.
Well, hope they're ready for some action, 'cause they're gonna get it.
Tonight we're gonna take down the Chelsea club.
Our files say Capone's got nothing to do with that place.
Well, your files are embarrassingly outdated.
We've learned Capone has a stake in the club, and furthermore, he hides a sizeable amount of Canadian whiskey in there.
You fellas sure do know an impressive amount about Capone's organization.
Well, let's just say we have people on the inside.
This place is quite lively, considering we haven't seen a single bottle of alcohol.
Well, Nate said it was a speakeasy.
Yeah, that's why it's called a speakeasy.
You gotta know how to do ask for the good stuff.
Ah.
Excuse me, I'd like a club soda, please.
One club soda coming up.
Here's what I wanna know.
Why would somebody from the future be interested in helping Al Capone?
Well, we're here to find out.
This is just a club soda.
- You feeling all right?
- Fine.
I guess I'm just surprised you'd rather stay here on the ship than be out there.
1920 Chicago seemed like your kinda town.
You know, when I was younger,
I always wanted to be a police officer.
I didn't care that I was a girl.
I just really wanted
- to wear a badge.
- Cute.
The bad guys have all the fun, you know.
It doesn't look like you're having much fun right now.
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.
Leonard.
- I must be losing my mind.
- Of course you are.
Why else would you still be here taking orders like a well-trained puppy?
You're not right in the head, Mick.
That's why I'm here, to set you straight.
Ray, Nate, what's your status?
Be careful, we're coming in.
Don't get caught in our net.
What are squares like you doing in a place like this?
- You.
- Jefferson.
What the hell?
Jefferson, the speedster is here, run!
Nobody move!
- Federal officers.
- You're all under arrest for violations of the Volstead Act.
Man!
Hey, take it easy, that's our inside guy.
Considering this club's as dry as the Sahara,
I'd say you need a new inside guy, special agent Ness.
Yeah.
What the hell's happening in here?
Damien Darhk showed up with the speedster.
They took Grey and Sara.
This whole Capone aberration was a distraction.
Darhk and his speedster pal knew it'd attract our attention.
But why kidnap Sara and Stein?
I mean, what could he want with them?
Still trying to work that one out.
- You all right, Jax?
- I'm pissed.
Let it go, kid.
There's nothing you can do about the speedsters.
We'll see about that.
Long story short, Rip had a secret armory.
Me and Grey found it alongside future Barry's message about the oncoming war.
This speedster killed Rex and kidnapped our friends.
We need him in the brig before dawn.
Yeah, if this weapon does what I think it does, we'll stop him dead in his tracks.
Yeah, well, at's all well and good, but we still need to get Capone's ledger back, otherwise history's screwed.
Since your last plan was a total bust,
I suggest somebody else do the strategic thinking.
Let me guess, that's you?
All right, so let's hear your brilliant idea.
Well, I don't have one, but it's gonna be better than yours.
Enough.
If you wanna nail Capone and Rex's killer, you can't do it by playing a boy scout or an historian or a policeman.
We do this my way, like a criminal.
Yes, the Ritz-Carleton it is definitely not.
How did we get here?
It appears our speedster friend got the better of us.
- And he wasn't working alone.
- Yes.
Damien Darhk, a rather predictable bedfellow for Al Capone.
And don't forget about me.
It's been a long time, Sara.
You look good for someone who's come back from the dead.
Why am I not surprised that you and Damien Darhk would find each other?
What do you want with us?
You have something we need, and while my partners think I'm a fool for trying,
I would like to broker a deal with you.
You have in your possession an amulet.
Give it to me, and I will give you nine years of your life back.
What are you talking about?
Oh, maybe Oliver didn't tell you, but I was the one who arranged to blow up the Queen's Gambit.
That was the day everything changed for you, Sara, hundreds of dominos toppling.
Dr. Ivo, Slade Wilson, the League of Assassins, losing your sister.
And you losing your son.
We both get clean slates.
Why don't you just ask your speedster friend to take you back in time?
Because Malcolm's just his errand boy, sent to retrieve the amulet.
Why is it so important?
What does it matter?
I'm giving you and your sister a chance to live normal lives.
To go back, maybe go to college, meet a nice boy, or a girl, and settle down.
No thank you.
I was never meant for those things, and I know that now.
And besides, you can't just go back and change things like that.
Why not?
Because time is sacred, and it can't be changed to suit any one person's desire without harming the lives of countless others.
But you wouldn't remember any of this, would you?
You would be blissfully unaware of time travel, of loss, of heartbreak.
You'd be happy, and isn't that what matters most in the end?
Hey, Malcolm.
I'll take a nightmare that's real over a dream that's a lie.
That was remarkably selfless.
Well, I had a good teacher.
Yes, Captain Hunter.
No.
I was talking about you.
What the hell?
Shoot her!
Come on!
Get out of here!
Get out of here!
Hi, I'm Clyde.
That's Bonnie.
Get out of the truck.
Do you have any idea who you're stealing from?
Yes, now where's the truck headed?
Uh, 31st and Fort Dearborn Drive.
Much obliged.
Hold that.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Nate and Ray?
Those idiots have done nothing but get in the way.
Uh, guys, we're...
We're standing right here.
Well... get in the back.
I can't believe Malcolm thought I would actually take that deal.
You really weren't tempted?
Of course, but we can't let a man like that change history.
Imagine the havoc that it would cause.
Oh, yes, when it comes to time travel, even the best of us can wreak havoc.
What do you mean?
Martin?
You have been acting weird ever since we fought the Dominators.
What's going on?
It was an innocent mistake...
I was just trying to give myself a bit of marital advice.
Never did I imagine it would ever have an effect.
You caused an aberration?
I have a daughter.
A what?
A full-grown human progeny who I never even knew I had.
- This beautiful, brilliant...
- And not real.
At first, no, but then I remembered.
I remembered the...
The countless nights I spent pacing the neighborhood with her stroller, trying to get her to sleep.
The... the...
The way my heart melted the first time she smiled at me.
The... the distress she caused her kindergarten teacher when she insisted on singing the periodic table instead of the alphabet.
I-I...
I remembered all of it.
But none of that happened to you.
But the memories are real.
They are a part of me now.
She is a part of me now.
And I love her.
Martin, you were the one who talked me into not killing Damien Darhk, into not bringing my sister back, because of the damage that it would do to history.
Ugh, I'm sorry, but my ears were burning.
I understand Malcolm tried to play nice and offer you a deal.
Since you didn't bite, we're gonna have to be a little rougher.
Do your worst.
Oh, you didn't think that I meant you?
Oh, I fear with your league-training torture, while fun, would be a waste of time.
Sara?
Whatever you do, don't give them anything.
No!
Martin!
Martin!
Professor Stein, am I right?
- Do I know you?
- Let's just say...
It's complicated.
I'm not gonna lie to ya.
This, um, little toy usually leaves the subject well dead, but I've adjusted it so that you should only feel a little pain...
In theory.
You're not the regular driver.
What happened to Vinny?
Vinny, he, uh, he's hanging out with your mother.
- What?
- What?
- So here's the plan.
- Is for us to rescue the people
- that got caught because of you.
- She's talking about you.
Nah, I think she was talking about you.
Shut up!
You're supposed to be partners.
Partners have each other's backs.
All right, Mick's right.
We can all agree that we need to get Capone's ledger.
- Fair?
- Agreed.
Sara?
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
We need to find Stein.
You know, for a homicidal gangster,
Capone was very organized, and had exquisite penmanship.
Check it out.
Is that it?
Bingo.
Let's go.
Watch where you point that thing.
- Snart.
- You shouldn't be here, Mick.
Capone's men might be from 1927, but their bullets work just fine.
Do you really wanna risk your life for a skirt and a geezer?
- Any sign of the professor?
- Not yet.
Aw, sounds like a sweet little angel whispering in your ear.
Problem is, angels always want you do the right thing, and doing the right thing gets you killed.
I should know.
You wanna stay alive, best listen to the devil.
Get out now.
Too late.
Hey, you found them.
- Are you guys okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Let's get out of here.
- Oh, good, yeah.
Oh, whoa.
Oh, my God, you're Al Capone.
- That's Scarface.
- Yeah, I-I don't think
- he likes that nickname.
- No?
I don't like when people try and steal what's mine.
How do you think it makes me feel seeing all you thieves on my property?
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say not good.
See, the doctor used to give me these pills, said they would help calm me down.
Then one day, I realized the only thing that makes me feel any better is killing.
Time for some therapy.
Whoo.
Thanks, buddy.
- Yeah.
- Let's go.
Yeah.
How'd I do?
You totally sold it, Al.
Thought so.
You sure Mr. Thawne ain't gonna be mad 'cause we let 'em go?
Oh, quite the opposite.
Hey, Grey, Grey, you're safe now, it's okay.
- Grey.
- What?
- Grey?
- Oh, uh, I'm sorry,
I-I-I didn't hear you.
I'm...
I'm...
I'm little...
A little discombobulated.
Whoo!
Well, that was close, but a win's a win, and we got the team back together.
Well, technically you and Rory got the team back together.
And we got the ledger.
Bro hug?
Do it.
Okay, I think this is all a little premature.
We still don't have an ID on the speedster.
Who's now added Malcolm Merlyn to his team of time travelling psychos.
And he wanted the amulet that I took off of Darhk in 1987.
What would someone with the speedster's power
- want with ancient artifacts?
- Perhaps...
Perhaps I should take a look at the amulet.
I may be able to unlock some of its mysteries.
All right.
Ah, so you didn't get a chance to kill your boyfriend's killer, huh?
It's not vengeance I'm after, Mick.
It's justice.
Right, right.
Well, for what it's worth, you looked good tonight.
Being a bad guy suits you.
Thank you.
Um, I'm hungry.
What's next, Mick?
Long walks on the beach, just the two of you?
For a figment of my imagination, you're really beginning to be a pain in my ass.
Look, I get it, she's easy on the eyes, tough in the fight.
She's just a friend, the one friend I have, since my last friend blew himself up.
Care for a little advice?
From a dead guy?
No.
Don't let the new girl rope you into her death wish.
This whole sacrificing yourself for your friends thing isn't as fun as it sounds.
Trust me.
What the hell?
Sara, stay out of the library.
How you feeling?
I'm all right.
Look, I know you've been through a lot, but we really need to talk about the aberration that you caused.
Perhaps some other time.
What were you doing in here, anyways?
- Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.
- I speak six languages, why...
Stein's about to kill Sara in the library.
With the rope or the candlestick?
Guys, I'm serious.
Somehow, the speedster's disguised himself as Stein, and he's turning over the whole ship.
- I'll suit up.
- I know how to get Sara away from fake Stein.
What about that speedster gun?
Yeah, I'm already on it.
Martin, you've been acting pretty different ever since Darhk tortured you.
Did they offer you a deal like they did me?
Help us, and we won't hurt your daughter?
My daughter?
Sara, uh, Jackson and I were just on the bridge, and...
He wanted to talk to you about ship stuff.
Ship stuff?
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm sure there's no need to rush off.
Jax can wait.
Since when do you call him Jax?
Actually, it's, uh, it's pretty urgent.
We should go now.
Okay.
My speedster weapon.
Impressive.
Unfortunately for you, the effects are only temporary.
What did you do with Stein?
Oh, I wouldn't waste my energy worrying about him right now.
Whatever you're gonna do, do it now.
In a rush to die, are we?
I wasn't talking to you.
He's headed towards the bridge, come on.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
What the hell is he doing in there?
Cloaking shield disengaged.
That's not good.
Cargo bay door now opening.
That is definitely not good.
Tear the ship apart.
Kill anyone you find.
The speedster just locked himself inside the bridge.
Great, so we got him trapped.
Call me an optimist.
And by the sound of it, he's letting his buddies onto the ship.
Guys, could use a little help here.
Okay, Nate and I will help Sara hold them off.
- I'll guard Ness.
- What about the speedster?
Well, he's after to amulet, so all we have to do is just keep him in the bridge...
What are you doing?
Capone's men are taking over the ship.
We got bigger fish to fry, honey.
Rex's killer?
He's tossing the ship.
He's looking for the amulet.
It's only gonna be a matter of time before he finds it.
Then how do we stop him?
What would a criminal do?
Run.
Steel-up.
Isn't that just like a thug?
Brings a Tommy gun to an ion blaster fight?
Ah, yeah.
Hey, I stole that fair and square.
This belongs to me.
Surprise.
The League taught you well, but unless you hand over the amulet,
I'm gonna have to teach you a few new lessons.
Those who cannot do teach.
I remember you.
You're here because I killed that moronic leader of the JSA.
Mr. Rex Tyler was it?
Don't worry, you'll be joining Mr. Tyler soon enough.
Lucky girl.
I gave you an out.
Not just a chance to survive, but to live a better life.
I already found a better life.
One without you in it.
But what about your friend, Martin Stein?
Where is he?
My dear, that information comes at a cost.
Don't look so glum, professor.
You'll be in good company at the bottom of this here river.
Thieves, snitches, do-gooder cops, they've all run afoul in my organization, but you...
I've never had to whack a professor before.
Guess I'm moving up in the world, hey, boys?
The speedster, how did you manage to defeat him?
I didn't.
I made him a counter-offer.
I gave him the amulet.
I still don't understand.
The last thing I remember was getting off the train.
Everything else is a blur.
I wouldn't worry about that, Mr. Ness.
After our investigation, we concluded you were kidnapped by an imposter, some idiot posing as you trying to bring down Capone.
The gentleman who was impersonating you was trying to do the right thing.
Luckily, he found some useful information.
- What's this?
- Everything you need to know to take down Capone.
If you look closely, you'll find some discrepancies in his bookkeeping.
You expect me to believe that Al Capone is gonna be taken down by tax evasion?
Sounds screwy.
Actually, it'd make a pretty good movie one day.
You know, if this is the week the Feds get Capone's ledger, why does it take four more years for them to take him down?
Because it's the federal government.
Now that's the Mick Rory I remember, always thinking with his stomach.
Shut up.
Who are you talking to?
Nobody.
Anyway, I thought I'd find you in here.
That speedster hit you pretty hard, huh?
I got a thick head.
What's that?
A little present for keeping me alive, and for helping me almost get Rex's killer.
Open it.
I lifted it back at Capone's warehouse.
You stole it.
You were right.
The bad guys really do have more fun.
Not that you're a bad guy.
I hope it was worth it.
All this for a kiss on the cheek and a cheap bottle of booze.
That speedster could've killed you, Mick.
What then?
I'll be dead like you.
My evil doppelganger left quite a mess.
It'll take me weeks to reorganize my notes.
Well, it's good to have you back,
- the real you.
- Well, thanks to your efforts.
Though, I have to say I'm a bit puzzled.
Predicting history is our team's raison d'être, yet you traded the amulet to our enemies, a choice which will no doubt have countless repercussions on history.
I'm starting to think that maybe some things are more important than history.
You know, you, me, and this team...
We're a family, a messed up one, but still a family.
I might not be able to save Laurel, but I can protect this family, and that includes yours.
What's her name?
Lily.
Lily.
It's a beautiful name.
We should leave soon.
You're certainly in a hurry to get out of 1927.
Not your concern, Malcolm, particularly now that we have what we came for.
Well, now that we have the matching set, do you care to tell us why we went through so much trouble?
Well, they are not a matching set.
In fact, they are not a they.
They are an it.
It's an amulet in two pieces.
I knew that you were more than just a pretty face, Malcolm.
Wow, it's a portable planetarium.
It's a compass.
Compasses generally find things.
Indeed.
Have either of you gentlemen heard of the Spear of Destiny?
Yes, it was a spear that was reportedly used to penetrate the side of Christ after he died on the cross.
And now it can be used to rewrite reality itself.
So, how do we find it?
Well, it's complicated, but the first step is with the person that Mr. Darhk met briefly in New York.
You remember Captain Rip Hunter?
Rip Hunter, stop where you are!
Cut!
Yeah, I told you idiots to move these garbage cans.
Can we try to...
To get this right, people?
I don't wanna be here all night.
Am I talking to myself?
Today!
Time travel is real, and all of history is vulnerable to attack, which is why we must travel through time to stop the spread of these so-called time aberrations, and to erase their damage to history.
We are a team of outcasts and misfits, so please don't call us heroes.
We're something else.
We're legends.
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...
You're back!
I love you, Dad.
When I last left 2016, that young woman did not exist.
I do not want to lose my daughter.
This amulet looks a lot like the one we recovered off the Nazis.
There's gotta be a connection.
And we know that Damien Darhk and the speedster are willing to kill for it.
Mr. Capone...
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
I cancelled tickets to the opera, 'cause I heard there was new players in town.
No one told me it was Halloween.
Well, it's more like Christmas.
That's...
I like that, it's very good.
See, my associate and I have come with a proposition.
We've seen how you run your empire, and we're impressed, but there's room for improvement.
We'd like to offer our services.
I got a better idea.
How 'bout I show you how business is done in my town?
You or me?
Oh, I've got... this.
By now you've probably surmised that my friend and I aren't from around here.
- What do you freaks want?
- To help.
I thought I made... did I not make that perfectly clear?
New enemies are coming to Chicago, and they will endanger your enterprises.
And you're saying you two can help me out?
Actually, there's three of us.
Pleasure to meet you.
My name is Malcolm Merlyn.
Okay.
New suit's good, but I think it needs those modifications Cisco mentioned.
It's a poor hero to blame a super suit.
Eh, exoskeleton.
Come on, let's do this.
I wanna get the kinks worked out before our next mission.
What's the rush?
I think I'm doing a pretty good job picking up your slack.
We scientists have a name for that phenomenon.
It's called beginner's luck.
- What do you think you're doing?
- Uh, s... sparring.
Yeah, he's helping me calibrate the new suit.
Last time y'all decided to spar,
- you wrecked my cargo bay.
- Yeah.
Don't make me come down here again.
Don't you make me come down here again.
Don't you make me come down here again.
I'm gonna come down here again, I'm watching you.
What is going on with them?
- You don't have any brothers or sisters, do you?
- Nope.
Sibling rivalry.
Nothing to be too worried about.
This is why I'm glad i'm an only child.
Oh, Jefferson, I was just, uh, catching up on some reading.
"The Fundamentals of Motorcycle Repair"?
It's a fascinating subject.
Of course, I'm also researching the amulet
Ms. Lance last stole from Damien Darhk.
You know, you might be a genius when it comes to nuclear physics, but when it comes to lying, you kinda suck at it, bro.
You were thinking about her again, weren't you?
I can't help it.
Every day, I recover new memories of her, each one a gift.
Then I find myself worrying,
"What if there's a car accident, or... or a fire?
Or she could be struck by lightning."
Yeah, I'd be more worried about what happens when Sara finds out you have a daughter that's a time aberration.
She's not an aberration.
The only reason Lily exists is because you convinced your younger self to pay more attention to your wife, and less attention to putting on a condom.
You changed history, and one of these days, either Nate or Gideon or anybody revealing the historical timeline's gonna figure that out.
Not necessarily.
According to my calculations, if Lily's impact on history remains small enough, she may be able to go undetected.
Excuse me, but Dr. Heywood's seismograph has detected an aberration.
You were saying?
- Who installed the alarms?
- That'd be me.
- We should kill him.
- We got another one?
Yeah, and judging by these readings, it's a major one.
Is there really cause for all this alarm?
Perhaps the aberration isn't as large as we think.
The temporal tremors originate from Union Station in Chicago, Illinois, October 17th in the year 1927.
That's fantastic.
I-I mean, I've always wanted to visit the roaring '20s right in the middle of Prohibition.
That means no drinking.
That's not good.
Well, actually under Capone,
Chicago was a hot bed of vice.
There was illegal drinking, gambling, prostitution.
Well, then, let's fire up a tub and get there.
Grab your fedoras, we're going to the 1920s.
I can't believe we're here.
What are you so happy about?
When I was younger, I'd read my mother's magazines, and I'd see photos of Chicago.
I'd never thought I'd see it with my own eyes.
Well, keep those eyes focused on whatever's causing those temporal tremors.
Copy that.
That's Eliot Ness.
He doesn't look like Kevin Costner.
What if somebody tipped off Capone that Ness is a future threat?
Then his life's in danger.
Don't worry, I'm on it.
You go.
Mr. Ness!
Mr. Ness, hi.
Uh, you don't know me.
My name is Ray Palmer.
I have reason to believe that your life may be in danger.
It'd be best if you came with me.
Mr. Ness, I'm Sergeant Jones with Chicago PD.
We're your security detail on the way to the bureau.
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Palmer, but it looks like I'm in good hands.
Okay.
What just happened?
Well, it's the strangest thing.
Uh, two cops just escorted Eliot Ness to the bureau.
They're not escorting him to the bureau.
They're gonna throw him in the river.
- What?
- Ray, 1920s Chicago PD was the most corrupt police force in history.
Almost all of them are on Capone's payroll.
Did you or did you not see "The Untouchables"?
Jax, Stein,
I need you to intercept Eliot Ness.
He's being escorted by two police officers.
Grey!
Didn't you hear Sara?
No.
Oh, wait, Hey, hey!
What the hell happened back there?
- How come you didn't stop him?
- I'm sorry, I got distracted.
- By what?
- Tell her, Grey.
It's not the professor's fault.
Ray let Ness walk right into Capone's hands.
They were police officers, and who's to say they didn't take him to the FBI like they said they would?
Gideon, pull up the Chicago Chronicle,
- October 24th, 1931.
- Ah, yes, the day Al Capone originally went down for tax evasion, only in this version of history, he becomes something far worse than a criminal, he becomes a politician.
Al Capone becomes mayor?
Okay, I take it back.
Ness probably is screwed.
Well, let's find out where they took him, so we can unscrew him before this happens.
Special agent Ness, you're having a hell of a first day.
How do you know who I am?
And when I was coming to town?
Some new friends of mine, they whispered in my ear, so me and the boys decided we would get you a nice welcome present.
Cement galoshes.
Very popular in Chicago these days, and I have a feeling these will be just your size.
Now, come on, try 'em on.
Any luck finding Ness?
By the time you find Ness, he'll be swimming with the fishes.
Mick, you beautiful genius, that's it.
About time someone noticed.
Gideon, set the course to shipping harbor dock 39.
What makes you so sure he'll be there?
In the '20s, dock 39 was where Capone brought all of his enemies and tied cinderblocks to their feet and tossed them in the harbor.
It became known as Cadaver's Cove.
This isn't personal.
I'm a businessman, and the Feds, well, they're bad for business.
The Bureau of Investigation will never stop fighting, not until the fight is done.
Poetic.
I hope you wrote that down somewhere.
Welcome to Chicago, Mr. Ness.
All this for some booze?
- I like it.
- Nice getups.
Seems our new friends have got some friends of their own.
Get 'em, boys.
I'm going after Capone.
Let 'em go, we got Ness.
- Is he dead?
- Unconscious.
He took on a lot of water.
Merlyn was right.
They took the bait.
Special Agent Ness has suffered severe hypoxia.
It will take some time to reverse his brain damage.
You can undo brain damage?
Why haven't you helped Rory out?
Who says I haven't?
All right, let's get serious.
Obviously, Capone somehow knew that Ness would be the one to take him down.
When we were at the docks,
Capone said something about having new friends.
But we have a bigger problem.
I mean, another problem.
This week, Ness and his team are supposed to obtain
Capone's ledger from his bookkeeper.
Now the IRS's case against Capone for tax evasion is completely dependent on that ledger.
Which Ness can't grab while he's lying here with brain damage.
Exactly, which means one of us has to take his place.
- That's a stupid idea.
- It's pre-Internet.
Nobody knows what Ness looks like.
Nate's right, I got this.
Actually, I was thinking I got this.
Well, yeah, I mean, if the mission was impersonating Brad Pitt, you'd be the man, but I think we can all agree if anyone here looks like a G-man here, it's me.
Well, we're in this situation, because you learned history from a movie.
All right, enough.
Ray, I'm sorry, but Nate knows more about this area than any of us.
What's the plan?
Okay.
So if Capone's ledger is anywhere, it's probably at his primary speakeasy, the Chelsea Club, so Ray and I will go to the Bureau, assemble Ness's team, lead him to bust the place up,
- grab the ledger.
- Great, take Rory with you.
Does this face look like a cop to you?
If this were a JSA mission, we'd probably also send someone undercover at the club.
Well, I'm not doing that either.
I'm done playing dress-up.
Fine.
I'll go the club with Jax and Stein, and you can stay here, drink your beers, and watch over Ness.
What about me?
- You can watch over him.
- What?
Sorry.
Beer.
There he is.
- Special Agent Cole Bennett.
- Yes, and you are?
Special Agent Eliot Ness.
This is my associate, Bob De Niro.
Well, I've assembled the team your telegram specified, Mr. Ness.
Well, hope they're ready for some action, 'cause they're gonna get it.
Tonight we're gonna take down the Chelsea Club.
Our files say Capone's got nothing to do with that place.
Well, your files are embarrassingly outdated.
We've learned Capone has a stake in the club, and furthermore, he hides a sizeable amount of Canadian whiskey in there.
You fellas sure do know an impressive amount about Capone's organization.
Well, let's just say we have people on the inside.
This place is quite lively, considering we haven't seen a single bottle of alcohol.
Well, Nate said it was a speakeasy.
Yeah, that's why it's called a speakeasy.
You gotta know how to do ask for the good stuff.
Excuse me, I'd like a club soda, please.
One club soda coming up.
Here's what I wanna know.
Why would somebody from the future be interested in helping Al Capone?
Well, we're here to find out.
This is just a club soda.
- You feeling all right?
- Fine.
I guess I'm just surprised you'd rather stay here on the ship than be out there.
1920 Chicago seemed like your kinda town.
You know, when I was younger,
I always wanted to be a police officer.
I didn't care that I was a girl.
I just really wanted to wear a badge.
Cute.
The bad guys have all the fun, you know.
It doesn't look like you're having much fun right now.
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.
Leonard.
Leonard.
- I must be losing my mind.
- Of course you are.
Why else would you still be here taking orders like a well-trained puppy?
You're not right in the head, Mick.
That's why I'm here, to set you straight.
Ray, Nate, what's your status?
Be careful, we're coming in.
Don't get caught in our net.
What are squares like you doing in a place like this?
- You.
- Jefferson.
What the hell?
Jefferson, the speedster is here, run!
Nobody move!
Federal officers.
You're all under arrest for violations of the Volstead Act.
- Man!
- Hey, take it easy, that's our inside guy.
Considering this club's as dry as the Sahara,
I'd say you need a new inside guy, Special Agent Ness.
Yeah.
What the hell's happening in here?
Damien Darhk showed up with the speedster.
They took Grey and Sara.
This whole Capone aberration was a distraction.
Darhk and his speedster pal knew it'd attract our attention.
But why kidnap Sara and Stein?
I mean, what could he want with them?
Still trying to work that one out.
- You all right, Jax?
- I'm pissed.
Let it go, kid.
There's nothing you can do about the speedsters.
We'll see about that.
Long story short, Rip had a secret armory.
Me and Grey found it alongside future Barry's message about the oncoming war.
This speedster killed Rex and kidnapped our friends.
We need him in the brig before dawn.
Yeah, if this weapon does what I think it does, we'll stop him dead in his tracks.
Yeah, well, that's all well and good, but we still need to get Capone's ledger back, otherwise history's screwed.
Since your last plan was a total bust,
I suggest somebody else do the strategic thinking.
Let me guess, that's you?
All right, so let's hear your brilliant idea.
Well, I don't have one, but it's gonna be better than yours.
Enough.
If you wanna nail Capone and Rex's killer, you can't do it by playing a boy scout or an historian or a policeman.
We do this my way, like a criminal.
Yes, the Ritz-Carleton it is definitely not.
How did we get here?
It appears our speedster friend got the better of us.
- And he wasn't working alone.
- Yes.
Damien Darhk, a rather predictable bedfellow for Al Capone.
And don't forget about me.
It's been a long time, Sara.
You look good for someone who's come back from the dead.
Why am I not surprised that you and Damien Darhk would find each other?
What do you want with us?
You have something we need, and while my partners think I'm a fool for trying,
I would like to broker a deal with you.
You have in your possession an amulet.
Give it to me, and I will give you nine years of your life back.
What are you talking about?
Oh, maybe Oliver didn't tell you, but I was the one who arranged to blow up the Queen's Gambit.
That was the day everything changed for you, Sara, hundreds of dominos toppling.
Dr. Ivo, Slade Wilson, the League of Assassins, losing your sister.
And you losing your son.
We both get clean slates.
Why don't you just ask your speedster friend to take you back in time?
Because Malcolm's just his errand boy, sent to retrieve the amulet.
Why is it so important?
What does it matter?
I'm giving you and your sister a chance to live normal lives.
To go back, maybe go to college, meet a nice boy, or a girl, and settle down.
No thank you.
I was never meant for those things, and I know that now.
And besides, you can't just go back and change things like that.
Why not?
Because time is sacred, and it can't be changed to suit any one person's desire without harming the lives of countless others.
But you wouldn't remember any of this, would you?
You would be blissfully unaware of time travel, of loss, of heartbreak.
You'd be happy, and isn't that what matters most in the end?
Hey, Malcolm.
I'll take a nightmare that's real over a dream that's a lie.
That was remarkably selfless.
Well, I had a good teacher.
Yes, Captain Hunter.
No.
I was talking about you.
What the hell?
Shoot her!
Come on!
Get out of here!
Get out of here!
Hi, I'm Clyde.
That's Bonnie.
Get out of the truck.
Do you have any idea who you're stealing from?
Yes, now where's the truck headed?
Uh, 31st and Fort Dearborn Drive.
Much obliged.
Hold that.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Nate and Ray?
Those idiots have done nothing but get in the way.
Uh, guys, we're... we're standing right here.
Well... get in the back.
I can't believe Malcolm thought I would actually take that deal.
You really weren't tempted?
Of course, but we can't let a man like that change history.
Imagine the havoc that it would cause.
Oh, yes, when it comes to time travel, even the best of us can wreak havoc.
What do you mean?
Martin?
You have been acting weird ever since we fought the Dominators.
What's going on?
It was an innocent mistake...
I was just trying to give myself a bit of marital advice.
Never did I imagine it would ever have an effect.
You caused an aberration?
I have a daughter.
A what?
A full-grown human progeny who I never even knew I had.
- This beautiful, brilliant...
- And not real.
At first, no, but then I remembered.
I remembered the... the countless nights I spent pacing the neighborhood with her stroller, trying to get her to sleep.
The... the...
The way my heart melted the first time she smiled at me.
The... the distress she caused her kindergarten teacher when she insisted on singing the periodic table instead of the alphabet.
I-I...
I remembered all of it.
But none of that happened to you.
But the memories are real.
They are a part of me now.
She is a part of me now.
And I love her.
Martin, you were the one who talked me into not killing Damien Darhk, into not bringing my sister back, because of the damage that it would do to history.
Ugh, I'm sorry, but my ears were burning.
I understand Malcolm tried to play nice and offer you a deal.
Since you didn't bite, we're gonna have to be a little rougher.
Do your worst.
Oh, you didn't think that I meant you?
Oh, I fear with your league-training torture, while fun, would be a waste of time.
Sara?
Whatever you do, don't give them anything.
No!
Martin!
Martin!
Professor Stein, am I right?
- Do I know you?
- Let's just say...
It's complicated.
I'm not gonna lie to ya.
This, um, little toy usually leaves the subject well dead, but I've adjusted it so that you should only feel a little pain... in theory.
You're not the regular driver.
What happened to Vinny?
Vinny, he, uh, he's hanging out with your mother.
- What?
- What?
So here's the plan.
Is for us to rescue the people that got caught because of you.
She's talking about you.
Nah, I think she was talking about you.
Shut up!
You're supposed to be partners.
Partners have each other's backs.
All right, Mick's right.
We can all agree that we need to get Capone's ledger.
- Fair?
- Agreed.
Sara?
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
We need to find Stein.
You know, for a homicidal gangster,
Capone was very organized, and had exquisite penmanship.
Check it out.
Is that it?
Bingo.
Let's go.
Watch where you point that thing.
- Snart.
- You shouldn't be here, Mick.
Capone's men might be from 1927, but their bullets work just fine.
Do you really wanna risk your life for a skirt and a geezer?
- Any sign of the professor?
- Not yet.
Aw, sounds like a sweet little angel whispering in your ear.
Problem is, angels always want you do the right thing, and doing the right thing gets you killed.
I should know.
You wanna stay alive, best listen to the devil.
Get out now.
Too late.
Hey, you found them.
- Are you guys okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Let's get out of here.
- Oh, good, yeah.
Oh, my God, you're Al Capone.
That's Scarface.
- Yeah, I-I don't think he likes that nickname.
- No?
I don't like when people try and steal what's mine.
How do you think it makes me feel seeing all you thieves on my property?
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say not good.
See, the doctor used to give me these pills, said they would help calm me down.
Then one day, I realized the only thing that makes me feel any better is killing.
Time for some therapy.
- Thanks, buddy.
- Yeah.
- Let's go.
- Yeah.
How'd I do?
You totally sold it, Al.
Thought so.
You sure Mr. Thawne ain't gonna be mad 'cause we let 'em go?
Oh, quite the opposite.
Hey, Grey, Grey, you're safe now, it's okay.
- Grey.
- What?
- Grey?
- Oh, uh, I'm sorry,
I-I-I didn't hear you.
I'm...
I'm...
I'm little...
A little discombobulated.
Whoo!
Well, that was close, but a win's a win, and we got the team back together.
Well, technically you and Rory got the team back together.
And we got the ledger.
Bro hug?
Do it.
Okay, I think this is all a little premature.
We still don't have an ID on the speedster.
Who's now added Malcolm Merlyn to his team of time travelling psychos.
And he wanted the Amulet that I took off of Darhk in 1987.
What would someone with the speedster's power want with ancient artifacts?
Perhaps... perhaps I should take a look at the Amulet.
I may be able to unlock some of its mysteries.
All right.
Ah, so you didn't get a chance to kill your boyfriend's killer, huh?
It's not vengeance I'm after, Mick.
It's justice.
Right, right.
Well, for what it's worth, you looked good tonight.
Being a bad guy suits you.
Thank you.
Um, I'm hungry.
What's next, Mick?
Long walks on the beach, just the two of you?
For a figment of my imagination, you're really beginning to be a pain in my ass.
Look, I get it, she's easy on the eyes, tough in the fight.
She's just a friend, the one friend I have, since my last friend blew himself up.
Care for a little advice?
From a dead guy?
No.
Don't let the new girl rope you into her death wish.
This whole sacrificing yourself for your friends thing isn't as fun as it sounds.
Trust me.
What the hell?
Sara, stay out of the library.
How you feeling?
I'm all right.
Look, I know you've been through a lot, but we really need to talk about the aberration that you caused.
Perhaps some other time.
What were you doing in here, anyways?
- Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.
- I speak six languages, why...
Stein's about to kill Sara in the library.
With the rope or the candlestick?
Guys, I'm serious.
Somehow, the speedster's disguised himself as Stein, and he's turning over the whole ship.
I'll suit up.
I know how to get Sara away from fake Stein.
What about that speedster gun?
Yeah, I'm already on it.
Martin, you've been acting pretty different ever since Darhk tortured you.
Did they offer you a deal like they did me?
Help us, and we won't hurt your daughter?
My daughter?
Sara, uh, Jackson and I were just on the bridge, and, um...
He wanted to talk to you about ship stuff.
- Ship stuff?
- Yeah.
Okay.
I'm sure there's no need to rush off.
Jax can wait.
Since when do you call him Jax?
Actually, it's, uh, it's pretty urgent.
We should go now.
Okay.
My speedster weapon.
Impressive.
Unfortunately for you, the effects are only temporary.
What did you do with Stein?
Oh, I wouldn't waste my energy worrying about him right now.
Whatever you're gonna do, do it now.
In a rush to die, are we?
I wasn't talking to you.
He's headed towards the bridge, come on.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
What the hell is he doing in there?
Cloaking shield disengaged.
That's not good.
Cargo bay door now opening.
That is definitely not good.
Tear the ship apart.
Kill anyone you find.
The speedster just locked himself inside the bridge.
Great, so we got him trapped.
Call me an optimist.
And by the sound of it, he's letting his buddies onto the ship.
Guys, could use a little help here.
Okay, Nate and I will help Sara hold them off.
- I'll guard Ness.
- What about the speedster?
Well, he's after to amulet, so all we have to do is just keep him in the bridge...
What are you doing?
Capone's men are taking over the ship.
We got bigger fish to fry, honey.
Rex's killer?
He's tossing the ship.
He's looking for the amulet.
It's only gonna be a matter of time before he finds it.
Then how do we stop him?
What would a criminal do?
Run.
Steel-up.
Isn't that just like a thug?
Brings a Tommy gun to an ion blaster fight?
Ah, yeah.
Hey, I stole that fair and square.
This belongs to me.
Surprise.
Eliot taught you well, but unless you hand over the amulet,
I'm gonna have to teach you a few new lessons.
Those who cannot do teach.
I remember you.
You're here because
I killed that moronic leader of the JSA.
Mr. Rex Tyler was it?
Don't worry, you'll be joining Mr. Tyler soon enough.
Lucky girl.
I gave you an out.
Not just a chance to survive, but to live a better life.
I already found a better life.
One without you in it.
But what about your friend, Martin Stein?
Where is he?
My dear, that information comes at a cost.
Don't look so glum, professor.
You'll be in good company at the bottom of this here river.
Thieves, snitches, do-gooder cops, they've all run afoul in my organization, but you...
I've never had to whack a professor before.
Guess I'm moving up in the world, hey, boys?
The speedster, how did you manage to defeat him?
I didn't.
I made him a counter-offer.
I gave him the amulet.
I still don't understand.
The last thing I remember was getting off the train.
Everything else is a blur.
I wouldn't worry about that, Mr. Ness.
After our investigation, we concluded you were kidnapped by an imposter, some idiot posing as you trying to bring down Capone.
The gentleman who was impersonating you was trying to do the right thing.
Luckily, he found some useful information.
What's this?
Everything you need to know to take down Capone.
If you look closely, you'll find some discrepancies in his bookkeeping.
You expect me to believe that Al Capone is gonna be taken down by tax evasion?
Sounds screwy.
Actually, it'd make a pretty good movie one day.
You know, if this is the week the Feds get Capone's ledger, why does it take four more years for them to take him down?
Because it's the federal government.
Now that's the Mick Rory I remember, always thinking with his stomach.
Shut up.
Who are you talking to?
Nobody.
Anyway, I thought I'd find you in here.
That speedster hit you pretty hard, huh?
I got a thick head.
What's that?
A little present for keeping me alive, and for helping me almost get Rex's killer.
Open it.
I lifted it back at Capone's warehouse.
You stole it.
You were right.
The bad guys really do have more fun.
Not that you're a bad guy.
I hope it was worth it.
All this for a kiss on the cheek and a cheap bottle of booze.
That speedster could've killed you, Mick.
What then?
I'll be dead like you.
My evil doppelganger left quite a mess.
It'll take me weeks to reorganize my notes.
Well, it's good to have you back, the real you.
Well, thanks to your efforts.
Though, I have to say I'm a bit puzzled.
Professor Stein puzzled?
Predicting history is our team's raison d'¨ºtre, yet you traded the amulet to our enemies, a choice which will no doubt have countless repercussions on history.
I'm starting to think that maybe some things are more important than history.
You know, you, me, and this team...
We're a family, a messed up one, but still a family.
I might not be able to save Laurel, but I can protect this family, and that includes yours.
What's her name?
Lily.
Lily.
It's a beautiful name.
We should leave soon.
You're certainly in a hurry to get out of 1927.
Not your concern, Malcolm, particularly now that we have what we came for.
Well, now that we have the matching set, do you care to tell us why we went through so much trouble?
Well, they are not a matching set.
In fact, they are not a they.
They are an it.
It's an amulet in two pieces.
I knew that you were more than just a pretty face, Malcolm.
Wow, it's a portable planetarium.
It's a compass.
Compasses generally find things.
Indeed.
Have either of you gentlemen heard of the Spear of Destiny?
Yes, it was a spear that was reportedly used to penetrate the sight of Christ after he died on the cross.
And now it can be used to rewrite reality itself.
So, how do we find it?
Well, it's complicated, but the first step is with the person that Mr. Darhk met briefly in New York.
You remember Captain Rip Hunter?
Rip Hunter, stop where you are!
Cut!
Yeah, I told you idiots to move these garbage cans.
Can we try to... to get this right, people?
I don't wanna be here all night.
Am I talking to myself?
Today!
Elvis?
Now I'm going to kill you.
You know, I could get out of this but it would involve inflicting
- much pain upon your personage.
- You reckon?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- We're getting married tomorrow!
- Mm-mm.
No.
- Day after tomorrow.
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.
- Are you sure?
Oh, no, shit.
No, it is tomorrow.
Listen, when I'm done here, I've gotta get back, babe.
- No, uh-uh.
- It's a full-on day.
I've got to bring the car back to London,
I've got to try my suit on.
When you're done here?
You cheeky bastard.
Do you think when they're married, he'll still be sneaking in her bedroom window?
They'll be in married quarters so he won't need to.
Can I go through my speech one more time?
No.
Just go to sleep.
It's bloody good, though, isn't it?
Moving and hilarious.
Yes, love.
Oh, gross!
I'd rather listen to your speech than them bonking next door.
Hiya.
What've you been up to, you dirty, horrible degenerate?
Nothing, just been, erm, practising my wedding dance with your sister.
- Oh, yeah, bet you have
- Oi!
Tarring me with your brush, again.
Morning.
What's going on?
Erm, I am just about to head back to London, to try my glad rags on.
Not getting married in your birthday suit, then?
No, can't afford the bridesmaids fainting at the altar, can we?
They've been practising their wedding dance apparently.
Oh, aye?
What's your wedding dance then, Elvis?
You going to be shaking your funky stuff
- on the dance floor, Elvis?
- Can't tell you.
Hey, are you going to serenade us?
I mean, your mum must have called you Elvis for a reason.
I can't tell you, it's classified!
- I can hold a tune, me.
- Yeah?
- Mm.
- Well, listen, it's our dance, it's our special song and you lot are all going to love it.
- Oooh!
- See you later.

Good to see you.
Ahh, you look so smart.
Nice to see you.
Thanks for coming.
- You look gorgeous.
- Dad, your jacket...
There you go.
Thank you.
Oh, I've had enough of this.
Oh, hello, Grandmother's coming!
Georgie, where is he?
He is still coming, in't he?
He should be waiting for you, not you waiting for him!
Oh, he's always late on parade, it's fine.
The groom should be here before the bride,
- you know that, don't you?
- Oh, I know.
I know what he's like.
It's fine.
Where is he, Dad?
- What time is it?
- It's only five past, we've got the place till half past, don't worry!
Have you spoken to him this morning?
No.
What's going on?
Er... can we go somewhere private?
Yeah.
- Is everything all right?
- Who's that?
I'm so sorry, Georgie.
He said...
Tell me again.
He said that he can't go through with it.
And that's it?
Why's he done this to me?
Dad!
It's all right.
Let it out.
Let it out.
_
So, on the cry of "man down", you get to the body as soon as you can, making sure of your own personal safety.
Why, Jenkinson?
Erm, so...
Sorry, I'm not sure, Staff.
Because a dead medic is no use to their platoon.
So once it is safe, and you've done your 5s, your 20s, proceed to the casualty.
Carry out your primary survey,
C, A, B, C. Yeah?
Catastrophic bleed, airway, breathing, circulation.
So what do we do, Cox?
Yeah, erm,
- check the airwaves and then make sure...
- Airway, Cox.
Airway.
Erm...
Erm...
Catastrophic bleed, airway, breathing, circulation deformities, environment exposure.
Cox, airway.
Now.
You're all right, relax.
- Sir.
- Relax.
All right, Georgie, how have you been?
Yeah, good, thanks, sir.
- How's things with you?
- Yeah, very well, thank you.
- Molly's back in Afghan.
- Yeah, I heard.
Facebook.
She's working with the training and advisory team.
You probably know that already.
So what you doing here?
Final mission-specific training on the moors before Kenya.
You going Kenya?
Humanitarian mission.
Outreach project in the refugee camps on the Somali border.
Well, some of us have to work for a living.
I've just had a word with your CO and he thinks it's a sound idea.
What?
Need a medic.
Experienced.
Top of the range, fully loaded, and you fit the bill.
What do you think?
Actually, don't answer that now, you can chat it through with your loved ones and tell me in the morning.
And you can say to your new chap that it's only six weeks and you'll be back by Christmas.
Isn't that what they said when they headed out to the First World War?
I wouldn't know, Georgie.
I'm not as old as I look.
How do you know that I've got a new chap?
Ah.
Molly.
- No secret is safe with social media.
- No.
- He's a doctor, I believe.
- Mm-hm, a notch up from a squaddie.
Well, why don't you think that over?
You won't hear from me in the morning.
Why's that?
Because I can say "yes" now, sir.
- Ooh... 14 hour, 12 minute shift.
- Yeah!
Apartment.
Bath.
Candles.
Wine.
I wish people would only get ill for eight hours a day.
What?
It'd relieve the pressure on the NHS.
Well, funny you should say that, because in Afghan...
- Oh, during the war...
- Yes.
Yeah...
Heard it all before.
I got made a rather interesting proposition today.
Oi, you're marrying me.
Tell all the other suitors to back off.
Yeah, well, it's not that interesting.
It's, erm, work.
In Kenya.
A six-week humanitarian mission.
Well, I hope you told 'em where to stick it.
You're on a humanitarian mission in Manchester, looking after me.
Your eyes are rather beautiful.
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.
Well, the sclera of your eyes are as white as virgin snow.
- I can't...
I'm sorry!
- What?
Come on, you see, I try to be romantic and you just throw it back in my face!
Everything is just medical with you.
Yeah, military with you, young lady!
It's six weeks.
OK?
You're happy for me to go Kenya?
What have they got in Kenya they don't have in Preston?
All right, don't answer that.
And once we're married, I won't be doing any more tours away.
Maybe...
Maybe we should set a date... to get married.
Look, I do want to marry you...
I do, it's just...
It's just all the shiz that comes with it.
- What shiz?
- Everything!
Yeah, but I thought after Sierra Leone
- you were going to stay based in the UK.
- Yes, and I will be.
You won't even know I've gone.
Hmm?
Yeah?
I know I'm not exactly Sigmund Freud or anything like that, but... it's pretty clear to me that you are refusing to set a date for the wedding because you're shitting yourself that Jamie's going to do an Elvis.
What's doing an Elvis?
"Forgetting" to turn up.
Jamie's not going to do that, Georgie, he dotes on you.
So if you are going to run off and abandon him, can you please let me know first?
Because...
I'll be all over that boy.
All right.
I'll give you first dibs.
Anyway, I'm not running away, Marie.
You can't bullshit a bullshitter, Georgie.
I know exactly what's going on here, OK?
I did GCSE psychology, don't forget.
Yeah, and you failed it.
So then why haven't you told Jamie about Elvis?
Look, do you mind buggering off so I can concentrate on packing my kit, please?
Ooh...
Back of the net!
What?
You are running away, and you haven't told him about Elvis.
I don't give a toss about Elvis.
I ain't thought about him in years so...
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, it's a six-week humanitarian tour in Kenya, Marie, right?
And once we're back, we'll set a date for the wedding.
OK, and that's when you're going to tell him about Elvis, yeah?
Do you tell all your boyfriends about your previous relationships?
No!
And I didn't fail, I got a D!
Yeah, for demented!
What, into Nairobi?
- Yeah.
- And then how many hours' drive?
- About six, seven.
- I bet.
- Bloody hell.
- Oh!
I love a woman in uniform!
Come here.
Let me see you.
You used to love ME that much, Mother.
In your dreams!
- You look gorgeous.
You look gorgeous.
- No, I do not.
Thank you.
Right, guys, we're just going to update you on our current situation and give you your missions and tasks.
We're going to be heading towards the Somali border, here.
We'll be imbedded with the Kenyan army, under the command of Captain Osman, who was, incidentally, at Sandhurst with me.
Firstly, welcome.
I'm looking forward to working with you over the next few weeks.
We're going to be working closely with the Kenyan NGO
Kenya Crisis Care.
They are working here at the large refugee camp, a breeding ground for Al Shabaab.
Many NGOs have been killed, many more have fled, leaving the camp very unstable.
Primarily, we'll be tasked with supporting the Kenyan army in restoring order and assisting the Kenya Crisis Care with delivering medical services to tens of thousands of inhabitants.
The insurgents have a ready supply of weapons from across the Somali border and they are proficient at making IEDs.
We need to stay focused, stay alert and stay alive.
This is effectively a war zone.
Therefore, whilst our mission is primarily humanitarian, we need to protect ourselves.
The situation on the Somali border is anything but straightforward.
When the Brits drew a border between countries, they did it in a straight line... which has resulted in the displacement of many ethnic Somalis.
Generally, inside the camps here, they are hostile to the military.
Their men with guns hate our men with guns.
Pretty much.
But also, the NGOs, needing to remain impartial so they can function within the camps, cannot be seen as taking sides with us.
Albeit we're there to help them.
We don't want to add to the confusion within the camp.
We are there to help... then we will withdraw to a military base three miles outside the camp.
That's where we'll be based and we'll move into the camp for a specific purpose.
Any questions thus far?
No, boss.
Right, guys, get your heads down tonight.
Breakfast tomorrow at 0530 then we move out at 0600.
Sir.
I like our new medic, boss.
I've got to hand it to you, you've got moves like Jagger.
What does that even mean, Fingers, you weapon-grade scrotum?
All right, I'm just saying, hand on my heart, I've had worse.
Oh, so we choose our medics based on their appearance,
- like a beauty contest?
- I would.
That's exactly what I'd do.
That's cos you're a bell-end, Monk.
Thanks, boss.
When you're shot, you're unlikely to have a hard-on, so we choose our medics based on their ability to deal with medical emergencies.
I don't know,
I reckon I'd still have a raging boner.
All we need now is to get you shot, Monk, then we'll find out.
And that will be arranged if you two don't start getting a shift in!
You two shitheads need to switch on, sharpish.
Sir.
All right, babe, you need a hand?
No, I'm all right, thanks.
You married?
Just thought I'd get straight to the point.
You'd better crack on, hadn't you?
Crack on to you, that's what I'm saying.
I'm engaged.
And I'm here to work.
Got that?
I like you already.
Welcome aboard.
Kicki, the soldiers are here.
Did they bring the equipment?
I'm sure.
They're only just parking up now.
OK, let's go.
Everyone off.
Doing all right?
All good, boss.
Hey.
Hey, Kicki, how are you?
- All right, and you?
- Good.
- Nafula...
- Captain Osman.
Let me introduce you to Captain James.
Right team, C Operation now!
Lane, on me!
Help!
Help!
Approximately...
- Kicki, come on.
- eight casualties.
Lift them and get them into triage.
Quickly!
Don't move them until they've been assessed!
Let's get 'em stable first.
I need tourniquets and morphine from my med Bergan...
ASAP.
Come on, move.
We become a target here!
Get down!
Contact?
Has anybody got eyes on?
I think one shooter!
No, three, 200 metres, hillside!
Don't shoot until you're sure!
We need to get them extracted, now!
- Into triage, quickly!
- Escort casualties!
Lift on three.
Yeah?
One, two, three...
Go!
Right, mate, we'll take over.
Hi, sir.
Hi, can you hear me?
Can you tell me your name?
Soon as he's off...
Soon as he's off
- I want you back outside.
- We're going to get you to a doctor as soon as we can, OK?
Put pressure there for me, yeah?
Push down.
Push down.
- Push down, yeah?
- One, two, three...
We have to take his blood pressure.
I have been in this camp for ten years.
Which I think beats your seven minutes.
I was worried, all right?
If we moved him he would've bled out.
Not moving them would have resulted in a bullet in the head.
For them as well as us.
We've got morphine so we can give them pain relief until the doctor arrives.
Doctors?
We...
We treat them as best we can until it's safe to get the most seriously injured to hospital.
Where are the doctors?
Gone.
Gone?
German doctor was taken hostage last week and the rest of her team withdrew to the hospital in the city.
That's the reality...
Lane.
Kicki, we need you.
We have a head trauma
- that I don't understand.
- I'm here.
What, from the fire?
Why would you have it from the fire?
Right, night, lads.
- Night.
- Goodnight.
Give us a shout if you get lonely, sugar tits.
Monk!
I don't want you to think that I'm a humourless Northern bird... but one more comment from you and I will inject you with a serum to make your cock shrivel to the size of your brain.
You just got told!
She can handle herself.
Oh, yeah, she's good.
Like, everything's a bit out of control.
My grandparents went to Kenya, said it was lovely.
Well, we're in a bit of Kenya that I doubt your grandparents came to!
Can't be as bad as Afghan, can it?
Erm...
It's...
It's different.
Are you OK?
Yeah, miss you.
I miss you too.
Look, tell me everything's all right out there.
Maybe I can do something good.
Medic, are you decent?
- I've gotta go, OK?
Love you.
- All right.
Stay safe.
Yeah, come in.
Sorry to disturb you, Medic, have you got any painkillers?
Yeah, yeah.
What's the matter?
Oh, I've just got a headache.
It's the heat and lack of sleep...
All right, keep hydrated, yeah?
I just wanted to... check you were OK.
You know, what with Kicki and that.
I thought you were 100% right, if that's any help.
I'm fine.
Thanks, Brains.
You know, under normal circs we shouldn't have moved those people till they'd been assessed.
Well, I don't think that normal circs exist round here.
Everything all right here, Brains?
Yeah, boss.
Sorry, boss.
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just getting everything ready for tomorrow.
Do you think it's safe to leave supplies in camp?
Ah, we can ask Kicki about that in the morning.
Well, she has been here for ten years, boss.
I know!
I imagine six weeks is going to feel like a lifetime to us.
It's good to have you on the team, Lane.
I was worried you might say no because of the friends I keep.
He's not Voldemort, you can actually mention his name, you know.
Well, it was horrible and I think Elvis could have handled it better.
It was the best thing that never happened to me.
Have you heard from Elvis at all,
- caught up on his news?
- Nope.
Honestly, boss, I'm so not interested.
- Look, I know he's a complete tosser but...
- But he's your mate.
I know.
Yeah, he's a good mate.
Not a good boyfriend, obviously, but as a mate...
Can we...
Can we just get on with the tour?
I realise he's your mate but can we just shut the door on yesterday, please, boss?
Get some shuteye.
Tomorrow may well be momentous.
Lane?
Lane...
Lane.
Lane, you need to wake up.
What's happened?
What is it?
They've taken Kicki.
What do you mean?
They smashed their way into the Kenya Crisis Care base.
She's been taken hostage by terrorists as yet unknown.
We need to get down there and calm the situation.
- ASAP, please, Lane.
- Boss.
Right, guys, debus.
We're supporting the Kenyans with crowd control.
Calm the situation and get these people away from the med centre.
Lane.
How?
How can anybody do this?
If you guys hadn't have come, maybe none of this would have happened.
Your presence with your guns has stirred their anger...
We're here to help.
Well, it hasn't helped.
Everything's ruined!
Look...
I don't know how things are ever going to get better.
Or how to carry on any more.
Right, guys, in here now!
We'll bring in all med re-supplies, get you back up and running.
- House party carnage!
- Learn when to keep quiet, Fingers.
Right, you and Monk go and get a truck.
Bring it down here and start loading this up and get this place cleared ASAP.
- Sir.
- Kingy.
Right, fellas, you know what to do.
Weapons and helmets down here, let's get this squared away!
Lane...
Captain James.
Intelligence suggests an Al Shabaab-inspired group, but possibly a breakaway faction working on their own.
MoD up to speed on all events.
Our special forces are out looking already.
We've got to get this facility up and running today, boss.
People will die without this care.
You're in your own time now.
They've been onto the Swiss Embassy.
They're trying to contact her family.
But we're her family.
I'm her family.
You know, this was her life...
We were all that she knew, all that she cared about.
Without her...
She'll be looking at you to carry on, Nafula.
Every minute of every day, she was saving lives.
We're not just going to let her life's work go to waste, Nafula.
Let's bring all the supplies in, yeah?
See as many patients as we can.
They took the computer.
Kicki and others were working on a database of patients...
How long have you been working here?
Not as long as Kicki, but this is my life too.
What's this?
Kicki's dictaphone.
Maybe it's not broken.
Is that Kicki?
- Thank you, Lane.
- Boss.
She was dictating notes when they came in.
She obviously had the gumption to leave it running.
Captain Osman will now be passing this to Kenyan intelligence.
Where is she, what are they doing with her?
Undercover Kenyan special forces are imbedded in Al Shabaab.
They'll find out where she's being kept and we'll do all we can to bring her back alive.
You don't exactly sound massively optimistic!
Right.
On me.
They're trying to stop a flood with...
I dunno, a fishing net.
We're here to do a job, Lane.
Let's focus on the task in hand.
I don't even know what that means any more.
What can I do?
We need to do a quick assessment, divide them into urgent and non-urgent cases.
Urgent on the right and we'll try to see them today.
Life-threatening at the front.
We're doing all we can, Nafula.
Mother with babies here...
Go on.
It's worse than Manchester Royal Infirmary on a Friday night, mate.
All right, boys, look, your Amazon delivery is here.
Guys, how about helping with the fridge?
And the med kit needs to be taken into the triage ASAP.
You struggling?
Shut up, Monk.
We had one fridge all the way through my childhood.
You must have been poor, then, Dangles.
I always thought we were quite rich until I started going out with Glynis.
You're joking!
What's wrong with Glynis, man?
We've all seen Glynis...
Please keep calm.
What is that?
Is that a Tic Tac?
Kicki's idea.
Not everyone, but some people just need a little pill.
My mother, for a start.
Really?
It seems to keep them quiet and makes them feel better.
Tic Tac!
Good tac-tics, eh, Lane?
Can you ask him how long he's had this?
- Two years.
- Two years.
Right, let's clean it up and dress it as best we can.
Have you got any antibiotics?
Just flip him over for me.
Going to flip you over, sir.
There you go.
Just hold that nice and tight for me, there.
Thank you.
Keep it down.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- No.
Thank you, Georgie.
Got a kid with a mouthful of maggots, Medic.
We're walking past this kid and I smiled at him, and when he smiled back all these maggots fell out.
- Straight up, boss.
- My dad was a fisherman, boss.
24-carat maggots.
We're here to help.
Calm, calm.
OK.
Come here.
OK.
What's your name, darling?
Jomo.
- Jomo.
- Jono.
- Jono?
- Jomo.
Jomo.
OK, Jomo.
- Open your mouth.
- Bit of a pen and ink in the old north and south, eh, Georgie?
OK.
I'm going to look after your son, sir.
Lie back for me, darling.
There you go.
Yeah.
Open your mouth.
Your mouth.
Open your mouth for me.
Yeah, the tooth is very loose.
I'm going to have to extract.
Erm, will you get me some lignocaine gel, please?
Have you ever done an extraction before, Lane?
Erm, only on myself, but I was seven years old.
All right, I'll pull the tooth out, then we'll flush the infected area out with saline, OK?
Can I have the forceps, please?
- Need a hand, Lane?
- Yeah, Monk.
There you go, darling, thank you.
- What do you want me to do?
- Just hold his head, very gently, yeah?
There you go, darling.
That's good.
Thank you.
I'll try and get as many of the maggots out as we can.
OK, keep your mouth wide for me.
OK?
That's it.
You're going to be all right.
You're gonna be eating crisps in no time.
Shh, shh, shh.
There you go.
A few more, a few more, it's OK.
That's it.
Right, just keep him really still, OK?
Listen, you're gonna feel a little tiny bit of pain and then you're going to be fine.
Yeah, it's going to be over.
Yeah?
OK.
Right.
Monk, just hold his head tight for me, yeah?
- Reassure him.
- What?
Reassure him.
Shh!
Reassure him.

Gauze in.
There you go.
Monk, you've stopped singing.
A maggot landed on my hand, you threw me out of my stride.
Did Kicki go home often?
Back to Switzerland?
No.
Why?
There's never a quiet moment in the camp.
How about you?
Do you manage to get back home?
Let's just say that when my grandfather passed away, we had an outbreak of malaria.
You didn't go back home?
I couldn't leave Kicki.
You need to sort your work/life balance out, young lady.
What does that mean?
Seriously, you need to find some time for you.
But there's work to be done.
Well, are you going to get married, have your own family?
That's not for me to decide.
- Your parents?
- No,
Allah.
Are you married?
Erm, well, no, I'm engaged.
To a doctor.
He should come out here.
- Is he a nice man?
- Of course!
I wouldn't be marrying him if he wasn't pretty perfect.
He's perfect?
Yeah.
Yeah, he is, Nafula.
Perfect for me anyway.
I think I might end up married to the Kenyan Crisis Care... like Kicki.
Yeah, but look at Kicki.
Sacrificed everything and...
Life is about sacrifice.
But it shouldn't be about regret, should it?
No.
- Kicki's watch.
- Mm?
This one.
She was very proud of that.
It was very special.
She said it kept absolute perfect time, although she always kept it five minutes fast.
I need to go and see Captain James.
Are you all right here on your own for a sec?
I'm hardly on my own...
I've half the Kenyan army outside.
Jomo's father had that watch!
- Or one like it.
- No, I'm pretty sure it was that one, boss.
It's not in our remit to start investigating petty theft, Lane.
But it's not exactly petty theft, though, is it?
He must know something about her abduction.
Let's get Kenyan intelligence to investigate.
- We can't just abandon her, boss.
- We're not abandoning her.
But it feels like she's been abandoned to me.
Then you don't understand.
Our sources are looking at likely safe houses...
So, are we going to investigate?
Once we've ascertained for sure, we move in.
Your passion and your information are appreciated.
As I've already said, Lane, we're here to do a job on this camp.
And that job is so colossal we need to focus on that.
And that job will be made a whole lot easier if we find Kicki.
Thank you, Lane.
There were these clowns in the cancer ward today.
Clowns?
Yeah, yeah, but we're not allowed to call them clowns.
Why not?
Well, cos so many people have clown phobias.
- So what do you call them, then?
- Er... chuckle monsters.
You taking the piss?
!
No!
All right, well...
I think I might have a chuckle-monster phobia.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I think I might become a chuckle monster.
Why not?
If we're not careful, life's going to slip through our hands
- without us realising.
- Oh, what?
!
What, do you... do you feel like life is slipping though your hands?
Erm...
Today I do, yeah.
Have you been putting your sunblock on?
Yeah... the sun's got to me!
Let's just get married.
As soon as I get back.
You serious?
Mm-hm!
You know,
I don't want a huge thing.
I'm down for it.
How many babies we going to have?
I'll think about it and text you.
OK.
Lane, you decent?
- Got to go.
- Lane?
Yes, boss.
Come in, boss.
As you were, Lane.
I've got some very interesting intel coming in.
Boss?
An eyewitness has seen a Western woman being taken into a dwelling.
Kicki?
It's looking hopeful, Lane.
And this individual has been seen frequenting the place.
Jomo's father.
O Group, mission briefing 0600.
- Mission briefing?
- Need a combat medic.
Full battle.
Well done, Lane.
Thank you, boss.
Gents, sit up!
Relax, guys.
We're about to embark on an operation to help Captain Osman and his men.
Kenyan intelligence have got eyes on this dwelling.
It's an Al Shabaab dwelling known to be frequented by Mr Sidiq, among others.
He is well known around camp and has many contacts there, that's why this morning's operation needs to be swift... the element of surprise on our side.
As the Kenyan army always do the morning sweep around town, our presence will not be unexpected.
Any questions?
No, sir.
ETA two minutes.
Focus, guys.
Prepare to move...
Two alphas.
Keep eyes on.
I repeat, keep eyes on.
Perimeter secure.
Right, we're searching and clearing.
Charlie Fire team on me.
Delta, right-flank it.
Prepare to move...
Move!
Lane.
Two fatalities here
- and attend to this one.
- Yes, boss!
Delta Fire team, push up.
Keep your hand pressed down firmly on your neck for me, all right?
There we go, keep the pressure on.
Delta Fire team, push up.
Cut!
Clear.
- Clear.
- Clear.
Charlie team!
Dangles, cover this door.
Mansfield, Monk, on me.
Eyes for hostage.
Check for captive.
One, two, three...
Monk, on me.
Move!
Move!
Move!
Go onto the balcony!
- Balcony clear.
- Stand up slowly!
Stand up now!
- Stand up!
- Stand up now!
Get up, get your hands on your head.
Put your hands on your head.
- Turn tound now!
- Turn around!
- Turn around now!
- Brains, turn him to me now.
*** Positive ID.
Right, that's dressed, that should staunch the bleed...
Let's give you something for the pain.
Dwelling clear!
Lane, need you.
Jomo.
Jomo.
Jomo.
Hey, it's all right...
Remember me?
Remember me, yeah?
We obviously had to search him in case he was booby-trapped.
Hence his distress.
It's all right.
Your father's all right, I've seen him.
He's alive, they're just taking him to the police station.
Does he speak English, Lane?
You understand me, don't you, Jomo?
It's all right.
Let's get you looked after.
OK?
Where's your mother?
Dead.
I'll be outside.
All right...
We'll take you back to the camp, with Nafula.
Do you remember Nafula?
They're looking for a lady from the camp...
Kicki.
Do you know Kicki?
Was Kicki here?
Is she still here now?
Where was she?
Boss!
Boss!
Right, this is now a crime scene.
No-one contaminate anything.
I'll leave the police here on guard.
Let's get the injured to hospital.
Kenya Crisis Care ambulance on the way, boss.
- ETA three minutes.
- Nice one, Kingy.
Right, guys, listen in.
Good work out there today.
If I had to single out a man of the match,
I'd give it to Lance Corporal Lane.
- Thanks, boss.
- You've always had a thing for the medic, boss.
- Strike one, Fingers.
- Sorry.
Her interventions led to the arrest of several
Al Shabaab figures in there today.
This is exactly how it started with Molly.
Strike two, Fingers.
Right, guys, stay here.
Lane, on me.
I'll need to go with him, boss.
If he crashes and there's no-one medical in the ambulance...
You do know he's Al Shabaab, Lane?
I need to keep him stable... get him to the hospital alive.
We can't just let him die, boss, whoever he is.
Kingy, get 'em all loaded up, we're escorting the ambulance to hospital.
- Boss?
- Lane can't do this on her own.
Mansfield, jump up front in the ambulance.
Kingy, in front of the truck with me.
Eyes on the ambulance throughout.
Let's go!
Right, guys, you heard the boss.
Let's go!
Good luck, Lane.
Right, that's all done.
_
Shit.
Fuck!
You all right back there, Georgie?
- He's crashed on me.
- Anything I can help with?
Fuck all, mate.
Let's just get him to the hospital ASAP.
Right, come on, put your foot down.
Slow down.
Slow down!
Watch out.
Move!
Get to the right.
Get to the right.
- What's he doing?
- No idea.
What's going on?
- Is everybody OK?
- Captain Osman, find out what's going on.
What the hell's he doing?
!
Contact.
Yeah.
Take the doctor.
Has anyone got eyes on Lane?
I am a British citizen being held hostage and will be executed at sundown tomorrow if all Al Shabaab fighters are not released.
You release our fighters... or we cut off her head.
The situation has now escalated.
We're soon to be joined by special forces.
What's going to happen to me now?
Pow!
Please, I'm a medical person.
I can help you and your brothers.
Please.
Please!

Elvis?
- (Chuckles)
- Now I'm gonna kill you.
I could get out of this but it would involve inflicting much pain upon your personage.
You reckon?
(She yelps)
- Hi.
- Hi.
We're getting married tomorrow.
- Mm-mn.
No.
Day after tomorrow.
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.
- Are you sure?
Oh, no, shit.
No, it is tomorrow.
(She giggles)
Listen, when I'm done here, I've gotta get back, babe.
- Uh-uh.
- It's a full-on day.
I've got to bring the car back to London, gotta try my suit on.
When you're done here?
You cheeky bastard.
(Banging and moaning in next room)
(He sighs)
Do you think when they're married he'll still be sneaking in her bedroom window?
They'll be in married quarters so he won't need to.
Can I go through my speech one more time?
No.
Just go to sleep.
It's bloody good, though, in't it?
Moving and hilarious.
Yes, love.
- (Sexual moaning)
- Oh, gross!
I'd rather listen to your speech than them bonking next door.
Hiya.
What've you been up to, you dirty, horrible degenerate?
Nothing, just been practising my wedding dance with your sister.
Oh, yeah, bet you have.
Oi!
Tarring me with your brush again?
Morning.
What's going on?
I am just about to head back to London, to try my glad rags on.
Not getting married in your birthday suit?
No, can't have bridesmaids fainting at the altar, can we?
They've been practising their wedding dance apparently.
Aye?
What's your wedding dance, then, Elvis?
You gonna be shaking your funky stuff on the dance floor?
- Can't tell you.
- Are you gonna serenade us?
Your mum must have called you Elvis for a reason.
I can't tell you, it's classified!
I can hold a tune, me.
Yeah?
Well, listen, it's our dance, it's our special song and you lot are all gonna love it.
- Oooh!
- See you later.

Oh, I've had enough of this.
Oh, hello, Grandmother's coming!
Georgie, where is he?
He is still coming, in't he?
He should be waiting for you, not you waiting for him!
Oh, he's always late on parade, it's fine.
The groom should be here before the bride, you know that?
Oh, I know.
I know what he's like.
- It's fine.
- Where is he, Dad?
- What time is it?
- Only five past.
We've got till half past, don't worry.
Have you spoke to him this morning?
No.
What's going on?
Er... can we go somewhere private?
Yeah.
MAN:
Is everything all right?
Who's that?
I'm so sorry, Georgie.
He said...
Tell me again.
He said that he can't go through with it.
And that's it?
Why's he done this to me?
Dad!
(Sobs)
It's all right.
Let it out.
Let it out.
(Sobs)
(Soldiers chanting commands)
So, on the cry of "man down", you get to the body as soon as you can, making sure of your own personal safety.
Why, Jenkinson?
Uhm... so...
Sorry, I'm not sure, Staff.
Because a dead medic is no use to their platoon.
So once it is safe, and you've done your 5s, your 20s, proceed to the casualty.
Carry out your primary survey.
C, A, B, C.
Yeah?
Catastrophic bleed, airway, breathing, circulation.
So what do we do, Cox?
(Clears throat) Yeah, uhm... check the airwaves and make sure...
Airway, Cox.
Airway.
Uhm... airway.
Catastrophic bleed, airway, breathing, circulation... deformities, environment exposure.
Cox, airway.
Now.
You're all right, relax.
- Sir.
- Relax.
It's good.
All right, Georgie, how have you been?
Good, thanks, sir.
How's things with you?
Yeah, very well, thank you.
Molly's back in Afghan.
Yeah, I heard.
Facebook.
She's working with the training and advisory team.
You probably know that already.
So what you doing here?
Final mission-specific training on the moors before Kenya.
You going Kenya?
Humanitarian mission.
Outreach project in the refugee camps on the Somali border.
Well, some of us have to work for a living. (Chuckles)
I've just had a word with your CO and he thinks it's a sound idea.
- What?
- Need a medic.
Experienced.
Top of the range, fully loaded, and you fit the bill.
What do you think?
Actually, don't answer that now.
Chat it through with your loved ones and tell me in the morning.
And you can say to your new chap that it's only six weeks and you'll be back by Christmas.
Isn't that what they said when heading to the First World War?
I wouldn't know, Georgie.
I'm not as old as I look.
How do you know that I've got a new chap?
Ah.
Molly.
No secret is safe with social media.
No.
He's a doctor, I believe?
Mm-hm, a notch up from a squaddie.
(He chuckles)
Well... why don't you think that over?
You won't hear from me in the morning.
Why's that?
Because I can say "yes" now, sir.
Ooh... 14 hour, 12 minute shift.
Yeah!
Apartment.
Bath.
Candles.
Wine.
I wish people would only get ill for eight hours a day.
What?
It'd relieve the pressure on the NHS.
Well, funny you should say that, because in Afghan...
- Oh, during the war?
- Yes.
Yeah?
Heard it all before.
I got made a rather interesting proposition today.
Oi, you're marrying me.
Tell all the other suitors to back off.
Yeah, well, it's not that interesting.
It's, uhm... work.
In Kenya.
A six-week humanitarian mission.
Well, I hope you told 'em where to stick it.
You're on a humanitarian mission in Manchester, looking after me.
Come here.
Your eyes are rather beautiful.
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.
Well, the sclera of your eyes are as white as virgin snow.
(Chuckles) I can't...
I'm sorry!
See, I try to be romantic and you just throw it back in my face!
Everything is just so medical with you.
Yeah, military with you, young lady!
It's six weeks.
Okay?
You're happy for me to go Kenya?
What have they got in Kenya they don't have in Preston?
All right, don't answer that.
And once we're married, I won't be doing any more tours away.
Maybe...
Maybe we should set a date... to get married.
Look, I do want to marry you, I do, it's just... it's just all the shiz that comes with it.
- What shiz?
- Everything!
But I thought after Sierra Leone you were gonna be UK-based.
Yes, and I will be.
You won't even know that I've gone.
Hm?
Yeah?
(Chuckles)
I know I'm not Sigmund Freud or anything like that, but... it's pretty clear to me that you are refusing to set a date for the wedding cos you're shitting yourself
Jamie's gonna do an Elvis.
What's doing an Elvis?
"Forgetting" to turn up.
Jamie's not gonna do that, Georgie, he dotes on you.
So if you are gonna run off and abandon him, can you let me know first?
I'll be all over that boy.
All right.
I'll give you first dibs.
Anyway, I'm not running away, Marie.
You can't bullshit a bullshitter, Georgie.
I know exactly what's going on here, Okay?
I did GCSE psychology, don't forget.
Yeah, and you failed it.
So then why haven't you told Jamie about Elvis?
Do you mind buggering off so I can concentrate on packing?
- Ooh, back of the net!
- What?
You are running away, and you haven't told him about Elvis.
I don't give a toss about Elvis.
I ain't thought about him in years so...
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
It's a six-week humanitarian tour in Kenya, Marie, right?
And once we're back, we'll set a date for the wedding.
Okay, and that's when you're gonna tell him about Elvis, yeah?
Do you tell all your boyfriends about previous relationships?
- No!
- And I didn't fail, I got a D.
Yeah, for demented!
- What, into Nairobi?
- Yeah.
- Then how many hours' drive?
- About six, seven.
I bet.
Bloody hell.
Oh!
I love a woman in uniform!
Come here.
(She laughs)
Let me see you.
- You used to love me that much.
- In your dreams!
- You look gorgeous.
- No, I do not.
- Gorgeous.
- Thank you.
Right, we're gonna update you on our current situation and give you your missions and tasks.
We're going to be heading towards the Somali border, here.
We'll be embedded with the Kenyan Army, under the command of Captain Osman, who was, incidentally, at Sandhurst with me.
Firstly, welcome.
I'm looking forward to working with you in the next few weeks.
We're gonna be working closely with the Kenyan NGO
Kenya Crisis Care.
They are working here at the large refugee camp, a breeding ground for Al-Shabaab.
Many NGOs have been killed, many more have fled, leaving the camp very unstable.
Primarily, we'll be tasked with supporting the Kenyan Army in restoring order and assisting the Kenyan Crisis Care with delivering medical services to thousands of inhabitants.
The insurgents have a ready supply of weapons from across the Somali border and they are proficient at making IEDs.
We need to stay focused, stay alert and stay alive.
This is effectively a war zone.
Therefore, whilst our mission is primarily humanitarian, we need to protect ourselves.
The situation on the Somali border is anything but straightforward.
When the Brits drew a border between countries, they did it in a straight line which has resulted in the displacement of many ethnic Somali.
Generally, inside the camps, they're hostile to the military.
Their men with guns hate our men with guns.
Pretty much.
But also, the NGOs, needing to remain impartial so they can function within the camps, cannot be seen as taking sides with us.
Albeit we're there to help them.
We don't want to add to the confusion within the camp.
We are there to help.
Then we will withdraw to a military base three miles outside the camp.
That's where we'll be based and we'll move into the camp for a specific purpose.
Any questions thus far?
ALL:
No, boss.
Right, guys, get your heads down tonight.
Breakfast tomorrow at 0530, then we move out at 0600.
ALL:
Sir.
I like our new medic, boss.
I've got to hand it to you, you've got moves like Jagger.
What does that mean, Fingers, you weapon-grade scrotum?
I'm just saying, hand on my heart, I've had worse.
Oh, so we choose our medics based on their appearance, like a beauty contest?
I would.
That's exactly what I'd do.
That's cos you're a bell-end, Monk.
Thanks, boss.
When you're shot, you're unlikely to have a hard-on, so we choose our medics on their ability to deal with medical emergencies.
I don't know, I reckon I'd still have a raging boner.
All we need now is to get you shot, Monk, then we'll find out.
And that will be arranged if you don't start getting a shift in!
You two shitheads need to switch on, sharpish.
Sir.
All right, babe, do you need a hand?
No, I'm all right, thanks.
You married?
Just thought I'd get straight to the point.
You'd better crack on, hadn't you?
Crack on to you, that's what I'm saying.
I'm engaged.
And I'm here to work.
Got that?
I like you already.
Welcome aboard.
(Children laughing)
(Radio chatter)
- Kicki, the soldiers are here.
- Did they bring the equipment?
I'm sure.
They're only just parking up now.
Okay, let's go.
Everyone off.
You all all right?
All good, boss.
Hey.
- Hey, Kicki, how are you?
- All right, and you?
Good.
Nafula...
Captain Osman.
Let me introduce you to Captain James.
(Screaming)
Right, C Operation now!
Lane, on me!
(Barks commands)
(Screams)
Help!
Help!
KICKI:
Put him out!
Put him out!
Approximately...
eight casualties.
Lift them and get them into triage.
Quickly!
Don't move them until they've been assessed!
Let's get 'em stable first.
I need tourniquets and morphine from my med Bergan...
ASAP.
Come on, move.
We become a target here!
- (Rapid gunfire) - (Screaming)
Get down!
Contact?
Has anybody got eyes on?
I think one shooter!
No, three, 200 metres, hillside!
Don't shoot until you're sure!
We need to get them extracted, now!
Into triage, quickly!
Escort casualties!
Lift on three.
Yeah?
One, two, three...
Go!
Right, mate, we'll take over.
Hello, sir.
Hi, can you hear me?
- Can you tell me your name?
- Soon as he's off...
I want you back outside.
We're gonna get you a doctor as soon as we can, Okay?
Put pressure there for me, yeah?
Push down.
One, two, three, lift... (Groaning)
We have to take his blood pressure.
I have been in this camp for ten years, which I think beats your seven minutes.
I was worried, all right?
If we moved him, he would've bled out.
Not moving them would result in a bullet in the head.
- For them as well as us.
- We've got morphine so we can give them pain relief until the doctor arrives.
Doctors?
We...
We treat them as best we can until it's safe to get the most seriously injured to hospital.
- Where are the doctors?
- Gone.
Gone?
German doctor was taken hostage last week.
The rest of her team withdrew to the hospital in the city.
That's the reality...
Lane.
Kicki, we need you - a head trauma that I don't understand.
From the fire?
Why would you have it from a fire?
Right, night, lads.
- Night.
- Goodnight, sir.
Give us a shout if you get lonely, sugar tits.
Monk!
I don't want you to think I'm a humourless Northern bird... but one more comment from you and I'll inject you with a serum to make your cock shrivel to the size of your brain.
You just got told!
She can handle herself.
Oh, yeah, she's good.
Like, everything's a bit out of control.
My grandparents went to Kenya, said it was lovely.
We're in a bit of Kenya that I doubt your grandparents came to!
Can't be as bad as Afghan, can it?
Uhm... it's... it's different.
- Are you Okay?
- Yeah, I miss you.
I miss you too.
Look, tell me everything's all right out there.
Maybe I can do something good.
Medic, are you decent?
I've gotta go, Okay?
Love you.
All right.
Stay safe.
Yeah, come in.
Sorry to disturb you, Medic, have you got any painkillers?
Yeah, yeah.
What's the matter?
I've just got a headache.
It's the heat and lack of sleep.
All right, keep hydrated, yeah?
There you go.
I just wanted to...
check you were Okay.
You know, what with Kicki and that.
I thought you were 100 per cent right, if that's any help.
- I'm fine.
Thanks, Brains.
- You know, under normal circs we shouldn't have moved them till they'd been assessed.
I don't think that normal circs exist round here.
Everything all right here, Brains?
Yeah, boss.
Sorry, boss.
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just getting everything ready for tomorrow.
Do you think it's safe to leave supplies in camp?
We can ask Kicki that in the morning.
Well, she has been here for ten years, boss.
I know.
I imagine six weeks is going to feel like a lifetime to us.
It's good to have you on the team, Lane.
I was worried you might say no because of the friends I keep.
He's not Voldemort, you can mention his name, you know.
It was horrible.
I think Elvis could have handled it better.
It was the best thing that never happened to me.
Have you heard from Elvis at all, caught up on his news?
Nope.
Honestly, boss, I'm so not interested.
Look, I know he's a complete tosser but...
But he's your mate.
I know.
Yeah, he's a good mate.
Not a good boyfriend, obviously, but as a mate...
Can we...
Can we just get on with the tour?
I realise he's your mate but can we just shut the door on yesterday, please, boss?
Get some shut-eye.
Tomorrow may well be momentous.
Lane?
Lane?
Lane?
Lane, you need to wake up.
- What's happened?
What is it?
- They've taken Kicki.
What do you mean?
They smashed their way into the Kenya Crisis Care base.
She's been taken hostage by terrorists as yet unknown.
We need to get down there and calm the situation.
- ASAP, please, Lane.
- Boss.
Right, guys, debus.
We're supporting the Kenyans with crowd control.
Calm the situation and get these people away from the med centre.
(Clamouring)
(Shouting)
Lane.
Come.
How could anybody do this?
If you guys hadn't have come, maybe none of this would have happened.
Your presence with your guns has stirred their anger.
We're here to help.
Well, it hasn't helped.
Everything's ruined!
Look...
I don't know how things are ever gonna get better.
Or how to carry on any more.
Right, guys, in here now!
We'll bring in med re-supplies, get you back up and running.
- (Fingers whistles)
- House party carnage!
Learn when to keep quiet, Fingers.
Right, you and Monk go and get a truck.
Bring it down here.
Start loading this up and get this place cleared ASAP.
- Sir.
- Kingy.
Right, fellas, you know what to do.
Weapons and helmets down here, let's get this squared away!
Lane.
Captain James.
Intelligence suggests an Al-Shabaab-inspired group, but possibly a breakaway faction working on their own.
MoD up to speed on all events.
Our Special Forces are out looking already.
We've got to get this facility up and running today, boss.
People will die without this care.
(Men joke and laugh)
You're in your own time now.
They've been onto the Swiss Embassy.
They're trying to contact her family.
But we're her family.
I'm her family.
You know, this was her life...
We were all that she knew, all that she cared about.
Without her...
She'll be looking at you to carry on, Nafula.
Every minute of every day, she was saving lives.
We're not just gonna let her life's work go to waste, Nafula.
Let's bring all the supplies in, yeah?
See as many patients as we can.
They took the computer.
Kicki and others were working on a database of patients.
How long have you been working here?
Not as long as Kicki, but this is my life too.
What's this?
Kicki's Dictaphone.
Maybe it's not broken.
(Raised voices and pleading on tape)
Is that Kicki?
(Kicki screams and sobs)
(Raised voices and pleading on tape)
Thank you, Lane.
Boss.
She was dictating notes when they came in.
She had the gumption to leave it running.
Captain Osman will now pass this to Kenyan Intelligence.
Where is she?
What are they doing with her?
Undercover Kenyan Special Forces are embedded in Al-Shabaab.
They'll find out where she's being kept and we'll do all we can to bring her back alive.
(Scoffs)
You don't exactly sound massively optimistic!
Right.
On me.
(Shouting and quarrelling)
They're trying to stop a flood with...
I dunno, a fishing net.
We're here to do a job, Lane.
Let's focus on the task in hand.
I don't even know what that means any more.
(Nafula speaks Swahili)
What can I do?
We need to do a quick assessment, divide them into urgent and non-urgent cases.
Urgent on the right and we'll try to see them today.
Life-threatening at the front.
We're doing all we can, Nafula.
Mother with babies here.
Go on.
Worse than Manchester Royal Infirmary on a Friday night.
All right, boys, look, your Amazon delivery's here.
Guys, how about helping with the fridge?
And the med kit needs to be taken into the triage ASAP.
You struggling?
Shut up, Monk.
We had one fridge all the way through my childhood.
You must have been poor, then, Dangles.
I always thought we were quite rich until I started going out with Glynis.
- You're joking!
- What's wrong with Glynis, man?
- We've all seen Glynis...
- (All laugh)
Please keep calm.
What is that?
- Is that a Tic-Tac?
- Kicki's idea.
Not everyone, but some people just need a little pill.
My mother, for a start.
Really?
It seems to keep them quiet and makes them feel better.
Tic-Tac!
Good "tac-tics", eh, Lane?
Can you ask him how long he's had this?
(Translates)
(Responds in Swahili)
- Two years.
- Two years.
Right, let's clean it up and dress it as best we can.
Have you got any antibiotics?
Just flip him over for me.
Going to flip you over, sir.
There you go.
Just hold that nice and tight for me, there.
Thank you.
Keep it down.
Thank you.
(She speaks Swahili)
Thank you.
No.
Thank you, Georgie.
Got a kid with a mouthful of maggots, Medic.
Walking past this kid, I smiled at him, and when he smiled back all these maggots fell out.
Straight up, boss.
My dad was a fisherman. 24-carat maggots.
(Man speaks Swahili)
We're here to help.
Calm, calm.
(She speaks Swahili)
Okay.
Come here.
(Speaks Swahili)
Okay.
What's your name, darling?
(Nafula translates)
- Jomo.
- Jomo.
- Jono?
- Jomo.
Okay, Jomo.
Bit of a pen and ink in the old north and south, eh, Georgie?
Okay.
I'm gonna look after your son, sir.
Lie back for me, darling.
There you go.
Yeah.
Open your mouth.
Your mouth.
Open your mouth for me.
Yeah, the tooth is very loose.
I'm gonna have to extract.
Will you get me some lignocaine gel, please?
You ever done an extraction before, Lane?
Uhm... only on myself, but I was seven years old.
I'll pull the tooth out, then we'll flush the infected area with saline, Okay?
Can I have the forceps, please?
- Need a hand, Lane?
- Yeah, Monk.
- There you go, darling.
- What do you want me to do?
Just hold his head, very gently, yeah?
- There you go, darling.
- (He moans)
That's good, thank you.
I'll try and get as many of the maggots out as we can.
Okay, keep your mouth wide for me.
Okay?
- (He cries)
- That's it.
You're gonna be all right.
Eating crisps in no time.
Shh, shh, shh.
There you go.
A few more, a few more, it's Okay.
That's it.
There you go.
Right, just keep him really still, Okay?
You're gonna feel a little tiny bit of pain and then you're gonna be fine.
Yeah?
It's gonna be over.
Yeah?
Okay.
Thank you.
Monk, just hold his head tight, yeah?
Reassure him.
- What?
- Reassure him.
(He beatboxes)
Shh!
Reassure him.

Monk, you've stopped singing.
A maggot landed on my hand, you threw me out of my stride.
GEORGIE:
Did Kicki go home often?
Back to Switzerland?
No.
Why?
There's never a quiet moment in the camp.
How about you?
Do you manage to get back home?
Let's just say that when my grandfather passed away, we had an outbreak of malaria.
You didn't go back home?
I couldn't leave Kicki.
You need to sort your work-life balance out, young lady.
What does that mean?
Seriously, you need to find some time for you.
But there's work to be done.
Well, are you gonna get married, have your own family?
That's not for me to decide.
- Your parents?
- No, Allah.
Are you married?
Uhm... well, no, I'm engaged.
To a doctor.
He should come out here.
Is he a nice man?
Of course!
Wouldn't be marrying him if he wasn't pretty perfect.
He's perfect?
Yeah.
Yeah, he is, Nafula.
Perfect for me, anyway.
I think I might end up married to the Kenyan Crisis Care... like Kicki.
Yeah, but look at Kicki.
Sacrificed everything and...
Life is about sacrifice.
But it shouldn't be about regret, should it?
No.
- Kicki's watch.
- Mm?
This one.
She was very proud of that.
It was very special.
She said it kept absolute perfect time, although she always kept it five minutes fast.
I need to go and see Captain James.
Are you all right here on your own for a sec?
I'm hardly on my own.
I've half the Kenyan Army outside.
Jomo's father had that watch.
Or one like it.
No, I'm pretty sure it was that one, boss.
It's not in our remit to start investigating petty theft, Lane.
But it's not exactly petty theft, though, is it?
He must know something about her abduction.
Let's get Kenyan Intelligence to investigate.
- We can't abandon her, boss.
- We're not abandoning her.
But it feels like she's been abandoned to me.
Then you don't understand.
Our sources are looking at likely safe houses.
So, are we going to investigate?
Once we've ascertained for sure, we move in.
Your passion and your information are appreciated.
As I've already said, Lane, we're here to do a job on this camp.
And that job is so colossal we need to focus on that.
That job will be made a whole lot easier if we find Kicki.
Thank you, Lane.
There were these clowns in the cancer ward today.
Clowns?
Yeah, yeah, but we're not allowed to call them clowns.
Why not?
Well, cos so many people have clown phobias.
So what do you call them, then?
Er...chuckle monsters.
You taking the piss?
No!
All right, well, I think I might have a chuckle-monster phobia.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I think I might become a chuckle monster.
Why not?
If we're not careful, life's gonna slip through our hands
- without us realising.
- What?
What, do you feel like life is slipping though your hands?
Uhm...
Today I do, yeah.
Have you been putting your sunblock on?
Yeah... the sun's got to me!
Let's just get married.
As soon as I get back.
You serious?
Mm-hm.
You know, I don't want a huge thing.
I'm down for it.
How many babies are we gonna have?
I'll think about it and text you.
Okay.
- Lane, you decent?
- Gotta go.
- Lane?
- Yes, boss.
Come in, boss.
As you were, Lane.
I've got some very interesting intel.
Boss?
An eyewitness saw a Western woman taken into a dwelling.
- Kicki?
- It's looking hopeful, Lane.
And this individual has been seen frequenting the place.
Jomo's father.
O Group mission briefing 0600.
Mission briefing?
Need a combat medic.
Full battle.
Well done, Lane.
Thank you, boss.
Gents, sit up!
Relax, guys.
We're about to embark on an operation to help
Captain Osman and his men.
Kenyan Intelligence have got eyes on this dwelling.
It's an Al-Shabaab dwelling known to be frequented by Mr Sidiq, among others.
He is well known around camp and has many contacts there, that's why this morning's operation needs to be swift, the element of surprise on our side.
As the Kenyan Army always do the morning sweep around town, our presence will not be unexpected.
- Any questions?
ALL:
No, sir.
ETA two minutes.
Focus up, guys.
Prepare to move.
Two alphas.
Keep eyes on.
I repeat, keep eyes on.
(Speaks Swahili)
(Rapid gunfire)
(Yelling)
(Barks commands)
Perimeter secure.
We're searching and clearing.
Charlie Fire team on me.
Delta, right-flank it.
Prepare to move...
Move!
Lane.
Two fatalities here and attend to this one.
Yes, boss!
Delta Fire team, push up.
Keep your hand pressed down firmly on your neck for me.
There you go, keep the pressure on.
Delta Fire team, push up.
Cut!
- Clear!
- Clear!
Charlie team!
Dangles, cover this door.
Mansfield, Monk, on me.
Eyes for hostage.
Check for captive.
One, two, three...
Monk, on me.
Move!
Move!
Move!
(Shouting)
- Down, down!
- I'm on you!
Freeze!
- Stand up!
- Get him up!
Get up!
- Go onto the balcony!
- Balcony clear.
- Stand up slowly!
- Stand up now!
Stand up now!
Get up, get your hands on your head!
- Put your hands on your head.
- Turn around now!
Brains, turn him to me now.
Red cherry, positive ID.
Right, that's dressed, that should staunch the bleed.
Let's give you something for the pain.
Dwelling clear!
Lane, need you.
Jomo.
Jomo.
Jomo.
Hey, it's all right.
Remember me?
- Remember me, yeah?
- Had to search him in case he was booby-trapped, hence his distress.
It's all right.
Your father's all right, I've seen him.
He's alive, they're just taking him to the police station.
Does he speak English, Lane?
You understand me, don't you, Jomo?
It's all right.
Let's get you looked after, Okay?
Where's your mother?
Dead.
- (Horn sounds twice outside)
- I'll be outside.
All right.
We'll take you back to the camp, with Nafula.
Do you remember Nafula?
They're looking for a lady from the camp.
Kicki.
Do you know Kicki?
Was Kicki here?
Is she still here now?
Where was she?
Boss!
Boss!
This is now a crime scene.
No one contaminate anything.
I'll leave the police here on guard.
Let's get the injured to hospital.
Kenya Crisis Care ambulance on the way, boss.
- ETA three minutes.
- Nice one, Kingy.
Right, guys, listen in.
Good work out there today.
If I had to single out a man of the match, it'd go to Lance Corporal Lane.
Thanks, boss.
You've always had a thing for the medic, boss.
- Strike one, Fingers.
- Sorry.
Her interventions led to the arrest of several
Al-Shabaab figures in there today.
This is exactly how it started with Molly.
Strike two, Fingers.
Right, guys, stay here.
Lane, on me.
I'll need to go with him, boss.
If he crashes and there's no one medical in the ambulance...
You do know he's Al-Shabaab, Lane?
I need to keep him stable, get him to the hospital alive.
We can't just let him die, boss, whoever he is.
Kingy, load up.
We're escorting the ambulance to hospital.
- Boss?
- Lane can't do this on her own.
Mansfield, up front in the ambulance.
Kingy, truck.
Eyes on the ambulance throughout.
You heard the boss.
Let's go!
Good luck, Lane.
(Siren blares)
Right, that's all done.
(Text alert)
Shit.
- (Steady beep)
- Fuck!
- You all right back there?
- He's crashed on me.
Anything I can help with?
Fuck all, mate.
Let's just get him to the hospital ASAP.
Right, come on, put your foot down.
Slow down.
Slow down!
Watch out.
Move!
Get to the right.
Get to the right.
(Horn blares)
- What's he doing?
- No idea.
- What's going on?
- Is everybody Okay?
Captain Osman, find out what's going on.
(Speaks Swahili)
(Exchange in Swahili)
What the hell's he doing?
Contact.
Yeah.
(Gasps)
Take the doctor.
(Yells)
(Screaming)
(Yelling)
(Grunts)
Has anyone got eyes on Lane?
GEORGIE:
I am a British citizen being held hostage and will be executed at sundown tomorrow if all Al-Shabaab fighters are not released.
You release our fighters...
or we cut off her head.
The situation has now escalated.
We're soon to be joined by Special Forces.
(Two gunshots)
What's gonna happen to me now?
Pow!
Please, I'm a medical person.
I can help you and your brothers.
Please.
Please!

Elvis?
Now I'm gonna kill you.
I could get out of this but it would involve inflicting much pain upon your personage.
You reckon?
- Hi.
- Hi.
We're getting married tomorrow.
- Mm-mn.
No.
Day after tomorrow.
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.
- Are you sure?
Oh, no, shit.
No, it is tomorrow.
Listen, when I'm done here, I've gotta get back, babe.
- Uh-uh.
- It's a full-on day.
I've got to bring the car back to London, gotta try my suit on.
When you're done here?
You cheeky bastard.
Do you think when they're married he'll still be sneaking in her bedroom window?
They'll be in married quarters so he won't need to.
Can I go through my speech one more time?
No.
Just go to sleep.
It's bloody good, though, in't it?
Moving and hilarious.
Yes, love.
Oh, gross!
I'd rather listen to your speech than them bonking next door.
Hiya.
What've you been up to, you dirty, horrible degenerate?
Nothing, just been practising my wedding dance with your sister.
Oh, yeah, bet you have.
Oi!
Tarring me with your brush again?
Morning.
What's going on?
I am just about to head back to London, to try my glad rags on.
Not getting married in your birthday suit?
No, can't have bridesmaids fainting at the altar, can we?
They've been practising their wedding dance apparently.
Aye?
What's your wedding dance, then, Elvis?
You gonna be shaking your funky stuff on the dance floor?
- Can't tell you.
- Are you gonna serenade us?
Your mum must have called you Elvis for a reason.
I can't tell you, it's classified!
I can hold a tune, me.
Yeah?
Well, listen, it's our dance, it's our special song and you lot are all gonna love it.
- Oooh!
- See you later.
- Thanks.
- Pleasure.
Hey, can I just say...
Please don't say anything, Dad.
If you make me cry, my mascara runs, I look like a panda.
- I'm gonna get your train.
- Thank you.
I think when I get married I'm gonna have a horse and carriage.
That's what your dad wants for his funeral.
Maybe we can make a deal with the company and get a discount?
Can we hurry up?
My hair's gonna frizzle.
Even with frizzled hair, you're still too good for him.
Right, family, are we ready?
Are you ready?
Come on!
Hi!
Good to see you.
Ah, you look so smart.
Nice to see you.
Thanks for coming.
You look gorgeous.
Dad, your jacket...
There you go.
Thank you.
You look great.
Oh, I've had enough of this.
Oh, hello, Grandmother's coming!
Georgie, where is he?
He is still coming, in't he?
He should be waiting for you, not you waiting for him!
Oh, he's always late on parade, it's fine.
The groom should be here before the bride, you know that?
Oh, I know.
I know what he's like.
- It's fine.
- Where is he, Dad?
- What time is it?
- Only five past.
We've got till half past, don't worry.
Have you spoke to him this morning?
No.
What's going on?
Er... can we go somewhere private?
Yeah.
Is everything all right?
Who's that?
I'm so sorry, Georgie.
He said...
Tell me again.
He said that he can't go through with it.
And that's it?
Why's he done this to me?
Dad!
It's all right.
Let it out.
Let it out.
So, on the cry of "man down", you get to the body as soon as you can, making sure of your own personal safety.
Why, Jenkinson?
Uhm... so...
Sorry, I'm not sure, Staff.
Because a dead medic is no use to their platoon.
So once it is safe, and you've done your 5s, your 20s, proceed to the casualty.
Carry out your primary survey.
C, A, B, C.
Yeah?
Catastrophic bleed, airway, breathing, circulation.
So what do we do, Cox?
Yeah, uhm... check the airwaves and make sure...
Airway, Cox.
Airway.
Uhm... airway.
Catastrophic bleed, airway, breathing, circulation... deformities, environment exposure.
Cox, airway.
Now.
You're all right, relax.
- Sir.
- Relax.
It's good.
All right, Georgie, how have you been?
Good, thanks, sir.
How's things with you?
Yeah, very well, thank you.
Molly's back in Afghan.
Yeah, I heard.
Facebook.
She's working with the training and advisory team.
You probably know that already.
So what you doing here?
Final mission-specific training on the moors before Kenya.
You going Kenya?
Humanitarian mission.
Outreach project in the refugee camps on the Somali border.
Well, some of us have to work for a living.
I've just had a word with your CO and he thinks it's a sound idea.
- What?
- Need a medic.
Experienced.
Top of the range, fully loaded, and you fit the bill.
What do you think?
Actually, don't answer that now.
Chat it through with your loved ones and tell me in the morning.
And you can say to your new chap that it's only six weeks and you'll be back by Christmas.
Isn't that what they said when heading to the First World War?
I wouldn't know, Georgie.
I'm not as old as I look.
How do you know that I've got a new chap?
Ah.
Molly.
No secret is safe with social media.
No.
He's a doctor, I believe?
Mm-hm, a notch up from a squaddie.
Well... why don't you think that over?
You won't hear from me in the morning.
Why's that?
Because I can say "yes" now, sir.
Ooh... 14 hour, 12 minute shift.
Yeah!
Apartment.
Bath.
Candles.
Wine.
I wish people would only get ill for eight hours a day.
What?
It'd relieve the pressure on the NHS.
Well, funny you should say that, because in Afghan...
- Oh, during the war?
- Yes.
Yeah?
Heard it all before.
I got made a rather interesting proposition today.
Oi, you're marrying me.
Tell all the other suitors to back off.
Yeah, well, it's not that interesting.
It's, uhm... work.
In Kenya.
A six-week humanitarian mission.
Well, I hope you told 'em where to stick it.
You're on a humanitarian mission in Manchester, looking after me.
Come here.
Your eyes are rather beautiful.
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.
Well, the sclera of your eyes are as white as virgin snow.
I can't...
I'm sorry!
See, I try to be romantic and you just throw it back in my face!
Everything is just so medical with you.
Yeah, military with you, young lady!
It's six weeks.
Okay?
You're happy for me to go Kenya?
What have they got in Kenya they don't have in Preston?
All right, don't answer that.
And once we're married, I won't be doing any more tours away.
Maybe...
Maybe we should set a date... to get married.
Look, I do want to marry you, I do, it's just... it's just all the shiz that comes with it.
- What shiz?
- Everything!
But I thought after Sierra Leone you were gonna be UK-based.
Yes, and I will be.
You won't even know that I've gone.
Hm?
Yeah?
I know I'm not Sigmund Freud or anything like that, but... it's pretty clear to me that you are refusing to set a date for the wedding cos you're shitting yourself
Jamie's gonna do an Elvis.
What's doing an Elvis?
"Forgetting" to turn up.
Jamie's not gonna do that, Georgie, he dotes on you.
So if you are gonna run off and abandon him, can you let me know first?
I'll be all over that boy.
All right.
I'll give you first dibs.
Anyway, I'm not running away, Marie.
You can't bullshit a bullshitter, Georgie.
I know exactly what's going on here, Okay?
I did GCSE psychology, don't forget.
Yeah, and you failed it.
So then why haven't you told Jamie about Elvis?
Do you mind buggering off so I can concentrate on packing?
- Ooh, back of the net!
- What?
You are running away, and you haven't told him about Elvis.
I don't give a toss about Elvis.
I ain't thought about him in years so...
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
It's a six-week humanitarian tour in Kenya, Marie, right?
And once we're back, we'll set a date for the wedding.
Okay, and that's when you're gonna tell him about Elvis, yeah?
Do you tell all your boyfriends about previous relationships?
- No!
- And I didn't fail, I got a D.
Yeah, for demented!
- What, into Nairobi?
- Yeah.
- Then how many hours' drive?
- About six, seven.
I bet.
Bloody hell.
Oh!
I love a woman in uniform!
Come here.
Let me see you.
- You used to love me that much.
- In your dreams!
- You look gorgeous.
- No, I do not.
- Gorgeous.
- Thank you.
Right, we're gonna update you on our current situation and give you your missions and tasks.
We're going to be heading towards the Somali border, here.
We'll be embedded with the Kenyan Army, under the command of Captain Osman, who was, incidentally, at Sandhurst with me.
Firstly, welcome.
I'm looking forward to working with you in the next few weeks.
We're gonna be working closely with the Kenyan NGO
Kenya Crisis Care.
They are working here at the large refugee camp, a breeding ground for Al-Shabaab.
Many NGOs have been killed, many more have fled, leaving the camp very unstable.
Primarily, we'll be tasked with supporting the Kenyan Army in restoring order and assisting the Kenyan Crisis Care with delivering medical services to thousands of inhabitants.
The insurgents have a ready supply of weapons from across the Somali border and they are proficient at making IEDs.
We need to stay focused, stay alert and stay alive.
This is effectively a war zone.
Therefore, whilst our mission is primarily humanitarian, we need to protect ourselves.
The situation on the Somali border is anything but straightforward.
When the Brits drew a border between countries, they did it in a straight line which has resulted in the displacement of many ethnic Somali.
Generally, inside the camps, they're hostile to the military.
Their men with guns hate our men with guns.
Pretty much.
But also, the NGOs, needing to remain impartial so they can function within the camps, cannot be seen as taking sides with us.
Albeit we're there to help them.
We don't want to add to the confusion within the camp.
We are there to help.
Then we will withdraw to a military base three miles outside the camp.
That's where we'll be based and we'll move into the camp for a specific purpose.
Any questions thus far?
No, boss.
Right, guys, get your heads down tonight.
Breakfast tomorrow at 0530, then we move out at 0600.
Sir.
I like our new medic, boss.
I've got to hand it to you, you've got moves like Jagger.
What does that mean, Fingers, you weapon-grade scrotum?
I'm just saying, hand on my heart, I've had worse.
Oh, so we choose our medics based on their appearance, like a beauty contest?
I would.
That's exactly what I'd do.
That's cos you're a bell-end, Monk.
Thanks, boss.
When you're shot, you're unlikely to have a hard-on, so we choose our medics on their ability to deal with medical emergencies.
I don't know, I reckon I'd still have a raging boner.
All we need now is to get you shot, Monk, then we'll find out.
And that will be arranged if you don't start getting a shift in!
You two shitheads need to switch on, sharpish.
Sir.
All right, babe, do you need a hand?
No, I'm all right, thanks.
You married?
Just thought I'd get straight to the point.
You'd better crack on, hadn't you?
Crack on to you, that's what I'm saying.
I'm engaged.
And I'm here to work.
Got that?
I like you already.
Welcome aboard.
- Kicki, the soldiers are here.
- Did they bring the equipment?
I'm sure.
They're only just parking up now.
Okay, let's go.
Everyone off.
You all all right?
All good, boss.
Hey.
- Hey, Kicki, how are you?
- All right, and you?
Good.
Nafula...
Captain Osman.
Let me introduce you to Captain James.
Right, C Operation now!
Lane, on me!
Help!
Help!
Put him out!
Put him out!
Approximately...
eight casualties.
Lift them and get them into triage.
Quickly!
Don't move them until they've been assessed!
Let's get 'em stable first.
I need tourniquets and morphine from my med Bergan...
ASAP.
Come on, move.
We become a target here!
Get down!
Contact?
Has anybody got eyes on?
I think one shooter!
No, three, 200 metres, hillside!
Don't shoot until you're sure!
We need to get them extracted, now!
Into triage, quickly!
Escort casualties!
Lift on three.
Yeah?
One, two, three...
Go!
Right, mate, we'll take over.
Hello, sir.
Hi, can you hear me?
- Can you tell me your name?
- Soon as he's off...
I want you back outside.
We're gonna get you a doctor as soon as we can, Okay?
Put pressure there for me, yeah?
Push down.
One, two, three, lift...
We have to take his blood pressure.
I have been in this camp for ten years, which I think beats your seven minutes.
I was worried, all right?
If we moved him, he would've bled out.
Not moving them would result in a bullet in the head.
- For them as well as us.
- We've got morphine so we can give them pain relief until the doctor arrives.
Doctors?
We...
We treat them as best we can until it's safe to get the most seriously injured to hospital.
- Where are the doctors?
- Gone.
Gone?
German doctor was taken hostage last week.
The rest of her team withdrew to the hospital in the city.
That's the reality...
Lane.
Kicki, we need you - a head trauma that I don't understand.
From the fire?
Why would you have it from a fire?
Right, night, lads.
- Night.
- Goodnight, sir.
Give us a shout if you get lonely, sugar tits.
Monk!
I don't want you to think I'm a humourless Northern bird... but one more comment from you and I'll inject you with a serum to make your cock shrivel to the size of your brain.
You just got told!
She can handle herself.
Oh, yeah, she's good.
Like, everything's a bit out of control.
My grandparents went to Kenya, said it was lovely.
We're in a bit of Kenya that I doubt your grandparents came to!
Can't be as bad as Afghan, can it?
Uhm... it's... it's different.
- Are you Okay?
- Yeah, I miss you.
I miss you too.
Look, tell me everything's all right out there.
Maybe I can do something good.
Medic, are you decent?
I've gotta go, Okay?
Love you.
All right.
Stay safe.
Yeah, come in.
Sorry to disturb you, Medic, have you got any painkillers?
Yeah, yeah.
What's the matter?
I've just got a headache.
It's the heat and lack of sleep.
All right, keep hydrated, yeah?
There you go.
I just wanted to...
check you were Okay.
You know, what with Kicki and that.
I thought you were 100 per cent right, if that's any help.
- I'm fine.
Thanks, Brains.
- You know, under normal circs we shouldn't have moved them till they'd been assessed.
I don't think that normal circs exist round here.
Everything all right here, Brains?
Yeah, boss.
Sorry, boss.
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just getting everything ready for tomorrow.
Do you think it's safe to leave supplies in camp?
We can ask Kicki that in the morning.
Well, she has been here for ten years, boss.
I know.
I imagine six weeks is going to feel like a lifetime to us.
It's good to have you on the team, Lane.
I was worried you might say no because of the friends I keep.
He's not Voldemort, you can mention his name, you know.
It was horrible.
I think Elvis could have handled it better.
It was the best thing that never happened to me.
Have you heard from Elvis at all, caught up on his news?
Nope.
Honestly, boss, I'm so not interested.
Look, I know he's a complete tosser but...
But he's your mate.
I know.
Yeah, he's a good mate.
Not a good boyfriend, obviously, but as a mate...
Can we...
Can we just get on with the tour?
I realise he's your mate but can we just shut the door on yesterday, please, boss?
Get some shut-eye.
Tomorrow may well be momentous.
Lane?
Lane?
Lane?
Lane, you need to wake up.
- What's happened?
What is it?
- They've taken Kicki.
What do you mean?
They smashed their way into the Kenya Crisis Care base.
She's been taken hostage by terrorists as yet unknown.
We need to get down there and calm the situation.
- ASAP, please, Lane.
- Boss.
Right, guys, debus.
We're supporting the Kenyans with crowd control.
Calm the situation and get these people away from the med centre.
Lane.
Come.
How could anybody do this?
If you guys hadn't have come, maybe none of this would have happened.
Your presence with your guns has stirred their anger.
We're here to help.
Well, it hasn't helped.
Everything's ruined!
Look...
I don't know how things are ever gonna get better.
Or how to carry on any more.
Right, guys, in here now!
We'll bring in med re-supplies, get you back up and running.
House party carnage!
Learn when to keep quiet, Fingers.
Right, you and Monk go and get a truck.
Bring it down here.
Start loading this up and get this place cleared ASAP.
- Sir.
- Kingy.
Right, fellas, you know what to do.
Weapons and helmets down here, let's get this squared away!
Lane.
Captain James.
Intelligence suggests an Al-Shabaab-inspired group, but possibly a breakaway faction working on their own.
MoD up to speed on all events.
Our Special Forces are out looking already.
We've got to get this facility up and running today, boss.
People will die without this care.
You're in your own time now.
They've been onto the Swiss Embassy.
They're trying to contact her family.
But we're her family.
I'm her family.
You know, this was her life...
We were all that she knew, all that she cared about.
Without her...
She'll be looking at you to carry on, Nafula.
Every minute of every day, she was saving lives.
We're not just gonna let her life's work go to waste, Nafula.
Let's bring all the supplies in, yeah?
See as many patients as we can.
They took the computer.
Kicki and others were working on a database of patients.
How long have you been working here?
Not as long as Kicki, but this is my life too.
What's this?
Kicki's Dictaphone.
Maybe it's not broken.
Is that Kicki?
Thank you, Lane.
Boss.
She was dictating notes when they came in.
She had the gumption to leave it running.
Captain Osman will now pass this to Kenyan Intelligence.
Where is she?
What are they doing with her?
Undercover Kenyan Special Forces are embedded in Al-Shabaab.
They'll find out where she's being kept and we'll do all we can to bring her back alive.
You don't exactly sound massively optimistic!
Right.
On me.
They're trying to stop a flood with...
I dunno, a fishing net.
We're here to do a job, Lane.
Let's focus on the task in hand.
I don't even know what that means any more.
What can I do?
We need to do a quick assessment, divide them into urgent and non-urgent cases.
Urgent on the right and we'll try to see them today.
Life-threatening at the front.
We're doing all we can, Nafula.
Mother with babies here.
Go on.
Worse than Manchester Royal Infirmary on a Friday night.
All right, boys, look, your Amazon delivery's here.
Guys, how about helping with the fridge?
And the med kit needs to be taken into the triage ASAP.
You struggling?
Shut up, Monk.
We had one fridge all the way through my childhood.
You must have been poor, then, Dangles.
I always thought we were quite rich until I started going out with Glynis.
- You're joking!
- What's wrong with Glynis, man?
We've all seen Glynis...
Please keep calm.
What is that?
- Is that a Tic-Tac?
- Kicki's idea.
Not everyone, but some people just need a little pill.
My mother, for a start.
Really?
It seems to keep them quiet and makes them feel better.
Tic-Tac!
Good "tac-tics", eh, Lane?
Can you ask him how long he's had this?
- Two years.
- Two years.
Right, let's clean it up and dress it as best we can.
Have you got any antibiotics?
Just flip him over for me.
Going to flip you over, sir.
There you go.
Just hold that nice and tight for me, there.
Thank you.
Keep it down.
Thank you.
Thank you.
No.
Thank you, Georgie.
Got a kid with a mouthful of maggots, Medic.
Walking past this kid, I smiled at him, and when he smiled back all these maggots fell out.
Straight up, boss.
My dad was a fisherman. 24-carat maggots.
We're here to help.
Calm, calm.
Okay.
Come here.
Okay.
What's your name, darling?
- Jomo.
- Jomo.
- Jono?
- Jomo.
Okay, Jomo.
Bit of a pen and ink in the old north and south, eh, Georgie?
Okay.
I'm gonna look after your son, sir.
Lie back for me, darling.
There you go.
Yeah.
Open your mouth.
Your mouth.
Open your mouth for me.
Yeah, the tooth is very loose.
I'm gonna have to extract.
Will you get me some lignocaine gel, please?
You ever done an extraction before, Lane?
Uhm... only on myself, but I was seven years old.
I'll pull the tooth out, then we'll flush the infected area with saline, Okay?
Can I have the forceps, please?
- Need a hand, Lane?
- Yeah, Monk.
- There you go, darling.
- What do you want me to do?
Just hold his head, very gently, yeah?
There you go, darling.
That's good, thank you.
I'll try and get as many of the maggots out as we can.
Okay, keep your mouth wide for me.
Okay?
That's it.
You're gonna be all right.
Eating crisps in no time.
Shh, shh, shh.
There you go.
A few more, a few more, it's Okay.
That's it.
There you go.
Right, just keep him really still, Okay?
You're gonna feel a little tiny bit of pain and then you're gonna be fine.
Yeah?
It's gonna be over.
Yeah?
Okay.
Thank you.
Monk, just hold his head tight, yeah?
Reassure him.
- What?
- Reassure him.
Shh!
Reassure him.
Gauze in.
There you go.
Monk, you've stopped singing.
A maggot landed on my hand, you threw me out of my stride.
Did Kicki go home often?
Back to Switzerland?
No.
Why?
There's never a quiet moment in the camp.
How about you?
Do you manage to get back home?
Let's just say that when my grandfather passed away, we had an outbreak of malaria.
You didn't go back home?
I couldn't leave Kicki.
You need to sort your work-life balance out, young lady.
What does that mean?
Seriously, you need to find some time for you.
But there's work to be done.
Well, are you gonna get married, have your own family?
That's not for me to decide.
- Your parents?
- No, Allah.
Are you married?
Uhm... well, no, I'm engaged.
To a doctor.
He should come out here.
Is he a nice man?
Of course!
Wouldn't be marrying him if he wasn't pretty perfect.
He's perfect?
Yeah.
Yeah, he is, Nafula.
Perfect for me, anyway.
I think I might end up married to the Kenyan Crisis Care... like Kicki.
Yeah, but look at Kicki.
Sacrificed everything and...
Life is about sacrifice.
But it shouldn't be about regret, should it?
No.
- Kicki's watch.
- Mm?
This one.
She was very proud of that.
It was very special.
She said it kept absolute perfect time, although she always kept it five minutes fast.
I need to go and see Captain James.
Are you all right here on your own for a sec?
I'm hardly on my own.
I've half the Kenyan Army outside.
Jomo's father had that watch.
Or one like it.
No, I'm pretty sure it was that one, boss.
It's not in our remit to start investigating petty theft, Lane.
But it's not exactly petty theft, though, is it?
He must know something about her abduction.
Let's get Kenyan Intelligence to investigate.
- We can't abandon her, boss.
- We're not abandoning her.
But it feels like she's been abandoned to me.
Then you don't understand.
Our sources are looking at likely safe houses.
So, are we going to investigate?
Once we've ascertained for sure, we move in.
Your passion and your information are appreciated.
As I've already said, Lane, we're here to do a job on this camp.
And that job is so colossal we need to focus on that.
That job will be made a whole lot easier if we find Kicki.
Thank you, Lane.
There were these clowns in the cancer ward today.
Clowns?
Yeah, yeah, but we're not allowed to call them clowns.
Why not?
Well, cos so many people have clown phobias.
So what do you call them, then?
Er...chuckle monsters.
You taking the piss?
No!
All right, well, I think I might have a chuckle-monster phobia.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I think I might become a chuckle monster.
Why not?
If we're not careful, life's gonna slip through our hands
- without us realising.
- What?
What, do you feel like life is slipping though your hands?
Uhm...
Today I do, yeah.
Have you been putting your sunblock on?
Yeah... the sun's got to me!
Let's just get married.
As soon as I get back.
You serious?
Mm-hm.
You know, I don't want a huge thing.
I'm down for it.
How many babies are we gonna have?
I'll think about it and text you.
Okay.
- Lane, you decent?
- Gotta go.
- Lane?
- Yes, boss.
Come in, boss.
As you were, Lane.
I've got some very interesting intel.
Boss?
An eyewitness saw a Western woman taken into a dwelling.
- Kicki?
- It's looking hopeful, Lane.
And this individual has been seen frequenting the place.
Jomo's father.
O Group mission briefing 0600.
Mission briefing?
Need a combat medic.
Full battle.
Well done, Lane.
Thank you, boss.
Gents, sit up!
Relax, guys.
We're about to embark on an operation to help
Captain Osman and his men.
Kenyan Intelligence have got eyes on this dwelling.
It's an Al-Shabaab dwelling known to be frequented by Mr Sidiq, among others.
He is well known around camp and has many contacts there, that's why this morning's operation needs to be swift, the element of surprise on our side.
As the Kenyan Army always do the morning sweep around town, our presence will not be unexpected.
- Any questions?
- No, sir.
ETA two minutes.
Focus up, guys.
Prepare to move.
Two alphas.
Keep eyes on.
I repeat, keep eyes on.
Perimeter secure.
We're searching and clearing.
Charlie Fire team on me.
Delta, right-flank it.
Prepare to move...
Move!
Lane.
Two fatalities here and attend to this one.
Yes, boss!
Delta Fire team, push up.
Keep your hand pressed down firmly on your neck for me.
There you go, keep the pressure on.
Delta Fire team, push up.
Cut!
- Clear!
- Clear!
Charlie team!
Dangles, cover this door.
Mansfield, Monk, on me.
Eyes for hostage.
Check for captive.
One, two, three...
Monk, on me.
Move!
Move!
Move!
- Down, down!
- I'm on you!
Freeze!
- Stand up!
- Get him up!
Get up!
- Go onto the balcony!
- Balcony clear.
- Stand up slowly!
- Stand up now!
Stand up now!
Get up, get your hands on your head!
- Put your hands on your head.
- Turn around now!
Brains, turn him to me now.
Red cherry, positive ID.
Right, that's dressed, that should staunch the bleed.
Let's give you something for the pain.
Dwelling clear!
Lane, need you.
Jomo.
Jomo.
Jomo.
Hey, it's all right.
Remember me?
- Remember me, yeah?
- Had to search him in case he was booby-trapped, hence his distress.
It's all right.
Your father's all right, I've seen him.
He's alive, they're just taking him to the police station.
Does he speak English, Lane?
You understand me, don't you, Jomo?
It's all right.
Let's get you looked after, Okay?
Where's your mother?
Dead.
I'll be outside.
All right.
We'll take you back to the camp, with Nafula.
Do you remember Nafula?
They're looking for a lady from the camp.
Kicki.
Do you know Kicki?
Was Kicki here?
Is she still here now?
Where was she?
Boss!
Boss!
This is now a crime scene.
No one contaminate anything.
I'll leave the police here on guard.
Let's get the injured to hospital.
Kenya Crisis Care ambulance on the way, boss.
- ETA three minutes.
- Nice one, Kingy.
Right, guys, listen in.
Good work out there today.
If I had to single out a man of the match, it'd go to Lance Corporal Lane.
Thanks, boss.
You've always had a thing for the medic, boss.
- Strike one, Fingers.
- Sorry.
Her interventions led to the arrest of several
Al-Shabaab figures in there today.
This is exactly how it started with Molly.
Strike two, Fingers.
Right, guys, stay here.
Lane, on me.
I'll need to go with him, boss.
If he crashes and there's no one medical in the ambulance...
You do know he's Al-Shabaab, Lane?
I need to keep him stable, get him to the hospital alive.
We can't just let him die, boss, whoever he is.
Kingy, load up.
We're escorting the ambulance to hospital.
- Boss?
- Lane can't do this on her own.
Mansfield, up front in the ambulance.
Kingy, truck.
Eyes on the ambulance throughout.
You heard the boss.
Let's go!
Good luck, Lane.
Right, that's all done.
Shit.
Fuck!
- You all right back there?
- He's crashed on me.
Anything I can help with?
Fuck all, mate.
Let's just get him to the hospital ASAP.
Right, come on, put your foot down.
Slow down.
Slow down!
Watch out.
Move!
Get to the right.
Get to the right.
- What's he doing?
- No idea.
- What's going on?
- Is everybody Okay?
Captain Osman, find out what's going on.
What the hell's he doing?
Contact.
Yeah.
Take the doctor.
Has anyone got eyes on Lane?
I am a British citizen being held hostage and will be executed at sundown tomorrow if all Al-Shabaab fighters are not released.
You release our fighters...
or we cut off her head.
The situation has now escalated.
We're soon to be joined by Special Forces.
What's gonna happen to me now?
Pow!
Please, I'm a medical person.
I can help you and your brothers.
Please.
Please!

[woman] Perhaps we could begin with your earliest recollections of the events of last May.
Well, I first got involved on the 15th.

[beeps] [woman on TV] Chancellor Tom Pickering has defended the government's stance on disability benefits as outrage over the death of so-called "Wheelchair Martyr" Gwen Marbury grows.
More than 20,000 people have signed a petition demanding the sacking of newspaper columnist Jo Powers following her controversial article about Gwen Marbury.
Conservationists have announced another extinction.
The Siberian crane has died out following an unprecedented reduction in its wetland habitat.
And the honeybee-mimicking drone insects known as ADIs have been activated for their second summer.
[buzzing]
[man] Hope you're ashamed of yourself.
- Bitch.
- Pleasure's all mine.
[phone beeps]
[keys jangle] [van door opens]
Yo Powers?
Jo Powers.
Whatever's in there, will it detonate?
That's from bakery.
For you.

[man] Hello, darling!
[chuckles softly]
Creative, your well-wishers.
[man] Don't eat it.
It's a cake.
That's its job.
I'm going to have a bath.

[woman on TV] Grammy-award-winning rapper Tusk is still with us.
[cheering]
Now, Tusk, there are loads of online videos of people trying to emulate you, but this is our favourite.
Take a look at this.
[laughter and cheering]
It's a young chap called Aaron Sheen.
He's nine years old.
[laughs] That is one goofy-looking kid.
- [laughter]
- Not a good dancer.
He's nine years old!
Come on, he's a pretty good dancer.
That young motherfucker can't dance for shit.
He should probably just give up now, actually.
Don't hate on me for keeping it real.
That's a goofy little motherfucker, and he can't dance for shit.
[woman] He is a big fan, Tusk.
- [Tusk] Don't hate on your boy.
- [phone beeps] [woman] Everybody's got to start somewhere.
[Tusk] Start somewhere?
I looked better than that...
- DCI Parke?
- No press.
No, I'm not press.
Um...
TDC Blue Colson.
I'm your shadow.
My shadow?
They said...
Sorry.
Call me Karin.
- Did you say your name was...?
- Blue.
- B-l-u-e, Blue?
- Yeah.
It's not a nickname.
- My dad liked the sound of it.
- Uh-huh.
- Seen a body before?
- A couple.
- On video, I mean.
- [man] Boss?
- This is Blue.
She's my shadow.
- [helicopter whirrs]
- DS Nick Shelton.
- What've we got?
- Jo Powers.
- As in...
As in actual Jo Powers.
Saw something she wrote the other day about the wheelchair woman.
Clickbait piece.
Pissed people off.
That article was fucking horrendous.
Even I signed the petition.
To get her sacked.
Come on.
Neighbours heard her screaming and called it in.
[Karin] Hell of a struggle.
Anyone else at home?
Husband.
Found slashed across the stomach.
- By her?
- Don't know.
He was unconscious.
They've taken him to St. Columbus.
[Blue] Her mentions are still pouring in.
Restraining bolt's in place.
- No other points of entry?
- No.
But the outside's ringed with CCTV.
- We got the code for the cams?
- Uh-huh.
Okay, then.
Check the recordings.
Bag that, send it to Toxicology.
Full autop for her, and we question the husband as soon as he wakes up.
Come on.
- You think it's the husband?
- I'm keeping options open.
Cutting the throat, that's unusual.
Thanks, chaps.
- But you do think he did it?
- Don't know anything yet.
These things are almost always either drink, drugs or domestic.
It is how it is.
- You driving home?
- No licence.
Never passed.
I'm sort of waiting for driverless to go mainstream.
- Get in.
- No, honestly, I'll get the Tube.
- Get in.
- Oh.
Okay.
- So you were in Tech Crime?
- Digital Forensics.
Computer murk.
[Karin] What happened, you get bored of it?
Not exactly.
You've seen what people tuck away on these.
Schemes and kill lists, kiddy porn.
It's not boring.
I'm old enough to remember when they walked around with that stuff just tucked away in their heads.
[Blue] Right.
But now they can't help but entrusting it to their little companions.
These things absorb who we are.
They know everything about us.
[Karin] If it's interesting, why leave Forensics?
The Rannoch case.
- Ian Rannoch?
- The child killings, yeah.
I was the one who cracked his souvenir folder.
- So you saw those pictures?
- Mm-hmm.
And the videos too.
Saw them all.
You see something like that, it changes you.
You either get defeated or you think...
You think, "Fuck me!
I've got to help stop that shit."
Yeah.
- I mean, out here in the field...
- What fucking field?
You know what I mean.
Out here in the real world, you can genuinely prevent stuff, can't you?
You are young.
Maybe you're old?
- [Karin] Steady.
- [chuckles]
Thanks.
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes, boss.
[woman onTV] Jo Powers has been found dead at her home in West London.
The veteran columnist had been at the centre of controversy over an article she'd written about disability rights activist Gwen Marbury.
The police have yet to confirm the cause... [clicks]
[man] It's just the first floor, first door on the...
- Starting early?
- I asked Nick to show me the CCTV.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
No one came in or out.
Just Jo and her husband all evening.
- And that one there?
- Rear patio.
- Bust for months by the looks of it.
- Someone could've come in through there.
They'd have to climb the fence, make it in and out, knowing the camera wasn't working, but yeah, could have happened.
Technically.
Okay, sorry.
You're keen to help.
- She just asked!
- Uh-huh.
[sighs]
[sighs]
[Karin clears throat]
Um...
So...
I'm collating every threat or insult levelled at Jo Powers over the previous 48 hours.
Say it is the husband.
That's a coincidence, isn't it?
Not really.
You've got everyone throwing a shit fit.
Stress levels in that household would've been through the roof.
That Internet stuff drifts off like weather.
It's half hate.
They don't mean it.
The hate in a marriage, that's in 3D.
That's had work put into it.
That's sincere.
- Yeah.
I'm divorced.
- Um...
Husband's up and talking.
You're gonna love his alibi.
[siren wailing]
[phone rings]
I heard Jo screaming from upstairs.
And when I ran in, she was walking 'round the room, stumbling.
She was clutching...
She was clutching her head as if she was in pain.
And then for a moment, she stopped.
And then it was like a seizure, she was... thrashing... clawing at her own skin.
And she turned... [sobs]
She smashed her head...
onto the desk, hard.
Then she... she pushed me over.
That must've been when the bottle smashed.
Then she picked it up, and she started cutting herself.
Here.
She was gouging.
[sobs] I tried to stop her.
But she did this.
Then she cut her throat.
I tried to stop her.
She cut her own throat with the glass!
[man whimpers] [cries]
[Karin]Mutilated and then killed herself for no apparent reason?
I'd say the odds are against that.
He said it was like she was having a seizure.
Maybe there was something in the cake.
- The cake?
- It had "fucking bitch" iced on it.
- Could've been something in it.
- Like a drug?
- I don't know.
- That makes people kill themselves?
He was sort of convincing.
- He just doesn't seem the...
- Don't say "the type."
He's ordinary.
That is the type.
What, so he bounced her head off the desk?
- Blue.
- Held her steady enough...
- Blue.
- What?
- Toxicology are looking at the cake.
- Okay.
Meantime, let's drop in on the person that sent it.
Got the name this morning.
- You don't need to patronize me.
- We're doing what you want.
- Following another lead.
- That you think is a waste of time.
Picking along dead ends just to prove they're dead ends, that's most of the job.
I'm not saying it's a waste of time.
Just... you haven't had a chance to get bored of reality yet.
Okay, that was patronizing.
- Is this who sent the cake?
- [Karin] Uh-huh.
- Have we checked her social feeds?
- I don't know.
"Death to Jo Powers." She posted that on Monday morning.
The bakery said that they're not meant to do obscenities, so I said it was for my sister, like just a joke thing, and they agreed, so...
Not cheap, their cakes.
With delivery, it was what, 80 quid?
Um...
Well, I didn't pay for it all myself.
- We all put a pound in each.
- We?
Yeah.
I'm on a mums and carers message board.
I held a sort of whip-round.
- You crowd-sourced the money?
- Yeah, if you like.
From 80 other people?
Look, I'm not... [laughs]
I'm not being funny, okay?
I know she is dead.
But did you read what she had written?
How much do you think she got paid for spouting that horrible shit?
I don't know.
- I was just using my freedom of speech.
- To send a threatening message.
[scoffs] It was funny, okay?
And I can see if I'd done it myself, then that would be a bit weird, but I'm not mental.
You wished she was dead.
Well, uh... [stammers] No, no, I didn't.
[phone beeps]
- "Death to Jo Powers." - [laughs] That's just...
It's a... a hashtag game, you know, like "Death to..."
You insert the name of someone who's being an arsehole.
It's not... real.
It's a joke thing.
And who started it?
The hashtag?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I saw it somewhere.
[phone beeps]
Excuse us a moment.
Toxicology say the cake's clean.
They also said:
"Thanks, it was delicious."
We'll give her a caution.
Offensive Communications Act.
- Does that cover cakes?
- As far as she's concerned, it does.
What about the others who chipped in?
Are you going to tell them off, too?
- I didn't do anything.
- Start a thread about it.
Hospital's discharging the husband tomorrow.
We'll bring him in for questioning.
Blue?
We're arresting the husband.
Don't wallow in that.
The Internet will be pissed off with someone else today.
[Nick] Tusk.
Everyone's pissed off with Tusk 'cause of that thing with the kid.
He's catching a shit storm on social media.
- Liza will be organising the cake now.
- Yeah.
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.
- Whoo!
- * Turn a penny to a grand *
* When I'm ready, rocking steady for my fans *
Where my ladies at?
- Yo!
Good show.
- Yeah, that's a good show, brother.
- I'm feeling my shit.
- You want some of that?
- What you smoking?
- Good shit, boy.
A'ight.
Damn!
Eyes on, eyes on, eyes on.
Don't stress.
It's legal here.
Pfft!
Keep forgetting.
Welcome to Europe, I guess.
- Kinda takes the joy out of it.
- Tell me about it.
- [clatter]
- Careful!
You break it, you pay for it.
- Always doing some bullshit.
- [Tusk yelling]
- [screams]
- Tusk?
Tusk?
[screaming]
Yo, yo!
We need some help over here!
[screams hysterically]
- I got you.
- Get it out!
Get it out!
Get it out!
Call an ambulance!
[screaming]
[monitor beeping]
[typing]
- [whirring]
- Commencing.
[rattling]
[beeping]
- Did he say what it is?
- Nope.
[buzzer]
- Good morning.
- Morning.
[man] She's in here.
So I go in, and there's not just the wound from the glass.
There's a hole.
Dug in.
A bore hole, like a tiny tunnel.
So I follow it, you know, how deep does it go?
It goes all the way from her ear canal to deep in her brain.
Where I find this.
Nestled right in there.
Looks quite cosy.
- [Karin] It's one of those bee things.
- [Blue] An ADI.
An Autonomous Drone Insect from the Granular Project.
- How did it get in there?
- I'd say it burrowed in.
- Fuck me.
- [man] That's not the worst part.
It crawled right through her dorsal posterior insula, which is basically the brain's pain centre.
You're talking agony off the scale.
- You'd do anything to make it stop.
- Even cut your own throat.
- Good afternoon.
- DCI Parke.
- TDC Blue Colson.
- Okay.
Thank you.
[Karin] They're so fucking fancy-looking, these companies.
- Billions on branding.
- Well, they can afford it.
The whole ADI project's pretty much bankrolled by the government.
It's why so many people are paranoid about it.
Let me guess, this is some people on the Internet?
They reckon the government uses the bees to spy on us.
There's a schizophrenic world view.
[buzzing]
[buzzing]
Jesus, I didn't expect to find myself living in the future, but here I fucking well am.
- Karin Parke?
- Uh-huh.
Vanessa Dahl.
Please.
Follow me.
You're after information on our Project Swarm ADIs?
[Karin] That's right.
[Vanessa] Any particular reason?
Yes.
[buzzing]
Rasmus.
Rasmus Sjoberg.
- He heads Swarm.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Nice greenhouse.
- Yeah.
[buzzing]
[Karin] So, your bees, your ADIs, talk me through them.
Colony Collapse Disorder.
We still don't know what's behind it.
Bees themselves were virtually extinct so what our ADIs do is effectively stand in for them.
They're solar powered.
They don't need nectar.
but they pollinate flowers the same way.
They crawl inside, pollen sticks to their legs and gets brushed off the next flower they visit.
- Can they make honey?
- Uh...
No.
I was joking.
How do they know where the flowers even are?
I mean...
Well, they have a sensor.
Like a... camera?
No.
Just a basic visual sensor.
You see, they need rudimentary pattern recognition in order to locate compatible flora and navigate.
- They navigate?
- Yes.
You don't...
I don't know... steer them?
They're autonomous.
That's right, isn't it?
They make their own decisions.
They look after themselves.
Yes.
You see, the ADIs cover the whole of the UK.
We couldn't command each one individually ourselves.
It's just not logistically possible.
No. [coughs] We simply set the behaviour and leave them to it.
They even construct these hives themselves.
They reproduce...
- They reproduce?
- Yes.
Each hive is a replication point.
- [Blue] It's like a 3D printer, basically.
- [Rasmus] Exactly.
They create duplicates of themselves, create more hives and spread out exponentially.
- [Blue] Cover the country.
- Maybe you should work here.
Yeah, well, I read up on it.
It's impressive.
It is.
It's just a shame it's necessary.
The alternative would have been environmental catastrophe.
Bees were dying out.
So, what is it that brings you here?
We think one of your ADIs may be involved in an unexplained death.
Sorry?
A death?
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
Yeah.
It's one of ours.
But, look, these are not designed to...
Kill people?
I'd hope not.
Could it have malfunctioned somehow?
No.
I mean, when they do malfunction...
It happens, but then they just break, they just hit the ground.
What if someone hacked one and then they found a way of controlling it?
That's impossible.
You see, it's got military-grade encryption, and you would need a diagnostic controller, which is also encrypted.
So I would say the likelihood is...
I don't know what he's saying, but it's not the same as "impossible."
This is every hive we have online.
See...
These are the hives in the building here.
- How many bees per hive?
- Around 4,000.
- [Karin] It's like air traffic control.
- [Rasmus] Yeah.
Is that the search input?
- Yeah, but, uh... you'd need...
- Sorry.
[tapping on keyboard]
- Jo Powers' postcode.
- [beeping]
Is that who this is about?
- You said you get some malfunctions?
- A fair few, yes.
They smack into a car or something.
We even had people trap them.
You know, put them in the microwave for YouTube videos. [laughs]
And this logs any that drop off the system?
Logs everything, yes.
Did you lose any around here on Monday evening?
Well, I can check.
[beeping]
Just one.
Went out at 1903 hours.
Here, I can replay.
[beeping]
There.
- That's odd.
- [Blue] What's odd?
When they pass between hives, they switch from one jurisdiction to another.
- It's, you know, like a...
- It's like a phone between cell masts?
Exactly.
It tried to do that, but there was nothing to switch to.
Unless someone spoofed a hive and then they've used that to commandeer your ADI.
No, you would need a diagnostic controller to do that.
[Blue] What's the range on one of those?
[Rasmus] Ten, 20 metres, perhaps.
So whoever was controlling it would have to be no more than 20 metres away.
- Outside the house.
- Yeah.
Sitting in a car, even.
- Can you trace back who did this?
- Yes.
I-I'm already trying to do that.
Uh...
You know what?
Uh...
It would be easier without an audience.
Okay.
You two swap numbers, keep a line of communication.
Can you shut the whole thing down if need be... hypothetically speaking?
Even a short stoppage would damage the ecosystem, and we'd need approval from the Department of the Environment.
We'll need a list of any Granular staff that had access to that system, past or present.
[laughs] Some were government employees.
Use a different font for those if it helps.
Bye.
[buzzing]
[buzzing]
Nick, that's a set of Granular personnel records.
Root out anyone interesting.
Maybe not just one.
Could be a group involved.
Technically we should refer this up to the NCA, but there's no fucking way they're taking this off me.
The NCA already knows about it.
What?
DCI Karin Parke?
- Yes.
- Shaun Li, National Crime Agency.
[Karin] How come you're here?
There's been more than one.
This is Tusk, last night.
- Shit.
- They thought it was a fit.
Took him to the hospital.
He had to be anaesthetised to stop him mutilating himself.
X-ray seemed to indicate some kind of plaque or tumour in his brain
- so they popped him in the MRI.
- [groans]
Yeah.
Basically one big magnet.
Tore it right out of his head, through the eye socket.
[groans]
Battered the ADI too.
Yours is more intact so I'm gonna need it for analysis.
[Karin] It's evidence.
Two's a pattern.
It knocks any malfunction theory in the head.
- And they're similar victims.
- Similar?
Both in the middle of online shit storms.
Well, if you wanna kill someone, there's a million easier ways to do it.
Pull this off and you've done it from across the street.
No fingerprints, no DNA.
It's like wishing them dead.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Guys?
Come here.
Okay, so, um...
Jo Powers and Tusk, both were being kicked around the Internet for hours, but in both their cases, people were also tweeting their photos accompanied with this hashtag: #DeathTo.
- Like our friend the teacher.
- Right.
She didn't know where she'd first heard of it, but trace it back, and it looks like the first real use of the hashtag was last weekend.
- By who?
- [Blue] Uh...
Looks like, um...
Looks like identical tweets from a set of duplicate bot accounts.
Um...
Automated.
It's like spam.
This is someone trying to seed the tag, you know?
Get it out there.
It's like bait.
This is someone wanting people to pick up on it.
Check out the senders' avatar photos.
[Karin] Bees.
Shit.
Okay.
There's more.
So each tweet had a sort of instruction video attached to it.
- [Karin] Uh-huh.
- There.
"Game of Consequences"?
It's like an unpopularity contest.
Pick someone you don't like and if enough other people choose the same name, then that's who gets targeted.
Here, watch.
[man] Game of Consequences.
- One:
Pick a target.
- [Karin] Oh, my God.
Two:
Post their name and photo with #DeathTo.
No.
Three:
Most popular target will be eliminated after 5 p.m. each day.
Four:
Game resets at midnight.
- [Nick] Oh, no.
- [Karin] Fuck.
Someone's holding a public ballot, bumping off the top person.
- Jesus, it's just mad.
- Yeah, and it's growing.
Day one. 63 people used the hashtag on Jo Powers, okay?
On day two, 223 used it on Tusk.
- Who's using it now?
- There's...
There's loads more people.
There's quite a few votes for the Chancellor.
- Yeah.
- Um...
But at number one... is 880 people using it on someone called Clara Meades.
- Who's she?
- Clara Meades.
Okay, um...
it looks like she was at a demo, and she took a selfie in front of a war memorial.
- Pretending to piss on it.
- Nice work, Clara.
Yeah, it's getting near the end of the vote, and her mentions are blowing up.
- Tusk isn't public knowledge yet?
- Um, no.
So people can't know the hashtag works.
They're using it to scare her.
- Yeah, but they're gonna get her killed.
- We need to get to her before five.
Yeah.
Pulling her citizens details.
You're not supposed to have access to that.
Yeah, I know.
Just getting her location.
There.
[breathes heavily] [computer chirrups repeatedly]
[phone ringing]
[ringing stops, chirruping continues]
[sighs] [phone rings]
[woman] Hello?
[whimpers] [woman] Yeah, she is.
All right, all right, hold on.
Clara!
Police.
For you.
How did they get my number?
- Hello?
- Clara Meades?
This is DCI Karin Parke, Met Police.
Sorry to track you down like this, but we think you may be in danger.
Sorry, is this a joke?
Because all this stuff I'm getting is not funny.
I'm not joking.
Stay where you are until we get there.
And keep your windows closed.
I'm setting up a perimeter.
Call Rasmus, we need him across this.
[sighs]
- Rasmus?
- Hi, Blue.
I'm sending you a postcode and my GPS.
I need you to monitor the area.
Track my location and see if you get anything unusual, any rogue ADIs, yeah?
Yeah, great, good.
Look, if they come back,
I think I can catch them.
I have basically set a trap.
So if they...
if they try it again, we've got them.
- Are you Batman?
- They only just rolled them out.
This'll turn every red light between here and there to green.
Fuck me.
If this is the NCA life, I should apply for a transfer.
Let's go.
We can take her here.
It's a safe house for terrorist informers usually.
[helicopter whirring]
[sirens wailing]
[man over radio] No target sighted.
[man over loudspeaker] This is a police operation!
Everybody vacate their premises now.
Please leave... [gasps] [computer pings]
- [Vanessa] What's that?
- [Rasmus] Someone's trying to break in.
- Rasmus?
- I just picked up an attempted breach.
Granular, they've got a breach.
- [Rasmus] One ADI just went offline.
- Where?
- 800 metres from your location.
- That's outside our cordon.
If someone's trying to pilot it this way, they're gonna turn 'round the moment they see all these uniforms.
Clara Meades?
I'm Karin Parke.
Did you pack a bag?
- Yeah, it's by the door.
- Right, let's go.
- Rasmus got a track on them?
- Not yet.
[beeping]
It's just precautionary, and it's only for one night.
Just gotta call in.
Hi.
No, not yet.
Hopefully never.
Granular are onto it.
- Understood.
- [buzzing]
They housed a witness here for a while, Shaun said.
- Must've had kids.
- Have you got kids?
[both] No.
No plans.
[buzzing]
Up the stairs.
[phone rings]
- Rasmus.
- Still nothing.
I can't trace it.
[sighs]
[sighs] At least there's an en-suite.
- Is there nothing?
- [Rasmus] No.
Whoever it is, they've masked their path well.
[beeping]
But that's not...
- Fuck.
- [Blue] What?
- We just lost a whole hive.
- What does that mean?
Packed full of ADIs.
Lost them all too.
- No...
Rasmus?
- There's thousands of them.
- Where?
- It's close to your location. [static]
Rasmus, say that again.
Blue?
Blue.
It's close...
It's very close to you.
Text it.
Text it to me.
Rasmus.
Text it to... [static] Shit.
Do I get to redecorate?
[buzzing]
- [crackling on line]
- Hello.
Hello.
[distorted voice]
[beeping]
[Rasmus] No...
They've got the whole thing.
We're not in control anymore.
- They've got the whole thing.
- [Vanessa] What are you doing?
- Fix it!
Can't you fix it?
- Shut up!
[crackling on line] [buzzing]
[buzzing continuing]
- [screams] - [phone beeps]
[buzzing]
Shit.
[panting]
We need to go.
Now.
Now!
Come on!
[buzzing]
Go.
Go, go, go.
[Shaun screams] [loud buzzing] [gasps]
[Clara] What's... what's happening?
[buzzing]
- [rattling] - [Blue] Karin...
- [rattling] - [mutters]
[loud buzzing]
In there!
Go!
[gasps]
- Help me block the gap!
- [Clara]Tell me what's going on!
You're scaring the shit out of me!
[loud buzzing]
[door rattles]
[gasps] [buzzing and rattling continue]
- [rattling] - [screams]
Oh!
Fuck!
[buzzing]
- [buzzing] - [screams] [buzzing]
The fan!
The fan!
[screams] [screams] [screams]
Get it away from me!
[screams]
[screams hysterically] [gasps]
[buzzing]
[buzzing stops]
[panting]
[woman] Take your time.
I'd seen so many bodies before.
At crime scenes, in autopsies.
But I'd never seen anyone die.
And she was right there.
And can you describe the reaction of your colleague, Miss Colson?
Blue took it hard.
[Shaun] Uh-huh.
[man] I'll shut it down.
We thought this was one guy, some Mr. Mystery in the vicinity, hijacking one ADI and personally controlling it.
[Shaun] But there were thousands of them.
- So it can't be that, right?
- No.
- One person can't fly hundreds at once.
- No.
Whoever this is, they're controlling the whole system.
- Do you know where from?
- Could be anywhere.
You need to fucking sort this out!
[kicks table]
How do the ADIs know who to target?
Could've found Clara the same way you did, the identity database?
No.
That just gives you the basic area.
We were in the room too, and they only went for her.
Facial recognition.
It's got to be facial recognition.
Which means the feed from their visual sensors, that's been accessed too.
- [Shaun] That's not possible.
- [Blue] It's the only explanation.
Now look, the visual feed is secure between each ADI and the hive.
- There you go.
- Although... one of the government's conditions for backing the project...
Okay.
Enough.
We had to consent to permitting government security services access to the visual feed at times of quote, "increased national security."
Which is, as I understand it, pretty much all the time.
- I wasn't happy about it.
- Your lot went along with it.
That implies a greater range of options than your lot presented.
- So they are spying on us.
- This is all classified.
So what did you do, did you put in a back door and route it through GCHQ?
I mean, you do CCTV, you do traffic cams.
So what don't you have your fucking noses in?
Look, millions of those things flying around, propping up the ecosystem?
Well, that's great, save the planet, hallelujah!
Government's not going to pump billions into it just 'cause some lab coat says so, and it grabs 200 green votes.
They saw an opportunity to get more, they took it.
Total nationwide surveillance.
We tracked suspects for weeks in ways they couldn't dream of.
- We prevented bombings, mass shootings.
- By spying on the public.
And keeping them safe, which is what they want.
Clara Meades isn't safe, though, is she, Shaun?
Knowing what you knew, that might've helped us, but no, you kept your little fucking secret.
Okay!
The government's a cunt.
We knew that already.
Word's going to get out about Clara.
The public's going to wake up and find this mental assassination game going on, and soon we're going to have another body.
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.
We're totally locked out.
Totally blind.
If I can work out how they got in,
I might be able to reverse engineer some means of getting control back.
Do the ADIs have a command log, on-board cache?
- Yeah, but that's encrypted.
- I'll need the key to that.
[phone rings] [sighs]
Been through the employee files, found some pols.
Bring them in.
Are you sitting in on these?
Granular interviews?
I've got to be somewhere.
[radio beeping]
[woman on radio] It's 7:15.
Three deaths have now been linked to a hashtag circulating on social media.
Controversial journalist Jo Powers... [man on radio] Good morning.
Have you posted the hashtag?
Is it real or an urban myth?
Well, thousands have been taking part, but how culpable are they?
People are dying, and we want to hear your thoughts.
Line seven, Liana...
This is real, this is happening...
I am happy to see her die.
[woman] It's not the hashtag killing them.
That's just a game.
Like, if you're an arsehole, you deserve to be shamed.
[man on radio] Steve, line five.
[man] Yeah, but my point is, someone's gotta be top of the list, yeah?
So why not make it someone, you know, who deserves it, like a racist.
[woman] With the hashtag, I've seen celebrities, politicians, everyone.
This doesn't mean you have to sit there encouraging people to take part.
The point is this is already happening.
And people know that they can jump onboard because nobody will ever know if they did or didn't.
Well, let's just pause for a moment and go back to that top five.
As we have been saying, the Chancellor is at number one, and I want us to think about that.
What does that tell us about the choice of the nation?
[woman] Well, I can't say I'm surprised that he's number one on the list.
He's been pretty unpopular for quite a long time now.
[interviewer] But does that warrant his place on this list?
[woman] I'm saying people don't have to think too hard about it.
Now that's he's number one, that should generate more discussions and probably more votes.
Thanks for your time.
- No good?
- No good.
- Well, that's all fascinating...
- Shaun.
- But when do we shut it down?
- Tom.
Forgive me for being sceptical about your agency's basic competence.
- Tom.
- I'm on the fucking chopping block here.
Number one on the list.
The people's fucking choice!
Farrington's number four, and he's a paedophile.
- Suspected paedophile.
- He did it.
You know he did.
Let's just shut it down.
All social media.
The whole bloody Internet, pull the plug.
Just for today, at least until Thumbelina here pulls his finger out and he actually catches someone.
I wouldn't advise shutting things down.
- But it's possible?
We can do that?
- The whole of social media?
- Yeah.
Pull a North Korea on it.
- Well, yes, technically.
- Right, so push the off switch.
- [Shaun] That's not a good idea.
- No?
- Not in my opinion.
Right, okay.
It's just that speaking as a marked man, I beg to fucking differ.
If we shut it down, you'll still be number one.
Guaranteed to be, in fact.
He's right.
If we let it run on, at least there's a few hours.
Anything could happen before five o'clock.
The vote might change.
Yeah, and it might not.
What about that report?
The archive job?
From 1985, that memo about Farrington?
- That was over an unrelated matter.
- [Tom] Leak it.
Tom, that would be a smear.
A head-to-toe shit smear, I fucking hope so.
He's in his 80s.
He's had his life.
Fuck him under the bus.
If I could suggest an alternative?
We move you to a safe location.
- Have you secured before five.
- Worked out well for you last night.
I'll show you.
This next one's Tess Wallender.
She was a junior.
So not much in the way of technical skills.
- Quit Granular for personal reasons.
- Nervous exhaustion, yeah.
Worked in Human Resources for Granular until she quit.
She took a photo of a guy on the Tube, said he'd harassed her, lewd comments or something.
Turned out he had a learning disability so she caught a ton of shit on...
On social media.
- Hello.
I'm DCI Karin Parke.
- Hi.
It was like having a whole weather system turn against me.
Just hate message after hate message, around the clock, all piling on.
It's hard to describe what that does to your head.
Suddenly there's a million invisible people, all talking about how they despise you.
It's like a mental illness.
Fuck.
[Nick] What?
Shit.
I mean, hands up, I made a mistake, but the way people enjoyed kicking me, that's what got to me.
The casual fun they had and, um...
I just felt I couldn't go on.
Who found you?
Um...
Garrett, my flatmate.
He found me in the bath five minutes after I'd slashed them.
I mean, it's crazy.
I'm half-conscious.
He's dragging me out of the bath, and I'm telling him to get out, saying, "I'm naked."
He tied towels 'round my wrists, kept me conscious, kept stroking my hair till the ambulance arrived, talking to me.
Sort of weird.
I think he always had a thing for me.
And we worked at the same place so, you know... awkward.
- He worked at Granular?
- Yeah.
On the ADI thing.
- He was a real wunderkind.
Ultra-smart.
- What did you say his name was?
Garrett.
Garrett Scholes.
Garrett Scholes.
We need the whereabouts of a Garrett...
Scholes.
We were about to tell you.
It was buried in the on-board memory of the Jo Powers' ADI.
- What was?
- A manifesto.
A 98-page manifesto.
And check this out.
There's fucking selfies in it.
[buzzing] [man] So we're good to go?
[buzzing]
Okay, that's the charge in place.
Okay.
Pull back.
We're all set here.
Detonate.
[explosion]
So, the plan is, we move you to an underground bunker, knock out every hive within a ten-mile radius.
And, what, just leave me there?
How long for?
It's a temporary measure.
How long till you take out all the hives?
There's 20,000, 30,000 of them.
That would take two years.
Two years, a victim a day.
More to the point, the environmental impact would...
Fuck that.
[man] Shit!
- What?
- Fuck!
Stay back, stay back!
Get back!
[buzzing] [men screaming]
Go, go, go!
Get away!
[men screaming]
For fuck's sake, move!
[static, buzzing]
What's your Plan B?
[buzzing]
He was on the original employee roster, but we discounted him.
He left the country six months ago.
We thought we were looking for someone nearby.
Run a full trace on him.
Everything we can find.
Lunatic with production values, that's the worst kind.
"Thanks to the technological revolution, we have the power to rage and accuse, spout bile without consequence.
Only by being forced to recognize the power technology grants us, to acknowledge individual responsibility..."
Is it all like this?
He likens the population to insects, says we revel in cruelty, that it's a weakness that should be bred out of us.
Recurrent theme is he wants people to face the consequences of what they say and do.
- Wants to force that on them.
- The whole thing's a moral lesson?
He wanted us to find this and spread it about.
Well, fuck him.
Fuck.
Shit.
Karin.
Karin.
He's messed up.
He's put this document together himself, right?
His author name's in the metadata.
But he stripped out everything else, so we don't know when he's written it, for example.
Mm-hmm.
Most of the photos are clipart off the Internet, except this one.
- The selfie.
- That's where he's screwed up.
He's taken it with his phone, and the phone left a geotag on the image.
- So you know where he took this?
- I know precisely where.
He's here and Granular HQ is there.
[phone pings]
[crash]
- Armed police!
Stay down!
- Armed police!
[banging]
Armed police!
Stay where you are!
Armed police!
Show yourselves!
Move!
Left.
- Clear!
- Clear!
- Clear!
- [sighs]
[opens drawer] [closes drawer]
[Karin] Lifestyles of the rich and famous.
There.
The forge.
[gasps]
[Karin] Nice one.
Half the drives I sifted in forensics had scorch marks on 'em.
- [Blue] What do you think?
- Yeah.
Looks like his toolkit.
- You can use it?
- Pretty much the key to the door.
So you can get control back?
Send the deactivation?
[Rasmus] Well, I've got his source code.
- I should be able to bounce him out.
- Be quick.
[Karin] Key to the door?
Our guy doesn't seem the type to leave keys lying around.
Well, I'm in.
Okay.
Deactivate her.
- Yeah, I need to repair permissions.
- Fucking hell.
That's weird.
What's weird?
- [Shaun] Time's ticking.
- That file.
Wasn't there before.
- This file?
- Yeah.
[computer beeps]
What is it?
- Blue?
- I think they're IMEI numbers.
What does that mean?
Every phone, every device has a unique number, an IMEI number.
It tethers it to a unique user.
- Yeah.
- But I can check, just... reverse lookup.
[Rasmus] Take it easy.
[Karin] Who are these people?
[Blue] I don't know.
There's 387,000 of them.
Are these IDs your spooks have been collecting?
- No!
Are you ready yet?
- Yeah, almost there.
Wait.
Wait.
What was the name of that teacher?
Hate cake.
- Liza.
Liza Bahar.
- Liza Bahar.
[Shaun] Fuck's sake.
This is a list of everyone who's used the hashtag.
What?
Everyone who took part in the Game of Consequences.
They've hoovered up their ID from GCHQ by the looks of it.
That backdoor worked both ways, it seems.
- See if I'm on there.
- What?
I posted the tag earlier with Scholes' face.
- Just trying to get a reaction from him.
- Yeah, yeah, almost there.
[Blue] Yeah, you're there.
[Rasmus] Almost there.
Why has he collected everyone who took part?
I mean...
[Rasmus] Okay.
I'm ready.
- Shit.
- Run it now.
No.
Think.
He left us a trail.
- Oh, come on.
- That photo with the whereabouts, it's too big a mistake for him.
He knew we'd do this.
- Now we're shutting it down, all right?
- And maybe that'll trigger some endgame, something to do with that list.
What if those are his real targets?
The people on the list.
Everyone who took part.
Consequences.
The hate figures were the bait.
The players are the target.
- Run the deact command.
- [Rasmus] Now just wait a minute, okay?
- Run it.
- [Karin] No!
[beeping] [gasps]
[beeping]
[Rasmus] Yeah. [laughs]
Yeah, it worked.
[Shaun sighs]
Sorry, but that needed doing. [laughs]
[beeping]
- No, no, no, no, no.
- [Karin] What?
No.
No.
- [Rasmus] Fuck!
- [Karin] No.
[Karin] Shit.
Oh, no.

[woman] We're all tragically familiar with the rest of the events of that week.
And we need no reminding of the sheer scale of the loss of life that followed.
No.
No, we don't.
[woman] And what became of Ms. Colson?
I think she blamed herself.
No.
I know she did.
She felt she'd followed his breadcrumb trail and sprung the whole thing.
She left the force.
I didn't hear from her.
Rang her, tried emailing, but no response.
Then, um...
About four months later, they found her things.
On a beach.
With a note.
[breathes deeply]
She killed herself?
That's the base theory, yes.
Ms Parke, I would like to commend you for sharing your testimony and your time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[chattering]
[crowd shouting] [camera shutters clicking]
[shouting] [shouting and banging]
Señor.
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

[glass cracks]
[man] They're ready now.
[woman] Perhaps we could begin with your earliest recollections of the events of last May.
Well, I first got involved on the 15th.
[woman] Could you move the microphone a little closer?
[feedback whines]
Here?
I first got involved on the 15th.

[beeps] [woman on TV] Chancellor Tom Pickering has defended the government's stance on disability benefits as outrage over the death of so-called "Wheelchair Martyr" Gwen Marbury grows.
More than 20,000 people have signed a petition demanding the sacking of newspaper columnist Jo Powers following her controversial article about Gwen Marbury.
Conservationists have announced another extinction.
The Siberian crane has died out following an unprecedented reduction in its wetland habitat.
And the honeybee-mimicking drone insects known as ADls have been activated for their second summer.
[buzzing]
[man] Hope you're ashamed of yourself.
- Bitch.
- Pleasure's all mine.
[phone beeps]
[keys jangle] [van door opens]
Yo Powers?
Jo Powers.
Whatever's in there, will it detonate?
That's from bakery.
For you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
[door opens]
[man] Hello, darling!
[chuckles softly]
Creative, your well-wishers.
[man] Don't eat it.
It's a cake.
That's its job.
I'm going to have a bath.

[woman on TV] Grammy-award-winning rapper Tusk is still with us.
[cheering]
Now, Tusk, there are loads of online videos of people trying to emulate you, but this is our favourite.
Take a look at this.
[laughter and cheering]
It's a young chap called Aaron Sheen.
He's nine years old.
[laughs] That is one goofy-looking kid.
- [laughter]
- Not a good dancer.
He's nine years old!
Come on, he's a pretty good dancer.
That young motherfucker can't dance for shit.
He should probably just give up now, actually.
Don't hate on me for keeping it real.
That's a goofy little motherfucker, and he can't dance for shit.
[woman] He is a big fan, Tusk.
- [Tusk] Don't hate on your boy.
- [phone beeps] [woman] Everybody's got to start somewhere.
[Tusk] Start somewhere?
I looked better than that...
- DCI Parke?
- No press.
No, I'm not press.
Um...
TDC Blue Colson.
I'm your shadow.
My shadow?
They said...
Sorry.
Call me Karin.
- Did you say your name was...?
- Blue.
- B-l-u-e, Blue?
- Yeah.
It's not a nickname.
- My dad liked the sound of it.
- Uh-huh.
- Seen a body before?
- A couple.
- On video, I mean.
- [man] Boss?
- This is Blue.
She's my shadow.
- [helicopter whirrs]
- DS Nick Shelton.
- What've we got?
- Jo Powers.
- As in...
As in actual Jo Powers.
Saw something she wrote the other day about the wheelchair woman.
Clickbait piece.
Pissed people off.
That article was fucking horrendous.
Even I signed the petition.
To get her sacked.
Come on.
Neighbours heard her screaming and called it in.
[Karin] Hell of a struggle.
Anyone else at home?
Husband.
Found slashed across the stomach.
- By her?
- Don't know.
He was unconscious.
They've taken him to St. Columbus.
[Blue] Her mentions are still pouring in.
Restraining bolt's in place.
- No other points of entry?
- No.
But the outside's ringed with CCTV.
- We got the code for the cams?
- Uh-huh.
Okay, then.
Check the recordings.
Bag that, send it to Toxicology.
Full autop for her, and we question the husband as soon as he wakes up.
Come on.
- You think it's the husband?
- I'm keeping options open.
Cutting the throat, that's unusual.
Thanks, chaps.
- But you do think he did it?
- Don't know anything yet.
These things are almost always either drink, drugs or domestic.
It is how it is.
- You driving home?
- No license.
Never passed.
I'm sort of waiting for driverless to go mainstream.
- Get in.
- No, honestly, I'll get the Tube.
- Get in.
- Oh.
Okay.
- So you were in Tech Crime?
- Digital Forensics.
Computer murk.
[Karin] What happened, you get bored of it?
Not exactly.
You've seen what people tuck away on these.
Schemes and kill lists, kiddy porn.
It's not boring.
I'm old enough to remember when they walked around with that stuff just tucked away in their heads.
[Blue] Right.
But now they can't help but entrusting it to their little companions.
These things absorb who we are.
They know everything about us.
[Karin] If it's interesting, why leave Forensics?
The Rannoch case.
- Ian Rannoch?
- The child killings, yeah.
I was the one who cracked his souvenir folder.
- So you saw those pictures?
- Mm-hmm.
And the videos too.
Saw them all.
You see something like that, it changes you.
You either get defeated or you think...
You think, "Fuck me!
I've got to help stop that shit."
Yeah.
- I mean, out here in the field...
- What fucking field?
You know what I mean.
Out here in the real world, you can genuinely prevent stuff, can't you?
You are young.
Maybe you're old?
- [Karin] Steady.
- [chuckles]
Thanks.
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes, boss.
[woman onTV] Jo Powers has been found dead at her home in West London.
The veteran columnist had been at the centre of controversy over an article she'd written about disability rights activist Gwen Marbury.
The police have yet to confirm the cause... [clicks]
[man] It's just the first floor, first door on the...
- Starting early?
- I asked Nick to show me the CCTV.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
No one came in or out.
Just Jo and her husband all evening.
- And that one there?
- Rear patio.
- Bust for months by the looks of it.
- Someone could've come in through there.
They'd have to climb the fence, make it in and out, knowing the camera wasn't working, but yeah, could have happened.
Technically.
Okay, sorry.
You're keen to help.
- She just asked!
- Uh-huh.
[sighs]
[sighs]
[Karin clears throat]
Um...
So...
I'm collating every threat or insult levelled at Jo Powers over the previous 48 hours.
Say it is the husband.
That's a coincidence, isn't it?
Not really.
You've got everyone throwing a shit fit.
Stress levels in that household would've been through the roof.
That Internet stuff drifts off like weather.
It's half hate.
They don't mean it.
The hate in a marriage, that's in 3D.
That's had work put into it.
That's sincere.
- Yeah.
I'm divorced.
- Um...
Husband's up and talking.
You're gonna love his alibi.
[siren wailing]
[phone rings]
I heard Jo screaming from upstairs.
And when I ran in, she was walking 'round the room, stumbling.
She was clutching...
She was clutching her head as if she was in pain.
And then for a moment, she stopped.
And then it was like a seizure, she was... thrashing... clawing at her own skin.
And she turned... [sobs]
She smashed her head...
onto the desk, hard.
Then she... she pushed me over.
That must've been when the bottle smashed.
Then she picked it up, and she started cutting herself.
Here.
She was gouging.
[sobs] I tried to stop her.
But she did this.
Then she cut her throat.
I tried to stop her.
She cut her own throat with the glass!
[man whimpers] [cries]
[Karin]Mutilated and then killed herself for no apparent reason?
I'd say the odds are against that.
He said it was like she was having a seizure.
Maybe there was something in the cake.
- The cake?
- It had "fucking bitch" iced on it.
- Could've been something in it.
- Like a drug?
- I don't know.
- That makes people kill themselves?
He was sort of convincing.
- He just doesn't seem the...
- Don't say "the type."
He's ordinary.
That is the type.
What, so he bounced her head off the desk?
- Blue.
- Held her steady enough...
- Blue.
- What?
- Toxicology are looking at the cake.
- Okay.
Meantime, let's drop in on the person that sent it.
Got the name this morning.
- You don't need to patronize me.
- We're doing what you want.
- Following another lead.
- That you think is a waste of time.
Picking along dead ends just to prove they're dead ends, that's most of the job.
I'm not saying it's a waste of time.
Just... you haven't had a chance to get bored of reality yet.
Okay, that was patronizing.
- Is this who sent the cake?
- [Karin] Uh-huh.
- Have we checked her social feeds?
- I don't know.
"Death to Jo Powers." She posted that on Monday morning.
The bakery said that they're not meant to do obscenities, so I said it was for my sister, like just a joke thing, and they agreed, so...
Not cheap, their cakes.
With delivery, it was what, 80 quid?
Um...
Well, I didn't pay for it all myself.
- We all put a pound in each.
- We?
Yeah.
I'm on a mums and carers message board.
I held a sort of whip-round.
- You crowd-sourced the money?
- Yeah, if you like.
From 80 other people?
Look, I'm not... [laughs]
I'm not being funny, okay?
I know she is dead.
But did you read what she had written?
How much do you think she got paid for spouting that horrible shit?
I don't know.
- I was just using my freedom of speech.
- To send a threatening message.
[scoffs] It was funny, okay?
And I can see if I'd done it myself, then that would be a bit weird, but I'm not mental.
You wished she was dead.
Well, uh... [stammers] No, no, I didn't.
[phone beeps]
- "Death to Jo Powers." - [laughs] That's just...
It's a... a hashtag game, you know, like "Death to..."
You insert the name of someone who's being an arsehole.
It's not... real.
It's a joke thing.
And who started it?
The hashtag?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I saw it somewhere.
[phone beeps]
Excuse us a moment.
Toxicology say the cake's clean.
They also said:
"Thanks, it was delicious."
We'll give her a caution.
Offensive Communications Act.
- Does that cover cakes?
- As far as she's concerned, it does.
What about the others who chipped in?
Are you going to tell them off, too?
- I didn't do anything.
- Start a thread about it.
Hospital's discharging the husband tomorrow.
We'll bring him in for questioning.
Blue?
We're arresting the husband.
Don't wallow in that.
The Internet will be pissed off with someone else today.
[Nick] Tusk.
Everyone's pissed off with Tusk 'cause of that thing with the kid.
He's catching a shit storm on social media.
- Liza will be organising the cake now.
- Yeah.
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.
- Whoo!
- ♪ Turn a penny to a grand ♪
♪ When I'm ready, rocking steady for my fans ♪
Where my ladies at?
- Yo!
Good show.
- Yeah, that's a good show, brother.
- I'm feeling my shit.
- You want some of that?
- What you smoking?
- Good shit, boy.
A'ight.
Damn!
Eyes on, eyes on, eyes on.
Don't stress.
It's legal here.
Pfft!
Keep forgetting.
Welcome to Europe, I guess.
- Kinda takes the joy out of it.
- Tell me about it.
- [clatter]
- Careful!
You break it, you pay for it.
- Always doing some bullshit.
- [Tusk yelling]
- [screams]
- Tusk?
Tusk?
[screaming]
Yo, yo!
We need some help over here!
[screams hysterically]
- I got you.
- Get it out!
Get it out!
Get it out!
Call an ambulance!
[screaming]
[monitor beeping]
[typing]
- [whirring]
- Commencing.
[rattling]
[beeping]
- Did he say what it is?
- Nope.
[buzzer]
- Good morning.
- Morning.
[man] She's in here.
So I go in, and there's not just the wound from the glass.
There's a hole.
Dug in.
A bore hole, like a tiny tunnel.
So I follow it, you know, how deep does it go?
It goes all the way from her ear canal to deep in her brain.
Where I find this.
Nestled right in there.
Looks quite cosy.
- [Karin] It's one of those bee things.
- [Blue] An ADI.
An Autonomous Drone Insect from the Granular Project.
- How did it get in there?
- I'd say it burrowed in.
- Fuck me.
- [man] That's not the worst part.
It crawled right through her dorsal posterior insula, which is basically the brain's pain centre.
You're talking agony off the scale.
- You'd do anything to make it stop.
- Even cut your own throat.
- Good afternoon.
- DCI Parke.
- TDC Blue Colson.
- Okay.
Thank you.
[Karin] They're so fucking fancy-looking, these companies.
- Billions on branding.
- Well, they can afford it.
The whole ADI project's pretty much bankrolled by the government.
It's why so many people are paranoid about it.
Let me guess, this is some people on the Internet?
They reckon the government uses the bees to spy on us.
There's a schizophrenic world view.
[buzzing]
[buzzing]
Jesus, I didn't expect to find myself living in the future, but here I fucking well am.
- Karin Parke?
- Uh-huh.
Vanessa Dahl.
Please.
Follow me.
You're after information on our Project Swarm ADls?
[Karin] That's right.
[Vanessa] Any particular reason?
Yes.
[buzzing]
Rasmus.
Rasmus Sjoberg.
- He heads Swarm.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Nice greenhouse.
- Yeah.
[buzzing]
[Karin] So, your bees, your ADis, talk me through them.
Colony Collapse Disorder.
We still don't know what's behind it.
Bees themselves were virtually extinct so what our ADis do is effectively stand in for them.
They're solar powered.
They don't need nectar.
But they pollinate flowers the same way.
They crawl inside, pollen sticks to their legs and gets brushed off the next flower they visit.
- Can they make honey?
- Uh...
No.
I was joking.
How do they know where the flowers even are?
I mean...
Well, they have a sensor.
Like a... camera?
No.
Just a basic visual sensor.
You see, they need rudimentary pattern recognition in order to locate compatible flora and navigate.
- They navigate?
- Yes.
You don't...
I don't know... steer them?
They're autonomous.
That's right, isn't it?
They make their own decisions.
They look after themselves.
Yes.
You see, the ADis cover the whole of the UK.
We couldn't command each one individually ourselves.
It's just not logistically possible.
No. [coughs] We simply set the behaviour and leave them to it.
They even construct these hives themselves.
They reproduce...
- They reproduce?
- Yes.
Each hive is a replication point.
- [Blue] It's like a 3D printer, basically.
- [Rasmus] Exactly.
They create duplicates of themselves, create more hives and spread out exponentially.
- [Blue] Cover the country.
- Maybe you should work here.
Yeah, well, I read up on it.
It's impressive.
It is.
It's just a shame it's necessary.
The alternative would have been environmental catastrophe.
Bees were dying out.
So, what is it that brings you here?
We think one of your ADis may be involved in an unexplained death.
Sorry?
A death?
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
Yeah.
It's one of ours.
But, look, these are not designed to...
Kill people?
I'd hope not.
Could it have malfunctioned somehow?
No.
I mean, when they do malfunction...
It happens, but then they just break, they just hit the ground.
What if someone hacked one and then they found a way of controlling it?
That's impossible.
You see, it's got military-grade encryption, and you would need a diagnostic controller, which is also encrypted.
So I would say the likelihood is...
I don't know what he's saying, but it's not the same as "impossible."
This is every hive we have online.
See...
These are the hives in the building here.
- How many bees per hive?
- Around 4,000.
- [Karin] It's like air traffic control.
- [Rasmus] Yeah.
Is that the search input?
- Yeah, but, uh... you'd need...
- Sorry.
[tapping on keyboard]
- Jo Powers' postcode.
- [beeping]
Is that who this is about?
- You said you get some malfunctions?
- A fair few, yes.
They smack into a car or something.
We even had people trap them.
You know, put them in the microwave for YouTube videos. [laughs]
And this logs any that drop off the system?
Logs everything, yes.
Did you lose any around here on Monday evening?
Well, I can check.
[beeping]
Just one.
Went out at 1903 hours.
Here, I can replay.
[beeping]
There.
- That's odd.
- [Blue] What's odd?
When they pass between hives, they switch from one jurisdiction to another.
- It's, you know, like a...
- It's like a phone between cell masts?
Exactly.
It tried to do that, but there was nothing to switch to.
Unless someone spoofed a hive and then they've used that to commandeer your ADI.
No, you would need a diagnostic controller to do that.
[Blue] What's the range on one of those?
[Rasmus] Ten, 20 metres, perhaps.
So whoever was controlling it would have to be no more than 20 metres away.
- Outside the house.
- Yeah.
Sitting in a car, even.
- Can you trace back who did this?
- Yes.
I-I'm already trying to do that.
Uh...
You know what?
Uh...
It would be easier without an audience.
Okay.
You two swap numbers, keep a line of communication.
Can you shut the whole thing down if need be... hypothetically speaking?
Even a short stoppage would damage the ecosystem, and we'd need approval from the Department of the Environment.
We'll need a list of any Granular staff that had access to that system, past or present.
[laughs] Some were government employees.
Use a different font for those if it helps.
Bye.
[buzzing]
[buzzing]
Nick, that's a set of Granular personnel records.
Root out anyone interesting.
Maybe not just one.
Could be a group involved.
Technically we should refer this up to the NCA, but there's no fucking way they're taking this off me.
The NCA already knows about it.
What?
DCI Karin Parke?
- Yes.
- Shaun Li, National Crime Agency.
[Karin] How come you're here?
There's been more than one.
This is Tusk, last night.
- Shit.
- They thought it was a fit.
Took him to the hospital.
He had to be anaesthetised to stop him mutilating himself.
X-ray seemed to indicate some kind of plaque or tumour in his brain
- so they popped him in the MRI.
- [groans]
Yeah.
Basically one big magnet.
Tore it right out of his head, through the eye socket.
[groans]
Battered the ADI too.
Yours is more intact so I'm gonna need it for analysis.
[Karin] It's evidence.
Two's a pattern.
It knocks any malfunction theory in the head.
- And they're similar victims.
- Similar?
Both in the middle of online shit storms.
Well, if you wanna kill someone, there's a million easier ways to do it.
Pull this off and you've done it from across the street.
No fingerprints, no DNA.
It's like wishing them dead.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Guys?
Come here.
Okay, so, um...
Jo Powers and Tusk, both were being kicked around the Internet for hours, but in both their cases, people were also tweeting their photos accompanied with this hashtag: #DeathTo.
- Like our friend the teacher.
- Right.
She didn't know where she'd first heard of it, but trace it back, and it looks like the first real use of the hashtag was last weekend.
- By who?
- [Blue] Uh...
Looks like, um...
Looks like identical tweets from a set of duplicate bot accounts.
Um...
Automated.
It's like spam.
This is someone trying to seed the tag, you know?
Get it out there.
It's like bait.
This is someone wanting people to pick up on it.
Check out the senders' avatar photos.
[Karin] Bees.
Shit.
Okay.
There's more.
So each tweet had a sort of instruction video attached to it.
- [Karin] Uh-huh.
- There.
"Game of Consequences"?
It's like an unpopularity contest.
Pick someone you don't like and if enough other people choose the same name, then that's who gets targeted.
Here, watch.
[man] Game of Consequences.
- One:
Pick a target.
- [Karin] Oh, my God.
Two:
Post their name and photo with #DeathTo.
No.
Three:
Most popular target will be eliminated after 5 p.m. each day.
Four:
Game resets at midnight.
- [Nick] Oh, no.
- [Karin] Fuck.
Someone's holding a public ballot, bumping off the top person.
- Jesus, it's just mad.
- Yeah, and it's growing.
Day one. 63 people used the hashtag on Jo Powers, okay?
On day two, 223 used it on Tusk.
- Who's using it now?
- There's...
There's loads more people.
There's quite a few votes for the Chancellor.
- Yeah.
- Um...
But at number one... is 880 people using it on someone called Clara Meades.
- Who's she?
- Clara Meades.
Okay, um...
it looks like she was at a demo, and she took a selfie in front of a war memorial.
- Pretending to piss on it.
- Nice work, Clara.
Yeah, it's getting near the end of the vote, and her mentions are blowing up.
- Tusk isn't public knowledge yet?
- Um, no.
So people can't know the hashtag works.
They're using it to scare her.
- Yeah, but they're gonna get her killed.
- We need to get to her before five.
Yeah.
Pulling her citizens details.
You're not supposed to have access to that.
Yeah, I know.
Just getting her location.
There.
[breathes heavily] [computer chirrups repeatedly]
[phone ringing]
[ringing stops, chirruping continues]
[sighs] [phone rings]
[woman] Hello?
[whimpers] [woman] Yeah, she is.
All right, all right, hold on.
Clara!
Police.
For you.
How did they get my number?
- Hello?
- Clara Meades?
This is DCI Karin Parke, Met Police.
Sorry to track you down like this, but we think you may be in danger.
Sorry, is this a joke?
Because all this stuff I'm getting is not funny.
I'm not joking.
Stay where you are until we get there.
And keep your windows closed.
I'm setting up a perimeter.
Call Rasmus, we need him across this.
[sighs]
- Rasmus?
- Hi, Blue.
I'm sending you a postcode and my GPS.
I need you to monitor the area.
Track my location and see if you get anything unusual, any rogue ADis, yeah?
Yeah, great, good.
Look, if they come back,
I think I can catch them.
I have basically set a trap.
So if they...
if they try it again, we've got them.
- Are you Batman?
- They only just rolled them out.
This'll turn every red light between here and there to green.
Fuck me.
If this is the NCA life, I should apply for a transfer.
Let's go.
We can take her here.
It's a safe house for terrorist informers usually.
[helicopter whirring]
[sirens wailing]
[man over radio] No target sighted.
[man over loudspeaker] This is a police operation!
Everybody vacate their premises now.
Please leave... [gasps] [computer pings]
- [Vanessa] What's that?
- [Rasmus] Someone's trying to break in.
- Rasmus?
- I just picked up an attempted breach.
Granular, they've got a breach.
- [Rasmus] One ADI just went offline.
- Where?
- 800 metres from your location.
- That's outside our cordon.
If someone's trying to pilot it this way, they're gonna turn 'round the moment they see all these uniforms.
Clara Meades?
I'm Karin Parke.
Did you pack a bag?
- Yeah, it's by the door.
- Right, let's go.
- Rasmus got a track on them?
- Not yet.
[beeping]
It's just precautionary, and it's only for one night.
Just gotta call in.
Hi.
No, not yet.
Hopefully never.
Granular are onto it.
- Understood.
- [buzzing]
They housed a witness here for a while, Shaun said.
- Must've had kids.
- Have you got kids?
[both] No.
No plans.
[buzzing]
Up the stairs.
[phone rings]
- Rasmus.
- Still nothing.
I can't trace it.
[sighs]
[sighs] At least there's an en-suite.
- Is there nothing?
- [Rasmus] No.
Whoever it is, they've masked their path well.
[beeping]
But that's not...
- Fuck.
- [Blue] What?
- We just lost a whole hive.
- What does that mean?
Packed full of ADls.
Lost them all too.
- No...
Rasmus?
- There's thousands of them.
- Where?
- It's close to your location. [static]
Rasmus, say that again.
Blue?
Blue.
It's close...
It's very close to you.
Text it.
Text it to me.
Rasmus.
Text it to... [static] Shit.
Do I get to redecorate?
[buzzing]
- [crackling on line]
- Hello.
Hello.
[distorted voice]
[beeping]
[Rasmus] No...
They've got the whole thing.
We're not in control anymore.
- They've got the whole thing.
- [Vanessa] What are you doing?
- Fix it!
Can't you fix it?
- Shut up!
[crackling on line] [buzzing]
[buzzing continuing]
- [screams] - [phone beeps]
[buzzing]
Shit.
[panting]
We need to go.
Now.
Now!
Come on!
[buzzing]
Go.
Go, go, go.
[Shaun screams] [loud buzzing] [gasps]
[Clara] What's... what's happening?
[buzzing]
- [rattling] - [Blue] Karin...
- [rattling] - [mutters]
[loud buzzing]
In there!
Go!
[gasps]
- Help me block the gap!
- [Clara]Tell me what's going on!
You're scaring the shit out of me!
[loud buzzing]
[door rattles]
[gasps] [buzzing and rattling continue]
- [rattling] - [screams]
Oh!
Fuck!
[buzzing]
- [buzzing] - [screams] [buzzing]
The fan!
The fan!
[screams] [screams] [screams]
Get it away from me!
[screams]
[screams hysterically] [gasps]
[buzzing]
[buzzing stops]
[panting]
[woman] Take your time.
I'd seen so many bodies before.
At crime scenes, in autopsies.
But I'd never seen anyone die.
And she was right there.
And can you describe the reaction of your colleague, Miss Colson?
Blue took it hard.
[Shaun] Uh-huh.
[man] I'll shut it down.
We thought this was one guy, some Mr. Mystery in the vicinity, hijacking one ADI and personally controlling it.
[Shaun] But there were thousands of them.
- So it can't be that, right?
- No.
- One person can't fly hundreds at once.
- No.
Whoever this is, they're controlling the whole system.
- Do you know where from?
- Could be anywhere.
You need to fucking sort this out!
[kicks table]
How do the ADis know who to target?
Could've found Clara the same way you did, the identity database?
No.
That just gives you the basic area.
We were in the room too, and they only went for her.
Facial recognition.
It's got to be facial recognition.
Which means the feed from their visual sensors, that's been accessed too.
- [Shaun] That's not possible.
- [Blue] It's the only explanation.
Now look, the visual feed is secure between each ADI and the hive.
- There you go.
- Although... one of the government's conditions for backing the project...
Okay.
Enough.
We had to consent to permitting government security services access to the visual feed at times of quote, "increased national security."
Which is, as I understand it, pretty much all the time.
- I wasn't happy about it.
- Your lot went along with it.
That implies a greater range of options than your lot presented.
- So they are spying on us.
- This is all classified.
So what did you do, did you put in a back door and route it through GCHQ?
I mean, you do CCTV, you do traffic cams.
So what don't you have your fucking noses in?
Look, millions of those things flying around, propping up the ecosystem?
Well, that's great, save the planet, hallelujah!
Government's not going to pump billions into it just 'cause some lab coat says so, and it grabs 200 green votes.
They saw an opportunity to get more, they took it.
Total nationwide surveillance.
We tracked suspects for weeks in ways they couldn't dream of.
- We prevented bombings, mass shootings.
- By spying on the public.
And keeping them safe, which is what they want.
Clara Meades isn't safe, though, is she, Shaun?
Knowing what you knew, that might've helped us, but no, you kept your little fucking secret.
Okay!
The government's a cunt.
We knew that already.
Word's going to get out about Clara.
The public's going to wake up and find this mental assassination game going on, and soon we're going to have another body.
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.
We're totally locked out.
Totally blind.
If I can work out how they got in,
I might be able to reverse engineer some means of getting control back.
Do the ADis have a command log, on-board cache?
- Yeah, but that's encrypted.
- I'll need the key to that.
[phone rings] [sighs]
Been through the employee files, found some pols.
Bring them in.
Are you sitting in on these?
Granular interviews?
I've got to be somewhere.
[radio beeping]
[woman on radio] It's 7:15.
Three deaths have now been linked to a hashtag circulating on social media.
Controversial journalist Jo Powers... [man on radio] Good morning.
Have you posted the hashtag?
Is it real or an urban myth?
Well, thousands have been taking part, but how culpable are they?
People are dying, and we want to hear your thoughts.
Line seven, Liana...
This is real, this is happening...
I am happy to see her die.
[woman] It's not the hashtag killing them.
That's just a game.
Like, if you're an arsehole, you deserve to be shamed.
[man on radio] Steve, line five.
[man] Yeah, but my point is, someone's gotta be top of the list, yeah?
So why not make it someone, you know, who deserves it, like a racist.
[woman] With the hashtag, I've seen celebrities, politicians, everyone.
This doesn't mean you have to sit there encouraging people to take part.
The point is this is already happening.
And people know that they can jump on board because nobody will ever know if they did or didn't.
Well, let's just pause for a moment and go back to that top five.
As we have been saying, the Chancellor is at number one, and I want us to think about that.
What does that tell us about the choice of the nation?
[woman] Well, I can't say I'm surprised that he's number one on the list.
He's been pretty unpopular for quite a long time now.
[interviewer] But does that warrant his place on this list?
[woman] I'm saying people don't have to think too hard about it.
Now that's he's number one, that should generate more discussions and probably more votes.
Thanks for your time.
- No good?
- No good.
- Well, that's all fascinating...
- Shaun.
- But when do we shut it down?
- Tom.
Forgive me for being sceptical about your agency's basic competence.
- Tom.
- I'm on the fucking chopping block here.
Number one on the list.
The people's fucking choice!
Farrington's number four, and he's a paedophile.
- Suspected paedophile.
- He did it.
You know he did.
Let's just shut it down.
All social media.
The whole bloody Internet, pull the plug.
Just for today, at least until Thumbelina here pulls his finger out and he actually catches someone.
I wouldn't advise shutting things down.
- But it's possible?
We can do that?
- The whole of social media?
- Yeah.
Pull a North Korea on it.
- Well, yes, technically.
- Right, so push the off switch.
- [Shaun] That's not a good idea.
- No?
- Not in my opinion.
Right, okay.
It's just that speaking as a marked man, I beg to fucking differ.
If we shut it down, you'll still be number one.
Guaranteed to be, in fact.
He's right.
If we let it run on, at least there's a few hours.
Anything could happen before five o'clock.
The vote might change.
Yeah, and it might not.
What about that report?
The archive job?
From 1985, that memo about Farrington?
- That was over an unrelated matter.
- [Tom] Leak it.
Tom, that would be a smear.
A head-to-toe shit smear, I fucking hope so.
He's in his 80s.
He's had his life.
Fuck him under the bus.
If I could suggest an alternative?
We move you to a safe location.
- Have you secured before five.
- Worked out well for you last night.
I'll show you.
This next one's Tess Wallender.
She was a junior.
So not much in the way of technical skills.
- Quit Granular for personal reasons.
- Nervous exhaustion, yeah.
Worked in Human Resources for Granular until she quit.
She took a photo of a guy on the Tube, said he'd harassed her, lewd comments or something.
Turned out he had a learning disability so she caught a ton of shit on...
On social media.
- Hello.
I'm DCI Karin Parke.
- Hi.
It was like having a whole weather system turn against me.
Just hate message after hate message, around the clock, all piling on.
It's hard to describe what that does to your head.
Suddenly there's a million invisible people, all talking about how they despise you.
It's like a mental illness.
Fuck.
[Nick] What?
Shit.
I mean, hands up, I made a mistake, but the way people enjoyed kicking me, that's what got to me.
The casual fun they had and, um...
I just felt I couldn't go on.
Who found you?
Um...
Garrett, my flatmate.
He found me in the bath five minutes after I'd slashed them.
I mean, it's crazy.
I'm half-conscious.
He's dragging me out of the bath, and I'm telling him to get out, saying, "I'm naked."
He tied towels 'round my wrists, kept me conscious, kept stroking my hair till the ambulance arrived, talking to me.
Sort of weird.
I think he always had a thing for me.
And we worked at the same place so, you know... awkward.
- He worked at Granular?
- Yeah.
On the ADI thing.
- He was a real wunderkind.
Ultra-smart.
- What did you say his name was?
Garrett.
Garrett Scholes.
Garrett Scholes.
We need the whereabouts of a Garrett...
Scholes.
We were about to tell you.
It was buried in the on-board memory of the Jo Powers' ADI.
- What was?
- A manifesto.
A 98-page manifesto.
And check this out.
There's fucking selfies in it.
[buzzing] [man] So we're good to go?
[buzzing]
Okay, that's the charge in place.
Okay.
Pull back.
We're all set here.
Detonate.
[explosion]
So, the plan is, we move you to an underground bunker, knock out every hive within a ten-mile radius.
And, what, just leave me there?
How long for?
It's a temporary measure.
How long till you take out all the hives?
There's 20,000, 30,000 of them.
That would take two years.
Two years, a victim a day.
More to the point, the environmental impact would...
Fuck that.
[man] Shit!
- What?
- Fuck!
Stay back, stay back!
Get back!
[buzzing] [men screaming]
Go, go, go!
Get away!
[men screaming]
For fuck's sake, move!
[static, buzzing]
What's your Plan B?
[buzzing]
He was on the original employee roster, but we discounted him.
He left the country six months ago.
We thought we were looking for someone nearby.
Run a full trace on him.
Everything we can find.
Lunatic with production values, that's the worst kind.
"Thanks to the technological revolution,"
we have the power to rage and accuse, spout bile without consequence.
Only by being forced to recognize the power technology grants us,
"to acknowledge individual responsibility..."
Is it all like this?
He likens the population to insects, says we revel in cruelty, that it's a weakness that should be bred out of us.
Recurrent theme is he wants people to face the consequences of what they say and do.
- Wants to force that on them.
- The whole thing's a moral lesson?
He wanted us to find this and spread it about.
Well, fuck him.
Fuck.
Shit.
Karin.
Karin.
He's messed up.
He's put this document together himself, right?
His author name's in the metadata.
But he stripped out everything else, so we don't know when he's written it, for example.
Mm-hmm.
Most of the photos are clipart off the Internet, except this one.
- The selfie.
- That's where he's screwed up.
He's taken it with his phone, and the phone left a geotag on the image.
- So you know where he took this?
- I know precisely where.
He's here and Granular HQ is there.
[phone pings]
[crash]
- Armed police!
Stay down!
- Armed police!
[banging]
Armed police!
Stay where you are!
Armed police!
Show yourselves!
Move!
Left.
- Clear!
- Clear!
- Clear!

[Karin] Lifestyles of the rich and famous.
There.
The forge.
[gasps]
[Karin] Nice one.
Half the drives I sifted in forensics had scorch marks on 'em.
- [Blue] What do you think?
- Yeah.
Looks like his toolkit.
- You can use it?
- Pretty much the key to the door.
So you can get control back?
Send the deactivation?
[Rasmus] Well, I've got his source code.
- I should be able to bounce him out.
- Be quick.
[Karin] Key to the door?
Our guy doesn't seem the type to leave keys lying around.
Well, I'm in.
Okay.
Deactivate her.
- Yeah, I need to repair permissions.
- Fucking hell.
That's weird.
What's weird?
- [Shaun] Time's ticking.
- That file.
Wasn't there before.
- This file?
- Yeah.
[computer beeps]
What is it?
- Blue?
- I think they're IMEI numbers.
What does that mean?
Every phone, every device has a unique number, an IMEI number.
It tethers it to a unique user.
- Yeah.
- But I can check, just... reverse lookup.
[Rasmus] Take it easy.
[Karin] Who are these people?
[Blue] I don't know.
There's 387,000 of them.
Are these IDs your spooks have been collecting?
- No!
Are you ready yet?
- Yeah, almost there.
Wait.
Wait.
What was the name of that teacher?
Hate cake.
- Liza.
Liza Bahar.
- Liza Bahar.
[Shaun] Fuck's sake.
This is a list of everyone who's used the hashtag.
What?
Everyone who took part in the Game of Consequences.
They've hoovered up their ID from GCHQ by the looks of it.
That backdoor worked both ways, it seems.
- See if I'm on there.
- What?
I posted the tag earlier with Scholes' face.
- Just trying to get a reaction from him.
- Yeah, yeah, almost there.
[Blue] Yeah, you're there.
[Rasmus] Almost there.
Why has he collected everyone who took part?
I mean...
[Rasmus] Okay.
I'm ready.
- Shit.
- Run it now.
No.
Think.
He left us a trail.
- Oh, come on.
- That photo with the whereabouts, it's too big a mistake for him.
He knew we'd do this.
- Now we're shutting it down, all right?
- And maybe that'll trigger some endgame, something to do with that list.
What if those are his real targets?
The people on the list.
Everyone who took part.
Consequences.
The hate figures were the bait.
The players are the target.
- Run the deact command.
- [Rasmus] Now just wait a minute, okay?
- Run it.
- [Karin] No!
[beeping] [gasps]
[beeping]
[Rasmus] Yeah. [laughs]
Yeah, it worked.
[Shaun sighs]
Sorry, but that needed doing. [laughs]
[beeping]
- No, no, no, no, no.
- [Karin] What?
No.
No.
- [Rasmus] Fuck!
- [Karin] No.
[Karin] Shit.
Oh, no.

[woman] We're all tragically familiar with the rest of the events of that week.
And we need no reminding of the sheer scale of the loss of life that followed.
No.
No, we don't.
[woman] And what became of Ms. Colson?
I think she blamed herself.
No.
I know she did.
She felt she'd followed his breadcrumb trail and sprung the whole thing.
She left the force.
I didn't hear from her.
Rang her, tried emailing, but no response.
Then, um...
About four months later, they found her things.
On a beach.
With a note.
[breathes deeply]
She killed herself?
That's the base theory, yes.
Ms Parke, I would like to commend you for sharing your testimony and your time.
Thank you.
Thank you.

[beeps] [woman on TV] Chancellor Tom Pickering has defended the government's stance on disability benefits as outrage over the death of so-called "Wheelchair Martyr" Gwen Marbury grows.
More than 20,000 people have signed a petition demanding the sacking of newspaper columnist Jo Powers following her controversial article about Gwen Marbury.
Conservationists have announced another extinction.
The Siberian crane has died out following an unprecedented reduction in its wetland habitat.
And the honeybee-mimicking drone insects known as ADIs have been activated for their second summer.

[woman on TV] Grammy-award-winning rapper Tusk is still with us.
[cheering]
Now, Tusk, there are loads of online videos of people trying to emulate you, but this is our favourite.
Take a look at this.
[laughter and cheering]
It's a young chap called Aaron Sheen.
He's nine years old.
[laughs] That is one goofy-looking kid.
- [laughter]
- Not a good dancer.
He's nine years old!
Come on, he's a pretty good dancer.
That young motherfucker can't dance for shit.
He should probably just give up now, actually.
Don't hate on me for keeping it real.
That's a goofy little motherfucker, and he can't dance for shit.
[woman] He is a big fan, Tusk.
- [Tusk] Don't hate on your boy.
- [phone beeps] [woman] Everybody's got to start somewhere.
[Tusk] Start somewhere?
I looked better than that...
- DCI Parke?
- No press.
No, I'm not press.
Um...
TDC Blue Colson.
I'm your shadow.
My shadow?
They said...
Sorry.
Call me Karin.
- Did you say your name was...?
- Blue.
- B-l-u-e, Blue?
- Yeah.
It's not a nickname.
- My dad liked the sound of it.
- Uh-huh.
- Seen a body before?
- A couple.
- On video, I mean.
- [man] Boss?
- This is Blue.
She's my shadow.
- [helicopter whirrs]
- DS Nick Shelton.
- What've we got?
- Jo Powers.
- As in...
As in actual Jo Powers.
Saw something she wrote the other day about the wheelchair woman.
Clickbait piece.
Pissed people off.
That article was fucking horrendous.
Even I signed the petition.
To get her sacked.
Come on.
Neighbours heard her screaming and called it in.
[Karin] Hell of a struggle.
Anyone else at home?
Husband.
Found slashed across the stomach.
- By her?
- Don't know.
He was unconscious.
They've taken him to St. Columbus.
[Blue] Her mentions are still pouring in.
Restraining bolt's in place.
- No other points of entry?
- No.
But the outside's ringed with CCTV.
- We got the code for the cams?
- Uh-huh.
Okay, then.
Check the recordings.
Bag that, send it to Toxicology.
Full autop for her, and we question the husband as soon as he wakes up.
Come on.
- You think it's the husband?
- I'm keeping options open.
Cutting the throat, that's unusual.
Thanks, chaps.
- But you do think he did it?
- Don't know anything yet.
These things are almost always either drink, drugs or domestic.
It is how it is.
- You driving home?
- No licence.
Never passed.
I'm sort of waiting for driverless to go mainstream.
- Get in.
- No, honestly, I'll get the Tube.
- Get in.
- Oh.
Okay.
- So you were in Tech Crime?
- Digital Forensics.
Computer murk.
[Karin] What happened, you get bored of it?
Not exactly.
You've seen what people tuck away on these.
Schemes and kill lists, kiddy porn.
It's not boring.
I'm old enough to remember when they walked around with that stuff just tucked away in their heads.
[Blue] Right.
But now they can't help but entrusting it to their little companions.
These things absorb who we are.
They know everything about us.
[Karin] If it's interesting, why leave Forensics?
The Rannoch case.
- Ian Rannoch?
- The child killings, yeah.
I was the one who cracked his souvenir folder.
- So you saw those pictures?
- Mm-hmm.
And the videos too.
Saw them all.
You see something like that, it changes you.
You either get defeated or you think...
You think, "Fuck me!
I've got to help stop that shit."
Yeah.
- I mean, out here in the field...
- What fucking field?
You know what I mean.
Out here in the real world, you can genuinely prevent stuff, can't you?
You are young.
Maybe you're old?
- [Karin] Steady.
- [chuckles]
Thanks.
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes, boss.
[woman onTV] Jo Powers has been found dead at her home in West London.
The veteran columnist had been at the centre of controversy over an article she'd written about disability rights activist Gwen Marbury.
The police have yet to confirm the cause... [clicks]
[man] It's just the first floor, first door on the...
- Starting early?
- I asked Nick to show me the CCTV.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
No one came in or out.
Just Jo and her husband all evening.
- And that one there?
- Rear patio.
- Bust for months by the looks of it.
- Someone could've come in through there.
They'd have to climb the fence, make it in and out, knowing the camera wasn't working, but yeah, could have happened.
Technically.
Okay, sorry.
You're keen to help.
- She just asked!
- Uh-huh.
[sighs]
_ [sighs]
_
_
[Karin clears throat]
Um...
So...
I'm collating every threat or insult levelled at Jo Powers over the previous 48 hours.
Say it is the husband.
That's a coincidence, isn't it?
Not really.
You've got everyone throwing a shit fit.
Stress levels in that household would've been through the roof.
That Internet stuff drifts off like weather.
It's half hate.
They don't mean it.
The hate in a marriage, that's in 3D.
That's had work put into it.
That's sincere.
- Yeah.
I'm divorced.
- Um...
Husband's up and talking.
You're gonna love his alibi.
_ [siren wailing]
[phone rings]
I heard Jo screaming from upstairs.
And when I ran in, she was walking 'round the room, stumbling.
She was clutching...
She was clutching her head as if she was in pain.
And then for a moment, she stopped.
And then it was like a seizure, she was... thrashing... clawing at her own skin.
And she turned... [sobs]
She smashed her head...
onto the desk, hard.
Then she... she pushed me over.
That must've been when the bottle smashed.
Then she picked it up, and she started cutting herself.
Here.
She was gouging.
[sobs] I tried to stop her.
But she did this.
Then she cut her throat.
I tried to stop her.
She cut her own throat with the glass!
[man whimpers] [cries]
[Karin]Mutilated and then killed herself for no apparent reason?
I'd say the odds are against that.
He said it was like she was having a seizure.
Maybe there was something in the cake.
- The cake?
- It had "fucking bitch" iced on it.
- Could've been something in it.
- Like a drug?
- I don't know.
- That makes people kill themselves?
He was sort of convincing.
- He just doesn't seem the...
- Don't say "the type."
He's ordinary.
That is the type.
What, so he bounced her head off the desk?
- Blue.
- Held her steady enough...
- Blue.
- What?
- Toxicology are looking at the cake.
- Okay.
Meantime, let's drop in on the person that sent it.
Got the name this morning.
- You don't need to patronize me.
- We're doing what you want.
- Following another lead.
- That you think is a waste of time.
Picking along dead ends just to prove they're dead ends, that's most of the job.
I'm not saying it's a waste of time.
Just... you haven't had a chance to get bored of reality yet.
Okay, that was patronizing.
- Is this who sent the cake?
- [Karin] Uh-huh.
- Have we checked her social feeds?
- I don't know.
_
"Death to Jo Powers." She posted that on Monday morning.
The bakery said that they're not meant to do obscenities, so I said it was for my sister, like just a joke thing, and they agreed, so...
Not cheap, their cakes.
With delivery, it was what, 80 quid?
Um...
Well, I didn't pay for it all myself.
- We all put a pound in each.
- We?
Yeah.
I'm on a mums and carers message board.
I held a sort of whip-round.
- You crowd-sourced the money?
- Yeah, if you like.
From 80 other people?
Look, I'm not... [laughs]
I'm not being funny, okay?
I know she is dead.
But did you read what she had written?
How much do you think she got paid for spouting that horrible shit?
I don't know.
- I was just using my freedom of speech.
- To send a threatening message.
[scoffs] It was funny, okay?
And I can see if I'd done it myself, then that would be a bit weird, but I'm not mental.
You wished she was dead.
Well, uh... [stammers] No, no, I didn't.
[phone beeps]
- "Death to Jo Powers." - [laughs] That's just...
It's a... a hashtag game, you know, like "Death to..."
You insert the name of someone who's being an arsehole.
It's not... real.
It's a joke thing.
And who started it?
The hashtag?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I saw it somewhere.
[phone beeps]
Excuse us a moment.
Toxicology say the cake's clean.
They also said:
"Thanks, it was delicious."
We'll give her a caution.
Offensive Communications Act.
- Does that cover cakes?
- As far as she's concerned, it does.
What about the others who chipped in?
Are you going to tell them off, too?
- I didn't do anything.
- Start a thread about it.
Hospital's discharging the husband tomorrow.
We'll bring him in for questioning.
Blue?
We're arresting the husband.
Don't wallow in that.
The Internet will be pissed off with someone else today.
[Nick] Tusk.
Everyone's pissed off with Tusk 'cause of that thing with the kid.
He's catching a shit storm on social media.
- Liza will be organising the cake now.
- Yeah.
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.
_
- Whoo!
- ♪ Turn a penny to a grand ♪
♪ When I'm ready, rocking steady for my fans ♪
Where my ladies at?
- Yo!
Good show.
- Yeah, that's a good show, brother.
- I'm feeling my shit.
- You want some of that?
- What you smoking?
- Good shit, boy.
A'ight.
Damn!
Eyes on, eyes on, eyes on.
Don't stress.
It's legal here.
Pfft!
Keep forgetting.
Welcome to Europe, I guess.
- Kinda takes the joy out of it.
- Tell me about it.
- [clatter]
- Careful!
You break it, you pay for it.
- Always doing some bullshit.
- [Tusk yelling]
- [screams]
- Tusk?
Tusk?
[screaming]
Yo, yo!
We need some help over here!
[screams hysterically]
- I got you.
- Get it out!
Get it out!
Get it out!
Call an ambulance!
[screaming]
[monitor beeping]
[typing]
- [whirring]
- Commencing.
[rattling]
[beeping]
- Did he say what it is?
- Nope.
[buzzer]
- Good morning.
- Morning.
[man] She's in here.
So I go in, and there's not just the wound from the glass.
There's a hole.
Dug in.
A bore hole, like a tiny tunnel.
So I follow it, you know, how deep does it go?
It goes all the way from her ear canal to deep in her brain.
Where I find this.
Nestled right in there.
Looks quite cosy.
- [Karin] It's one of those bee things.
- [Blue] An ADI.
An Autonomous Drone Insect from the Granular Project.
- How did it get in there?
- I'd say it burrowed in.
- Fuck me.
- [man] That's not the worst part.
It crawled right through her dorsal posterior insula, which is basically the brain's pain centre.
You're talking agony off the scale.
- You'd do anything to make it stop.
- Even cut your own throat.
- Good afternoon.
- DCI Parke.
- TDC Blue Colson.
- Okay.
Thank you.
[Karin] They're so fucking fancy-looking, these companies.
- Billions on branding.
- Well, they can afford it.
The whole ADI project's pretty much bankrolled by the government.
It's why so many people are paranoid about it.
Let me guess, this is some people on the Internet?
They reckon the government uses the bees to spy on us.
There's a schizophrenic world view.
[buzzing]
[buzzing]
Jesus, I didn't expect to find myself living in the future, but here I fucking well am.
- Karin Parke?
- Uh-huh.
Vanessa Dahl.
Please.
Follow me.
You're after information on our Project Swarm ADIs?
[Karin] That's right.
[Vanessa] Any particular reason?
Yes.
[buzzing]
Rasmus.
Rasmus Sjoberg.
- He heads Swarm.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Nice greenhouse.
- Yeah.
[buzzing]
[Karin] So, your bees, your ADIs, talk me through them.
Colony Collapse Disorder.
We still don't know what's behind it.
Bees themselves were virtually extinct so what our ADIs do is effectively stand in for them.
They're solar powered.
They don't need nectar.
but they pollinate flowers the same way.
They crawl inside, pollen sticks to their legs and gets brushed off the next flower they visit.
- Can they make honey?
- Uh...
No.
I was joking.
How do they know where the flowers even are?
I mean...
Well, they have a sensor.
Like a... camera?
No.
Just a basic visual sensor.
You see, they need rudimentary pattern recognition in order to locate compatible flora and navigate.
- They navigate?
- Yes.
You don't...
I don't know... steer them?
They're autonomous.
That's right, isn't it?
They make their own decisions.
They look after themselves.
Yes.
You see, the ADIs cover the whole of the UK.
We couldn't command each one individually ourselves.
It's just not logistically possible.
No. [coughs] We simply set the behaviour and leave them to it.
They even construct these hives themselves.
They reproduce...
- They reproduce?
- Yes.
Each hive is a replication point.
- [Blue] It's like a 3D printer, basically.
- [Rasmus] Exactly.
They create duplicates of themselves, create more hives and spread out exponentially.
- [Blue] Cover the country.
- Maybe you should work here.
Yeah, well, I read up on it.
It's impressive.
It is.
It's just a shame it's necessary.
The alternative would have been environmental catastrophe.
Bees were dying out.
So, what is it that brings you here?
We think one of your ADIs may be involved in an unexplained death.
Sorry?
A death?
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
Yeah.
It's one of ours.
But, look, these are not designed to...
Kill people?
I'd hope not.
Could it have malfunctioned somehow?
No.
I mean, when they do malfunction...
It happens, but then they just break, they just hit the ground.
What if someone hacked one and then they found a way of controlling it?
That's impossible.
You see, it's got military-grade encryption, and you would need a diagnostic controller, which is also encrypted.
So I would say the likelihood is...
I don't know what he's saying, but it's not the same as "impossible."
This is every hive we have online.
See...
These are the hives in the building here.
- How many bees per hive?
- Around 4,000.
- [Karin] It's like air traffic control.
- [Rasmus] Yeah.
Is that the search input?
- Yeah, but, uh... you'd need...
- Sorry.
[tapping on keyboard]
- Jo Powers' postcode.
- [beeping]
Is that who this is about?
- You said you get some malfunctions?
- A fair few, yes.
They smack into a car or something.
We even had people trap them.
You know, put them in the microwave for YouTube videos. [laughs]
And this logs any that drop off the system?
Logs everything, yes.
Did you lose any around here on Monday evening?
Well, I can check.
[beeping]
Just one.
Went out at 1903 hours.
Here, I can replay.
[beeping]
There.
- That's odd.
- [Blue] What's odd?
When they pass between hives, they switch from one jurisdiction to another.
- It's, you know, like a...
- It's like a phone between cell masts?
Exactly.
It tried to do that, but there was nothing to switch to.
Unless someone spoofed a hive and then they've used that to commandeer your ADI.
No, you would need a diagnostic controller to do that.
[Blue] What's the range on one of those?
[Rasmus] Ten, 20 metres, perhaps.
So whoever was controlling it would have to be no more than 20 metres away.
- Outside the house.
- Yeah.
Sitting in a car, even.
- Can you trace back who did this?
- Yes.
I-I'm already trying to do that.
Uh...
You know what?
Uh...
It would be easier without an audience.
Okay.
You two swap numbers, keep a line of communication.
Can you shut the whole thing down if need be... hypothetically speaking?
Even a short stoppage would damage the ecosystem, and we'd need approval from the Department of the Environment.
We'll need a list of any Granular staff that had access to that system, past or present.
[laughs] Some were government employees.
Use a different font for those if it helps.
Bye.
[buzzing]
[buzzing]
Nick, that's a set of Granular personnel records.
Root out anyone interesting.
Maybe not just one.
Could be a group involved.
Technically we should refer this up to the NCA, but there's no fucking way they're taking this off me.
The NCA already knows about it.
What?
DCI Karin Parke?
- Yes.
- Shaun Li, National Crime Agency.
[Karin] How come you're here?
There's been more than one.
This is Tusk, last night.
- Shit.
- They thought it was a fit.
Took him to the hospital.
He had to be anaesthetised to stop him mutilating himself.
X-ray seemed to indicate some kind of plaque or tumour in his brain
- so they popped him in the MRI.
- [groans]
Yeah.
Basically one big magnet.
Tore it right out of his head, through the eye socket.
[groans]
Battered the ADI too.
Yours is more intact so I'm gonna need it for analysis.
[Karin] It's evidence.
Two's a pattern.
It knocks any malfunction theory in the head.
- And they're similar victims.
- Similar?
Both in the middle of online shit storms.
Well, if you wanna kill someone, there's a million easier ways to do it.
Pull this off and you've done it from across the street.
No fingerprints, no DNA.
It's like wishing them dead.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Guys?
Come here.
Okay, so, um...
Jo Powers and Tusk, both were being kicked around the Internet for hours, but in both their cases, people were also tweeting their photos accompanied with this hashtag: #DeathTo.
- Like our friend the teacher.
- Right.
She didn't know where she'd first heard of it, but trace it back, and it looks like the first real use of the hashtag was last weekend.
- By who?
- [Blue] Uh...
Looks like, um...
Looks like identical tweets from a set of duplicate bot accounts.
Um...
Automated.
It's like spam.
This is someone trying to seed the tag, you know?
Get it out there.
It's like bait.
This is someone wanting people to pick up on it.
Check out the senders' avatar photos.
[Karin] Bees.
Shit.
Okay.
There's more.
So each tweet had a sort of instruction video attached to it.
- [Karin] Uh-huh.
- There.
"Game of Consequences"?
It's like an unpopularity contest.
Pick someone you don't like and if enough other people choose the same name, then that's who gets targeted.
Here, watch.
[man] Game of Consequences.
- One:
Pick a target.
- [Karin] Oh, my God.
Two:
Post their name and photo with #DeathTo.
No.
Three:
Most popular target will be eliminated after 5 p.m. each day.
Four:
Game resets at midnight.
- [Nick] Oh, no.
- [Karin] Fuck.
Someone's holding a public ballot, bumping off the top person.
- Jesus, it's just mad.
- Yeah, and it's growing.
Day one. 63 people used the hashtag on Jo Powers, okay?
On day two, 223 used it on Tusk.
- Who's using it now?
- There's...
There's loads more people.
There's quite a few votes for the Chancellor.
- Yeah.
- Um...
But at number one... is 880 people using it on someone called Clara Meades.
- Who's she?
- Clara Meades.
Okay, um...
it looks like she was at a demo, and she took a selfie in front of a war memorial.
- Pretending to piss on it.
- Nice work, Clara.
Yeah, it's getting near the end of the vote, and her mentions are blowing up.
- Tusk isn't public knowledge yet?
- Um, no.
So people can't know the hashtag works.
They're using it to scare her.
- Yeah, but they're gonna get her killed.
- We need to get to her before five.
Yeah.
Pulling her citizens details.
You're not supposed to have access to that.
Yeah, I know.
Just getting her location.
There.
[breathes heavily] [computer chirrups repeatedly]
[phone ringing]
[ringing stops, chirruping continues]
_
_
_
_ [sighs]
- _ - [phone rings]
_
_ [woman] Hello?
[whimpers] [woman] Yeah, she is.
All right, all right, hold on.
Clara!
Police.
For you.
How did they get my number?
- Hello?
- Clara Meades?
This is DCI Karin Parke, Met Police.
Sorry to track you down like this, but we think you may be in danger.
Sorry, is this a joke?
Because all this stuff I'm getting is not funny.
I'm not joking.
Stay where you are until we get there.
And keep your windows closed.
I'm setting up a perimeter.
Call Rasmus, we need him across this.
[sighs]
- Rasmus?
- Hi, Blue.
I'm sending you a postcode and my GPS.
I need you to monitor the area.
Track my location and see if you get anything unusual, any rogue ADIs, yeah?
Yeah, great, good.
Look, if they come back,
I think I can catch them.
I have basically set a trap.
So if they...
if they try it again, we've got them.
- Are you Batman?
- They only just rolled them out.
This'll turn every red light between here and there to green.
Fuck me.
If this is the NCA life, I should apply for a transfer.
Let's go.
_
We can take her here.
It's a safe house for terrorist informers usually.
[helicopter whirring]
[sirens wailing]
[man over radio] No target sighted.
[man over loudspeaker] This is a police operation!
Everybody vacate their premises now.
Please leave... [gasps] [computer pings]
- [Vanessa] What's that?
- [Rasmus] Someone's trying to break in.
- Rasmus?
- I just picked up an attempted breach.
Granular, they've got a breach.
- [Rasmus] One ADI just went offline.
- Where?
- 800 metres from your location.
- That's outside our cordon.
If someone's trying to pilot it this way, they're gonna turn 'round the moment they see all these uniforms.
Clara Meades?
I'm Karin Parke.
Did you pack a bag?
- Yeah, it's by the door.
- Right, let's go.
- Rasmus got a track on them?
- Not yet.
[beeping] _
It's just precautionary, and it's only for one night.
Just gotta call in.
Hi.
No, not yet.
Hopefully never.
Granular are onto it.
- Understood.
- [buzzing]
They housed a witness here for a while, Shaun said.
- Must've had kids.
- Have you got kids?
[both] No.
No plans.
[buzzing]
Up the stairs.
[phone rings]
- Rasmus.
- Still nothing.
I can't trace it.
[sighs]
[sighs] At least there's an en-suite.
- Is there nothing?
- [Rasmus] No.
Whoever it is, they've masked their path well.
[beeping]
But that's not...
- Fuck.
- [Blue] What?
- We just lost a whole hive.
- What does that mean?
Packed full of ADIs.
Lost them all too.
- No...
Rasmus?
- There's thousands of them.
- Where?
- It's close to your location. [static]
Rasmus, say that again.
Blue?
Blue.
It's close...
It's very close to you.
Text it.
Text it to me.
Rasmus.
Text it to... [static] Shit.
Do I get to redecorate?
[buzzing]
- [crackling on line]
- Hello.
Hello.
[distorted voice]
[beeping]
[Rasmus] No...
They've got the whole thing.
We're not in control anymore.
- They've got the whole thing.
- [Vanessa] What are you doing?
- Fix it!
Can't you fix it?
- Shut up!
[crackling on line] [buzzing]
[buzzing continuing]
- [screams] - [phone beeps]
_ [buzzing]
Shit.
[panting]
We need to go.
Now.
Now!
Come on!
[buzzing]
Go.
Go, go, go.
[Shaun screams] [loud buzzing] [gasps]
[Clara] What's... what's happening?
[buzzing]
- [rattling] - [Blue] Karin...
- [rattling] - [mutters]
[loud buzzing]
In there!
Go!
[gasps]
- Help me block the gap!
- [Clara]Tell me what's going on!
You're scaring the shit out of me!
[loud buzzing]
[door rattles]
[gasps] [buzzing and rattling continue]
- [rattling] - [screams]
Oh!
Fuck!
[buzzing]
- [buzzing] - [screams] [buzzing]
The fan!
The fan!
[screams] [screams] [screams]
Get it away from me!
[screams]
[screams hysterically] [gasps]
[buzzing]
[buzzing stops]
[panting]
[woman] Take your time.
I'd seen so many bodies before.
At crime scenes, in autopsies.
But I'd never seen anyone die.
And she was right there.
And can you describe the reaction of your colleague, Miss Colson?
Blue took it hard.
[Shaun] Uh-huh.
[man] I'll shut it down.
We thought this was one guy, some Mr. Mystery in the vicinity, hijacking one ADI and personally controlling it.
[Shaun] But there were thousands of them.
- So it can't be that, right?
- No.
- One person can't fly hundreds at once.
- No.
Whoever this is, they're controlling the whole system.
- Do you know where from?
- Could be anywhere.
You need to fucking sort this out!
[kicks table]
How do the ADIs know who to target?
Could've found Clara the same way you did, the identity database?
No.
That just gives you the basic area.
We were in the room too, and they only went for her.
Facial recognition.
It's got to be facial recognition.
Which means the feed from their visual sensors, that's been accessed too.
- [Shaun] That's not possible.
- [Blue] It's the only explanation.
Now look, the visual feed is secure between each ADI and the hive.
- There you go.
- Although... one of the government's conditions for backing the project...
Okay.
Enough.
We had to consent to permitting government security services access to the visual feed at times of quote, "increased national security."
Which is, as I understand it, pretty much all the time.
- I wasn't happy about it.
- Your lot went along with it.
That implies a greater range of options than your lot presented.
- So they are spying on us.
- This is all classified.
So what did you do, did you put in a back door and route it through GCHQ?
I mean, you do CCTV, you do traffic cams.
So what don't you have your fucking noses in?
Look, millions of those things flying around, propping up the ecosystem?
Well, that's great, save the planet, hallelujah!
Government's not going to pump billions into it just 'cause some lab coat says so, and it grabs 200 green votes.
They saw an opportunity to get more, they took it.
Total nationwide surveillance.
We tracked suspects for weeks in ways they couldn't dream of.
- We prevented bombings, mass shootings.
- By spying on the public.
And keeping them safe, which is what they want.
Clara Meades isn't safe, though, is she, Shaun?
Knowing what you knew, that might've helped us, but no, you kept your little fucking secret.
Okay!
The government's a cunt.
We knew that already.
Word's going to get out about Clara.
The public's going to wake up and find this mental assassination game going on, and soon we're going to have another body.
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.
We're totally locked out.
Totally blind.
If I can work out how they got in,
I might be able to reverse engineer some means of getting control back.
Do the ADIs have a command log, on-board cache?
- Yeah, but that's encrypted.
- I'll need the key to that.
[phone rings] [sighs]
Been through the employee files, found some pols.
Bring them in.
Are you sitting in on these?
Granular interviews?
I've got to be somewhere.
[radio beeping]
[woman on radio] It's 7:15.
Three deaths have now been linked to a hashtag circulating on social media.
Controversial journalist Jo Powers... [man on radio] Good morning.
Have you posted the hashtag?
Is it real or an urban myth?
Well, thousands have been taking part, but how culpable are they?
People are dying, and we want to hear your thoughts.
Line seven, Liana...
This is real, this is happening...
I am happy to see her die.
[woman] It's not the hashtag killing them.
That's just a game.
Like, if you're an arsehole, you deserve to be shamed.
[man on radio] Steve, line five.
[man] Yeah, but my point is, someone's gotta be top of the list, yeah?
So why not make it someone, you know, who deserves it, like a racist.
[woman] With the hashtag, I've seen celebrities, politicians, everyone.
This doesn't mean you have to sit there encouraging people to take part.
The point is this is already happening.
And people know that they can jump onboard because nobody will ever know if they did or didn't.
Well, let's just pause for a moment and go back to that top five.
As we have been saying, the Chancellor is at number one, and I want us to think about that.
What does that tell us about the choice of the nation?
[woman] Well, I can't say I'm surprised that he's number one on the list.
He's been pretty unpopular for quite a long time now.
[interviewer] But does that warrant his place on this list?
[woman] I'm saying people don't have to think too hard about it.
Now that's he's number one, that should generate more discussions and probably more votes.
_
Thanks for your time.
- No good?
- No good.
- Well, that's all fascinating...
- Shaun.
- But when do we shut it down?
- Tom.
Forgive me for being sceptical about your agency's basic competence.
- Tom.
- I'm on the fucking chopping block here.
Number one on the list.
The people's fucking choice!
Farrington's number four, and he's a paedophile.
- Suspected paedophile.
- He did it.
You know he did.
Let's just shut it down.
All social media.
The whole bloody Internet, pull the plug.
Just for today, at least until Thumbelina here pulls his finger out and he actually catches someone.
I wouldn't advise shutting things down.
- But it's possible?
We can do that?
- The whole of social media?
- Yeah.
Pull a North Korea on it.
- Well, yes, technically.
- Right, so push the off switch.
- [Shaun] That's not a good idea.
- No?
- Not in my opinion.
Right, okay.
It's just that speaking as a marked man, I beg to fucking differ.
If we shut it down, you'll still be number one.
Guaranteed to be, in fact.
He's right.
If we let it run on, at least there's a few hours.
Anything could happen before five o'clock.
The vote might change.
Yeah, and it might not.
What about that report?
The archive job?
From 1985, that memo about Farrington?
- That was over an unrelated matter.
- [Tom] Leak it.
Tom, that would be a smear.
A head-to-toe shit smear, I fucking hope so.
He's in his 80s.
He's had his life.
Fuck him under the bus.
If I could suggest an alternative?
We move you to a safe location.
- Have you secured before five.
- Worked out well for you last night.
I'll show you.
This next one's Tess Wallender.
She was a junior.
So not much in the way of technical skills.
- Quit Granular for personal reasons.
- Nervous exhaustion, yeah.
Worked in Human Resources for Granular until she quit.
She took a photo of a guy on the Tube, said he'd harassed her, lewd comments or something.
Turned out he had a learning disability so she caught a ton of shit on...
On social media.
- Hello.
I'm DCI Karin Parke.
- Hi.
_
It was like having a whole weather system turn against me.
Just hate message after hate message, around the clock, all piling on.
It's hard to describe what that does to your head.
Suddenly there's a million invisible people, all talking about how they despise you.
It's like a mental illness.
Fuck.
[Nick] What?
Shit.
I mean, hands up, I made a mistake, but the way people enjoyed kicking me, that's what got to me.
The casual fun they had and, um...
I just felt I couldn't go on.
Who found you?
Um...
Garrett, my flatmate.
He found me in the bath five minutes after I'd slashed them.
I mean, it's crazy.
I'm half-conscious.
He's dragging me out of the bath, and I'm telling him to get out, saying, "I'm naked."
He tied towels 'round my wrists, kept me conscious, kept stroking my hair till the ambulance arrived, talking to me.
Sort of weird.
I think he always had a thing for me.
And we worked at the same place so, you know... awkward.
- He worked at Granular?
- Yeah.
On the ADI thing.
- He was a real wunderkind.
Ultra-smart.
- What did you say his name was?
Garrett.
Garrett Scholes.
Garrett Scholes.
We need the whereabouts of a Garrett...
Scholes.
We were about to tell you.
It was buried in the on-board memory of the Jo Powers' ADI.
- What was?
- A manifesto.
A 98-page manifesto.
_
And check this out.
There's fucking selfies in it.
[buzzing] [man] So we're good to go?
[buzzing]
Okay, that's the charge in place.
Okay.
Pull back.
We're all set here.
Detonate.
[explosion]
So, the plan is, we move you to an underground bunker, knock out every hive within a ten-mile radius.
And, what, just leave me there?
How long for?
It's a temporary measure.
How long till you take out all the hives?
There's 20,000, 30,000 of them.
That would take two years.
Two years, a victim a day.
More to the point, the environmental impact would...
Fuck that.
[man] Shit!
- What?
- Fuck!
Stay back, stay back!
Get back!
[buzzing] [men screaming]
Go, go, go!
Get away!
[men screaming]
For fuck's sake, move!
[static, buzzing]
What's your Plan B?
[buzzing]
He was on the original employee roster, but we discounted him.
He left the country six months ago.
We thought we were looking for someone nearby.
Run a full trace on him.
Everything we can find.
Lunatic with production values, that's the worst kind.
"Thanks to the technological revolution, we have the power to rage and accuse, spout bile without consequence.
Only by being forced to recognize the power technology grants us, to acknowledge individual responsibility..."
Is it all like this?
He likens the population to insects, says we revel in cruelty, that it's a weakness that should be bred out of us.
Recurrent theme is he wants people to face the consequences of what they say and do.
- Wants to force that on them.
- The whole thing's a moral lesson?
He wanted us to find this and spread it about.
Well, fuck him.
_
_
Fuck.
_
_
Shit.
Karin.
Karin.
He's messed up.
He's put this document together himself, right?
His author name's in the metadata.
But he stripped out everything else, so we don't know when he's written it, for example.
Mm-hmm.
Most of the photos are clipart off the Internet, except this one.
- The selfie.
- That's where he's screwed up.
He's taken it with his phone, and the phone left a geotag on the image.
- So you know where he took this?
- I know precisely where.
He's here and Granular HQ is there.

[Karin] Lifestyles of the rich and famous.
There.
The forge.
[gasps]
[Karin] Nice one.
Half the drives I sifted in forensics had scorch marks on 'em.
- [Blue] What do you think?
- Yeah.
Looks like his toolkit.
- You can use it?
- Pretty much the key to the door.
So you can get control back?
Send the deactivation?
[Rasmus] Well, I've got his source code.
- I should be able to bounce him out.
- Be quick.
[Karin] Key to the door?
Our guy doesn't seem the type to leave keys lying around.
Well, I'm in.
Okay.
Deactivate her.
- Yeah, I need to repair permissions.
- Fucking hell.
That's weird.
What's weird?
- [Shaun] Time's ticking.
- That file.
Wasn't there before.
- This file?
- Yeah.
[computer beeps]
What is it?
- Blue?
- I think they're IMEI numbers.
What does that mean?
Every phone, every device has a unique number, an IMEI number.
It tethers it to a unique user.
- Yeah.
- But I can check, just... reverse lookup.
[Rasmus] Take it easy.
[Karin] Who are these people?
[Blue] I don't know.
There's 387,000 of them.
Are these IDs your spooks have been collecting?
- No!
Are you ready yet?
- Yeah, almost there.
Wait.
Wait.
What was the name of that teacher?
Hate cake.
- Liza.
Liza Bahar.
- Liza Bahar.
[Shaun] Fuck's sake.
This is a list of everyone who's used the hashtag.
What?
Everyone who took part in the Game of Consequences.
They've hoovered up their ID from GCHQ by the looks of it.
That backdoor worked both ways, it seems.
- See if I'm on there.
- What?
I posted the tag earlier with Scholes' face.
- Just trying to get a reaction from him.
- Yeah, yeah, almost there.
[Blue] Yeah, you're there.
[Rasmus] Almost there.
Why has he collected everyone who took part?
I mean...
[Rasmus] Okay.
I'm ready.
- Shit.
- Run it now.
No.
Think.
He left us a trail.
- Oh, come on.
- That photo with the whereabouts, it's too big a mistake for him.
He knew we'd do this.
- Now we're shutting it down, all right?
- And maybe that'll trigger some endgame, something to do with that list.
What if those are his real targets?
The people on the list.
Everyone who took part.
Consequences.
The hate figures were the bait.
The players are the target.
- Run the deact command.
- [Rasmus] Now just wait a minute, okay?
- Run it.
- [Karin] No!
[beeping] _ [gasps]
[beeping]
[Rasmus] Yeah. [laughs]
Yeah, it worked.
[Shaun sighs]
Sorry, but that needed doing. [laughs]
[beeping]
- No, no, no, no, no.
- [Karin] What?
No.
No.
- [Rasmus] Fuck!
- [Karin] No.
[Karin] Shit.
Oh, no.

[woman] We're all tragically familiar with the rest of the events of that week.
And we need no reminding of the sheer scale of the loss of life that followed.
No.
No, we don't.
[woman] And what became of Ms. Colson?
I think she blamed herself.
No.
I know she did.
She felt she'd followed his breadcrumb trail and sprung the whole thing.
She left the force.
I didn't hear from her.
Rang her, tried emailing, but no response.
Then, um...
About four months later, they found her things.
On a beach.
With a note.
[breathes deeply]
She killed herself?
That's the base theory, yes.
Ms Parke, I would like to commend you for sharing your testimony and your time.
Thank you.
Thank you.

[Karin] Lifestyles of the r
They're ready now.
Perhaps we could begin with your earliest recollections of the events of last May.
Well, I first got involved on the 15th.
Could you move the microphone a little closer?
Here?
I first got involved on the 15th.
Chancellor Tom Pickering has defended the government's stance on disability benefits as outrage over the death of so-called "Wheelchair Martyr" Gwen Marbury grows.
More than 20,000 people have signed a petition demanding the sacking of newspaper columnist Jo Powers following her controversial article about Gwen Marbury.
Conservationists have announced another extinction.
The Siberian crane has died out following an unprecedented reduction in its wetland habitat.
And the honeybee-mimicking drone insects known as ADls have been activated for their second summer.
Hope you're ashamed of yourself.
- Bitch.
- Pleasure's all mine.
Yo Powers?
Jo Powers.
Whatever's in there, will it detonate?
That's from bakery.
For you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Hello, darling!
Creative, your well-wishers.
Don't eat it.
It's a cake.
That's its job.
I'm going to have a bath.
Ah!
Grammy-award-winning rapper Tusk is still with us.
Now, Tusk, there are loads of online videos of people trying to emulate you, but this is our favourite.
Take a look at this.
It's a young chap called Aaron Sheen.
He's nine years old.
Thatisonegoofy-lookingkid.
Not a good dancer.
He's nine years old!
Come on, he's a pretty good dancer.
That young motherfucker can't dance for shit.
He should probably just give up now, actually.
Don't hate on me for keeping it real.
That's a goofy little motherfucker, and he can't dance for shit.
Heisabig fan ,Tusk.
Don'thateon yourboy .
Everybody's got to start somewhere.
Startsomewhere?
I looked better than that...
- DCI Parke?
- No press.
No, I'm not press.
Um...
TDC Blue Colson.
I'm your shadow.
My shadow?
They said...
Sorry.
Call me Karin.
- Did you say your name was...?
- Blue.
- B-l-u-e, Blue?
- Yeah.
It's not a nickname.
- My dad liked the sound of it.
- Uh-huh.
- Seen a body before?
- A couple.
- On video, I mean.
- Boss?
This is Blue.
She's my shadow.
- DS Nick Shelton.
- What've we got?
- Jo Powers.
- As in...
As in actual Jo Powers.
Saw something she wrote the other day about the wheelchair woman.
Clickbait piece.
Pissed people off.
That article was fucking horrendous.
Even I signed the petition.
To get her sacked.
Come on.
Neighbours heard her screaming and called it in.
Hell of a struggle.
Anyone else at home?
Husband.
Found slashed across the stomach.
- By her?
- Don't know.
He was unconscious.
They've taken him to St. Columbus.
Her mentions are still pouring in.
Restraining bolt's in place.
- No other points of entry?
- No.
But the outside's ringed with CCTV.
- We got the code for the cams?
- Uh-huh.
Okay, then.
Check the recordings.
Bag that, send it to Toxicology.
Full autop for her, and we question the husband as soon as he wakes up.
Come on.
- You think it's the husband?
- I'm keeping options open.
Cutting the throat, that's unusual.
Thanks, chaps.
- But you do think he did it?
- Don't know anything yet.
These things are almost always either drink, drugs or domestic.
It is how it is.
- You driving home?
- No license.
Never passed.
I'm sort of waiting for driverless to go mainstream.
- Get in.
- No, honestly, I'll get the Tube.
- Get in.
- Oh.
Okay.
- So you were in Tech Crime?
- Digital Forensics.
Computer murk.
What happened, you get bored of it?
Not exactly.
You've seen what people tuck away on these.
Schemes and kill lists, kiddy porn.
It's not boring.
I'm old enough to remember when they walked around with that stuff just tucked away in their heads.
Right.
But now they can't help but entrusting it to their little companions.
These things absorb who we are.
They know everything about us.
If it's interesting, why leave Forensics?
The Rannoch case.
- Ian Rannoch?
- The child killings, yeah.
I was the one who cracked his souvenir folder.
- So you saw those pictures?
- Mm-hmm.
And the videos too.
Saw them all.
You see something like that, it changes you.
You either get defeated or you think...
You think, "Fuck me!
I've got to help stop that shit."
Yeah.
- I mean, out here in the field...
- What fucking field?
You know what I mean.
Out here in the real world, you can genuinely prevent stuff, can't you?
You are young.
Maybe you're old?
Steady.
Thanks.
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes, boss.
Jo Powers has been found dead at her home in West London.
The veteran columnist had been at the centre of controversy over an article she'd written about disability rights activist Gwen Marbury.
The police have yet to confirm the cause...
It's just the first floor, first door on the...
- Starting early?
- I asked Nick to show me the CCTV.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
No one came in or out.
Just Jo and her husband all evening.
- And that one there?
- Rear patio.
- Bust for months by the looks of it.
- Someone could've come in through there.
They'd have to climb the fence, make it in and out, knowing the camera wasn't working, but yeah, could have happened.
Technically.
Okay, sorry.
You're keen to help.
- She just asked!
- Uh-huh.
Um...
So...
I'm collating every threat or insult levelled at Jo Powers over the previous 48 hours.
Say it is the husband.
That's a coincidence, isn't it?
Not really.
You've got everyone throwing a shit fit.
Stress levels in that household would've been through the roof.
That Internet stuff drifts off like weather.
It's half hate.
They don't mean it.
The hate in a marriage, that's in 3D.
That's had work put into it.
That's sincere.
- Yeah.
I'm divorced.
- Um...
Husband's up and talking.
You're gonna love his alibi.
I heard Jo screaming from upstairs.
And when I ran in, she was walking 'round the room, stumbling.
She was clutching...
She was clutching her head as if she was in pain.
And then for a moment, she stopped.
And then it was like a seizure, she was... thrashing... clawing at her own skin.
And she turned...
She smashed her head...
onto the desk, hard.
Then she... she pushed me over.
That must've been when the bottle smashed.
Then she picked it up, and she started cutting herself.
Here.
She was gouging.
I tried to stop her.
But she did this.
Then she cut her throat.
I tried to stop her.
She cut her own throat with the glass!
Mutilated and then killed herself for no apparent reason?
I'd say the odds are against that.
He said it was like she was having a seizure.
Maybe there was something in the cake.
- The cake?
- It had "fucking bitch" iced on it.
- Could've been something in it.
- Like a drug?
- I don't know.
- That makes people kill themselves?
He was sort of convincing.
- He just doesn't seem the...
- Don't say "the type."
He's ordinary.
That is the type.
What, so he bounced her head off the desk?
- Blue.
- Held her steady enough...
- Blue.
- What?
- Toxicology are looking at the cake.
- Okay.
Meantime, let's drop in on the person that sent it.
Got the name this morning.
- You don't need to patronize me.
- We're doing what you want.
- Following another lead.
- That you think is a waste of time.
Picking along dead ends just to prove they're dead ends, that's most of the job.
I'm not saying it's a waste of time.
Just... you haven't had a chance to get bored of reality yet.
Okay, that was patronizing.
- Is this who sent the cake?
- Uh-huh.
- Have we checked her social feeds?
- I don't know.
"Death to Jo Powers." She posted that on Monday morning.
The bakery said that they're not meant to do obscenities, so I said it was for my sister, like just a joke thing, and they agreed, so...
Not cheap, their cakes.
With delivery, it was what, 80 quid?
Um...
Well, I didn't pay for it all myself.
- We all put a pound in each.
- We?
Yeah.
I'm on a mums and carers message board.
I held a sort of whip-round.
- You crowd-sourced the money?
- Yeah, if you like.
From 80 other people?
Look, I'm not...
I'm not being funny, okay?
I know she is dead.
But did you read what she had written?
How much do you think she got paid for spouting that horrible shit?
I don't know.
- I was just using my freedom of speech.
- To send a threatening message.
It was funny, okay?
And I can see if I'd done it myself, then that would be a bit weird, but I'm not mental.
You wished she was dead.
Well, uh...
No, no, I didn't.
- "Death to Jo Powers."
- That's just...
It's a... a hashtag game, you know, like "Death to..."
You insert the name of someone who's being an arsehole.
It's not... real.
It's a joke thing.
And who started it?
The hashtag?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I saw it somewhere.
Excuse us a moment.
Toxicology say the cake's clean.
They also said:
"Thanks, it was delicious."
We'll give her a caution.
Offensive Communications Act.
- Does that cover cakes?
- As far as she's concerned, it does.
What about the others who chipped in?
Are you going to tell them off, too?
- I didn't do anything.
- Start a thread about it.
Hospital's discharging the husband tomorrow.
We'll bring him in for questioning.
Blue?
We're arresting the husband.
Don't wallow in that.
The Internet will be pissed off with someone else today.
Tusk.
Everyone's pissed off with Tusk 'cause of that thing with the kid.
He's catching a shit storm on social media.
- Liza will be organising the cake now.
- Yeah.
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.
Whoo!
Where my ladies at?
- Yo!
Good show.
- Yeah, that's a good show, brother.
- I'm feeling my shit.
- You want some of that?
- What you smoking?
- Good shit, boy.
A'ight.
Damn!
Eyes on, eyes on, eyes on.
Don't stress.
It's legal here.
Pfft!
Keep forgetting.
Welcome to Europe, I guess.
- Kinda takes the joy out of it.
- Tell me about it.
Careful!
You break it, you pay for it.
Always doing some bullshit.
Tusk?
Tusk?
Yo, yo!
We need some help over here!
- I got you.
- Get it out!
Get it out!
Get it out!
Call an ambulance!
Commencing.
- Did he say what it is?
- Nope.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
She's in here.
So I go in, and there's not just the wound from the glass.
There's a hole.
Dug in.
A bore hole, like a tiny tunnel.
So I follow it, you know, how deep does it go?
It goes all the way from her ear canal to deep in her brain.
Where I find this.
Nestled right in there.
Looks quite cosy.
- It's one of those bee things.
- An ADI.
An Autonomous Drone Insect from the Granular Project.
- How did it get in there?
- I'd say it burrowed in.
- Fuck me.
- That's not the worst part.
It crawled right through her dorsal posterior insula, which is basically the brain's pain centre.
You're talking agony off the scale.
- You'd do anything to make it stop.
- Even cut your own throat.
- Good afternoon.
- DCI Parke.
- TDC Blue Colson.
- Okay.
Thank you.
They're so fucking fancy-looking, these companies.
- Billions on branding.
- Well, they can afford it.
The whole ADI project's pretty much bankrolled by the government.
It's why so many people are paranoid about it.
Let me guess, this is some people on the Internet?
They reckon the government uses the bees to spy on us.
There's a schizophrenic world view.
Jesus, I didn't expect to find myself living in the future, but here I fucking well am.
- Karin Parke?
- Uh-huh.
Vanessa Dahl.
Please.
Follow me.
You're after information on our Project Swarm ADls?
That's right.
Any particular reason?
Yes.
Rasmus.
Rasmus Sjoberg.
- He heads Swarm.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Nice greenhouse.
- Yeah.
So, your bees, your ADis, talk me through them.
Colony Collapse Disorder.
We still don't know what's behind it.
Bees themselves were virtually extinct so what our ADis do is effectively stand in for them.
They're solar powered.
They don't need nectar.
But they pollinate flowers the same way.
They crawl inside, pollen sticks to their legs and gets brushed off the next flower they visit.
- Can they make honey?
- Uh...
No.
I was joking.
How do they know where the flowers even are?
I mean...
Well, they have a sensor.
Like a... camera?
No.
Just a basic visual sensor.
You see, they need rudimentary pattern recognition in order to locate compatible flora and navigate.
- They navigate?
- Yes.
You don't...
I don't know... steer them?
They're autonomous.
That's right, isn't it?
They make their own decisions.
They look after themselves.
Yes.
You see, the ADis cover the whole of the UK.
We couldn't command each one individually ourselves.
It's just not logistically possible.
No.
We simply set the behaviour and leave them to it.
They even construct these hives themselves.
They reproduce...
- They reproduce?
- Yes.
Each hive is a replication point.
- It's like a 3D printer, basically.
- Exactly.
They create duplicates of themselves, create more hives and spread out exponentially.
- Cover the country.
- Maybe you should work here.
Yeah, well, I read up on it.
It's impressive.
It is.
It's just a shame it's necessary.
The alternative would have been environmental catastrophe.
Bees were dying out.
So, what is it that brings you here?
We think one of your ADis may be involved in an unexplained death.
Sorry?
A death?
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
Yeah.
It's one of ours.
But, look, these are not designed to...
Kill people?
I'd hope not.
Could it have malfunctioned somehow?
No.
I mean, when they do malfunction...
It happens, but then they just break, they just hit the ground.
What if someone hacked one and then they found a way of controlling it?
That's impossible.
You see, it's got military-grade encryption, and you would need a diagnostic controller, which is also encrypted.
So I would say the likelihood is...
I don't know what he's saying, but it's not the same as "impossible."
This is every hive we have online.
See...
These are the hives in the building here.
- How many bees per hive?
- Around 4,000.
- It's like air traffic control.
- Yeah.
Is that the search input?
- Yeah, but, uh... you'd need...
- Sorry.
Jo Powers' postcode.
Is that who this is about?
- You said you get some malfunctions?
- A fair few, yes.
They smack into a car or something.
We even had people trap them.
You know, put them in the microwave for YouTube videos.
And this logs any that drop off the system?
Logs everything, yes.
Did you lose any around here on Monday evening?
Well, I can check.
Just one.
Went out at 1903 hours.
Here, I can replay.
There.
- That's odd.
- What's odd?
When they pass between hives, they switch from one jurisdiction to another.
- It's, you know, like a...
- It's like a phone between cell masts?
Exactly.
It tried to do that, but there was nothing to switch to.
Unless someone spoofed a hive and then they've used that to commandeer your ADI.
No, you would need a diagnostic controller to do that.
What's the range on one of those?
Ten, 20 metres, perhaps.
So whoever was controlling it would have to be no more than 20 metres away.
- Outside the house.
- Yeah.
Sitting in a car, even.
- Can you trace back who did this?
- Yes.
I-I'm already trying to do that.
Uh...
You know what?
Uh...
It would be easier without an audience.
Okay.
You two swap numbers, keep a line of communication.
Can you shut the whole thing down if need be... hypothetically speaking?
Even a short stoppage would damage the ecosystem, and we'd need approval from the Department of the Environment.
We'll need a list of any Granular staff that had access to that system, past or present.
Some were government employees.
Use a different font for those if it helps.
Bye.
Nick, that's a set of Granular personnel records.
Root out anyone interesting.
Maybe not just one.
Could be a group involved.
Technically we should refer this up to the NCA, but there's no fucking way they're taking this off me.
The NCA already knows about it.
What?
DCI Karin Parke?
- Yes.
- Shaun Li, National Crime Agency.
How come you're here?
There's been more than one.
This is Tusk, last night.
- Shit.
- They thought it was a fit.
Took him to the hospital.
He had to be anaesthetised to stop him mutilating himself.
X-ray seemed to indicate some kind of plaque or tumour in his brain so they popped him in the MRI.
Yeah.
Basically one big magnet.
Tore it right out of his head, through the eye socket.
Battered the ADI too.
Yours is more intact so I'm gonna need it for analysis.
It's evidence.
Two's a pattern.
It knocks any malfunction theory in the head.
- And they're similar victims.
- Similar?
Both in the middle of online shit storms.
Well, if you wanna kill someone, there's a million easier ways to do it.
Pull this off and you've done it from across the street.
No fingerprints, no DNA.
It's like wishing them dead.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Guys?
Come here.
Okay, so, um...
Jo Powers and Tusk, both were being kicked around the Internet for hours, but in both their cases, people were also tweeting their photos accompanied with this hashtag: #DeathTo.
- Like our friend the teacher.
- Right.
She didn't know where she'd first heard of it, but trace it back, and it looks like the first real use of the hashtag was last weekend.
- By who?
- Uh...
Looks like, um...
Looks like identical tweets from a set of duplicate bot accounts.
Um...
Automated.
It's like spam.
This is someone trying to seed the tag, you know?
Get it out there.
It's like bait.
This is someone wanting people to pick up on it.
Check out the senders' avatar photos.
Bees.
Shit.
Okay.
There's more.
So each tweet had a sort of instruction video attached to it.
- Uh-huh.
- There.
"Game of Consequences"?
It's like an unpopularity contest.
Pick someone you don't like and if enough other people choose the same name, then that's who gets targeted.
Here, watch.
GameofConsequences.
- One:
Pick a target.
- Oh, my God.
Two:
Post their name and photo with #DeathTo.
No.
Three:
Most popular target will be eliminated after 5 p.m. each day.
Four:
Game resets at midnight.
- Oh, no.
- Fuck.
Someone's holding a public ballot, bumping off the top person.
- Jesus, it's just mad.
- Yeah, and it's growing.
Day one. 63 people used the hashtag on Jo Powers, okay?
On day two, 223 used it on Tusk.
- Who's using it now?
- There's...
There's loads more people.
There's quite a few votes for the Chancellor.
- Yeah.
- Um...
But at number one... is 880 people using it on someone called Clara Meades.
- Who's she?
- Clara Meades.
Okay, um...
it looks like she was at a demo, and she took a selfie in front of a war memorial.
- Pretending to piss on it.
- Nice work, Clara.
Yeah, it's getting near the end of the vote, and her mentions are blowing up.
- Tusk isn't public knowledge yet?
- Um, no.
So people can't know the hashtag works.
They're using it to scare her.
- Yeah, but they're gonna get her killed.
- We need to get to her before five.
Yeah.
Pulling her citizens details.
You're not supposed to have access to that.
Yeah, I know.
Just getting her location.
There.
Hello?
Yeah, she is.
All right, all right, hold on.
Clara!
Police.
For you.
How did they get my number?
- Hello?
- Clara Meades?
This is DCI Karin Parke, Met Police.
Sorry to track you down like this, but we think you may be in danger.
Sorry, is this a joke?
Because all this stuff I'm getting is not funny.
I'm not joking.
Stay where you are until we get there.
And keep your windows closed.
I'm setting up a perimeter.
Call Rasmus, we need him across this.
- Rasmus?
- Hi, Blue.
I'm sending you a postcode and my GPS.
I need you to monitor the area.
Track my location and see if you get anything unusual, any rogue ADis, yeah?
Yeah, great, good.
Look, if they come back,
I think I can catch them.
I have basically set a trap.
So if they...
if they try it again, we've got them.
- Are you Batman?
- They only just rolled them out.
This'll turn every red light between here and there to green.
Fuck me.
If this is the NCA life, I should apply for a transfer.
Let's go.
We can take her here.
It's a safe house for terrorist informers usually.
Notargetsighted.
This is a police operation!
Everybody vacate their premises now.
Please leave...
- What's that?
- Someone's trying to break in.
- Rasmus?
- I just picked up an attempted breach.
Granular, they've got a breach.
- One ADI just went offline.
- Where?
- 800 metres from your location.
- That's outside our cordon.
If someone's trying to pilot it this way, they're gonna turn 'round the moment they see all these uniforms.
Clara Meades?
I'm Karin Parke.
Did you pack a bag?
- Yeah, it's by the door.
- Right, let's go.
- Rasmus got a track on them?
- Not yet.
It's just precautionary, and it's only for one night.
Just gotta call in.
Hi.
No, not yet.
Hopefully never.
Granular are onto it.
Understood.
They housed a witness here for a while, Shaun said.
- Must've had kids.
- Have you got kids?
No.
No plans.
Up the stairs.
- Rasmus.
- Still nothing.
I can't trace it.
At least there's an en-suite.
- Is there nothing?
- No.
Whoever it is, they've masked their path well.
But that's not...
- Fuck.
- What?
- We just lost a whole hive.
- What does that mean?
Packed full of ADls.
Lost them all too.
- No...
Rasmus?
- There's thousands of them.
- Where?
- It's close to your location.
Rasmus, say that again.
Blue?
Blue.
It's close...
It's very close to you.
- Text it.
Text it to me.
- Rasmus.
Text it to...
Shit.
Do I get to redecorate?
Hello.
Hello.
No...
They've got the whole thing.
We're not in control anymore.
- They've got the whole thing.
- What are you doing?
- Fix it!
Can't you fix it?
- Shut up!
Shit.
We need to go.
Now.
Now!
Come on!
Go.
Go, go, go.
What's... what's happening?
Karin...
In there!
Go!
- Help me block the gap!
- Tell me what's going on!
You're scaring the shit out of me!
Oh!
Fuck!
The fan!
The fan!
Get it away from me!
Take your time.
I'd seen so many bodies before.
At crime scenes, in autopsies.
But I'd never seen anyone die.
And she was right there.
And can you describe the reaction of your colleague, Miss Colson?
Blue took it hard.
Uh-huh.
I'll shut it down.
We thought this was one guy, some Mr. Mystery in the vicinity, hijacking one ADI and personally controlling it.
But there were thousands of them.
- So it can't be that, right?
- No.
- One person can't fly hundreds at once.
- No.
Whoever this is, they're controlling the whole system.
- Do you know where from?
- Could be anywhere.
You need to fucking sort this out!
How do the ADis know who to target?
Could've found Clara the same way you did, the identity database?
No.
That just gives you the basic area.
We were in the room too, and they only went for her.
Facial recognition.
It's got to be facial recognition.
Which means the feed from their visual sensors, that's been accessed too.
- That's not possible.
- It's the only explanation.
Now look, the visual feed is secure between each ADI and the hive.
- There you go.
- Although... one of the government's conditions for backing the project...
Okay.
Enough.
We had to consent to permitting government security services access to the visual feed at times of quote, "increased national security."
Which is, as I understand it, pretty much all the time.
- I wasn't happy about it.
- Your lot went along with it.
That implies a greater range of options than your lot presented.
- So they are spying on us.
- This is all classified.
So what did you do, did you put in a back door and route it through GCHQ?
I mean, you do CCTV, you do traffic cams.
So what don't you have your fucking noses in?
Look, millions of those things flying around, propping up the ecosystem?
Well, that's great, save the planet, hallelujah!
Government's not going to pump billions into it just 'cause some lab coat says so, and it grabs 200 green votes.
They saw an opportunity to get more, they took it.
Total nationwide surveillance.
We tracked suspects for weeks in ways they couldn't dream of.
- We prevented bombings, mass shootings.
- By spying on the public.
And keeping them safe, which is what they want.
Clara Meades isn't safe, though, is she, Shaun?
Knowing what you knew, that might've helped us, but no, you kept your little fucking secret.
Okay!
The government's a cunt.
We knew that already.
Word's going to get out about Clara.
The public's going to wake up and find this mental assassination game going on, and soon we're going to have another body.
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.
We're totally locked out.
Totally blind.
If I can work out how they got in,
I might be able to reverse engineer some means of getting control back.
Do the ADis have a command log, on-board cache?
- Yeah, but that's encrypted.
- I'll need the key to that.
Been through the employee files, found some pols.
Bring them in.
Are you sitting in on these?
Granular interviews?
I've got to be somewhere.
It's7 :15.
Three deaths have now been linked to a hashtag circulating on social media.
Controversial journalist Jo Powers...
Goodmorning.
Have you posted the hashtag?
Is it real or an urban myth?
Well, thousands have been taking part, but how culpable are they?
People are dying, and we want to hear your thoughts.
Line seven, Liana...
This is real, this is happening...
I am happy to see her die.
It'snotthehashtagkillingthem.
That's just a game.
Like, if you're an arsehole, you deserve to be shamed.
Steve,linefive.
Yeah,butmy pointis, someone's gotta be top of the list, yeah?
So why not make it someone, you know, who deserves it, like a racist.
Withthehashtag,I'veseen celebrities, politicians, everyone.
This doesn't mean you have to sit there encouraging people to take part.
The point is this is already happening.
And people know that they can jump on board because nobody will ever know if they did or didn't.
Well, let's just pause for a moment and go back to that top five.
As we have been saying, the Chancellor is at number one, and I want us to think about that.
What does that tell us about the choice of the nation?
Well,I can'tsayI'm surprised that he's number one on the list.
He's been pretty unpopular for quite a long time now.
Butdoesthatwarrant his place on this list?
I'msayingpeople don't have to think too hard about it.
Now that's he's number one, that should generate more discussions and probably more votes.
Thanks for your time.
- No good?
- No good.
- Well, that's all fascinating...
- Shaun.
- But when do we shut it down?
- Tom.
Forgive me for being sceptical about your agency's basic competence.
- Tom.
- I'm on the fucking chopping block here.
Number one on the list.
The people's fucking choice!
Farrington's number four, and he's a paedophile.
- Suspected paedophile.
- He did it.
You know he did.
Let's just shut it down.
All social media.
The whole bloody Internet, pull the plug.
Just for today, at least until Thumbelina here pulls his finger out and he actually catches someone.
I wouldn't advise shutting things down.
- But it's possible?
We can do that?
- The whole of social media?
- Yeah.
Pull a North Korea on it.
- Well, yes, technically.
- Right, so push the off switch.
- That's not a good idea.
- No?
- Not in my opinion.
Right, okay.
It's just that speaking as a marked man, I beg to fucking differ.
If we shut it down, you'll still be number one.
Guaranteed to be, in fact.
He's right.
If we let it run on, at least there's a few hours.
Anything could happen before five o'clock.
The vote might change.
Yeah, and it might not.
What about that report?
The archive job?
From 1985, that memo about Farrington?
- That was over an unrelated matter.
- Leak it.
Tom, that would be a smear.
A head-to-toe shit smear, I fucking hope so.
He's in his 80s.
He's had his life.
Fuck him under the bus.
If I could suggest an alternative?
We move you to a safe location.
- Have you secured before five.
- Worked out well for you last night.
I'll show you.
This next one's Tess Wallender.
She was a junior.
So not much in the way of technical skills.
- Quit Granular for personal reasons.
- Nervous exhaustion, yeah.
Worked in Human Resources for Granular until she quit.
She took a photo of a guy on the Tube, said he'd harassed her, lewd comments or something.
Turned out he had a learning disability so she caught a ton of shit on...
On social media.
- Hello.
I'm DCI Karin Parke.
- Hi.
It was like having a whole weather system turn against me.
Just hate message after hate message, around the clock, all piling on.
It's hard to describe what that does to your head.
Suddenly there's a million invisible people, all talking about how they despise you.
It's like a mental illness.
Fuck.
What?
Shit.
I mean, hands up, I made a mistake, but the way people enjoyed kicking me, that's what got to me.
The casual fun they had and, um...
I just felt I couldn't go on.
Who found you?
Um...
Garrett, my flatmate.
He found me in the bath five minutes after I'd slashed them.
I mean, it's crazy.
I'm half-conscious.
He's dragging me out of the bath, and I'm telling him to get out, saying, "I'm naked."
He tied towels 'round my wrists, kept me conscious, kept stroking my hair till the ambulance arrived, talking to me.
Sort of weird.
I think he always had a thing for me.
And we worked at the same place so, you know... awkward.
- He worked at Granular?
- Yeah.
On the ADI thing.
- He was a real wunderkind.
Ultra-smart.
- What did you say his name was?
Garrett.
Garrett Scholes.
Garrett Scholes.
We need the whereabouts of a Garrett...
Scholes.
We were about to tell you.
It was buried in the on-board memory of the Jo Powers' ADI.
- What was?
- A manifesto.
A 98-page manifesto.
And check this out.
There's fucking selfies in it.
Sowe'regoodtogo?
Okay, that's the charge in place.
Okay.
Pull back.
We're all set here.
Detonate.
So, the plan is, we move you to an underground bunker, knock out every hive within a ten-mile radius.
And, what, just leave me there?
How long for?
It's a temporary measure.
How long till you take out all the hives?
There's 20,000, 30,000 of them.
That would take two years.
Two years, a victim a day.
More to the point, the environmental impact would...
Fuck that.
Shit!
- What?
- Fuck!
Stay back, stay back!
Get back!
Go, go, go!
Get away!
For fuck's sake, move!
What's your Plan B?
He was on the original employee roster, but we discounted him.
He left the country six months ago.
We thought we were looking for someone nearby.
Run a full trace on him.
Everything we can find.
Lunatic with production values, that's the worst kind.
"Thanks to the technological revolution,"
we have the power to rage and accuse, spout bile without consequence.
Only by being forced to recognize the power technology grants us,
"to acknowledge individual responsibility..."
Is it all like this?
He likens the population to insects, says we revel in cruelty, that it's a weakness that should be bred out of us.
Recurrent theme is he wants people to face the consequences of what they say and do.
- Wants to force that on them.
- The whole thing's a moral lesson?
He wanted us to find this and spread it about.
Well, fuck him.
Fuck.
Shit.
Karin.
Karin.
He's messed up.
He's put this document together himself, right?
His author name's in the metadata.
But he stripped out everything else, so we don't know when he's written it, for example.
Mm-hmm.
Most of the photos are clipart off the Internet, except this one.
- The selfie.
- That's where he's screwed up.
He's taken it with his phone, and the phone left a geotag on the image.
- So you know where he took this?
- I know precisely where.
He's here and Granular HQ is there.
- Armed police!
Stay down!
- Armed police!
Armed police!
Stay where you are!
Armed police!
Show yourselves!
Move!
Left.
- Clear!
- Clear!
Clear!
Lifestyles of the rich and famous.
There.
The forge.
Nice one.
Half the drives I sifted in forensics had scorch marks on 'em.
- What do you think?
- Yeah.
Looks like his toolkit.
- You can use it?
- Pretty much the key to the door.
So you can get control back?
Send the deactivation?
Well, I've got his source code.
- I should be able to bounce him out.
- Be quick.
Key to the door?
Our guy doesn't seem the type to leave keys lying around.
Well, I'm in.
Okay.
Deactivate her.
- Yeah, I need to repair permissions.
- Fucking hell.
That's weird.
What's weird?
- Time's ticking.
- That file.
Wasn't there before.
- This file?
- Yeah.
What is it?
- Blue?
- I think they're IMEI numbers.
What does that mean?
Every phone, every device has a unique number, an IMEI number.
It tethers it to a unique user.
- Yeah.
- But I can check, just... reverse lookup.
Take it easy.
Who are these people?
I don't know.
There's 387,000 of them.
Are these IDs your spooks have been collecting?
- No!
Are you ready yet?
- Yeah, almost there.
Wait.
Wait.
What was the name of that teacher?
Hate cake.
- Liza.
Liza Bahar.
- Liza Bahar.
Fuck's sake.
This is a list of everyone who's used the hashtag.
What?
Everyone who took part in the Game of Consequences.
They've hoovered up their ID from GCHQ by the looks of it.
That backdoor worked both ways, it seems.
- See if I'm on there.
- What?
I posted the tag earlier with Scholes' face.
- Just trying to get a reaction from him.
- Yeah, yeah, almost there.
Yeah, you're there.
Almost there.
Why has he collected everyone who took part?
I mean...
Okay.
I'm ready.
- Shit.
- Run it now.
No.
Think.
He left us a trail.
- Oh, come on.
- That photo with the whereabouts, it's too big a mistake for him.
He knew we'd do this.
- Now we're shutting it down, all right?
- And maybe that'll trigger some endgame, something to do with that list.
What if those are his real targets?
The people on the list.
Everyone who took part.
Consequences.
The hate figures were the bait.
The players are the target.
- Run the deact command.
- Now just wait a minute, okay?
- Run it.
- No!
Yeah.
Yeah, it worked.
Sorry, but that needed doing.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?
No.
No.
- Fuck!
- No.
Shit.
Oh, no.
There's...
We're all tragically familiar with the rest of the events of that week.
And we need no reminding of the sheer scale of the loss of life that followed.
No.
No, we don't.
And what became of Ms. Colson?
I think she blamed herself.
No.
I know she did.
She felt she'd followed his breadcrumb trail and sprung the whole thing.
She left the force.
I didn't hear from her.
Rang her, tried emailing, but no response.
Then, um...
About four months later, they found her things.
On a beach.
With a note.
She killed herself?
That's the base theory, yes.
Ms Parke, I would like to commend you for sharing your testimony and your time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Señor.
- Gracias.
- Gracias.
They're ready now.
Perhaps we could begin with your earliest recollections of the events of last May.
Well, I first got involved on the 15th.
Could you move the microphone a little closer?
Here?
I first got involved on the 15th.
Chancellor Tom Pickering has defended the government's stance on disability benefits as outrage over the death of so-called "Wheelchair Martyr" Gwen Marbury grows.
More than 20,000 people have signed a petition demanding the sacking of newspaper columnist Jo Powers following her controversial article about Gwen Marbury.
Conservationists have announced another extinction.
The Siberian crane has died out following an unprecedented reduction in its wetland habitat.
And the honeybee-mimicking drone insects known as ADIs have been activated for their second summer.
Hope you're ashamed of yourself.
- Bitch.
- Pleasure's all mine.
Yo Powers?
Jo Powers.
Whatever's in there, will it detonate?
That's from bakery.
For you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Hello, darling!
Creative, your well-wishers.
Don't eat it.
It's a cake.
That's its job.
I'm going to have a bath.
* Sail away *
* Sail away, sail away, sail away *
* From Bissau to Palau in the shade of Avalon *
* From Fiji to Tiree and the Isles of Ebony *
* From Peru to Cebu, hear the power of Babylon *
* From Bali to Cali... *
Ah!
Grammy-award-winning rapper Tusk is still with us.
Now, Tusk, there are loads of online videos of people trying to emulate you, but this is our favourite.
Take a look at this.
It's a young chap called Aaron Sheen.
He's nine years old.
That is one goofy-looking kid.
Not a good dancer.
He's nine years old!
Come on, he's a pretty good dancer.
That young motherfucker can't dance for shit.
He should probably just give up now, actually.
Don't hate on me for keeping it real.
That's a goofy little motherfucker, and he can't dance for shit.
He is a big fan, Tusk.
Don't hate on your boy.
Everybody's got to start somewhere.
Start somewhere?
I looked better than that...
- DCI Parke?
- No press.
No, I'm not press.
Um...
TDC Blue Colson.
I'm your shadow.
My shadow?
They said...
Sorry.
Call me Karin.
- Did you say your name was...?
- Blue.
- B-l-u-e, Blue?
- Yeah.
It's not a nickname.
- My dad liked the sound of it.
- Uh-huh.
- Seen a body before?
- A couple.
- On video, I mean.
- Boss?
This is Blue.
She's my shadow.
- DS Nick Shelton.
- What've we got?
- Jo Powers.
- As in...
As in actual Jo Powers.
Saw something she wrote the other day about the wheelchair woman.
Clickbait piece.
Pissed people off.
That article was fucking horrendous.
Even I signed the petition.
To get her sacked.
Come on.
Neighbours heard her screaming and called it in.
Hell of a struggle.
Anyone else at home?
Husband.
Found slashed across the stomach.
- By her?
- Don't know.
He was unconscious.
They've taken him to St. Columbus.
Her mentions are still pouring in.
Restraining bolt's in place.
- No other points of entry?
- No.
But the outside's ringed with CCTV.
- We got the code for the cams?
- Uh-huh.
Okay, then.
Check the recordings.
Bag that, send it to Toxicology.
Full autop for her, and we question the husband as soon as he wakes up.
Come on.
- You think it's the husband?
- I'm keeping options open.
Cutting the throat, that's unusual.
Thanks, chaps.
- But you do think he did it?
- Don't know anything yet.
These things are almost always either drink, drugs or domestic.
It is how it is.
- You driving home?
- No licence.
Never passed.
I'm sort of waiting for driverless to go mainstream.
- Get in.
- No, honestly, I'll get the Tube.
- Get in.
- Oh.
Okay.
- So you were in Tech Crime?
- Digital Forensics.
Computer murk.
What happened, you get bored of it?
Not exactly.
You've seen what people tuck away on these.
Schemes and kill lists, kiddy porn.
It's not boring.
I'm old enough to remember when they walked around with that stuff just tucked away in their heads.
Right.
But now they can't help but entrusting it to their little companions.
These things absorb who we are.
They know everything about us.
If it's interesting, why leave Forensics?
The Rannoch case.
- Ian Rannoch?
- The child killings, yeah.
I was the one who cracked his souvenir folder.
- So you saw those pictures?
- Mm-hmm.
And the videos too.
Saw them all.
You see something like that, it changes you.
You either get defeated or you think...
You think, "Fuck me!
I've got to help stop that shit."
Yeah.
- I mean, out here in the field...
- What fucking field?
You know what I mean.
Out here in the real world, you can genuinely prevent stuff, can't you?
You are young.
Maybe you're old?
Steady.
Thanks.
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes, boss.
Jo Powers has been found dead at her home in West London.
The veteran columnist had been at the centre of controversy over an article she'd written about disability rights activist Gwen Marbury.
The police have yet to confirm the cause...
It's just the first floor, first door on the...
- Starting early?
- I asked Nick to show me the CCTV.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
No one came in or out.
Just Jo and her husband all evening.
- And that one there?
- Rear patio.
- Bust for months by the looks of it.
- Someone could've come in through there.
They'd have to climb the fence, make it in and out, knowing the camera wasn't working, but yeah, could have happened.
Technically.
Okay, sorry.
You're keen to help.
- She just asked!
- Uh-huh.
Um...
So...
I'm collating every threat or insult levelled at Jo Powers over the previous 48 hours.
Say it is the husband.
That's a coincidence, isn't it?
Not really.
You've got everyone throwing a shit fit.
Stress levels in that household would've been through the roof.
That Internet stuff drifts off like weather.
It's half hate.
They don't mean it.
The hate in a marriage, that's in 3D.
That's had work put into it.
That's sincere.
- Yeah.
I'm divorced.
- Um...
Husband's up and talking.
You're gonna love his alibi.
I heard Jo screaming from upstairs.
And when I ran in, she was walking 'round the room, stumbling.
She was clutching...
She was clutching her head as if she was in pain.
And then for a moment, she stopped.
And then it was like a seizure, she was... thrashing... clawing at her own skin.
And she turned...
She smashed her head...
onto the desk, hard.
Then she... she pushed me over.
That must've been when the bottle smashed.
Then she picked it up, and she started cutting herself.
Here.
She was gouging.
I tried to stop her.
But she did this.
Then she cut her throat.
I tried to stop her.
She cut her own throat with the glass!
Mutilated and then killed herself for no apparent reason?
I'd say the odds are against that.
He said it was like she was having a seizure.
Maybe there was something in the cake.
- The cake?
- It had "fucking bitch" iced on it.
- Could've been something in it.
- Like a drug?
- I don't know.
- That makes people kill themselves?
He was sort of convincing.
- He just doesn't seem the...
- Don't say "the type."
He's ordinary.
That is the type.
What, so he bounced her head off the desk?
- Blue.
- Held her steady enough...
- Blue.
- What?
- Toxicology are looking at the cake.
- Okay.
Meantime, let's drop in on the person that sent it.
Got the name this morning.
- You don't need to patronize me.
- We're doing what you want.
- Following another lead.
- That you think is a waste of time.
Picking along dead ends just to prove they're dead ends, that's most of the job.
I'm not saying it's a waste of time.
Just... you haven't had a chance to get bored of reality yet.
Okay, that was patronizing.
- Is this who sent the cake?
- Uh-huh.
- Have we checked her social feeds?
- I don't know.
"Death to Jo Powers." She posted that on Monday morning.
The bakery said that they're not meant to do obscenities, so I said it was for my sister, like just a joke thing, and they agreed, so...
Not cheap, their cakes.
With delivery, it was what, 80 quid?
Um...
Well, I didn't pay for it all myself.
- We all put a pound in each.
- We?
Yeah.
I'm on a mums and carers message board.
I held a sort of whip-round.
- You crowd-sourced the money?
- Yeah, if you like.
From 80 other people?
Look, I'm not...
I'm not being funny, okay?
I know she is dead.
But did you read what she had written?
How much do you think she got paid for spouting that horrible shit?
I don't know.
- I was just using my freedom of speech.
- To send a threatening message.
It was funny, okay?
And I can see if I'd done it myself, then that would be a bit weird, but I'm not mental.
You wished she was dead.
Well, uh...
No, no, I didn't.
- "Death to Jo Powers."
- That's just...
It's a... a hashtag game, you know, like "Death to..."
You insert the name of someone who's being an arsehole.
It's not... real.
It's a joke thing.
And who started it?
The hashtag?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I saw it somewhere.
Excuse us a moment.
Toxicology say the cake's clean.
They also said:
"Thanks, it was delicious."
We'll give her a caution.
Offensive Communications Act.
- Does that cover cakes?
- As far as she's concerned, it does.
What about the others who chipped in?
Are you going to tell them off, too?
- I didn't do anything.
- Start a thread about it.
Hospital's discharging the husband tomorrow.
We'll bring him in for questioning.
Blue?
We're arresting the husband.
Don't wallow in that.
The Internet will be pissed off with someone else today.
Tusk.
Everyone's pissed off with Tusk 'cause of that thing with the kid.
He's catching a shit storm on social media.
- Liza will be organising the cake now.
- Yeah.
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.
- Whoo!
- * Turn a penny to a grand *
* When I'm ready, rocking steady for my fans *
Where my ladies at?
- Yo!
Good show.
- Yeah, that's a good show, brother.
- I'm feeling my shit.
- You want some of that?
- What you smoking?
- Good shit, boy.
A'ight.
Damn!
Eyes on, eyes on, eyes on.
Don't stress.
It's legal here.
Pfft!
Keep forgetting.
Welcome to Europe, I guess.
- Kinda takes the joy out of it.
- Tell me about it.
Careful!
You break it, you pay for it.
Always doing some bullshit.
Tusk?
Tusk?
Yo, yo!
We need some help over here!
- I got you.
- Get it out!
Get it out!
Get it out!
Call an ambulance!
Commencing.
- Did he say what it is?
- Nope.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
She's in here.
So I go in, and there's not just the wound from the glass.
There's a hole.
Dug in.
A bore hole, like a tiny tunnel.
So I follow it, you know, how deep does it go?
It goes all the way from her ear canal to deep in her brain.
Where I find this.
Nestled right in there.
Looks quite cosy.
- It's one of those bee things.
- An ADI.
An Autonomous Drone Insect from the Granular Project.
- How did it get in there?
- I'd say it burrowed in.
- Fuck me.
- That's not the worst part.
It crawled right through her dorsal posterior insula, which is basically the brain's pain centre.
You're talking agony off the scale.
- You'd do anything to make it stop.
- Even cut your own throat.
- Good afternoon.
- DCI Parke.
- TDC Blue Colson.
- Okay.
Thank you.
They're so fucking fancy-looking, these companies.
- Billions on branding.
- Well, they can afford it.
The whole ADI project's pretty much bankrolled by the government.
It's why so many people are paranoid about it.
Let me guess, this is some people on the Internet?
They reckon the government uses the bees to spy on us.
There's a schizophrenic world view.
Jesus, I didn't expect to find myself living in the future, but here I fucking well am.
- Karin Parke?
- Uh-huh.
Vanessa Dahl.
Please.
Follow me.
You're after information on our Project Swarm ADIs?
That's right.
Any particular reason?
Yes.
Rasmus.
Rasmus Sjoberg.
- He heads Swarm.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Nice greenhouse.
- Yeah.
So, your bees, your ADIs, talk me through them.
Colony Collapse Disorder.
We still don't know what's behind it.
Bees themselves were virtually extinct so what our ADIs do is effectively stand in for them.
They're solar powered.
They don't need nectar.
but they pollinate flowers the same way.
They crawl inside, pollen sticks to their legs and gets brushed off the next flower they visit.
- Can they make honey?
- Uh...
No.
I was joking.
How do they know where the flowers even are?
I mean...
Well, they have a sensor.
Like a... camera?
No.
Just a basic visual sensor.
You see, they need rudimentary pattern recognition in order to locate compatible flora and navigate.
- They navigate?
- Yes.
You don't...
I don't know... steer them?
They're autonomous.
That's right, isn't it?
They make their own decisions.
They look after themselves.
Yes.
You see, the ADIs cover the whole of the UK.
We couldn't command each one individually ourselves.
It's just not logistically possible.
No.
We simply set the behaviour and leave them to it.
They even construct these hives themselves.
They reproduce...
- They reproduce?
- Yes.
Each hive is a replication point.
- It's like a 3D printer, basically.
- Exactly.
They create duplicates of themselves, create more hives and spread out exponentially.
- Cover the country.
- Maybe you should work here.
Yeah, well, I read up on it.
It's impressive.
It is.
It's just a shame it's necessary.
The alternative would have been environmental catastrophe.
Bees were dying out.
So, what is it that brings you here?
We think one of your ADIs may be involved in an unexplained death.
Sorry?
A death?
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
Yeah.
It's one of ours.
But, look, these are not designed to...
Kill people?
I'd hope not.
Could it have malfunctioned somehow?
No.
I mean, when they do malfunction...
It happens, but then they just break, they just hit the ground.
What if someone hacked one and then they found a way of controlling it?
That's impossible.
You see, it's got military-grade encryption, and you would need a diagnostic controller, which is also encrypted.
So I would say the likelihood is...
I don't know what he's saying, but it's not the same as "impossible."
This is every hive we have online.
See...
These are the hives in the building here.
- How many bees per hive?
- Around 4,000.
- It's like air traffic control.
- Yeah.
Is that the search input?
- Yeah, but, uh... you'd need...
- Sorry.
Jo Powers' postcode.
Is that who this is about?
- You said you get some malfunctions?
- A fair few, yes.
They smack into a car or something.
We even had people trap them.
You know, put them in the microwave for YouTube videos.
And this logs any that drop off the system?
Logs everything, yes.
Did you lose any around here on Monday evening?
Well, I can check.
Just one.
Went out at 1903 hours.
Here, I can replay.
There.
- That's odd.
- What's odd?
When they pass between hives, they switch from one jurisdiction to another.
- It's, you know, like a...
- It's like a phone between cell masts?
Exactly.
It tried to do that, but there was nothing to switch to.
Unless someone spoofed a hive and then they've used that to commandeer your ADI.
No, you would need a diagnostic controller to do that.
What's the range on one of those?
Ten, 20 metres, perhaps.
So whoever was controlling it would have to be no more than 20 metres away.
- Outside the house.
- Yeah.
Sitting in a car, even.
- Can you trace back who did this?
- Yes.
I-I'm already trying to do that.
Uh...
You know what?
Uh...
It would be easier without an audience.
Okay.
You two swap numbers, keep a line of communication.
Can you shut the whole thing down if need be... hypothetically speaking?
Even a short stoppage would damage the ecosystem, and we'd need approval from the Department of the Environment.
We'll need a list of any Granular staff that had access to that system, past or present.
Some were government employees.
Use a different font for those if it helps.
Bye.
Nick, that's a set of Granular personnel records.
Root out anyone interesting.
Maybe not just one.
Could be a group involved.
Technically we should refer this up to the NCA, but there's no fucking way they're taking this off me.
The NCA already knows about it.
What?
DCI Karin Parke?
- Yes.
- Shaun Li, National Crime Agency.
How come you're here?
There's been more than one.
This is Tusk, last night.
- Shit.
- They thought it was a fit.
Took him to the hospital.
He had to be anaesthetised to stop him mutilating himself.
X-ray seemed to indicate some kind of plaque or tumour in his brain so they popped him in the MRI.
Yeah.
Basically one big magnet.
Tore it right out of his head, through the eye socket.
Battered the ADI too.
Yours is more intact so I'm gonna need it for analysis.
It's evidence.
Two's a pattern.
It knocks any malfunction theory in the head.
- And they're similar victims.
- Similar?
Both in the middle of online shit storms.
Well, if you wanna kill someone, there's a million easier ways to do it.
Pull this off and you've done it from across the street.
No fingerprints, no DNA.
It's like wishing them dead.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Guys?
Come here.
Okay, so, um...
Jo Powers and Tusk, both were being kicked around the Internet for hours, but in both their cases, people were also tweeting their photos accompanied with this hashtag: #DeathTo.
- Like our friend the teacher.
- Right.
She didn't know where she'd first heard of it, but trace it back, and it looks like the first real use of the hashtag was last weekend.
- By who?
- Uh...
Looks like, um...
Looks like identical tweets from a set of duplicate bot accounts.
Um...
Automated.
It's like spam.
This is someone trying to seed the tag, you know?
Get it out there.
It's like bait.
This is someone wanting people to pick up on it.
Check out the senders' avatar photos.
Bees.
Shit.
Okay.
There's more.
So each tweet had a sort of instruction video attached to it.
- Uh-huh.
- There.
"Game of Consequences"?
It's like an unpopularity contest.
Pick someone you don't like and if enough other people choose the same name, then that's who gets targeted.
Here, watch.
Game of Consequences.
- One:
Pick a target.
- Oh, my God.
Two:
Post their name and photo with #DeathTo.
No.
Three:
Most popular target will be eliminated after 5 p.m. each day.
Four:
Game resets at midnight.
- Oh, no.
- Fuck.
Someone's holding a public ballot, bumping off the top person.
- Jesus, it's just mad.
- Yeah, and it's growing.
Day one. 63 people used the hashtag on Jo Powers, okay?
On day two, 223 used it on Tusk.
- Who's using it now?
- There's...
There's loads more people.
There's quite a few votes for the Chancellor.
- Yeah.
- Um...
But at number one... is 880 people using it on someone called Clara Meades.
- Who's she?
- Clara Meades.
Okay, um...
it looks like she was at a demo, and she took a selfie in front of a war memorial.
- Pretending to piss on it.
- Nice work, Clara.
Yeah, it's getting near the end of the vote, and her mentions are blowing up.
- Tusk isn't public knowledge yet?
- Um, no.
So people can't know the hashtag works.
They're using it to scare her.
- Yeah, but they're gonna get her killed.
- We need to get to her before five.
Yeah.
Pulling her citizens details.
You're not supposed to have access to that.
Yeah, I know.
Just getting her location.
There.
Hello?
Yeah, she is.
All right, all right, hold on.
Clara!
Police.
For you.
How did they get my number?
- Hello?
- Clara Meades?
This is DCI Karin Parke, Met Police.
Sorry to track you down like this, but we think you may be in danger.
Sorry, is this a joke?
Because all this stuff I'm getting is not funny.
I'm not joking.
Stay where you are until we get there.
And keep your windows closed.
I'm setting up a perimeter.
Call Rasmus, we need him across this.
- Rasmus?
- Hi, Blue.
I'm sending you a postcode and my GPS.
I need you to monitor the area.
Track my location and see if you get anything unusual, any rogue ADIs, yeah?
Yeah, great, good.
Look, if they come back,
I think I can catch them.
I have basically set a trap.
So if they...
if they try it again, we've got them.
- Are you Batman?
- They only just rolled them out.
This'll turn every red light between here and there to green.
Fuck me.
If this is the NCA life, I should apply for a transfer.
Let's go.
We can take her here.
It's a safe house for terrorist informers usually.
No target sighted.
This is a police operation!
Everybody vacate their premises now.
Please leave...
- What's that?
- Someone's trying to break in.
- Rasmus?
- I just picked up an attempted breach.
Granular, they've got a breach.
- One ADI just went offline.
- Where?
- 800 metres from your location.
- That's outside our cordon.
If someone's trying to pilot it this way, they're gonna turn 'round the moment they see all these uniforms.
Clara Meades?
I'm Karin Parke.
Did you pack a bag?
- Yeah, it's by the door.
- Right, let's go.
- Rasmus got a track on them?
- Not yet.
It's just precautionary, and it's only for one night.
Just gotta call in.
Hi.
No, not yet.
Hopefully never.
Granular are onto it.
Understood.
They housed a witness here for a while, Shaun said.
- Must've had kids.
- Have you got kids?
No.
No plans.
Up the stairs.
- Rasmus.
- Still nothing.
I can't trace it.
At least there's an en-suite.
- Is there nothing?
- No.
Whoever it is, they've masked their path well.
But that's not...
- Fuck.
- What?
- We just lost a whole hive.
- What does that mean?
Packed full of ADIs.
Lost them all too.
- No...
Rasmus?
- There's thousands of them.
- Where?
- It's close to your location.
Rasmus, say that again.
Blue?
Blue.
It's close...
It's very close to you.
Text it.
Text it to me.
Rasmus.
Text it to...
Shit.
Do I get to redecorate?
Hello.
Hello.
No...
They've got the whole thing.
We're not in control anymore.
- They've got the whole thing.
- What are you doing?
- Fix it!
Can't you fix it?
- Shut up!
Shit.
We need to go.
Now.
Now!
Come on!
Go.
Go, go, go.
What's... what's happening?
Karin...
In there!
Go!
- Help me block the gap!
- Tell me what's going on!
You're scaring the shit out of me!
Oh!
Fuck!
The fan!
The fan!
Get it away from me!
Take your time.
I'd seen so many bodies before.
At crime scenes, in autopsies.
But I'd never seen anyone die.
And she was right there.
And can you describe the reaction of your colleague, Miss Colson?
Blue took it hard.
Uh-huh.
I'll shut it down.
We thought this was one guy, some Mr. Mystery in the vicinity, hijacking one ADI and personally controlling it.
But there were thousands of them.
- So it can't be that, right?
- No.
- One person can't fly hundreds at once.
- No.
Whoever this is, they're controlling the whole system.
- Do you know where from?
- Could be anywhere.
You need to fucking sort this out!
How do the ADIs know who to target?
Could've found Clara the same way you did, the identity database?
No.
That just gives you the basic area.
We were in the room too, and they only went for her.
Facial recognition.
It's got to be facial recognition.
Which means the feed from their visual sensors, that's been accessed too.
- That's not possible.
- It's the only explanation.
Now look, the visual feed is secure between each ADI and the hive.
- There you go.
- Although... one of the government's conditions for backing the project...
Okay.
Enough.
We had to consent to permitting government security services access to the visual feed at times of quote, "increased national security."
Which is, as I understand it, pretty much all the time.
- I wasn't happy about it.
- Your lot went along with it.
That implies a greater range of options than your lot presented.
- So they are spying on us.
- This is all classified.
So what did you do, did you put in a back door and route it through GCHQ?
I mean, you do CCTV, you do traffic cams.
So what don't you have your fucking noses in?
Look, millions of those things flying around, propping up the ecosystem?
Well, that's great, save the planet, hallelujah!
Government's not going to pump billions into it just 'cause some lab coat says so, and it grabs 200 green votes.
They saw an opportunity to get more, they took it.
Total nationwide surveillance.
We tracked suspects for weeks in ways they couldn't dream of.
- We prevented bombings, mass shootings.
- By spying on the public.
And keeping them safe, which is what they want.
Clara Meades isn't safe, though, is she, Shaun?
Knowing what you knew, that might've helped us, but no, you kept your little fucking secret.
Okay!
The government's a cunt.
We knew that already.
Word's going to get out about Clara.
The public's going to wake up and find this mental assassination game going on, and soon we're going to have another body.
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.
We're totally locked out.
Totally blind.
If I can work out how they got in,
I might be able to reverse engineer some means of getting control back.
Do the ADIs have a command log, on-board cache?
- Yeah, but that's encrypted.
- I'll need the key to that.
Been through the employee files, found some pols.
Bring them in.
Are you sitting in on these?
Granular interviews?
I've got to be somewhere.
It's 7:15.
Three deaths have now been linked to a hashtag circulating on social media.
Controversial journalist Jo Powers...
Good morning.
Have you posted the hashtag?
Is it real or an urban myth?
Well, thousands have been taking part, but how culpable are they?
People are dying, and we want to hear your thoughts.
Line seven, Liana...
This is real, this is happening...
I am happy to see her die.
It's not the hashtag killing them.
That's just a game.
Like, if you're an arsehole, you deserve to be shamed.
Steve, line five.
Yeah, but my point is, someone's gotta be top of the list, yeah?
So why not make it someone, you know, who deserves it, like a racist.
With the hashtag, I've seen celebrities, politicians, everyone.
This doesn't mean you have to sit there encouraging people to take part.
The point is this is already happening.
And people know that they can jump onboard because nobody will ever know if they did or didn't.
Well, let's just pause for a moment and go back to that top five.
As we have been saying, the Chancellor is at number one, and I want us to think about that.
What does that tell us about the choice of the nation?
Well, I can't say I'm surprised that he's number one on the list.
He's been pretty unpopular for quite a long time now.
But does that warrant his place on this list?
I'm saying people don't have to think too hard about it.
Now that's he's number one, that should generate more discussions and probably more votes.
Thanks for your time.
- No good?
- No good.
- Well, that's all fascinating...
- Shaun.
- But when do we shut it down?
- Tom.
Forgive me for being sceptical about your agency's basic competence.
- Tom.
- I'm on the fucking chopping block here.
Number one on the list.
The people's fucking choice!
Farrington's number four, and he's a paedophile.
- Suspected paedophile.
- He did it.
You know he did.
Let's just shut it down.
All social media.
The whole bloody Internet, pull the plug.
Just for today, at least until Thumbelina here pulls his finger out and he actually catches someone.
I wouldn't advise shutting things down.
- But it's possible?
We can do that?
- The whole of social media?
- Yeah.
Pull a North Korea on it.
- Well, yes, technically.
- Right, so push the off switch.
- That's not a good idea.
- No?
- Not in my opinion.
Right, okay.
It's just that speaking as a marked man, I beg to fucking differ.
If we shut it down, you'll still be number one.
Guaranteed to be, in fact.
He's right.
If we let it run on, at least there's a few hours.
Anything could happen before five o'clock.
The vote might change.
Yeah, and it might not.
What about that report?
The archive job?
From 1985, that memo about Farrington?
- That was over an unrelated matter.
- Leak it.
Tom, that would be a smear.
A head-to-toe shit smear, I fucking hope so.
He's in his 80s.
He's had his life.
Fuck him under the bus.
If I could suggest an alternative?
We move you to a safe location.
- Have you secured before five.
- Worked out well for you last night.
I'll show you.
This next one's Tess Wallender.
She was a junior.
So not much in the way of technical skills.
- Quit Granular for personal reasons.
- Nervous exhaustion, yeah.
Worked in Human Resources for Granular until she quit.
She took a photo of a guy on the Tube, said he'd harassed her, lewd comments or something.
Turned out he had a learning disability so she caught a ton of shit on...
On social media.
- Hello.
I'm DCI Karin Parke.
- Hi.
It was like having a whole weather system turn against me.
Just hate message after hate message, around the clock, all piling on.
It's hard to describe what that does to your head.
Suddenly there's a million invisible people, all talking about how they despise you.
It's like a mental illness.
Fuck.
What?
Shit.
I mean, hands up, I made a mistake, but the way people enjoyed kicking me, that's what got to me.
The casual fun they had and, um...
I just felt I couldn't go on.
Who found you?
Um...
Garrett, my flatmate.
He found me in the bath five minutes after I'd slashed them.
I mean, it's crazy.
I'm half-conscious.
He's dragging me out of the bath, and I'm telling him to get out, saying, "I'm naked."
He tied towels 'round my wrists, kept me conscious, kept stroking my hair till the ambulance arrived, talking to me.
Sort of weird.
I think he always had a thing for me.
And we worked at the same place so, you know... awkward.
- He worked at Granular?
- Yeah.
On the ADI thing.
- He was a real wunderkind.
Ultra-smart.
- What did you say his name was?
Garrett.
Garrett Scholes.
Garrett Scholes.
We need the whereabouts of a Garrett...
Scholes.
We were about to tell you.
It was buried in the on-board memory of the Jo Powers' ADI.
- What was?
- A manifesto.
A 98-page manifesto.
And check this out.
There's fucking selfies in it.
So we're good to go?
Okay, that's the charge in place.
Okay.
Pull back.
We're all set here.
Detonate.
So, the plan is, we move you to an underground bunker, knock out every hive within a ten-mile radius.
And, what, just leave me there?
How long for?
It's a temporary measure.
How long till you take out all the hives?
There's 20,000, 30,000 of them.
That would take two years.
Two years, a victim a day.
More to the point, the environmental impact would...
Fuck that.
Shit!
- What?
- Fuck!
Stay back, stay back!
Get back!
Go, go, go!
Get away!
For fuck's sake, move!
What's your Plan B?
He was on the original employee roster, but we discounted him.
He left the country six months ago.
We thought we were looking for someone nearby.
Run a full trace on him.
Everything we can find.
Lunatic with production values, that's the worst kind.
"Thanks to the technological revolution, we have the power to rage and accuse, spout bile without consequence.
Only by being forced to recognize the power technology grants us, to acknowledge individual responsibility..."
Is it all like this?
He likens the population to insects, says we revel in cruelty, that it's a weakness that should be bred out of us.
Recurrent theme is he wants people to face the consequences of what they say and do.
- Wants to force that on them.
- The whole thing's a moral lesson?
He wanted us to find this and spread it about.
Well, fuck him.
Fuck.
Shit.
Karin.
Karin.
He's messed up.
He's put this document together himself, right?
His author name's in the metadata.
But he stripped out everything else, so we don't know when he's written it, for example.
Mm-hmm.
Most of the photos are clipart off the Internet, except this one.
- The selfie.
- That's where he's screwed up.
He's taken it with his phone, and the phone left a geotag on the image.
- So you know where he took this?
- I know precisely where.
He's here and Granular HQ is there.
- Armed police!
Stay down!
- Armed police!
Armed police!
Stay where you are!
Armed police!
Show yourselves!
Move!
Left.
- Clear!
- Clear!
Clear!
Lifestyles of the rich and famous.
There.
The forge.
Nice one.
Half the drives I sifted in forensics had scorch marks on 'em.
- What do you think?
- Yeah.
Looks like his toolkit.
- You can use it?
- Pretty much the key to the door.
So you can get control back?
Send the deactivation?
Well, I've got his source code.
- I should be able to bounce him out.
- Be quick.
Key to the door?
Our guy doesn't seem the type to leave keys lying around.
Well, I'm in.
Okay.
Deactivate her.
- Yeah, I need to repair permissions.
- Fucking hell.
That's weird.
What's weird?
- Time's ticking.
- That file.
Wasn't there before.
- This file?
- Yeah.
What is it?
- Blue?
- I think they're IMEI numbers.
What does that mean?
Every phone, every device has a unique number, an IMEI number.
It tethers it to a unique user.
- Yeah.
- But I can check, just... reverse lookup.
Take it easy.
Who are these people?
I don't know.
There's 387,000 of them.
Are these IDs your spooks have been collecting?
- No!
Are you ready yet?
- Yeah, almost there.
Wait.
Wait.
What was the name of that teacher?
Hate cake.
- Liza.
Liza Bahar.
- Liza Bahar.
Fuck's sake.
This is a list of everyone who's used the hashtag.
What?
Everyone who took part in the Game of Consequences.
They've hoovered up their ID from GCHQ by the looks of it.
That backdoor worked both ways, it seems.
- See if I'm on there.
- What?
I posted the tag earlier with Scholes' face.
- Just trying to get a reaction from him.
- Yeah, yeah, almost there.
Yeah, you're there.
Almost there.
Why has he collected everyone who took part?
I mean...
Okay.
I'm ready.
- Shit.
- Run it now.
No.
Think.
He left us a trail.
- Oh, come on.
- That photo with the whereabouts, it's too big a mistake for him.
He knew we'd do this.
- Now we're shutting it down, all right?
- And maybe that'll trigger some endgame, something to do with that list.
What if those are his real targets?
The people on the list.
Everyone who took part.
Consequences.
The hate figures were the bait.
The players are the target.
- Run the deact command.
- Now just wait a minute, okay?
- Run it.
- No!
Yeah.
Yeah, it worked.
Sorry, but that needed doing.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?
No.
No.
- Fuck!
- No.
Shit.
Oh, no.
* Follow me *
* I'll show you the way *

We're all tragically familiar with the rest of the events of that week.
And we need no reminding of the sheer scale of the loss of life that followed.
No.
No, we don't.
And what became of Ms. Colson?
I think she blamed herself.
No.
I know she did.
She felt she'd followed his breadcrumb trail and sprung the whole thing.
She left the force.
I didn't hear from her.
Rang her, tried emailing, but no response.
Then, um...
About four months later, they found her things.
On a beach.
With a note.
She killed herself?
That's the base theory, yes.
Ms Parke, I would like to commend you for sharing your testimony and your time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Señor.
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

They're ready now.
Perhaps we could begin with your earliest recollections of the events of last May.
Well, I first got involved on the 15th.
Could you move the microphone a little closer?
Here?
I first got involved on the 15th.
Chancellor Tom Pickering has defended the government's stance on disability benefits as outrage over the death of so-called "Wheelchair Martyr" Gwen Marbury grows.
More than 20,000 people have signed a petition demanding the sacking of newspaper columnist Jo Powers following her controversial article about Gwen Marbury.
Conservationists have announced another extinction.
The Siberian crane has died out following an unprecedented reduction in its wetland habitat.
And the honeybee-mimicking drone insects known as ADIs have been activated for their second summer.
Hope you're ashamed of yourself.
- Bitch.
- Pleasure's all mine.
Yo Powers?
Jo Powers.
Whatever's in there, will it detonate?
That's from bakery.
For you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Hello, darling!
Creative, your well-wishers.
Don't eat it.
It's a cake.
That's its job.
I'm going to have a bath.
Ah!
Grammy-award-winning rapper Tusk is still with us.
Now, Tusk, there are loads of online videos of people trying to emulate you, but this is our favourite.
Take a look at this.
It's a young chap called Aaron Sheen.
He's nine years old.
That is one goofy-looking kid.
Not a good dancer.
He's nine years old!
Come on, he's a pretty good dancer.
That young motherfucker can't dance for shit.
He should probably just give up now, actually.
Don't hate on me for keeping it real.
That's a goofy little motherfucker, and he can't dance for shit.
He is a big fan, Tusk.
Don't hate on your boy.
Everybody's got to start somewhere.
Start somewhere?
I looked better than that...
- DCI Parke?
- No press.
No, I'm not press.
Um...
TDC Blue Colson.
I'm your shadow.
My shadow?
They said...
Sorry.
Call me Karin.
- Did you say your name was...?
- Blue.
- B-l-u-e, Blue?
- Yeah.
It's not a nickname.
- My dad liked the sound of it.
- Uh-huh.
- Seen a body before?
- A couple.
- On video, I mean.
- Boss?
This is Blue.
She's my shadow.
- DS Nick Shelton.
- What've we got?
- Jo Powers.
- As in...
As in actual Jo Powers.
Saw something she wrote the other day about the wheelchair woman.
Clickbait piece.
Pissed people off.
That article was fucking horrendous.
Even I signed the petition.
To get her sacked.
Come on.
Neighbours heard her screaming and called it in.
Hell of a struggle.
Anyone else at home?
Husband.
Found slashed across the stomach.
- By her?
- Don't know.
He was unconscious.
They've taken him to St. Columbus.
Her mentions are still pouring in.
Restraining bolt's in place.
- No other points of entry?
- No.
But the outside's ringed with CCTV.
- We got the code for the cams?
- Uh-huh.
Okay, then.
Check the recordings.
Bag that, send it to Toxicology.
Full autop for her, and we question the husband as soon as he wakes up.
Come on.
- You think it's the husband?
- I'm keeping options open.
Cutting the throat, that's unusual.
Thanks, chaps.
- But you do think he did it?
- Don't know anything yet.
These things are almost always either drink, drugs or domestic.
It is how it is.
- You driving home?
- No licence.
Never passed.
I'm sort of waiting for driverless to go mainstream.
- Get in.
- No, honestly, I'll get the Tube.
- Get in.
- Oh.
Okay.
- So you were in Tech Crime?
- Digital Forensics.
Computer murk.
What happened, you get bored of it?
Not exactly.
You've seen what people tuck away on these.
Schemes and kill lists, kiddy porn.
It's not boring.
I'm old enough to remember when they walked around with that stuff just tucked away in their heads.
Right.
But now they can't help but entrusting it to their little companions.
These things absorb who we are.
They know everything about us.
If it's interesting, why leave Forensics?
The Rannoch case.
- Ian Rannoch?
- The child killings, yeah.
I was the one who cracked his souvenir folder.
- So you saw those pictures?
- Mm-hmm.
And the videos too.
Saw them all.
You see something like that, it changes you.
You either get defeated or you think...
You think, "Fuck me!
I've got to help stop that shit."
Yeah.
- I mean, out here in the field...
- What fucking field?
You know what I mean.
Out here in the real world, you can genuinely prevent stuff, can't you?
You are young.
Maybe you're old?
Steady.
Thanks.
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes, boss.
Jo Powers has been found dead at her home in West London.
The veteran columnist had been at the centre of controversy over an article she'd written about disability rights activist Gwen Marbury.
The police have yet to confirm the cause...
It's just the first floor, first door on the...
- Starting early?
- I asked Nick to show me the CCTV.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
No one came in or out.
Just Jo and her husband all evening.
- And that one there?
- Rear patio.
- Bust for months by the looks of it.
- Someone could've come in through there.
They'd have to climb the fence, make it in and out, knowing the camera wasn't working, but yeah, could have happened.
Technically.
Okay, sorry.
You're keen to help.
- She just asked!
- Uh-huh.
Um...
So...
I'm collating every threat or insult levelled at Jo Powers over the previous 48 hours.
Say it is the husband.
That's a coincidence, isn't it?
Not really.
You've got everyone throwing a shit fit.
Stress levels in that household would've been through the roof.
That Internet stuff drifts off like weather.
It's half hate.
They don't mean it.
The hate in a marriage, that's in 3D.
That's had work put into it.
That's sincere.
- Yeah.
I'm divorced.
- Um...
Husband's up and talking.
You're gonna love his alibi.
I heard Jo screaming from upstairs.
And when I ran in, she was walking 'round the room, stumbling.
She was clutching...
She was clutching her head as if she was in pain.
And then for a moment, she stopped.
And then it was like a seizure, she was... thrashing... clawing at her own skin.
And she turned...
She smashed her head...
onto the desk, hard.
Then she... she pushed me over.
That must've been when the bottle smashed.
Then she picked it up, and she started cutting herself.
Here.
She was gouging.
I tried to stop her.
But she did this.
Then she cut her throat.
I tried to stop her.
She cut her own throat with the glass!
Mutilated and then killed herself for no apparent reason?
I'd say the odds are against that.
He said it was like she was having a seizure.
Maybe there was something in the cake.
- The cake?
- It had "fucking bitch" iced on it.
- Could've been something in it.
- Like a drug?
- I don't know.
- That makes people kill themselves?
He was sort of convincing.
- He just doesn't seem the...
- Don't say "the type."
He's ordinary.
That is the type.
What, so he bounced her head off the desk?
- Blue.
- Held her steady enough...
- Blue.
- What?
- Toxicology are looking at the cake.
- Okay.
Meantime, let's drop in on the person that sent it.
Got the name this morning.
- You don't need to patronize me.
- We're doing what you want.
- Following another lead.
- That you think is a waste of time.
Picking along dead ends just to prove they're dead ends, that's most of the job.
I'm not saying it's a waste of time.
Just... you haven't had a chance to get bored of reality yet.
Okay, that was patronizing.
- Is this who sent the cake?
- Uh-huh.
- Have we checked her social feeds?
- I don't know.
"Death to Jo Powers." She posted that on Monday morning.
The bakery said that they're not meant to do obscenities, so I said it was for my sister, like just a joke thing, and they agreed, so...
Not cheap, their cakes.
With delivery, it was what, 80 quid?
Um...
Well, I didn't pay for it all myself.
- We all put a pound in each.
- We?
Yeah.
I'm on a mums and carers message board.
I held a sort of whip-round.
- You crowd-sourced the money?
- Yeah, if you like.
From 80 other people?
Look, I'm not...
I'm not being funny, okay?
I know she is dead.
But did you read what she had written?
How much do you think she got paid for spouting that horrible shit?
I don't know.
- I was just using my freedom of speech.
- To send a threatening message.
It was funny, okay?
And I can see if I'd done it myself, then that would be a bit weird, but I'm not mental.
You wished she was dead.
Well, uh...
No, no, I didn't.
- "Death to Jo Powers."
- That's just...
It's a... a hashtag game, you know, like "Death to..."
You insert the name of someone who's being an arsehole.
It's not... real.
It's a joke thing.
And who started it?
The hashtag?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I saw it somewhere.
Excuse us a moment.
Toxicology say the cake's clean.
They also said:
"Thanks, it was delicious."
We'll give her a caution.
Offensive Communications Act.
- Does that cover cakes?
- As far as she's concerned, it does.
What about the others who chipped in?
Are you going to tell them off, too?
- I didn't do anything.
- Start a thread about it.
Hospital's discharging the husband tomorrow.
We'll bring him in for questioning.
Blue?
We're arresting the husband.
Don't wallow in that.
The Internet will be pissed off with someone else today.
Tusk.
Everyone's pissed off with Tusk 'cause of that thing with the kid.
He's catching a shit storm on social media.
- Liza will be organising the cake now.
- Yeah.
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.
Whoo!
Where my ladies at?
- Yo!
Good show.
- Yeah, that's a good show, brother.
- I'm feeling my shit.
- You want some of that?
- What you smoking?
- Good shit, boy.
A'ight.
Damn!
Eyes on, eyes on, eyes on.
Don't stress.
It's legal here.
Pfft!
Keep forgetting.
Welcome to Europe, I guess.
- Kinda takes the joy out of it.
- Tell me about it.
Careful!
You break it, you pay for it.
Always doing some bullshit.
Tusk?
Tusk?
Yo, yo!
We need some help over here!
- I got you.
- Get it out!
Get it out!
Get it out!
Call an ambulance!
Commencing.
- Did he say what it is?
- Nope.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
She's in here.
So I go in, and there's not just the wound from the glass.
There's a hole.
Dug in.
A bore hole, like a tiny tunnel.
So I follow it, you know, how deep does it go?
It goes all the way from her ear canal to deep in her brain.
Where I find this.
Nestled right in there.
Looks quite cosy.
- It's one of those bee things.
- An ADI.
An Autonomous Drone Insect from the Granular Project.
- How did it get in there?
- I'd say it burrowed in.
- Fuck me.
- That's not the worst part.
It crawled right through her dorsal posterior insula, which is basically the brain's pain centre.
You're talking agony off the scale.
- You'd do anything to make it stop.
- Even cut your own throat.
- Good afternoon.
- DCI Parke.
- TDC Blue Colson.
- Okay.
Thank you.
They're so fucking fancy-looking, these companies.
- Billions on branding.
- Well, they can afford it.
The whole ADI project's pretty much bankrolled by the government.
It's why so many people are paranoid about it.
Let me guess, this is some people on the Internet?
They reckon the government uses the bees to spy on us.
There's a schizophrenic world view.
Jesus, I didn't expect to find myself living in the future, but here I fucking well am.
- Karin Parke?
- Uh-huh.
Vanessa Dahl.
Please.
Follow me.
You're after information on our Project Swarm ADIs?
That's right.
Any particular reason?
Yes.
Rasmus.
Rasmus Sjoberg.
- He heads Swarm.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Nice greenhouse.
- Yeah.
So, your bees, your ADIs, talk me through them.
Colony Collapse Disorder.
We still don't know what's behind it.
Bees themselves were virtually extinct so what our ADIs do is effectively stand in for them.
They're solar powered.
They don't need nectar.
but they pollinate flowers the same way.
They crawl inside, pollen sticks to their legs and gets brushed off the next flower they visit.
- Can they make honey?
- Uh...
No.
I was joking.
How do they know where the flowers even are?
I mean...
Well, they have a sensor.
Like a... camera?
No.
Just a basic visual sensor.
You see, they need rudimentary pattern recognition in order to locate compatible flora and navigate.
- They navigate?
- Yes.
You don't...
I don't know... steer them?
They're autonomous.
That's right, isn't it?
They make their own decisions.
They look after themselves.
Yes.
You see, the ADIs cover the whole of the UK.
We couldn't command each one individually ourselves.
It's just not logistically possible.
No.
We simply set the behaviour and leave them to it.
They even construct these hives themselves.
They reproduce...
- They reproduce?
- Yes.
Each hive is a replication point.
- It's like a 3D printer, basically.
- Exactly.
They create duplicates of themselves, create more hives and spread out exponentially.
- Cover the country.
- Maybe you should work here.
Yeah, well, I read up on it.
It's impressive.
It is.
It's just a shame it's necessary.
The alternative would have been environmental catastrophe.
Bees were dying out.
So, what is it that brings you here?
We think one of your ADIs may be involved in an unexplained death.
Sorry?
A death?
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
Yeah.
It's one of ours.
But, look, these are not designed to...
Kill people?
I'd hope not.
Could it have malfunctioned somehow?
No.
I mean, when they do malfunction...
It happens, but then they just break, they just hit the ground.
What if someone hacked one and then they found a way of controlling it?
That's impossible.
You see, it's got military-grade encryption, and you would need a diagnostic controller, which is also encrypted.
So I would say the likelihood is...
I don't know what he's saying, but it's not the same as "impossible."
This is every hive we have online.
See...
These are the hives in the building here.
- How many bees per hive?
- Around 4,000.
- It's like air traffic control.
- Yeah.
Is that the search input?
- Yeah, but, uh... you'd need...
- Sorry.
Jo Powers' postcode.
Is that who this is about?
- You said you get some malfunctions?
- A fair few, yes.
They smack into a car or something.
We even had people trap them.
You know, put them in the microwave for YouTube videos.
And this logs any that drop off the system?
Logs everything, yes.
Did you lose any around here on Monday evening?
Well, I can check.
Just one.
Went out at 1903 hours.
Here, I can replay.
There.
- That's odd.
- What's odd?
When they pass between hives, they switch from one jurisdiction to another.
- It's, you know, like a...
- It's like a phone between cell masts?
Exactly.
It tried to do that, but there was nothing to switch to.
Unless someone spoofed a hive and then they've used that to commandeer your ADI.
No, you would need a diagnostic controller to do that.
What's the range on one of those?
Ten, 20 metres, perhaps.
So whoever was controlling it would have to be no more than 20 metres away.
- Outside the house.
- Yeah.
Sitting in a car, even.
- Can you trace back who did this?
- Yes.
I-I'm already trying to do that.
Uh...
You know what?
Uh...
It would be easier without an audience.
Okay.
You two swap numbers, keep a line of communication.
Can you shut the whole thing down if need be... hypothetically speaking?
Even a short stoppage would damage the ecosystem, and we'd need approval from the Department of the Environment.
We'll need a list of any Granular staff that had access to that system, past or present.
Some were government employees.
Use a different font for those if it helps.
Bye.
Nick, that's a set of Granular personnel records.
Root out anyone interesting.
Maybe not just one.
Could be a group involved.
Technically we should refer this up to the NCA, but there's no fucking way they're taking this off me.
The NCA already knows about it.
What?
DCI Karin Parke?
- Yes.
- Shaun Li, National Crime Agency.
How come you're here?
There's been more than one.
This is Tusk, last night.
- Shit.
- They thought it was a fit.
Took him to the hospital.
He had to be anaesthetised to stop him mutilating himself.
X-ray seemed to indicate some kind of plaque or tumour in his brain so they popped him in the MRI.
Yeah.
Basically one big magnet.
Tore it right out of his head, through the eye socket.
Battered the ADI too.
Yours is more intact so I'm gonna need it for analysis.
It's evidence.
Two's a pattern.
It knocks any malfunction theory in the head.
- And they're similar victims.
- Similar?
Both in the middle of online shit storms.
Well, if you wanna kill someone, there's a million easier ways to do it.
Pull this off and you've done it from across the street.
No fingerprints, no DNA.
It's like wishing them dead.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Guys?
Come here.
Okay, so, um...
Jo Powers and Tusk, both were being kicked around the Internet for hours, but in both their cases, people were also tweeting their photos accompanied with this hashtag: #DeathTo.
- Like our friend the teacher.
- Right.
She didn't know where she'd first heard of it, but trace it back, and it looks like the first real use of the hashtag was last weekend.
- By who?
- Uh...
Looks like, um...
Looks like identical tweets from a set of duplicate bot accounts.
Um...
Automated.
It's like spam.
This is someone trying to seed the tag, you know?
Get it out there.
It's like bait.
This is someone wanting people to pick up on it.
Check out the senders' avatar photos.
Bees.
Shit.
Okay.
There's more.
So each tweet had a sort of instruction video attached to it.
- Uh-huh.
- There.
"Game of Consequences"?
It's like an unpopularity contest.
Pick someone you don't like and if enough other people choose the same name, then that's who gets targeted.
Here, watch.
Game of Consequences.
- One:
Pick a target.
- Oh, my God.
Two:
Post their name and photo with #DeathTo.
No.
Three:
Most popular target will be eliminated after 5 p.m. each day.
Four:
Game resets at midnight.
- Oh, no.
- Fuck.
Someone's holding a public ballot, bumping off the top person.
- Jesus, it's just mad.
- Yeah, and it's growing.
Day one. 63 people used the hashtag on Jo Powers, okay?
On day two, 223 used it on Tusk.
- Who's using it now?
- There's...
There's loads more people.
There's quite a few votes for the Chancellor.
- Yeah.
- Um...
But at number one... is 880 people using it on someone called Clara Meades.
- Who's she?
- Clara Meades.
Okay, um...
it looks like she was at a demo, and she took a selfie in front of a war memorial.
- Pretending to piss on it.
- Nice work, Clara.
Yeah, it's getting near the end of the vote, and her mentions are blowing up.
- Tusk isn't public knowledge yet?
- Um, no.
So people can't know the hashtag works.
They're using it to scare her.
- Yeah, but they're gonna get her killed.
- We need to get to her before five.
Yeah.
Pulling her citizens details.
You're not supposed to have access to that.
Yeah, I know.
Just getting her location.
There.
Hello?
Yeah, she is.
All right, all right, hold on.
Clara!
Police.
For you.
How did they get my number?
- Hello?
- Clara Meades?
This is DCI Karin Parke, Met Police.
Sorry to track you down like this, but we think you may be in danger.
Sorry, is this a joke?
Because all this stuff I'm getting is not funny.
I'm not joking.
Stay where you are until we get there.
And keep your windows closed.
I'm setting up a perimeter.
Call Rasmus, we need him across this.
- Rasmus?
- Hi, Blue.
I'm sending you a postcode and my GPS.
I need you to monitor the area.
Track my location and see if you get anything unusual, any rogue ADIs, yeah?
Yeah, great, good.
Look, if they come back,
I think I can catch them.
I have basically set a trap.
So if they...
if they try it again, we've got them.
- Are you Batman?
- They only just rolled them out.
This'll turn every red light between here and there to green.
Fuck me.
If this is the NCA life, I should apply for a transfer.
Let's go.
We can take her here.
It's a safe house for terrorist informers usually.
No target sighted.
This is a police operation!
Everybody vacate their premises now.
Please leave...
- What's that?
- Someone's trying to break in.
- Rasmus?
- I just picked up an attempted breach.
Granular, they've got a breach.
- One ADI just went offline.
- Where?
- 800 metres from your location.
- That's outside our cordon.
If someone's trying to pilot it this way, they're gonna turn 'round the moment they see all these uniforms.
Clara Meades?
I'm Karin Parke.
Did you pack a bag?
- Yeah, it's by the door.
- Right, let's go.
- Rasmus got a track on them?
- Not yet.
It's just precautionary, and it's only for one night.
Just gotta call in.
Hi.
No, not yet.
Hopefully never.
Granular are onto it.
Understood.
They housed a witness here for a while, Shaun said.
- Must've had kids.
- Have you got kids?
No.
No plans.
Up the stairs.
- Rasmus.
- Still nothing.
I can't trace it.
At least there's an en-suite.
- Is there nothing?
- No.
Whoever it is, they've masked their path well.
But that's not...
- Fuck.
- What?
- We just lost a whole hive.
- What does that mean?
Packed full of ADIs.
Lost them all too.
- No...
Rasmus?
- There's thousands of them.
- Where?
- It's close to your location.
Rasmus, say that again.
Blue?
Blue.
It's close...
It's very close to you.
Text it.
Text it to me.
Rasmus.
Text it to...
Shit.
Do I get to redecorate?
Hello.
Hello.
No...
They've got the whole thing.
We're not in control anymore.
- They've got the whole thing.
- What are you doing?
- Fix it!
Can't you fix it?
- Shut up!
Shit.
We need to go.
Now.
Now!
Come on!
Go.
Go, go, go.
What's... what's happening?
Karin...
In there!
Go!
- Help me block the gap!
- Tell me what's going on!
You're scaring the shit out of me!
Oh!
Fuck!
The fan!
The fan!
Get it away from me!
Take your time.
I'd seen so many bodies before.
At crime scenes, in autopsies.
But I'd never seen anyone die.
And she was right there.
And can you describe the reaction of your colleague, Miss Colson?
Blue took it hard.
Uh-huh.
I'll shut it down.
We thought this was one guy, some Mr. Mystery in the vicinity, hijacking one ADI and personally controlling it.
But there were thousands of them.
- So it can't be that, right?
- No.
- One person can't fly hundreds at once.
- No.
Whoever this is, they're controlling the whole system.
- Do you know where from?
- Could be anywhere.
You need to fucking sort this out!
How do the ADIs know who to target?
Could've found Clara the same way you did, the identity database?
No.
That just gives you the basic area.
We were in the room too, and they only went for her.
Facial recognition.
It's got to be facial recognition.
Which means the feed from their visual sensors, that's been accessed too.
- That's not possible.
- It's the only explanation.
Now look, the visual feed is secure between each ADI and the hive.
- There you go.
- Although... one of the government's conditions for backing the project...
Okay.
Enough.
We had to consent to permitting government security services access to the visual feed at times of quote, "increased national security."
Which is, as I understand it, pretty much all the time.
- I wasn't happy about it.
- Your lot went along with it.
That implies a greater range of options than your lot presented.
- So they are spying on us.
- This is all classified.
So what did you do, did you put in a back door and route it through GCHQ?
I mean, you do CCTV, you do traffic cams.
So what don't you have your fucking noses in?
Look, millions of those things flying around, propping up the ecosystem?
Well, that's great, save the planet, hallelujah!
Government's not going to pump billions into it just 'cause some lab coat says so, and it grabs 200 green votes.
They saw an opportunity to get more, they took it.
Total nationwide surveillance.
We tracked suspects for weeks in ways they couldn't dream of.
- We prevented bombings, mass shootings.
- By spying on the public.
And keeping them safe, which is what they want.
Clara Meades isn't safe, though, is she, Shaun?
Knowing what you knew, that might've helped us, but no, you kept your little fucking secret.
Okay!
The government's a cunt.
We knew that already.
Word's going to get out about Clara.
The public's going to wake up and find this mental assassination game going on, and soon we're going to have another body.
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.
We're totally locked out.
Totally blind.
If I can work out how they got in,
I might be able to reverse engineer some means of getting control back.
Do the ADIs have a command log, on-board cache?
- Yeah, but that's encrypted.
- I'll need the key to that.
Been through the employee files, found some pols.
Bring them in.
Are you sitting in on these?
Granular interviews?
I've got to be somewhere.
It's 7:15.
Three deaths have now been linked to a hashtag circulating on social media.
Controversial journalist Jo Powers...
Good morning.
Have you posted the hashtag?
Is it real or an urban myth?
Well, thousands have been taking part, but how culpable are they?
People are dying, and we want to hear your thoughts.
Line seven, Liana...
This is real, this is happening...
I am happy to see her die.
It's not the hashtag killing them.
That's just a game.
Like, if you're an arsehole, you deserve to be shamed.
Steve, line five.
Yeah, but my point is, someone's gotta be top of the list, yeah?
So why not make it someone, you know, who deserves it, like a racist.
With the hashtag, I've seen celebrities, politicians, everyone.
This doesn't mean you have to sit there encouraging people to take part.
The point is this is already happening.
And people know that they can jump onboard because nobody will ever know if they did or didn't.
Well, let's just pause for a moment and go back to that top five.
As we have been saying, the Chancellor is at number one, and I want us to think about that.
What does that tell us about the choice of the nation?
Well, I can't say I'm surprised that he's number one on the list.
He's been pretty unpopular for quite a long time now.
But does that warrant his place on this list?
I'm saying people don't have to think too hard about it.
Now that's he's number one, that should generate more discussions and probably more votes.
Thanks for your time.
- No good?
- No good.
- Well, that's all fascinating...
- Shaun.
- But when do we shut it down?
- Tom.
Forgive me for being sceptical about your agency's basic competence.
- Tom.
- I'm on the fucking chopping block here.
Number one on the list.
The people's fucking choice!
Farrington's number four, and he's a paedophile.
- Suspected paedophile.
- He did it.
You know he did.
Let's just shut it down.
All social media.
The whole bloody Internet, pull the plug.
Just for today, at least until Thumbelina here pulls his finger out and he actually catches someone.
I wouldn't advise shutting things down.
- But it's possible?
We can do that?
- The whole of social media?
- Yeah.
Pull a North Korea on it.
- Well, yes, technically.
- Right, so push the off switch.
- That's not a good idea.
- No?
- Not in my opinion.
Right, okay.
It's just that speaking as a marked man, I beg to fucking differ.
If we shut it down, you'll still be number one.
Guaranteed to be, in fact.
He's right.
If we let it run on, at least there's a few hours.
Anything could happen before five o'clock.
The vote might change.
Yeah, and it might not.
What about that report?
The archive job?
From 1985, that memo about Farrington?
- That was over an unrelated matter.
- Leak it.
Tom, that would be a smear.
A head-to-toe shit smear, I fucking hope so.
He's in his 80s.
He's had his life.
Fuck him under the bus.
If I could suggest an alternative?
We move you to a safe location.
- Have you secured before five.
- Worked out well for you last night.
I'll show you.
This next one's Tess Wallender.
She was a junior.
So not much in the way of technical skills.
- Quit Granular for personal reasons.
- Nervous exhaustion, yeah.
Worked in Human Resources for Granular until she quit.
She took a photo of a guy on the Tube, said he'd harassed her, lewd comments or something.
Turned out he had a learning disability so she caught a ton of shit on...
On social media.
- Hello.
I'm DCI Karin Parke.
- Hi.
It was like having a whole weather system turn against me.
Just hate message after hate message, around the clock, all piling on.
It's hard to describe what that does to your head.
Suddenly there's a million invisible people, all talking about how they despise you.
It's like a mental illness.
Fuck.
What?
Shit.
I mean, hands up, I made a mistake, but the way people enjoyed kicking me, that's what got to me.
The casual fun they had and, um...
I just felt I couldn't go on.
Who found you?
Um...
Garrett, my flatmate.
He found me in the bath five minutes after I'd slashed them.
I mean, it's crazy.
I'm half-conscious.
He's dragging me out of the bath, and I'm telling him to get out, saying, "I'm naked."
He tied towels 'round my wrists, kept me conscious, kept stroking my hair till the ambulance arrived, talking to me.
Sort of weird.
I think he always had a thing for me.
And we worked at the same place so, you know... awkward.
- He worked at Granular?
- Yeah.
On the ADI thing.
- He was a real wunderkind.
Ultra-smart.
- What did you say his name was?
Garrett.
Garrett Scholes.
Garrett Scholes.
We need the whereabouts of a Garrett...
Scholes.
We were about to tell you.
It was buried in the on-board memory of the Jo Powers' ADI.
- What was?
- A manifesto.
A 98-page manifesto.
And check this out.
There's fucking selfies in it.
So we're good to go?
Okay, that's the charge in place.
Okay.
Pull back.
We're all set here.
Detonate.
So, the plan is, we move you to an underground bunker, knock out every hive within a ten-mile radius.
And, what, just leave me there?
How long for?
It's a temporary measure.
How long till you take out all the hives?
There's 20,000, 30,000 of them.
That would take two years.
Two years, a victim a day.
More to the point, the environmental impact would...
Fuck that.
Shit!
- What?
- Fuck!
Stay back, stay back!
Get back!
Go, go, go!
Get away!
For fuck's sake, move!
What's your Plan B?
He was on the original employee roster, but we discounted him.
He left the country six months ago.
We thought we were looking for someone nearby.
Run a full trace on him.
Everything we can find.
Lunatic with production values, that's the worst kind.
"Thanks to the technological revolution, we have the power to rage and accuse, spout bile without consequence.
Only by being forced to recognize the power technology grants us, to acknowledge individual responsibility..."
Is it all like this?
He likens the population to insects, says we revel in cruelty, that it's a weakness that should be bred out of us.
Recurrent theme is he wants people to face the consequences of what they say and do.
- Wants to force that on them.
- The whole thing's a moral lesson?
He wanted us to find this and spread it about.
Well, fuck him.
Fuck.
Shit.
Karin.
Karin.
He's messed up.
He's put this document together himself, right?
His author name's in the metadata.
But he stripped out everything else, so we don't know when he's written it, for example.
Mm-hmm.
Most of the photos are clipart off the Internet, except this one.
- The selfie.
- That's where he's screwed up.
He's taken it with his phone, and the phone left a geotag on the image.
- So you know where he took this?
- I know precisely where.
He's here and Granular HQ is there.
- Armed police!
Stay down!
- Armed police!
Armed police!
Stay where you are!
Armed police!
Show yourselves!
Move!
Left.
- Clear!
- Clear!
Clear!
Lifestyles of the rich and famous.
There.
The forge.
Nice one.
Half the drives I sifted in forensics had scorch marks on 'em.
- What do you think?
- Yeah.
Looks like his toolkit.
- You can use it?
- Pretty much the key to the door.
So you can get control back?
Send the deactivation?
Well, I've got his source code.
- I should be able to bounce him out.
- Be quick.
Key to the door?
Our guy doesn't seem the type to leave keys lying around.
Well, I'm in.
Okay.
Deactivate her.
- Yeah, I need to repair permissions.
- Fucking hell.
That's weird.
What's weird?
- Time's ticking.
- That file.
Wasn't there before.
- This file?
- Yeah.
What is it?
- Blue?
- I think they're IMEI numbers.
What does that mean?
Every phone, every device has a unique number, an IMEI number.
It tethers it to a unique user.
- Yeah.
- But I can check, just... reverse lookup.
Take it easy.
Who are these people?
I don't know.
There's 387,000 of them.
Are these IDs your spooks have been collecting?
- No!
Are you ready yet?
- Yeah, almost there.
Wait.
Wait.
What was the name of that teacher?
Hate cake.
- Liza.
Liza Bahar.
- Liza Bahar.
Fuck's sake.
This is a list of everyone who's used the hashtag.
What?
Everyone who took part in the Game of Consequences.
They've hoovered up their ID from GCHQ by the looks of it.
That backdoor worked both ways, it seems.
- See if I'm on there.
- What?
I posted the tag earlier with Scholes' face.
- Just trying to get a reaction from him.
- Yeah, yeah, almost there.
Yeah, you're there.
Almost there.
Why has he collected everyone who took part?
I mean...
Okay.
I'm ready.
- Shit.
- Run it now.
No.
Think.
He left us a trail.
- Oh, come on.
- That photo with the whereabouts, it's too big a mistake for him.
He knew we'd do this.
- Now we're shutting it down, all right?
- And maybe that'll trigger some endgame, something to do with that list.
What if those are his real targets?
The people on the list.
Everyone who took part.
Consequences.
The hate figures were the bait.
The players are the target.
- Run the deact command.
- Now just wait a minute, okay?
- Run it.
- No!
Yeah.
Yeah, it worked.
Sorry, but that needed doing.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?
No.
No.
- Fuck!
- No.
Shit.
Oh, no.
There's...
We're all tragically familiar with the rest of the events of that week.
And we need no reminding of the sheer scale of the loss of life that followed.
No.
No, we don't.
And what became of Ms. Colson?
I think she blamed herself.
No.
I know she did.
She felt she'd followed his breadcrumb trail and sprung the whole thing.
She left the force.
I didn't hear from her.
Rang her, tried emailing, but no response.
Then, um...
About four months later, they found her things.
On a beach.
With a note.
She killed herself?
That's the base theory, yes.
Ms Parke, I would like to commend you for sharing your testimony and your time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Señor.
- Gracias.
- Gracias.
[glass cracks]
[man] They're ready now.
[woman] Perhaps we could begin with your earliest recollections of the events of last May.
Well, I first got involved on the 15th.
[woman] Could you move the microphone a little closer?

Here?
I first got involved on the 15th.

[beeps] [woman on TV] Chancellor Tom Pickering has defended the government's stance on disability benefits as outrage over the death of so-called "Wheelchair Martyr" Gwen Marbury grows.
More than 20,000 people have signed a petition demanding the sacking of newspaper columnist Jo Powers following her controversial article about Gwen Marbury.
Conservationists have announced another extinction.
The Siberian crane has died out following an unprecedented reduction in its wetland habitat.
And the honeybee-mimicking drone insects known as ADIs have been activated for their second summer.

[woman on TV] Grammy-award-winning rapper Tusk is still with us.
[cheering]
Now, Tusk, there are loads of online videos of people trying to emulate you, but this is our favourite.
Take a look at this.
[laughter and cheering]
It's a young chap called Aaron Sheen.
He's nine years old.
[laughs] That is one goofy-looking kid.
- [laughter]
- Not a good dancer.
He's nine years old!
Come on, he's a pretty good dancer.
That young motherfucker can't dance for shit.
He should probably just give up now, actually.
Don't hate on me for keeping it real.
That's a goofy little motherfucker, and he can't dance for shit.
[woman] He is a big fan, Tusk.
- [Tusk] Don't hate on your boy.
- [phone beeps] [woman] Everybody's got to start somewhere.
[Tusk] Start somewhere?
I looked better than that...
- DCI Parke?
- No press.
No, I'm not press.
Um...
TDC Blue Colson.
I'm your shadow.
My shadow?
They said...
Sorry.
Call me Karin.
- Did you say your name was...?
- Blue.
- B-l-u-e, Blue?
- Yeah.
It's not a nickname.
- My dad liked the sound of it.
- Uh-huh.
- Seen a body before?
- A couple.
- On video, I mean.
- [man] Boss?
- This is Blue.
She's my shadow.
- [helicopter whirrs]
- DS Nick Shelton.
- What've we got?
- Jo Powers.
- As in...
As in actual Jo Powers.
Saw something she wrote the other day about the wheelchair woman.
Clickbait piece.
Pissed people off.
That article was fucking horrendous.
Even I signed the petition.
To get her sacked.
Come on.
Neighbours heard her screaming and called it in.
[Karin] Hell of a struggle.
Anyone else at home?
Husband.
Found slashed across the stomach.
- By her?
- Don't know.
He was unconscious.
They've taken him to St. Columbus.
[Blue] Her mentions are still pouring in.
Restraining bolt's in place.
- No other points of entry?
- No.
But the outside's ringed with CCTV.
- We got the code for the cams?
- Uh-huh.
Okay, then.
Check the recordings.
Bag that, send it to Toxicology.
Full autop for her, and we question the husband as soon as he wakes up.
Come on.
- You think it's the husband?
- I'm keeping options open.
Cutting the throat, that's unusual.
Thanks, chaps.
- But you do think he did it?
- Don't know anything yet.
These things are almost always either drink, drugs or domestic.
It is how it is.
- You driving home?
- No licence.
Never passed.
I'm sort of waiting for driverless to go mainstream.
- Get in.
- No, honestly, I'll get the Tube.
- Get in.
- Oh.
Okay.
- So you were in Tech Crime?
- Digital Forensics.
Computer murk.
[Karin] What happened, you get bored of it?
Not exactly.
You've seen what people tuck away on these.
Schemes and kill lists, kiddy porn.
It's not boring.
I'm old enough to remember when they walked around with that stuff just tucked away in their heads.
[Blue] Right.
But now they can't help but entrusting it to their little companions.
These things absorb who we are.
They know everything about us.
[Karin] If it's interesting, why leave Forensics?
The Rannoch case.
- Ian Rannoch?
- The child killings, yeah.
I was the one who cracked his souvenir folder.
- So you saw those pictures?
- Mm-hmm.
And the videos too.
Saw them all.
You see something like that, it changes you.
You either get defeated or you think...
You think, "Fuck me!
I've got to help stop that shit."
Yeah.
- I mean, out here in the field...
- What fucking field?
You know what I mean.
Out here in the real world, you can genuinely prevent stuff, can't you?
You are young.
Maybe you're old?
- [Karin] Steady.
- [chuckles]
Thanks.
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes, boss.
[woman onTV] Jo Powers has been found dead at her home in West London.
The veteran columnist had been at the centre of controversy over an article she'd written about disability rights activist Gwen Marbury.
The police have yet to confirm the cause... [clicks]
[man] It's just the first floor, first door on the...
- Starting early?
- I asked Nick to show me the CCTV.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
No one came in or out.
Just Jo and her husband all evening.
- And that one there?
- Rear patio.
- Bust for months by the looks of it.
- Someone could've come in through there.
They'd have to climb the fence, make it in and out, knowing the camera wasn't working, but yeah, could have happened.
Technically.
Okay, sorry.
You're keen to help.
- She just asked!
- Uh-huh.
[sighs]
_ [sighs]

[Karin clears throat]
Um...
So...
I'm collating every threat or insult levelled at Jo Powers over the previous 48 hours.
Say it is the husband.
That's a coincidence, isn't it?
Not really.
You've got everyone throwing a shit fit.
Stress levels in that household would've been through the roof.
That Internet stuff drifts off like weather.
It's half hate.
They don't mean it.
The hate in a marriage, that's in 3D.
That's had work put into it.
That's sincere.
- Yeah.
I'm divorced.
- Um...
Husband's up and talking.
You're gonna love his alibi.
_ [siren wailing]
[phone rings]
I heard Jo screaming from upstairs.
And when I ran in, she was walking 'round the room, stumbling.
She was clutching...
She was clutching her head as if she was in pain.
And then for a moment, she stopped.
And then it was like a seizure, she was... thrashing... clawing at her own skin.
And she turned... [sobs]
She smashed her head...
onto the desk, hard.
Then she... she pushed me over.
That must've been when the bottle smashed.
Then she picked it up, and she started cutting herself.
Here.
She was gouging.
[sobs] I tried to stop her.
But she did this.
Then she cut her throat.
I tried to stop her.
She cut her own throat with the glass!
[man whimpers] [cries]
[Karin]Mutilated and then killed herself for no apparent reason?
I'd say the odds are against that.
He said it was like she was having a seizure.
Maybe there was something in the cake.
- The cake?
- It had "fucking bitch" iced on it.
- Could've been something in it.
- Like a drug?
- I don't know.
- That makes people kill themselves?
He was sort of convincing.
- He just doesn't seem the...
- Don't say "the type."
He's ordinary.
That is the type.
What, so he bounced her head off the desk?
- Blue.
- Held her steady enough...
- Blue.
- What?
- Toxicology are looking at the cake.
- Okay.
Meantime, let's drop in on the person that sent it.
Got the name this morning.
- You don't need to patronize me.
- We're doing what you want.
- Following another lead.
- That you think is a waste of time.
Picking along dead ends just to prove they're dead ends, that's most of the job.
I'm not saying it's a waste of time.
Just... you haven't had a chance to get bored of reality yet.
Okay, that was patronizing.
- Is this who sent the cake?
- [Karin] Uh-huh.
- Have we checked her social feeds?
- I don't know.
_
"Death to Jo Powers." She posted that on Monday morning.
The bakery said that they're not meant to do obscenities, so I said it was for my sister, like just a joke thing, and they agreed, so...
Not cheap, their cakes.
With delivery, it was what, 80 quid?
Um...
Well, I didn't pay for it all myself.
- We all put a pound in each.
- We?
Yeah.
I'm on a mums and carers message board.
I held a sort of whip-round.
- You crowd-sourced the money?
- Yeah, if you like.
From 80 other people?
Look, I'm not... [laughs]
I'm not being funny, okay?
I know she is dead.
But did you read what she had written?
How much do you think she got paid for spouting that horrible shit?
I don't know.
- I was just using my freedom of speech.
- To send a threatening message.
[scoffs] It was funny, okay?
And I can see if I'd done it myself, then that would be a bit weird, but I'm not mental.
You wished she was dead.
Well, uh... [stammers] No, no, I didn't.
[phone beeps]
- "Death to Jo Powers." - [laughs] That's just...
It's a... a hashtag game, you know, like "Death to..."
You insert the name of someone who's being an arsehole.
It's not... real.
It's a joke thing.
And who started it?
The hashtag?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I saw it somewhere.
[phone beeps]
Excuse us a moment.
Toxicology say the cake's clean.
They also said:
"Thanks, it was delicious."
We'll give her a caution.
Offensive Communications Act.
- Does that cover cakes?
- As far as she's concerned, it does.
What about the others who chipped in?
Are you going to tell them off, too?
- I didn't do anything.
- Start a thread about it.
Hospital's discharging the husband tomorrow.
We'll bring him in for questioning.
Blue?
We're arresting the husband.
Don't wallow in that.
The Internet will be pissed off with someone else today.
[Nick] Tusk.
Everyone's pissed off with Tusk 'cause of that thing with the kid.
He's catching a shit storm on social media.
- Liza will be organising the cake now.
- Yeah.
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

[man] She's in here.
So I go in, and there's not just the wound from the glass.
There's a hole.
Dug in.
A bore hole, like a tiny tunnel.
So I follow it, you know, how deep does it go?
It goes all the way from her ear canal to deep in her brain.
Where I find this.
Nestled right in there.
Looks quite cosy.
- [Karin] It's one of those bee things.
- [Blue] An ADI.
An Autonomous Drone Insect from the Granular Project.
- How did it get in there?
- I'd say it burrowed in.
- Fuck me.
- [man] That's not the worst part.
It crawled right through her dorsal posterior insula, which is basically the brain's pain centre.
You're talking agony off the scale.
- You'd do anything to make it stop.
- Even cut your own throat.
- Good afternoon.
- DCI Parke.
- TDC Blue Colson.
- Okay.
Thank you.
[Karin] They're so fucking fancy-looking, these companies.
- Billions on branding.
- Well, they can afford it.
The whole ADI project's pretty much bankrolled by the government.
It's why so many people are paranoid about it.
Let me guess, this is some people on the Internet?
They reckon the government uses the bees to spy on us.
There's a schizophrenic world view.
[buzzing]
[buzzing]
Jesus, I didn't expect to find myself living in the future, but here I fucking well am.
- Karin Parke?
- Uh-huh.
Vanessa Dahl.
Please.
Follow me.
You're after information on our Project Swarm ADIs?
[Karin] That's right.
[Vanessa] Any particular reason?
Yes.
[buzzing]
Rasmus.
Rasmus Sjoberg.
- He heads Swarm.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Nice greenhouse.
- Yeah.
[buzzing]
[Karin] So, your bees, your ADIs, talk me through them.
Colony Collapse Disorder.
We still don't know what's behind it.
Bees themselves were virtually extinct so what our ADIs do is effectively stand in for them.
They're solar powered.
They don't need nectar.
but they pollinate flowers the same way.
They crawl inside, pollen sticks to their legs and gets brushed off the next flower they visit.
- Can they make honey?
- Uh...
No.
I was joking.
How do they know where the flowers even are?
I mean...
Well, they have a sensor.
Like a... camera?
No.
Just a basic visual sensor.
You see, they need rudimentary pattern recognition in order to locate compatible flora and navigate.
- They navigate?
- Yes.
You don't...
I don't know... steer them?
They're autonomous.
That's right, isn't it?
They make their own decisions.
They look after themselves.
Yes.
You see, the ADIs cover the whole of the UK.
We couldn't command each one individually ourselves.
It's just not logistically possible.
No. [coughs] We simply set the behaviour and leave them to it.
They even construct these hives themselves.
They reproduce...
- They reproduce?
- Yes.
Each hive is a replication point.
- [Blue] It's like a 3D printer, basically.
- [Rasmus] Exactly.
They create duplicates of themselves, create more hives and spread out exponentially.
- [Blue] Cover the country.
- Maybe you should work here.
Yeah, well, I read up on it.
It's impressive.
It is.
It's just a shame it's necessary.
The alternative would have been environmental catastrophe.
Bees were dying out.
So, what is it that brings you here?
We think one of your ADIs may be involved in an unexplained death.
Sorry?
A death?
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
Yeah.
It's one of ours.
But, look, these are not designed to...
Kill people?
I'd hope not.
Could it have malfunctioned somehow?
No.
I mean, when they do malfunction...
It happens, but then they just break, they just hit the ground.
What if someone hacked one and then they found a way of controlling it?
That's impossible.
You see, it's got military-grade encryption, and you would need a diagnostic controller, which is also encrypted.
So I would say the likelihood is...
I don't know what he's saying, but it's not the same as "impossible."
This is every hive we have online.
See...
These are the hives in the building here.
- How many bees per hive?
- Around 4,000.
- [Karin] It's like air traffic control.
- [Rasmus] Yeah.
Is that the search input?
- Yeah, but, uh... you'd need...
- Sorry.
[tapping on keyboard]
- Jo Powers' postcode.
- [beeping]
Is that who this is about?
- You said you get some malfunctions?
- A fair few, yes.
They smack into a car or something.
We even had people trap them.
You know, put them in the microwave for YouTube videos. [laughs]
And this logs any that drop off the system?
Logs everything, yes.
Did you lose any around here on Monday evening?
Well, I can check.
[beeping]
Just one.
Went out at 1903 hours.
Here, I can replay.
[beeping]
There.
- That's odd.
- [Blue] What's odd?
When they pass between hives, they switch from one jurisdiction to another.
- It's, you know, like a...
- It's like a phone between cell masts?
Exactly.
It tried to do that, but there was nothing to switch to.
Unless someone spoofed a hive and then they've used that to commandeer your ADI.
No, you would need a diagnostic controller to do that.
[Blue] What's the range on one of those?
[Rasmus] Ten, 20 metres, perhaps.
So whoever was controlling it would have to be no more than 20 metres away.
- Outside the house.
- Yeah.
Sitting in a car, even.
- Can you trace back who did this?
- Yes.
I-I'm already trying to do that.
Uh...
You know what?
Uh...
It would be easier without an audience.
Okay.
You two swap numbers, keep a line of communication.
Can you shut the whole thing down if need be... hypothetically speaking?
Even a short stoppage would damage the ecosystem, and we'd need approval from the Department of the Environment.
We'll need a list of any Granular staff that had access to that system, past or present.
[laughs] Some were government employees.
Use a different font for those if it helps.
Bye.
[buzzing]
[buzzing]
Nick, that's a set of Granular personnel records.
Root out anyone interesting.
Maybe not just one.
Could be a group involved.
Technically we should refer this up to the NCA, but there's no fucking way they're taking this off me.
The NCA already knows about it.
What?
DCI Karin Parke?
- Yes.
- Shaun Li, National Crime Agency.
[Karin] How come you're here?
There's been more than one.
This is Tusk, last night.
- Shit.
- They thought it was a fit.
Took him to the hospital.
He had to be anaesthetised to stop him mutilating himself.
X-ray seemed to indicate some kind of plaque or tumour in his brain
- so they popped him in the MRI.
- [groans]
Yeah.
Basically one big magnet.
Tore it right out of his head, through the eye socket.
[groans]
Battered the ADI too.
Yours is more intact so I'm gonna need it for analysis.
[Karin] It's evidence.
Two's a pattern.
It knocks any malfunction theory in the head.
- And they're similar victims.
- Similar?
Both in the middle of online shit storms.
Well, if you wanna kill someone, there's a million easier ways to do it.
Pull this off and you've done it from across the street.
No fingerprints, no DNA.
It's like wishing them dead.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Guys?
Come here.
Okay, so, um...
Jo Powers and Tusk, both were being kicked around the Internet for hours, but in both their cases, people were also tweeting their photos accompanied with this hashtag: #DeathTo.
- Like our friend the teacher.
- Right.
She didn't know where she'd first heard of it, but trace it back, and it looks like the first real use of the hashtag was last weekend.
- By who?
- [Blue] Uh...
Looks like, um...
Looks like identical tweets from a set of duplicate bot accounts.
Um...
Automated.
It's like spam.
This is someone trying to seed the tag, you know?
Get it out there.
It's like bait.
This is someone wanting people to pick up on it.
Check out the senders' avatar photos.
[Karin] Bees.
Shit.
Okay.
There's more.
So each tweet had a sort of instruction video attached to it.
- [Karin] Uh-huh.
- There.
"Game of Consequences"?
It's like an unpopularity contest.
Pick someone you don't like and if enough other people choose the same name, then that's who gets targeted.
Here, watch.
[man] Game of Consequences.
- One:
Pick a target.
- [Karin] Oh, my God.
Two:
Post their name and photo with #DeathTo.
No.
Three:
Most popular target will be eliminated after 5 p.m. each day.
Four:
Game resets at midnight.
- [Nick] Oh, no.
- [Karin] Fuck.
Someone's holding a public ballot, bumping off the top person.
- Jesus, it's just mad.
- Yeah, and it's growing.
Day one. 63 people used the hashtag on Jo Powers, okay?
On day two, 223 used it on Tusk.
- Who's using it now?
- There's...
There's loads more people.
There's quite a few votes for the Chancellor.
- Yeah.
- Um...
But at number one... is 880 people using it on someone called Clara Meades.
- Who's she?
- Clara Meades.
Okay, um...
it looks like she was at a demo, and she took a selfie in front of a war memorial.
- Pretending to piss on it.
- Nice work, Clara.
Yeah, it's getting near the end of the vote, and her mentions are blowing up.
- Tusk isn't public knowledge yet?
- Um, no.
So people can't know the hashtag works.
They're using it to scare her.
- Yeah, but they're gonna get her killed.
- We need to get to her before five.
Yeah.
Pulling her citizens details.
You're not supposed to have access to that.
Yeah, I know.
Just getting her location.
There.
[breathes heavily] [computer chirrups repeatedly]
[phone ringing]
[ringing stops, chirruping continues]
_
_
_
_ [sighs]
- _ - [phone rings]
_
_ [woman] Hello?
[whimpers] [woman] Yeah, she is.
All right, all right, hold on.
Clara!
Police.
For you.
How did they get my number?
- Hello?
- Clara Meades?
This is DCI Karin Parke, Met Police.
Sorry to track you down like this, but we think you may be in danger.
Sorry, is this a joke?
Because all this stuff I'm getting is not funny.
I'm not joking.
Stay where you are until we get there.
And keep your windows closed.
I'm setting up a perimeter.
Call Rasmus, we need him across this.
[sighs]
- Rasmus?
- Hi, Blue.
I'm sending you a postcode and my GPS.
I need you to monitor the area.
Track my location and see if you get anything unusual, any rogue ADIs, yeah?
Yeah, great, good.
Look, if they come back,
I think I can catch them.
I have basically set a trap.
So if they...
if they try it again, we've got them.
- Are you Batman?
- They only just rolled them out.
This'll turn every red light between here and there to green.
Fuck me.
If this is the NCA life, I should apply for a transfer.
Let's go.
_
We can take her here.
It's a safe house for terrorist informers usually.
[helicopter whirring]
[sirens wailing]
[man over radio] No target sighted.
[man over loudspeaker] This is a police operation!
Everybody vacate their premises now.
Please leave... [gasps] [computer pings]
- [Vanessa] What's that?
- [Rasmus] Someone's trying to break in.
- Rasmus?
- I just picked up an attempted breach.
Granular, they've got a breach.
- [Rasmus] One ADI just went offline.
- Where?
- 800 metres from your location.
- That's outside our cordon.
If someone's trying to pilot it this way, they're gonna turn 'round the moment they see all these uniforms.
Clara Meades?
I'm Karin Parke.
Did you pack a bag?
- Yeah, it's by the door.
- Right, let's go.
- Rasmus got a track on them?
- Not yet.
[beeping] _
It's just precautionary, and it's only for one night.
Just gotta call in.
Hi.
No, not yet.
Hopefully never.
Granular are onto it.
- Understood.
- [buzzing]
They housed a witness here for a while, Shaun said.
- Must've had kids.
- Have you got kids?
[both] No.
No plans.
[buzzing]
Up the stairs.
[phone rings]
- Rasmus.
- Still nothing.
I can't trace it.
[sighs]
[sighs] At least there's an en-suite.
- Is there nothing?
- [Rasmus] No.
Whoever it is, they've masked their path well.
[beeping]
But that's not...
- Fuck.
- [Blue] What?
- We just lost a whole hive.
- What does that mean?
Packed full of ADIs.
Lost them all too.
- No...
Rasmus?
- There's thousands of them.
- Where?
- It's close to your location. [static]
Rasmus, say that again.
Blue?
Blue.
It's close...
It's very close to you.
Text it.
Text it to me.
Rasmus.
Text it to... [static] Shit.
Do I get to redecorate?
[buzzing]
- [crackling on line]
- Hello.
Hello.
[distorted voice]
[beeping]
[Rasmus] No...
They've got the whole thing.
We're not in control anymore.
- They've got the whole thing.
- [Vanessa] What are you doing?
- Fix it!
Can't you fix it?
- Shut up!
[crackling on line] [buzzing]
[buzzing continuing]
- [screams] - [phone beeps]
_ [buzzing]
Shit.
[panting]
We need to go.
Now.
Now!
Come on!
[buzzing]
Go.
Go, go, go.
[Shaun screams] [loud buzzing] [gasps]
[Clara] What's... what's happening?
[buzzing]
- [rattling] - [Blue] Karin...
- [rattling] - [mutters]
[loud buzzing]
In there!
Go!
[gasps]
- Help me block the gap!
- [Clara]Tell me what's going on!
You're scaring the shit out of me!
[loud buzzing]
[door rattles]
[gasps] [buzzing and rattling continue]
- [rattling] - [screams]
Oh!
Fuck!
[buzzing]
- [buzzing] - [screams] [buzzing]
The fan!
The fan!
[screams] [screams] [screams]
Get it away from me!
[screams]
[screams hysterically] [gasps]
[buzzing]
[buzzing stops]
[panting]
[woman] Take your time.
I'd seen so many bodies before.
At crime scenes, in autopsies.
But I'd never seen anyone die.
And she was right there.
And can you describe the reaction of your colleague, Miss Colson?
Blue took it hard.
[Shaun] Uh-huh.
[man] I'll shut it down.
We thought this was one guy, some Mr. Mystery in the vicinity, hijacking one ADI and personally controlling it.
[Shaun] But there were thousands of them.
- So it can't be that, right?
- No.
- One person can't fly hundreds at once.
- No.
Whoever this is, they're controlling the whole system.
- Do you know where from?
- Could be anywhere.
You need to fucking sort this out!
[kicks table]
How do the ADIs know who to target?
Could've found Clara the same way you did, the identity database?
No.
That just gives you the basic area.
We were in the room too, and they only went for her.
Facial recognition.
It's got to be facial recognition.
Which means the feed from their visual sensors, that's been accessed too.
- [Shaun] That's not possible.
- [Blue] It's the only explanation.
Now look, the visual feed is secure between each ADI and the hive.
- There you go.
- Although... one of the government's conditions for backing the project...
Okay.
Enough.
We had to consent to permitting government security services access to the visual feed at times of quote, "increased national security."
Which is, as I understand it, pretty much all the time.
- I wasn't happy about it.
- Your lot went along with it.
That implies a greater range of options than your lot presented.
- So they are spying on us.
- This is all classified.
So what did you do, did you put in a back door and route it through GCHQ?
I mean, you do CCTV, you do traffic cams.
So what don't you have your fucking noses in?
Look, millions of those things flying around, propping up the ecosystem?
Well, that's great, save the planet, hallelujah!
Government's not going to pump billions into it just 'cause some lab coat says so, and it grabs 200 green votes.
They saw an opportunity to get more, they took it.
Total nationwide surveillance.
We tracked suspects for weeks in ways they couldn't dream of.
- We prevented bombings, mass shootings.
- By spying on the public.
And keeping them safe, which is what they want.
Clara Meades isn't safe, though, is she, Shaun?
Knowing what you knew, that might've helped us, but no, you kept your little fucking secret.
Okay!
The government's a cunt.
We knew that already.
Word's going to get out about Clara.
The public's going to wake up and find this mental assassination game going on, and soon we're going to have another body.
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.
We're totally locked out.
Totally blind.
If I can work out how they got in,
I might be able to reverse engineer some means of getting control back.
Do the ADIs have a command log, on-board cache?
- Yeah, but that's encrypted.
- I'll need the key to that.
[phone rings] [sighs]
Been through the employee files, found some pols.
Bring them in.
Are you sitting in on these?
Granular interviews?
I've got to be somewhere.
[radio beeping]
[woman on radio] It's 7:15.
Three deaths have now been linked to a hashtag circulating on social media.
Controversial journalist Jo Powers... [man on radio] Good morning.
Have you posted the hashtag?
Is it real or an urban myth?
Well, thousands have been taking part, but how culpable are they?
People are dying, and we want to hear your thoughts.
Line seven, Liana...
This is real, this is happening...
I am happy to see her die.
[woman] It's not the hashtag killing them.
That's just a game.
Like, if you're an arsehole, you deserve to be shamed.
[man on radio] Steve, line five.
[man] Yeah, but my point is, someone's gotta be top of the list, yeah?
So why not make it someone, you know, who deserves it, like a racist.
[woman] With the hashtag, I've seen celebrities, politicians, everyone.
This doesn't mean you have to sit there encouraging people to take part.
The point is this is already happening.
And people know that they can jump onboard because nobody will ever know if they did or didn't.
Well, let's just pause for a moment and go back to that top five.
As we have been saying, the Chancellor is at number one, and I want us to think about that.
What does that tell us about the choice of the nation?
[woman] Well, I can't say I'm surprised that he's number one on the list.
He's been pretty unpopular for quite a long time now.
[interviewer] But does that warrant his place on this list?
[woman] I'm saying people don't have to think too hard about it.
Now that's he's number one, that should generate more discussions and probably more votes.
_
Thanks for your time.
- No good?
- No good.
- Well, that's all fascinating...
- Shaun.
- But when do we shut it down?
- Tom.
Forgive me for being sceptical about your agency's basic competence.
- Tom.
- I'm on the fucking chopping block here.
Number one on the list.
The people's fucking choice!
Farrington's number four, and he's a paedophile.
- Suspected paedophile.
- He did it.
You know he did.
Let's just shut it down.
All social media.
The whole bloody Internet, pull the plug.
Just for today, at least until Thumbelina here pulls his finger out and he actually catches someone.
I wouldn't advise shutting things down.
- But it's possible?
We can do that?
- The whole of social media?
- Yeah.
Pull a North Korea on it.
- Well, yes, technically.
- Right, so push the off switch.
- [Shaun] That's not a good idea.
- No?
- Not in my opinion.
Right, okay.
It's just that speaking as a marked man, I beg to fucking differ.
If we shut it down, you'll still be number one.
Guaranteed to be, in fact.
He's right.
If we let it run on, at least there's a few hours.
Anything could happen before five o'clock.
The vote might change.
Yeah, and it might not.
What about that report?
The archive job?
From 1985, that memo about Farrington?
- That was over an unrelated matter.
- [Tom] Leak it.
Tom, that would be a smear.
A head-to-toe shit smear, I fucking hope so.
He's in his 80s.
He's had his life.
Fuck him under the bus.
If I could suggest an alternative?
We move you to a safe location.
- Have you secured before five.
- Worked out well for you last night.
I'll show you.
This next one's Tess Wallender.
She was a junior.
So not much in the way of technical skills.
- Quit Granular for personal reasons.
- Nervous exhaustion, yeah.
Worked in Human Resources for Granular until she quit.
She took a photo of a guy on the Tube, said he'd harassed her, lewd comments or something.
Turned out he had a learning disability so she caught a ton of shit on...
On social media.
- Hello.
I'm DCI Karin Parke.
- Hi.
_
It was like having a whole weather system turn against me.
Just hate message after hate message, around the clock, all piling on.
It's hard to describe what that does to your head.
Suddenly there's a million invisible people, all talking about how they despise you.
It's like a mental illness.
Fuck.
[Nick] What?
Shit.
I mean, hands up, I made a mistake, but the way people enjoyed kicking me, that's what got to me.
The casual fun they had and, um...
I just felt I couldn't go on.
Who found you?
Um...
Garrett, my flatmate.
He found me in the bath five minutes after I'd slashed them.
I mean, it's crazy.
I'm half-conscious.
He's dragging me out of the bath, and I'm telling him to get out, saying, "I'm naked."
He tied towels 'round my wrists, kept me conscious, kept stroking my hair till the ambulance arrived, talking to me.
Sort of weird.
I think he always had a thing for me.
And we worked at the same place so, you know... awkward.
- He worked at Granular?
- Yeah.
On the ADI thing.
- He was a real wunderkind.
Ultra-smart.
- What did you say his name was?
Garrett.
Garrett Scholes.
Garrett Scholes.
We need the whereabouts of a Garrett...
Scholes.
We were about to tell you.
It was buried in the on-board memory of the Jo Powers' ADI.
- What was?
- A manifesto.
A 98-page manifesto.
_
And check this out.
There's fucking selfies in it.
[buzzing] [man] So we're good to go?
[buzzing]
Okay, that's the charge in place.
Okay.
Pull back.
We're all set here.
Detonate.
[explosion]
So, the plan is, we move you to an underground bunker, knock out every hive within a ten-mile radius.
And, what, just leave me there?
How long for?
It's a temporary measure.
How long till you take out all the hives?
There's 20,000, 30,000 of them.
That would take two years.
Two years, a victim a day.
More to the point, the environmental impact would...
Fuck that.
[man] Shit!
- What?
- Fuck!
Stay back, stay back!
Get back!
[buzzing] [men screaming]
Go, go, go!
Get away!
[men screaming]
For fuck's sake, move!
[static, buzzing]
What's your Plan B?
[buzzing]
He was on the original employee roster, but we discounted him.
He left the country six months ago.
We thought we were looking for someone nearby.
Run a full trace on him.
Everything we can find.
Lunatic with production values, that's the worst kind.
"Thanks to the technological revolution, we have the power to rage and accuse, spout bile without consequence.
Only by being forced to recognize the power technology grants us, to acknowledge individual responsibility..."
Is it all like this?
He likens the population to insects, says we revel in cruelty, that it's a weakness that should be bred out of us.
Recurrent theme is he wants people to face the consequences of what they say and do.
- Wants to force that on them.
- The whole thing's a moral lesson?
He wanted us to find this and spread it about.
Well, fuck him.
_
_
Fuck.
_
_
Shit.
Karin.
Karin.
He's messed up.
He's put this document together himself, right?
His author name's in the metadata.
But he stripped out everything else, so we don't know when he's written it, for example.
Mm-hmm.
Most of the photos are clipart off the Internet, except this one.
- The selfie.
- That's where he's screwed up.
He's taken it with his phone, and the phone left a geotag on the image.
- So you know where he took this?
- I know precisely where.
He's here and Granular HQ is there.
[phone pings]

[crash]
- Armed police!
Stay down!

[Karin] Lifestyles of the rich and famous.
There.
The forge.
[gasps]
[Karin] Nice one.
Half the drives I sifted in forensics had scorch marks on 'em.
- [Blue] What do you think?
- Yeah.
Looks like his toolkit.
- You can use it?
- Pretty much the key to the door.
So you can get control back?
Send the deactivation?
[Rasmus] Well, I've got his source code.
- I should be able to bounce him out.
- Be quick.
[Karin] Key to the door?
Our guy doesn't seem the type to leave keys lying around.
Well, I'm in.
Okay.
Deactivate her.
- Yeah, I need to repair permissions.
- Fucking hell.
That's weird.
What's weird?
- [Shaun] Time's ticking.
- That file.
Wasn't there before.
- This file?
- Yeah.
[computer beeps]
What is it?
- Blue?
- I think they're IMEI numbers.
What does that mean?
Every phone, every device has a unique number, an IMEI number.
It tethers it to a unique user.
- Yeah.
- But I can check, just... reverse lookup.
[Rasmus] Take it easy.
[Karin] Who are these people?
[Blue] I don't know.
There's 387,000 of them.
Are these IDs your spooks have been collecting?
- No!
Are you ready yet?
- Yeah, almost there.
Wait.
Wait.
What was the name of that teacher?
Hate cake.
- Liza.
Liza Bahar.
- Liza Bahar.
[Shaun] Fuck's sake.
This is a list of everyone who's used the hashtag.
What?
Everyone who took part in the Game of Consequences.
They've hoovered up their ID from GCHQ by the looks of it.
That backdoor worked both ways, it seems.
- See if I'm on there.
- What?
I posted the tag earlier with Scholes' face.
- Just trying to get a reaction from him.
- Yeah, yeah, almost there.
[Blue] Yeah, you're there.
[Rasmus] Almost there.
Why has he collected everyone who took part?
I mean...
[Rasmus] Okay.
I'm ready.
- Shit.
- Run it now.
No.
Think.
He left us a trail.
- Oh, come on.
- That photo with the whereabouts, it's too big a mistake for him.
He knew we'd do this.
- Now we're shutting it down, all right?
- And maybe that'll trigger some endgame, something to do with that list.
What if those are his real targets?
The people on the list.
Everyone who took part.
Consequences.
The hate figures were the bait.
The players are the target.
- Run the deact command.
- [Rasmus] Now just wait a minute, okay?
- Run it.
- [Karin] No!
[beeping] _ [gasps]
[beeping]
[Rasmus] Yeah. [laughs]
Yeah, it worked.
[Shaun sighs]
Sorry, but that needed doing. [laughs]
[beeping]
- No, no, no, no, no.
- [Karin] What?
No.
No.
- [Rasmus] Fuck!
- [Karin] No.
[Karin] Shit.
Oh, no.

[woman] We're all tragically familiar with the rest of the events of that week.
And we need no reminding of the sheer scale of the loss of life that followed.
No.
No, we don't.
[woman] And what became of Ms. Colson?
I think she blamed herself.
No.
I know she did.
She felt she'd followed his breadcrumb trail and sprung the whole thing.
She left the force.
I didn't hear from her.
Rang her, tried emailing, but no response.
Then, um...
About four months later, they found her things.
On a beach.
With a note.
[breathes deeply]
She killed herself?
That's the base theory, yes.
Ms Parke, I would like to commend you for sharing your testimony and your time.
Thank you.

Narrator:
Poppy and Georgie Carlton are back.
Reporting live for "news today", I am nerissa knight at a private airport in California where English aristocrats poppy and Georgie Carlton have arrived on U.S. soil.
Narrator:
The royal sibling -- 60th and 61st in line to the English throne...
I'm poppy.
Hello, Lisa vanderpump.
...are still being followed 24 hours a day by a documentary crew.
Georgie, we share a common name.
Yes.
And this time, they're joining the ranks of the Internet generation.
Hello, investigative journalists poppy Carlton here.
...filming themselves as they embark on a cultural tour across the United States.
Are you ready?
3, 2 -- no, I'll do it.
I want to do it.
3, 2, 1 -- record.
...as they investigate the subjects that define American life today.
I don't know if you guys are aware, but we're not actually women.
In America, do you always finish off with a blow-dry?
Always.
I thought I was gonna be the only one in red.
No.
So, why are you here in the United States?
We're here to find out what makes Americans tick, beauty-wise.
It'll also be interesting to find out about standards of beauty in America.
Will any of them live up to poppy?
I doubt it.
Narrator:
Aspiring online commentators, poppy and Georgie Carlton are in the United States of America to investigate the world of beauty.
Georgie:
It's funny about beauty, isn't it, poppy?
Because people from different places think different things are beautiful.
I wonder what Americans think is beautiful.
Maybe guns or something.
Barbecue.
Yeah.
Guns and barbecue.
Maybe the dream American woman is just a lady made of brisket holding a revolver.
Narrator:
By way of an introduction to the subject, poppy and Georgie have made an appointment at a beauty school.
There we are, poppy.
Hello.
How are you?
Good.
Lovely to meet you.
Hello, I'm Georgie.
I'm dam.
Narrator:
They're here to meet hairdresser damiano, who's going to demonstrate some basic beauty skills.
One of the things that we're gonna be focusing on today -- are you a hairdresser?
Of course I am.
Oh.
Yeah, you're gonna be with me.
I didn't realize -- you're not like lots of the hairdressers I've met before.
Okay.
So we're gonna walk over to the mannequin.
Okay.
And we're gonna work on some hair-cutting today.
So we're gonna cut a straight line, and we're gonna use the comb as our ruler, right?
So we're gonna bring the hair down, and if you will...
That's very straight.
Very straight.
Very simple.
So do you want to give it a go, Georgie?
Yes, absolutely.
Are these my scissors here?
Those are yours, yeah.
I've never had my own proper scissors.
People have always said I'm quite dangerous.
You actually should give him a wide berth.
Yeah.
So you're gonna use your left hand.
You're gonna comb the hair with your left hand.
And you're gonna hold it down like a ruler.
How short are we -- no!
Not that -- you're not gonna want to do that.
Wow.
So hair-cutting might not be your thing, Georgie.
But it looks lovely, don't you think?
Um, yeah.
Wow.
Wow.
What do we do with that?
Um, wow.
You're gonna just drop it on the floor.
Oh, and nanny comes and cleans this up.
There's no nanny in here that's gonna clean it up.
You're gonna have to do it yourself.
Usually when we make the mess, we're gonna have to clean it.
Okay, perfect.
So we're gonna walk here and we're gonna work on our blow-dry finishing.
The first thing I want to do is actually, I want to get one of you involved.
So I'm gonna have you get involved, poppy.
If you can, just take a little bit of product.
I'm gonna put it in your hand.
Okay?
And do -- and in America, do you always finish off with a blow-dry?
Always.
That's nice.
So you want apply the product thoroughly throughout the ends of her hair.
Yep.
Go ahead.
Perfect.
Oh, it's not too hard.
So you're gonna hold the brush in your right hand and the blow dryer in your left hand.
You ready?
You want me to hold that for you?
There we go.
You're gonna hold this.
You can do it if you want.
No, you need to do it.
But this is much easier if you do that one and you do that one.
And what are you gonna do?
Watch?
She's doing the blow-dry.
Yeah.
You need to move that brush at the same time.
So as I move down -- we're gonna have to coordinate this together.
It's actually easier if one person does it.
So we're gonna give it go?
Coordinate the blow dryer down.
Oh, yeah.
Away from you.
You're gonna just start pulling away on it.
Careful, you're -- oh, that's a good point.
Should I -- should one dry your down-there hair?
When you're out of the shower?
Uh, I -
- I -- you can, I would imagine.
But not -- you wouldn't go into a salon for that.
That went absolutely brilliantly.
I think I may have found my calling.
You guys work really well as a team.
Thank so you much, dom.
Thanks so much, dom.
It was lovely to meet you.
Thank you for having us.
Nice to meet you, Georgie.
Nice to meet you, poppy.
Thank you.
Goodbye, dom.
Bye!
Narrator:
To help them understand beauty in America, poppy and Georgie have enlisted the help of superstar Mario Lopez to serve as their guide.
As an actor, presenter, and host of the miss world pageant,
Mario is perfectly placed to illuminate further the topic of beauty.
[ Beep ]
Hello, I'm poppy Carlton, and I'm here with the most beautiful man in America, Mario Lopez.
We're going to be talking about looks, appearances, and beauty.
Georgie's here, as well.
Thank you.
Finally.
Narrator:
They begin with the basics.
How old do you have to be before you can be beautiful?
And what about sexy?
How old do you have to be?
Well, I have a 4-year-old and a 1-year-old, so I think as soon as you're born you qualify to -- be sexy?
To be able to be beautiful.
I think sexy is something that comes with time and maturity.
You know?
I don't think you can have a sexy kid.
You know, one of daddy's friends said that I was a sexy child.
And then he didn't come around anymore.
Yeah, that would -
- I don't know if I have friends like that.
You've got to be careful what you say.
Narrator:
Poppy and Georgie have been invited to judge a "cutest baby" competition at a local harvest festival in Florida.
Linda is the organizer of the event.
Hi.
Georgie.
Lovely to meet you.
Hi, George.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
I'm poppy.
Oh, nice to meet you, Pompeii.
Welcome to our 40th annual harvest festival, and our "cutest baby" contest.
What makes a really cute baby.
Well...
Is it the eyes, or...?
It could be the eyes, it could be the smile a cheeky smile?
It could be if they're really shy, you know?
Or if they say something really hilarious?
That's right, yeah.
Do you ever get adults dressed as babies trying to compete?
No, we don't.
Yeah.Okay.
Linda:
Well, good afternoon, everybody.
And we're honored to have two judges that have come from england -- this is George, and this is his sister, Pompeii.
Oh, yeah, we normally say "poppy" for "poppy."
Oh, poppy.
Oh, poppeh is her name.
Pompeii is a place in Italy where there was a terrible disaster.
Lots of people died.
Lots of people died.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
So, it's poppeh.
And our first entrant, her name is Adrianna.
She looks lovely.
Well done.
Lovely. [ Applause ]
She probably shouldn't eat so many sweets.
I would say so, right.
'Cause that can be very bad for things like type 2 diabetes.
And goes straight to the hips, as well.
Okay.
And our next entrant is Emily may cisneros, and she's 15 months old.
She's like Uncle Humphrey.
Oh, yes.
Our Uncle Humphrey's got a dress like that.
Oh, goodness!
[ Laughs ]
And he always does this.
Yeah.
Okay.
Our next entrance is Victor Gutierrez.
Oh, he looks like he's wearing a little prison uniform.
Okay.
And those are all of our entrants for the "cutest baby" contest.
So, please sit tight, and we are going to get together here now with George and poppeh -- poppy.
Poppy, yes.
Poppeh.
And June, my assistant, and we're going to try to figure out who's the winner.
Narrator:
Having retired backstage, the judges are deliberating.
So, what do you think?
Is it only one baby?
One baby.
Now, I like Victor because of the prison uniform.
Poppy:
Which one do you think was the sexiest?
It's -- it's not the sexiest baby.
It's the cutest baby.
Cutest baby.
Oh, okay.
Very exciting.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have made our selection.
And the cutest baby boy is
Gutierrez, Victor.
[ Cheers and applause ]
We're gonna do prison baby.
That's lovely.
And he's in the prison uniform like they said grandpa was wearing.
Yes.
That was a war tribunal, though.
Narrator:
Poppy and Georgie Carlton are in the United States of America investigating the subject of beauty.
No, not that!
You're not gonna want to do that.
Wow.
Narrator:
Continuing in his role as their guide is superstar Mario Lopez.
Who is more beautiful, Mario?
Men or women?
Yeah, that's a good one.
Battle of the sexes, Mario.
I'm gonna lean more towards the women.
But that's just me.
Even taking into account, in england, there are some very ugly women?
Awful.
Huh.
Narrator:
Eager to immerse herself in the subject of beauty, poppy is intending to compete in an American institution -- the beauty pageant.
The royal siblings have come to meet Mona Igor and her two daughters, a family with more than 25 years of experience in the pageant business.
Shawna focuses on the most important part of the pageant -- the interview.
What do you want to be?
What is your ambition in life?
I've recently become a small English businesswoman.
Okay, that's wonderful.
What kind of business did you start?
Well, it's a bit vague.
I haven't really worked it out.
I decided to become a businesswoman first, and then do the business later.
Um, what about, like, any charity work or community service?
Do you do anything like that?
I tend to find the poor quite grabby.
So, probably not.
Okay, well, in a pageant, we wouldn't want to say that.
Because here, they're a lot about helping not just the poor, but like we said, the elderly or animals, whatever.
I like animals.
I love eating and wearing them.
I don't know about that one.
Um, they do a lot of, like, "if I gave you $100,000, what would you do with it," you know, doing something good, something to help people, rather than "if you gave me $100,000,
I would go on a shopping spree."
Yeah, definitely.
Or a really good vacation.
That's what I would like to do.
Or you would say that, but you would also have a positive, something with the community, or something -- maybe could say, "I'd love to go on a really good holiday, but I'll take an orphan with me."
But with a friend instead of the orphan.
I don't think that would count for community service.
Narrator:
Back with Mr. Lopez, he offers up some of his valuable expertise.
Could you think of a classic pageant question?
You're the expert.
A classic pageant question.
Something they ask in all pageants.
Probably ask something along the lines, like,
"do you think Hillary Clinton has a good shot to be the first female president, considering the baggage she's bringing to the election like benghazi and the e-mail scandal and what have you?
Or will it become irrelevant?"
Go.
Yes.
I do.
Narrator:
Poppy and Georgie have come to the miss broward county beauty pageant, in which poppy is going to compete for the crown.
Welcome, poppy.
Grant.
Narrator:
Here, they meet show organizer grant and former winner Michelle, who will take poppy under her wing.
Welcome to what is going to be a fun afternoon.
Yes.
Is this your first pageant?
Yeah, it's my first one.
But probably not my last.
Well, we'll see about that.
Are you ready to win?
Yeah, I really want to win.
She's always ready to win.
Well, we're going to have a lot of fun today, so I say let's get going.
Right.
Should I go up as well, grant?
Um, if you'd like to meet the young ladies.
I never turn down an opportunity to meet a young lady.
Poppy, I've got a Georgie cam.
Hello, Georgie cam.
This is my camera.
Say hello.
Hello.
I love my makeup.
It's pageant, but it's subtle, too.
Yes.
Now let's go out there and get that crown, right?
Yeah.
I thought I was going to be the only one in red.
No.
Narrator:
Meanwhile, Georgie takes a front-row seat with the judges.
Let's get the party started with the introduction of this evening's delegates.
So what do you aspire -- who do you look up to?
Just imagine -- who is it?
Tell me a person.
Probably me.
[ Applause ]
That's not my sister.
Someone said that I look like George w.
Bush's wife.
So that's lovely.
Woman:
Up next is delegate number 2, poppy.
There she is.
Yes, poppy!
Narrator:
The first part of the competition is the interview.
What qualities do you look for in a friend?
Qualities I look for in a friend, um, the main one is total obedience, because basically I have this friend called Tabitha, and she never did what I said, and she's really annoying, and she thought she was
really pretty, but she wasn't actually that pretty!
So probably I'd say that I like people a bit more like Millie, because she just does what I say.
I've got one eye on fashion, one eye on current affairs, and the other on the prize.
Simply put, if life hands you lemons, give the lemons to someone else, and they can make you something lemony.
I don't know what.
I'm an ambassador for world peace, not a chef.
Thank you.
10 out of 10.
Narrator:
Once the interviews are concluded, the girls return to the stage in evening wear for the prize-gmng.
Woman:
Audience, drumroll, please.
Hold on, hold on.
Wait for camera.
Wait for camera.
He's a funny little man.
He's my son.
Is he?
Well-done, you.
Woman:
Ladies and gentlemen, your new miss broward county fair international is...
Poppy!
Oh!
Brilliant!
I'd like to dedicate this to all of my ugly friends to show it's okay, because I'm pretty on behalf of all of us.
World peace.
Narrator:
Poppy and Georgie Carlton are in the United States of America, investigating the theme of beauty.
I'd like to dedicate this to all of my ugly friends.
Narrator:
Their guide on the subject, Mario Lopez, has been helping them on their journey.
"When a lady has no clothes on, how beautiful does she have to be to notice her face?"
How beautiful does she have to be to notice her own face, or are you asking me how beautiful she had to be for me to notice her face?
How...
I don't know.
I'm trying to tie my head round it.
"When a lady has no clothes on --" that bit makes sense, 'cause...
I got that.
I think it might be to not notice her face.
Does that make more sense?
Or for you to notice her face.
That would make more sense.
"When a lady has --" maybe just we know what this bit means.
"When a lady has no clothes on..."
You can stop right there.
It's fine.
"Why is a man with no shirt more beautiful than a man with no pants?"
It leaves nothing to the imagination, so maybe ladies are disappointed.
They like a little mystery.
Also, I think maybe you're right, the build-up's better than the reality, because quite frankly, a lot of them --
I've been in the showers after a game of cricket before, and some of them are much more purple than you were expecting.
Okay.
Well, I can't, you know...
Speak on that experience, but I'm -- take your word for it.
Narrator:
Digging deeper into the subject of beauty,
Georgie is investigating how a man can be beautiful.
The siblings are meeting peaches Christ, who runs a different type of pageant.
Georgie.
Peaches.
Nice to meet you.
So, I don't know if you guys are aware, but we're not actually women.
It's hard to tell.
So, we're gonna -- we're gonna costume you to compete with the other drag queens in the pageant tonight.
So, this pageant is really looking for the next talented drag queen, and we really think that you have a shot at winning over the judges.
So, you will perform a number.
So if there's a song that you know particularly well, preferably with female vocals...
I'm sure I can think of something.
Perfect.
And do you have a drag name chosen?
One of mother's friends, who I quite admire, is called lady hollingsworth.
My friend Duffy, when he sees a lady with an impressive front section, he shouts "badonkadonk."
Uh-huh.
So I was thinking lady hollingsworth-badonkadonk.
When we were talking, we thought of a few others.
I don't know.
What did you think?
Well, playing on Georgie, maybe Georgie o'[Bleep].
Both:
What does that mean?
Well, you don't have [Bleep] in england?
So [Bleep] when air gets inside of a woman's vagina, and as it escapes it sort of makes an audible noise.
A pilates pop.
Yes, a pilates pop.
My friend Tabitha does that.
She's got really weak stomach muscles.
I've never had that problem.
But it's basically a vagina fart.
Maybe go with lady hollingsworth-badonkadonk.
It's a little bit more polite.
Oh.
Do I look halfway between a sperm and me?
Do you ever think you might be overdoing it?
Well, look at it this way -- this is exactly how I start my makeup, and I look fabulous.
Narrator:
Poppy excuses herself, leaving Georgie to emulate his sister's unique style in an attempt to maximize his live performance.
[ Laughing ]
Do I look like you?
You've got my mole.
Yeah, but a sparkly version.
[ Cheers and applause ]
Hello, everybody.
[ Cheers and applause ]
So, this first number is actually being performed by someone who's presenting their first time in drag to you.
[ Cheers and applause ] So...
He -- or she and her sister are descendants of royalty from the u.K.
So you guys ready for her?
You're gonna give her some love?
[ Cheers and applause ] Let's bring her out.
Lady hollingsworth-badonkadonk!
Here she is!
Narrator:
As a final homage to his sister,
Georgie is performing his own interpretation of poppy's single, "everyone knows it but me."
♪♪
♪ if you've been looking for love ♪
♪ you can call off your search
♪ it's cool
♪ I'm so beautiful
♪ and everyone knows it but me [ cheers and applause ]
Thank you, lady hollingsworth-badonkadonk.
Apparently drag entertainment is much different in the u.K.
♪♪
Check it out, romance stories set in a firehouse.
Can you imagine the hellfire of crap I'd get if anyone around here found out I was doing this?
What do you say we write together and go get published?
You know I love you and I support you no matter what you do.
Maybe I can scale back at work and...
No.
You can't force yourself into wanting this right now just because of how much I do.
Okay, stuffed animal, sippy cup.
You are all set, buddy.
You can take him to lunch after you pick him up, but please, no drive-through.
What?
I'm dropping him off.
Bonnie's picking him up.
No, no, I told you that I canceled Bonnie because you're free.
You didn't tell me, and I'm not free.
I took the shift off to check out this warehouse.
Well, you told me it would only take a few hours.
That's plenty of time to pick up Louie at 1:00.
Perfect.
I'm playing golf at 1:00.
What?
Didn't mean to interrupt.
You ready to go?
Yeah.
Casey was just about to say how he's gonna cancel his golf game so he can pick Louie up later.
I'll be in the car.
Guess I'll play golf another time.
Better get going.
- Alderman Casey.
- Hey.
Gary Melville.
Thanks for coming out.
Thanks for opening up your warehouse on a Saturday.
It's no problem.
Although I thought the contract was a done deal.
I mean, we do have the best decontamination supplies in Chicago.
Vote's all set for Monday.
I just heard no one had been by to actually look things over.
Well, who better than a real Chicago firefighter, right?
Come on in.
This way.
Come on.
No, no, hold it there for a sec.
You machine your own aluminum?
Absolutely, we manufacture all of our decontamination pools on site, so we can supply emergency response to any Hazmat situation.
As you can see, we keep the frames folded for easy transport...
Hey, I've got all those specs that you were looking for over here in my office.
You always have kids hanging around here?
That's Laurel; that's Ken's daughter.
Hi.
I could've stayed home, but no.
Stuck here doing slave labor.
Don't wanna paint, don't get grounded.
Get back in the break room.
Whatever.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Watch out!
God!
Milo, look out!
What the hell?
What the hell?
You gotta get away from these fumes!
Run outside and call 911!
Right!
Dad?
Wait, what happened?
An accident.
Your dad inhaled some fumes.
We gotta block that off, or we're dead.
Here, use this.
You need to to cut up this drop cloth in wide pieces, roll 'em up, stuff 'em underneath.
Got that?
Here, take it.
Go.
Now.
Okay.
Is he okay?
His acid burns aren't too bad.
He's breathing on his own, which is a good sign.
Gary's calling 911, so the medics will be here soon.
Wait.
Where's Milo?
Is he still out there?
Your dad's forklift ran into a tank of something toxic.
My guess is sulfuric acid.
Is he...
He didn't make it.
My God.
My God.
- Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, wait.
- My God, my God, my God, my God!
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, Laurel.
Right?
Yeah.
My name's Matt Casey.
I'm a firefighter.
I know you're freaked out, but we're safe in here for the moment.
What I need you to do is sit with your dad and keep an eye on him for me.
Can you do that?
Okay, good.
Daddy?
What in God's name is that?
This is beef jerky mac.
That, my friend, is disgusting.
This is the food of the future.
It's packed with lean protein.
You just add water.
Best science has to offer.
Delicious.
Delicious science.
Leave him alone.
He wants to eat slop in a sack, let him.
Well, that wouldn't be my choice, but we could all stand to be more thoughtful about the food that we eat.
Good for you for trying something new.
See?
Vision, bifocals.
My breakfast is a federal case, but that we're all just gonna ignore?
What are those two up to?
Ignorance is bliss.
Mr. Morley.
Randy McHolland.
That is a great author name.
Sylvie Brett.
Okay.
Can we sit?
We haven't discussed our little project here at work yet.
We're keeping it "on the down low," so to speak.
Say no more.
Next meeting...
Maggiano's.
My treat.
Wow.
So, this book, what do you call it?
- "Flames of Desire." - "Sheets on Fire."
Really?
Like "pants on fire?"
Whatever it's called, it's hot stuff.
Pun intended.
We're ready to publish.
My gosh.
...I gotta tell you,
I lost track of how many queries I sent out, but this... this makes it all worth it.
All we need to get started is you write me a check for $5,000.
- What?
- It's totally standard, covers upfront expenses.
I'm sorry, what's the name of your company again?
Fireworks Publishing.
Best vanity press in Chicago.
Ambulance 61, injury from a fall, 2012 Princeton Ave., Apartment 6.
So what's going on with you and Mouch?
Nothing.
He's just giving me some advice on a business matter...
Some personal investments.
Okay.
Pupils are normal.
I'm fine.
Just one of my dizzy spells.
Well, you had to go down pretty hard to get a scrape like that.
I put my hand out to steady myself.
My skin is so thin now.
It looks like your blood pressure's running on the low end.
Do you drink enough water?
- I try.
- So it's just a fall, nothing serious?
Courtney Jackson.
I work with the city as a senior advocate.
Courtney's a huge help.
She gets me discounts on everything.
Well, your scrape's not too bad, but it sounds like you have a lot of these dizzy spells.
What happens when you can't call for help next time?
Maybe I should get one of those alert necklaces.
Well, our concern is that we don't know if these spells are caused by your low blood pressure or something more serious.
We should get you checked out at Chicago Med.
You know, I'm feeling better.
I don't need to go to the hospital.
Can we speak over here?
I'm here to make sure our seniors aren't bullied into something they don't want.
Bullied?
We just want what's best for the patient.
I get that, but Margot's mentally competent to make her own decisions, and it's my job to support her.
Are you with her 24 hours a day?
You going to make sure she's drinking enough water to keep her blood pressure up?
If this is even because of that.
If she's having multiple falls, she shouldn't be living alone.
I'll make a note of that opinion.
I'm sure Margot will call if she needs help again.
You can't get a signal in here.
Trust me, I've tried.
We should be hearing sirens by now.
Grounded?
I snuck out, stayed out late.
How late is "late"?
1:00 in the morning.
Yeah.
I'm Team Dad on that one.
What are you, 14?
15.
He's out late all the time, working.
Can't believe he even noticed I was gone... or cared.
He's your dad.
Of course he cares.
You know who says stuff like that?
People whose dads took them fishing a lot.
Actually, my dad died when I was a little older than you.
My mom died last year.
I'm sorry.
Whatever.
It sucks.
Yeah.
It does.
What's wrong?
I was just checking to see how things were out there.
I know what it looks like when grown-ups lie.
Looks like Gary tried to go back to his office before he went outside.
Why would he do that?
Probably to get rid of the records of what he was up to here.
The point is the fumes got him.
He never called 911.
- Nobody's coming.
- Nope.
God.
Dad?
What's that?
Baking soda helps neutralize the acid.
It won't work for long.
Dad?
Daddy?
Dad!
- What happened?
- Forklift pierced a tank.
Come on.
- God.
God.
- Easy, take it easy.
Gary said to stack the drums high enough to hide the tanks.
I'm guessing he doesn't have a permit to store sulfuric acid.
The guy never met a corner he couldn't cut.
He's making cash on the side storing the tanks for a friend.
And you brought me here?
What was I supposed to do, leave you at home alone?
Guys, what's on the other side of this vent?
- Office.
- With a landline?
Yeah.
What the hell are you doing?
How long have you all been here?
So, what's going on here?
Are you having a mental event of some sort?
Mars.
It's a privately funded project to train and send civilians to form the first human habitats on Mars, and I made the top 100.
- Yeah, he did!
Ha ha!
- There he is!
There he is!
Your application must have been... impressive.
I wrote a great personal essay, okay?
And Cruz here helped me bring it to tip-top shape.
You encouraged this?
He asks, I help.
Anyway, they sent over a list of tasks for ultimate mission fitness.
And putting together a fan while holding your breath was on it?
Repairing an oxygen filtration system in case of critical error.
Okay.
We need to widen this up if I'm gonna get through.
- Or I could go.
- No way.
I can fit.
All I have to do is call 911, right?
Yeah.
I can do it.
Okay.
Just go in, use the phone, come back.
Okay.
Laurel.
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, come back, come back.
Okay.
Hold on.
The fumes are already in there.
We need to seal this off.
Mr. Casey.
Perfect.
Yeah, hold this.
Two more.
Here.
What is it?
What is it?
- Nothing.
- The hell it is.
What is it?
The acid's moving toward a pile of aluminum shavings.
So?
When sulfuric acid touches aluminum, there's a chemical reaction.
Acid hits those shavings, there's gonna be an explosion.
We gotta get out of here.
I mean, golf?
Really?
And then for him to have the nerve to be annoyed with me, to tell me I didn't tell him that I canceled Bonnie?
Dawson, no offense.
Maybe you should be talking to Casey.
What am I supposed to say?
"I'd rather you not prioritize a golf game over our kid?"
I mean, I kind of thought that was implied.
Okay, take a breath.
Hang on.
Now, do you really think that Casey cares more about golf than Louie?
No.
But I did tell him.
He forgot.
You both have a lot going on.
This is the first time that Louie saw us fight.
If that's a fight, he'll be fine.
- Ambulance 61.
- Thank you.
Elderly person injured from fall, 2012 Princeton Ave, Apartment 6.
I heard a thump and I knocked and I got no answer, so I used my key.
Is she okay?
I'm fine.
Just a little bump.
You're gonna have to get some stitches.
- Call Courtney.
- I already did.
Just pop a bandage on it.
You already fell once, and now you got a head injury.
We gotta take you to a trauma center.
It's protocol.
I want to go to North-side, not Chicago Med.
Rules are we have to take you to the nearest hospital.
I don't want to go to a strange doctor who doesn't know my history.
They know me at North-side.
They have... all my...
my... my...
Records.
Let's just see if we...
She's out.
Margot?
Margot?
Margot, see if you can follow my finger with your eyes.
Try not to talk, sweetie, just look at Gabby's finger.
Great.
See if you can squeeze both my hands, honey.
We gotta move.
What's wrong?
What happened?
She had a stroke is what happened.
She's had a T.I.A. before.
Her neurologist is at North-side.
North-side is ten minutes farther away.
She has a request on file.
It's my responsibility to speak for her.
You can speak for her at Med.
For you.
My department chief with a direct order to transport Margot to North-side.
Great.
Let me talk to him.
We're going to Med.
What are you doing?
This pipe goes clear through to the next room.
If I get a little leverage...
Mr. Casey?
Give me a hand.
Just hold that.
You all right, Ken?
I'm just... a little winded.
- Dad?
- Why don't you lie down, rest for a minute?
- All right.
- Dad?
Are you okay?
Dad?
Laurel.
Give me your shirt.
Okay.
Here.
It's okay.
Okay, give me your hand.
It'll make you feel better, Ken.
What?
Okay.
I want you to tie this around your dad's face and mouth, like a mask.
Okay.
- Here.
- Okay.
Lunch already?
Yeah, lasagna or Chicken Ã la King.
Frankly, I'm thinking about doubling up, because that beef jerky mac just did not stick to the ribs.
Funny you should say that.
I've been reading up on alternate protein sources, and...
Cricket protein powder.
It makes any food more filling, and I guess you can raise crickets in zero gravity, so endless food supply.
Interesting, and... disgusting.
Nah, man, look. "Virtually tasteless in a smoothie or shake."
You should give it a try.
Okay.
Thanks.
No problem.
You're telling me that getting treatment started ten minutes earlier didn't make a difference?
'Cause I heard she already started recovering movement.
No.
What I'm telling you is that I find it hard to believe that there's no way to achieve that result without destroying a city employee's property.
I didn't destroy her property.
I dropped it.
It slipped.
My life was so much easier when you were a firefighter, and here you are, back on ambo, raising my blood pressure one shift at a time.
- If doing right by my patient...
- I'm not disputing your medical judgment.
I'm just saying there's better ways to go do things.
Well, maybe I just don't have your gift of diplomacy.
Gabby.
Brett, what's your take on the situation?
I stand by my partner.
This is par for the course with Dawson, but I expected better of you, Brett.
I'm sorry to hear my confidence has been misplaced.
You can both go.
Welcome to the troublemaker list, girl.
Don't ever put me in that position again.
Come on, Hatcher's just a blowhard who's pissed he's gotta do more paperwork.
Well, I'm not like you, Gabby.
I like following the rules.
I like being liked by my boss.
Showdowns with Hatcher aren't exactly fun for me.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
It's just... that guy just really pushes my buttons.
But, you got to admit, it was kind of fun watching him get all red.
Louie's daycare.
Go for it.
Hello?
No, no, it should've been Matt Casey.
You couldn't?
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'll call his sitter.
She'll be right there.
Bonnie, hey.
I'm gonna need you to pick up Louie after all.
Mr. Casey?
The acid's hitting the shavings.
It's hissing.
Dad?
Daddy?
Daddy!
Laurel, I need you to see if you can fit through that hole.
But...
Is that the explosion?
No, that would be louder, but I need you to tell me what's happening in there.
Okay, okay.
The box on the wall is shooting sparks everywhere!
Laurel, listen, the acid's hitting the conduit on the warehouse floor.
I need you to go through that hole, go out the door, and call 911.
What?
What about my dad?
I need to stay here to help him.
It has to be you.
No, no, no, no.
No, I can't do that, I can't leave him, not after my mom...
Laurel.
I'm sorry about your mom.
It's not fair you have to worry about your dad, too.
Nobody else is dying today.
Not if you do what I'm asking you.
Okay.
Here, use this.
Cover your head with it, it'll shield you from the sparks.
Okay.
After your dad died, did your mom still make you act like a family?
Not exactly.
Dad made us have these family dinners.
God, I hated them.
Laurel, we're out of time.
If he wakes up, can you tell him dinners weren't so bad?
I'll tell him.
We're out of time!
Go!
Go!
Now!
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Okay.
How you doing, Laurel?
I'm good!
Okay.
This isn't over.
We just need to do a rewrite, send more queries.
And meet more scam artists?
Maybe... we need more...
interpersonal conflict.
We're conflicting right now.
You think it's sexy?
I will quit right now if you can look me in the eye and tell me this hasn't been the most fun you've had all year.
Okay, what if the ambo partners are really different?
One is a wholesome good girl, and the other's rebellious and feisty and...
They make out?
They clash.
But they ultimately realize that their differences make them great.
And then they make out.
Hey.
You mind if we go for a ride?
Sure.
Sure, what is it?
Probably nothing.
I just want to make sure that...
Truck 81, Ambulance 61, Squad 3.
Industrial accident.
Acid spill. 625...
God, that's Matt's truck.
Please, hurry!
You guys gotta help!
My dad and Mr. Casey are still inside!
Okay.
You tell me as much as you can.
There was acid.
We got stuck in the break room.
Mr. Casey blew a hole in the wall to get out, but now that room has sparks and fire and...
Okay, okay.
Battalion 25 to Main, requesting a power shutoff at my location.
Herrmann, find a way to cut the power on site.
All right, hey, split up!
Cover the sides!
Find me those meters.
Everybody mask up.
Tony, Capp, grab your chemical extinguishers.
Cruz, couple sledgehammers.
On it.
Come on, let's get you checked out.
Gabby?
Casey!
Severide?
I got fumes coming in from the spill area!
One civilian.
I had to improvise a cric!
All right.
You gotta make the hole big enough to get him out on a backboard!
Tony, Capp, take an extinguisher to that panel!
Cruz, we'll use sledges on this hole!
Otis, we could really use that power cutoff!
Truck's on it.
Pulling!
Pulling!
Pulling!
Ken, I know it's hard, but it's better if you stay still?
She's okay.
She got out.
She wanted me to tell you, she didn't mind the dinners.
After we get out of here, you should try doing those again?
Pulling!
Power should be off!
Negative!
It's still hot!
We're getting pinned down in here!
Yeah, we're gonna have to pull the main line feed out of the meter.
- You all ready?
- Yeah.
One, two, pull!
How you doing in there?
Power's off.
We're secure.
Capp, grab a backboard!
Casey, you all right?
Hazmat on site.
Entering building now.
Daddy!
All the way up.
Pick him up there.
Pick him up.
Good.
Got him?
- You okay?
- I'm good.
- We should get you checked out.
- I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Hey.
You got a great kid, you know that?
Thank you.
- What's this?
- Spicy Margarita.
I'm trying to convince Herrmann to put it on the menu.
It's great.
What's in it?
- Right?
- No.
It's lime, tequila, jalapeño...
Couple of secret ingredients.
It's awesome.
Hey, so I have a little bit of news.
I... am...
leaving Chicago.
- What?
- Yeah.
I found a simulation Mission:
Mars capsule in Australia, right?
So I'm gonna go down there for six months, I'm gonna train.
Sold all my stuff to some guy online, he agreed to buy it, 1,500 bucks.
He's gonna come down with a truck, he's gonna pick it up tomorrow.
You need a new couch, by the way.
Okay, no, wait, this is nuts, man.
You can't do this.
We're talking about my dreams here.
Okay.
Look, Otis, I hate to say this, man, but...
I made it up.
- What?
- The email, the shortlist, I made it all up.
Look, I started reading up on this, and if you actually go, it's literally forever.
And if anything goes wrong, you get, like, suffocated to death.
Like, I thought you were gonna see how crazy this thing is, and then just get over it, not sell our couch...
Which we both bought, by the way...
And move to Australia!
You knew.
How long?
Since the cricket powder.
Good one.
God, I'm so glad you like it, by the way.
Yeah.
Hey, hey.
Where is she?
The... that girl.
Who?
Sylvie Brett.
Do you mind explaining this text you sent to my husband?
"The girls can make out if you want."
- Dear Lord.
- That's right, genius.
You grabbed my phone and left yours at home.
Trudy, it is... it is not what you think.
We... we wrote a romance novel.
W-we were just trying to figure out how to spice it up to get publishers interested.
Randall?
How many times have I told you about my college roommate Lola and her husband Anton's job... in publishing?
A lot?
I can get you a read, like that.
Well, that'd be great.
This one.
This one, he's an idiot.
Such an idiot.
Dr. Bruce, telephone please.
Dr. Bruce, telephone please.
We're gonna screw up.
You know, the both of us.
I mean, this is all still really new.
I know.
But I love you.
And I'm not going anywhere.
I love you too.
You know, there are easier ways to get me to let you play golf.
Getting trapped by acid a little over the top?
Just a bit.
Should we go in?
Nah.
They have everything they need.
Hey.
You ready to go?
Check it out, romance stories set in a firehouse.
Can you imagine the hellfire of crap I'd get if anyone around here found out I was doing this?
What do you say we write together and go get published?
You know I love you and I support you no matter what you do.
Maybe I can scale back at work and...
No.
You can't force yourself into wanting this right now just because of how much I do.
Okay, stuffed animal, sippy cup.
You are all set, buddy.
You can take him to lunch after you pick him up, but please, no drive-through.
What?
I'm dropping him off.
Bonnie's picking him up.
No, no, I told you that I canceled Bonnie because you're free.
Uh, you didn't tell me, and I'm not free.
I took the shift off to check out this warehouse.
Well, you told me it would only take a few hours.
That's plenty of time to pick up Louie at 1:00.
Perfect.
I'm playing golf at 1:00.
What?
Didn't mean to interrupt.
You ready to go?
Yeah.
Casey was just about to say how he's gonna cancel his golf game so he can pick Louie up later.
I'll be in the car.
Guess I'll play golf another time.
Better get going.
- Alderman Casey.
- Hey.
Gary Melville.
Thanks for coming out.
Thanks for opening up your warehouse on a Saturday.
It's no problem.
Although I thought the contract was a done deal.
I mean, we do have the best decontamination supplies in Chicago.
Vote's all set for Monday.
I just heard no one had been by to actually look things over.
Huh.
Well, who better than a real Chicago firefighter, right?
Come on in.
This way.
Come on.
No, no, hold it there for a sec.
You machine your own aluminum?
Oh, absolutely, we manufacture all of our decontamination pools on site, so we can supply emergency response to any Hazmat situation.
As you can see, we keep the frames folded for easy transport...
Hey, I've got all those specs that you were looking for over here in my office.
You always have kids hanging around here?
That's Laurel; that's Ken's daughter.
Hi.
I could've stayed home, but no.
Stuck here doing slave labor.
Don't wanna paint, don't get grounded.
Get back in the break room.
Whatever.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Watch out!
Oh, God!
Milo, look out!
Ah, ah, ah!
Ah!
What the hell?
What the hell?
You gotta get away from these fumes!
Run outside and call 911!
Right!
Dad?
Wait, what happened?
An accident.
Your dad inhaled some fumes.
Huh?
We gotta block that off, or we're dead.
Here, use this.
You need to to cut up this drop cloth in wide pieces, roll 'em up, stuff 'em underneath.
Got that?
Here, take it.
Go.
Now.
Okay.
Is he okay?
His acid burns aren't too bad.
He's breathing on his own, which is a good sign.
Gary's calling 911, so the medics will be here soon.
Wait.
Where's Milo?
Is he still out there?
Your dad's forklift ran into a tank of something toxic.
My guess is sulfuric acid.
Is he...
He didn't make it.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, wait.
- Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, Laurel.
Right?
Yeah.
My name's Matt Casey.
I'm a firefighter.
I know you're freaked out, but we're safe in here for the moment.
What I need you to do is sit with your dad and keep an eye on him for me.
Can you do that?
Okay, good.
Daddy?
What in God's name is that?
This is beef jerky mac.
That, my friend, is disgusting.
Oh, this is the food of the future.
It's packed with lean protein.
You just add water.
Best science has to offer.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
Mmm.
Delicious.
Delicious science.
Ah, leave him alone.
He wants to eat slop in a sack, let him.
Well, that wouldn't be my choice, but we could all stand to be more thoughtful about the food that we eat.
Good for you for trying something new.
See?
Vision, bifocals.
Oh, my breakfast is a federal case, but that we're all just gonna ignore?
What are those two up to?
Ignorance is bliss.
Mr. Morley.
Randy McHolland.
That is a great author name.
Sylvie Brett.
Okay.
Can we sit?
We haven't discussed our little project here at work yet.
We're keeping it "on the down low," so to speak.
Oh.
Say no more.
Next meeting...
Maggiano's.
My treat.
Wow.
So, this book, what do you call it?
- "Flames of Desire." - "Sheets on Fire."
Really?
Like "pants on fire?"
Whatever it's called, it's hot stuff.
Pun intended.
We're ready to publish.
Oh, my gosh.
Uh...
I gotta tell you,
I lost track of how many queries I sent out, but this... this makes it all worth it.
All we need to get started is you write me a check for $5,000.
- What?
- Oh, it's totally standard, covers upfront expenses.
I'm sorry, what's the name of your company again?
Fireworks Publishing.
Best vanity press in Chicago.
Ambulance 61, injury from a fall, 2012 Princeton Ave., Apartment 6.
So what's going on with you and Mouch?
Nothing.
He's just giving me some advice on a business matter...
Some personal investments.
Okay.
Pupils are normal.
I'm fine.
Just one of my dizzy spells.
Well, you had to go down pretty hard to get a scrape like that.
I put my hand out to steady myself.
My skin is so thin now.
It looks like your blood pressure's running on the low end.
Do you drink enough water?
- I try.
- So it's just a fall, nothing serious?
Courtney Jackson.
I work with the city as a senior advocate.
Courtney's a huge help.
She gets me discounts on everything.
Well, your scrape's not too bad, but it sounds like you have a lot of these dizzy spells.
What happens when you can't call for help next time?
Maybe I should get one of those alert necklaces.
Hmm, well, our concern is that we don't know if these spells are caused by your low blood pressure or something more serious.
We should get you checked out at Chicago Med.
You know, I'm feeling better.
I don't need to go to the hospital.
Can we speak over here?
I'm here to make sure our seniors aren't bullied into something they don't want.
Bullied?
We just want what's best for the patient.
I get that, but Margot's mentally competent to make her own decisions, and it's my job to support her.
Are you with her 24 hours a day?
You going to make sure she's drinking enough water to keep her blood pressure up?
If this is even because of that.
If she's having multiple falls, she shouldn't be living alone.
I'll make a note of that opinion.
I'm sure Margot will call if she needs help again.
You can't get a signal in here.
Trust me, I've tried.
We should be hearing sirens by now.
Grounded, huh?
I snuck out, stayed out late.
How late is "late"?
1:00 in the morning.
Yeah.
I'm Team Dad on that one.
What are you, 14?
15.
He's out late all the time, working.
Can't believe he even noticed I was gone... or cared.
He's your dad.
Of course he cares.
You know who says stuff like that?
People whose dads took them fishing a lot.
Actually, my dad died when I was a little older than you.
Oh.
My mom died last year.
I'm sorry.
Whatever.
It sucks.
Yeah.
It does.
What's wrong?
I was just checking to see how things were out there.
I know what it looks like when grown-ups lie.
Looks like Gary tried to go back to his office before he went outside.
Why would he do that?
Probably to get rid of the records of what he was up to here.
The point is the fumes got him.
He never called 911.
- Nobody's coming.
- Nope.
Oh, God.
Dad?
What's that?
Baking soda helps neutralize the acid.
It won't work for long.
Dad?
Daddy?
Oh.
Dad!
- What happened?
- Forklift pierced a tank.
- Oh!
- Come on.
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
- Easy, take it easy.
Gary said to stack the drums high enough to hide the tanks.
I'm guessing he doesn't have a permit to store sulfuric acid.
The guy never met a corner he couldn't cut.
He's making cash on the side storing the tanks for a friend.
And you brought me here?
What was I supposed to do, leave you at home alone?
Guys, what's on the other side of this vent?
- Office.
- With a landline?
Yeah.
What the hell are you doing?
How long have you all been here?
So, what's going on here?
Are you having a mental event of some sort?
Mars.
It's a privately funded project to train and send civilians to form the first human habitats on Mars, and I made the top 100.
- Yeah, he did!
Ha ha!
- There he is!
- There he is!
- Ah.
Your application must have been... impressive.
I wrote a great personal essay, okay?
And Cruz here helped me bring it to tip-top shape.
You encouraged this?
He asks, I help.
Anyway, they sent over a list of tasks for ultimate mission fitness.
And putting together a fan while holding your breath was on it?
Repairing an oxygen filtration system in case of critical error.
Okay.
We need to widen this up if I'm gonna get through.
- Or I could go.
- No way.
I can fit.
All I have to do is call 911, right?
Yeah.
I can do it.
Okay.
Just go in, use the phone, come back.
Okay.
Laurel.
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, come back, come back.
Okay.
Hold on.
The fumes are already in there.
We need to seal this off.
Mr. Casey.
Perfect.
Yeah, hold this.
Two more.
Here.
What is it?
What is it?
- Nothing.
- The hell it is.
What is it?
The acid's moving toward a pile of aluminum shavings.
So?
When sulfuric acid touches aluminum, there's a chemical reaction.
Acid hits those shavings, there's gonna be an explosion.
We gotta get out of here.
I mean, golf?
Really?
And then for him to have the nerve to be annoyed with me, to tell me I didn't tell him that I canceled Bonnie?
Dawson, no offense.
Maybe you should be talking to Casey.
What am I supposed to say?
"I'd rather you not prioritize a golf game over our kid?"
I mean, I kind of thought that was implied.
Okay, take a breath.
Hang on.
Now, do you really think that Casey cares more about golf than Louie?
No.
But I did tell him.
He forgot.
You both have a lot going on.
This is the first time that Louie saw us fight.
If that's a fight, he'll be fine.
- Ambulance 61.
- Thank you.
Elderly person injured from fall, 2012 Princeton Ave, Apartment 6.
I heard a thump and I knocked and I got no answer, so I used my key.
Is she okay?
I'm fine.
Just a little bump.
You're gonna have to get some stitches.
- Call Courtney.
- I already did.
Just pop a bandage on it.
You already fell once, and now you got a head injury.
We gotta take you to a trauma center.
It's protocol.
I want to go to North-side, not Chicago Med.
Rules are we have to take you to the nearest hospital.

Great.
See if you can squeeze both my hands, honey.
We gotta move.

You can speak for her at Med.
For you.
My department chief with a direct order to transport Margot to North-side.
Oh.
Great.
Let me talk to him.
We're going to Med.
What are you doing?
This pipe goes clear through to the next room.
If I get a little leverage...
Mr. Casey?
Give me a hand.
Just hold that.
You all right, Ken?
I'm just... a little winded.
- Dad?
- Why don't you lie down, rest for a minute?
- All right.
- Dad?
Are you okay?
Dad?
Laurel.
Give me your shirt.
Okay.
Here.
It's okay.
Okay, give me your hand.
It'll make you feel better, Ken.
What?
Okay.
I want you to tie this around your dad's face and mouth, like a mask.
Okay.
- Here.
- Okay.
Oh.
Lunch already?
Yeah, lasagna or Chicken à la King.
Frankly, I'm thinking about doubling up, because that beef jerky mac just did not stick to the ribs.
Funny you should say that.
I've been reading up on alternate protein sources, and...
Cricket protein powder.
It makes any food more filling, and I guess you can raise crickets in zero gravity, so endless food supply.
Interesting, and... disgusting.
Nah, man, look. "Virtually tasteless in a smoothie or shake." Huh.
You should give it a try.
Okay.
Thanks.
No problem.
You're telling me that getting treatment started ten minutes earlier didn't make a difference?
'Cause I heard she already started recovering movement.
No.
What I'm telling you is that I find it hard to believe that there's no way to achieve that result without destroying a city employee's property.
I didn't destroy her property.
I dropped it.
It slipped.
My life was so much easier when you were a firefighter, and here you are, back on ambo, raising my blood pressure one shift at a time.
- If doing right by my patient...
- I'm not disputing your medical judgment.
I'm just saying there's better ways to go do things.
Well, maybe I just don't have your gift of diplomacy.
Gabby.
Brett, what's your take on the situation?
I stand by my partner.
This is par for the course with Dawson, but I expected better of you, Brett.
I'm sorry to hear my confidence has been misplaced.
You can both go.
Welcome to the troublemaker list, girl.
Don't ever put me in that position again.
Oh, come on, Hatcher's just a blowhard who's pissed he's gotta do more paperwork.
Well, I'm not like you, Gabby.
I like following the rules.
I like being liked by my boss.
Showdowns with Hatcher aren't exactly fun for me.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
It's just... that guy just really pushes my buttons.
But, you got to admit, it was kind of fun watching him get all red.
Uh, Louie's daycare.
Go for it.
Hello?
No, uh, no, it should've been Matt Casey.
You couldn't?
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'll call his sitter.
She'll be right there.
Bonnie, hey.
I'm gonna need you to pick up Louie after all.
Mr. Casey?
The acid's hitting the shavings.
It's hissing.
Dad?
Daddy?
Daddy!
Laurel, I need you to see if you can fit through that hole.
But...
Is that the explosion?
No, that would be louder, but I need you to tell me what's happening in there.
Okay, okay.
The box on the wall is shooting sparks everywhere!
Laurel, listen, the acid's hitting the conduit on the warehouse floor.
I need you to go through that hole, go out the door, and call 911.
What?
What about my dad?
I need to stay here to help him.
It has to be you.
No, no, no, no.
No, I can't do that, I can't leave him, not after my mom...
Laurel.
I'm sorry about your mom.
It's not fair you have to worry about your dad, too.
Nobody else is dying today.
Not if you do what I'm asking you.
Okay.
Here, use this.
Cover your head with it, it'll shield you from the sparks.
Okay.
After your dad died, did your mom still make you act like a family?
Not exactly.
Dad made us have these family dinners.
God, I hated them.
Laurel, we're out of time.
If he wakes up, can you tell him dinners weren't so bad?
I'll tell him.
We're out of time!
Go!
Go!
Now!
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Okay.
How you doing, Laurel?
I'm good!
Okay.
This isn't over.
We just need to do a rewrite, send more queries.
Oh, and meet more scam artists?
Maybe... we need more...
interpersonal conflict.
We're conflicting right now.
You think it's sexy?
I will quit right now if you can look me in the eye and tell me this hasn't been the most fun you've had all year.
Okay, what if the ambo partners are really different?
One is a wholesome good girl, and the other's rebellious and feisty and...
They make out?
They clash.
But they ultimately realize that their differences make them great.
And then they make out.
Hey.
You mind if we go for a ride?
Sure.
Sure, what is it?
Probably nothing.
I just want to make sure that...
Truck 81, Ambulance 61, Squad 3.
Industrial accident.
Acid spill. 625...
Oh, God, that's Matt's truck.
Please, hurry!
You guys gotta help!
My dad and Mr. Casey are still inside!
Okay.
You tell me as much as you can.
There was acid.
We got stuck in the break room.
Mr. Casey blew a hole in the wall to get out, but now that room has sparks and fire and...
Okay, okay.
Battalion 25 to Main, requesting a power shutoff at my location.
Herrmann, find a way to cut the power on site.
All right, hey, split up!
Cover the sides!
Find me those meters.
Everybody mask up.
Tony, Capp, grab your chemical extinguishers.
Cruz, couple sledgehammers.
On it.
Come on, let's get you checked out.
Gabby?
Casey!
Severide?
I got fumes coming in from the spill area!
One civilian.
I had to improvise a cric!
All right.
You gotta make the hole big enough to get him out on a backboard!
Tony, Capp, take an extinguisher to that panel!
Cruz, we'll use sledges on this hole!
Otis, we could really use that power cutoff!
Truck's on it.
Pulling!
Pulling!
Pulling!
Ken, I know it's hard, but it's better if you stay still, huh?
She's okay.
She got out.
She wanted me to tell you, she didn't mind the dinners.
After we get out of here, you should try doing those again, huh?
Pulling!
Power should be off!
Negative!
It's still hot!
We're getting pinned down in here!
Yeah, we're gonna have to pull the main line feed out of the meter.
- You all ready?
- Yeah.
One, two, pull!
How you doing in there?
Power's off.
We're secure.
Capp, grab a backboard!
Casey, you all right?
Hazmat on site.
Entering building now.
Daddy!
All the way up.
Pick him up there.
Pick him up.
Good.
Got him?
- You okay?
- I'm good.
- We should get you checked out.
- I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Hey.
You got a great kid, you know that?
Thank you.
Phew.
- What's this?
- Spicy Margarita.
I'm trying to convince Herrmann to put it on the menu.
It's great.
What's in it?
- Right?
- No.
It's lime, tequila, jalapeño...
- Mmm.
- Couple of secret ingredients.
It's awesome.
Hey, so I have a little bit of news.
I... am...
leaving Chicago.
- What?
- Yeah.
I found a simulation Mission:
Mars capsule in Australia, right?
So I'm gonna go down there for six months, I'm gonna train.
Sold all my stuff to some guy online, he agreed to buy it, 1,500 bucks.
He's gonna come down with a truck, he's gonna pick it up tomorrow.
You need a new couch, by the way.
Okay, no, wait, this is nuts, man.
You can't do this.
We're talking about my dreams here.
Okay.
Look, Otis, I hate to say this, man, but...
I made it up.
- What?
- The email, the shortlist, I made it all up.
Look, I started reading up on this, and if you actually go, it's literally forever.
And if anything goes wrong, you get, like, suffocated to death.
Like, I thought you were gonna see how crazy this thing is, and then just get over it, not sell our couch...
Which we both bought, by the way...
And move to Australia!
You knew.
How long?
Since the cricket powder.
Good one.
God, I'm so glad you like it, by the way.
Yeah.
Hey, hey.
Where is she?
The... that girl.
Uh, who?
Sylvie Brett.
Huh.
Do you mind explaining this text you sent to my husband?
"The girls can make out if you want."
- Oh, dear Lord.
- That's right, genius.
You grabbed my phone and left yours at home.
Trudy, it is... it is not what you think.
Uh...
Uh, uh...
We... we wrote a romance novel.
W-we were just trying to figure out how to spice it up to get publishers interested.
- Randall?
- Hmm?
How many times have I told you about my college roommate Lola and her husband Anton's job... in publishing?
A lot?
I can get you a read, like that.
Well, that'd be great.
Ah!
Mmm.
This one.
This one, he's an idiot.
Such an idiot.
Dr. Bruce, telephone please.
Dr. Bruce, telephone please.
We're gonna screw up.
You know, the both of us.
I mean, this is all still really new.
I know.
But I love you.
And I'm not going anywhere.
I love you too.
You know, there are easier ways to get me to let you play golf.
Getting trapped by acid a little over the top, huh?
Just a bit.
Should we go in?
Nah.
They have everything they need.
Hey.
You ready to go?
Check it out, romance stories set in a firehouse.
Can you imagine the hellfire of crap I'd get if anyone around here found out I was doing this?
What do you say we write together and go get published?
You know I love you and I support you no matter what you do.
Maybe I can scale back at work and...
No.
You can't force yourself into wanting this right now just because of how much I do.
Okay, stuffed animal, sippy cup.
You are all set, buddy.
You can take him to lunch after you pick him up, but please, no drive-through.
What?
I'm dropping him off.
Bonnie's picking him up.
No, no, I told you that I canceled Bonnie because you're free.
Uh, you didn't tell me, and I'm not free.
I took the shift off to check out this warehouse.
Well, you told me it would only take a few hours.
That's plenty of time to pick up Louie at 1:00.
Perfect.
I'm playing golf at 1:00.
What?
Didn't mean to interrupt.
You ready to go?
Yeah.
Casey was just about to say how he's gonna cancel his golf game so he can pick Louie up later.
I'll be in the car.
Guess I'll play golf another time.
Better get going.
- Alderman Casey.
- Hey.
Gary Melville.
Thanks for coming out.
Thanks for opening up your warehouse on a Saturday.
It's no problem.
Although I thought the contract was a done deal.
I mean, we do have the best decontamination supplies in Chicago.
Vote's all set for Monday.
I just heard no one had been by to actually look things over.
Huh.
Well, who better than a real Chicago firefighter, right?
Come on in.
This way.
Come on.
No, no, hold it there for a sec.
You machine your own aluminum?
Oh, absolutely, we manufacture all of our decontamination pools on site, so we can supply emergency response to any Hazmat situation.
As you can see, we keep the frames folded for easy transport...
Hey, I've got all those specs that you were looking for over here in my office.
You always have kids hanging around here?
That's Laurel; that's Ken's daughter.
Hi.
I could've stayed home, but no.
Stuck here doing slave labor.
Don't wanna paint, don't get grounded.
Get back in the break room.
Whatever.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Watch out!
Oh, God!
Milo, look out!
Ah, ah, ah!
Ah!
[screaming]
What the hell?
[screaming] [screaming]
What the hell?
[screaming]
[groaning]
You gotta get away from these fumes!
Run outside and call 911!
Right!
[groans]
Dad?
Wait, what happened?
An accident.
Your dad inhaled some fumes.
Huh?
We gotta block that off, or we're dead.
Here, use this.
You need to to cut up this drop cloth in wide pieces, roll 'em up, stuff 'em underneath.
Got that?
Here, take it.
Go.
Now.
Okay.
[mumbles]
[grunts]
Is he okay?
His acid burns aren't too bad.
He's breathing on his own, which is a good sign.
Gary's calling 911, so the medics will be here soon.
Wait.
Where's Milo?
Is he still out there?
Your dad's forklift ran into a tank of something toxic.
My guess is sulfuric acid.
Is he...
He didn't make it.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, wait.
- Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, Laurel.
Right?
Yeah.
My name's Matt Casey.
I'm a firefighter.
I know you're freaked out, but we're safe in here for the moment.
What I need you to do is sit with your dad and keep an eye on him for me.
Can you do that?
Okay, good.
Daddy?
[sighs]
What in God's name is that?
This is beef jerky mac.
That, my friend, is disgusting.
Oh, this is the food of the future.
It's packed with lean protein.
You just add water.
Best science has to offer.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
Mmm.
Delicious.
Delicious science.
Ah, leave him alone.
He wants to eat slop in a sack, let him.
Well, that wouldn't be my choice, but we could all stand to be more thoughtful about the food that we eat.
Good for you for trying something new.
See?
Vision, bifocals.
[phone buzzing] [presses button]
Oh, my breakfast is a federal case, but that we're all just gonna ignore?
What are those two up to?
Ignorance is bliss.
Mr. Morley.
Randy McHolland.
That is a great author name.
[laughs]
Sylvie Brett.
Okay.
Can we sit?
We haven't discussed our little project here at work yet.
[whispering] We're keeping it "on the down low," so to speak.
Oh.
Say no more.
Next meeting...
Maggiano's.
My treat.
Wow.
So, this book, what do you call it?
- "Flames of Desire." - "Sheets on Fire."
Really?
Like "pants on fire?"
Whatever it's called, it's hot stuff.
Pun intended. [laughter]
We're ready to publish.
Oh, my gosh.
Uh...
I gotta tell you,
I lost track of how many queries I sent out, but this... this makes it all worth it.
All we need to get started is you write me a check for $5,000.
- What?
- Oh, it's totally standard, covers upfront expenses.
I'm sorry, what's the name of your company again?
Fireworks Publishing.
Best vanity press in Chicago.
[alarm sounding]
Ambulance 61, injury from a fall, 2012 Princeton Ave., Apartment 6.
[siren wailing]
So what's going on with you and Mouch?
Nothing.
He's just giving me some advice on a business matter...
Some personal investments.
Okay.
Pupils are normal.
I'm fine.
Just one of my dizzy spells.
Well, you had to go down pretty hard to get a scrape like that.
I put my hand out to steady myself.
My skin is so thin now.
It looks like your blood pressure's running on the low end.
Do you drink enough water?
- I try.
- So it's just a fall, nothing serious?
Courtney Jackson.
I work with the city as a senior advocate.
Courtney's a huge help.
She gets me discounts on everything. [laughs]
Well, your scrape's not too bad, but it sounds like you have a lot of these dizzy spells.
What happens when you can't call for help next time?
Maybe I should get one of those alert necklaces.
Hmm, well, our concern is that we don't know if these spells are caused by your low blood pressure or something more serious.
We should get you checked out at Chicago Med.
You know, I'm feeling better.
I don't need to go to the hospital.
Can we speak over here?
I'm here to make sure our seniors aren't bullied into something they don't want.
Bullied?
We just want what's best for the patient.
I get that, but Margot's mentally competent to make her own decisions, and it's my job to support her.
Are you with her 24 hours a day?
You going to make sure she's drinking enough water to keep her blood pressure up?
If this is even because of that.
If she's having multiple falls, she shouldn't be living alone.
I'll make a note of that opinion.
I'm sure Margot will call if she needs help again.
You can't get a signal in here.
Trust me, I've tried.
We should be hearing sirens by now.
Grounded, huh?
I snuck out, stayed out late.
How late is "late"?
1:00 in the morning.
Yeah.
I'm Team Dad on that one.
What are you, 14?
15.
He's out late all the time, working.
Can't believe he even noticed I was gone... or cared.
He's your dad.
Of course he cares.
You know who says stuff like that?
People whose dads took them fishing a lot.
Actually, my dad died when I was a little older than you.
Oh.
My mom died last year.
I'm sorry.
Whatever.
It sucks.
Yeah.
It does.
What's wrong?
I was just checking to see how things were out there.
I know what it looks like when grown-ups lie.
[sighs]
Looks like Gary tried to go back to his office before he went outside.
Why would he do that?
Probably to get rid of the records of what he was up to here.
The point is the fumes got him.
He never called 911.
- Nobody's coming.
- Nope.
Oh, God.
- [moans]
- Dad?
[breathes unevenly]
[breathes unevenly]
What's that?
Baking soda helps neutralize the acid.
- [gasps]
- It won't work for long.
[coughs]
Dad?
Daddy?
[mumbling]
Oh. [laughs] Dad!
- What happened?
- Forklift pierced a tank.
- Oh!
[groans]
- Come on.
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
- Easy, take it easy.
Gary said to stack the drums high enough to hide the tanks.
I'm guessing he doesn't have a permit to store sulfuric acid.
The guy never met a corner he couldn't cut.
He's making cash on the side storing the tanks for a friend.
And you brought me here?
What was I supposed to do, leave you at home alone?
Guys, what's on the other side of this vent?
- Office.
- With a landline?
Yeah.
[groans] [exhales sharply] [inhales]
What the hell are you doing?
[surprised gasp]
How long have you all been here?
So, what's going on here?
Are you having a mental event of some sort?
[sighs]
I got shortlisted for Mission:
Mars.
[laughter]
It's a privately funded project to train and send civilians to form the first human habitats on Mars, and I made the top 100.
- Yeah, he did!
Ha ha!
- There he is!
- There he is!
- Ah.
Your application must have been... impressive.
I wrote a great personal essay, okay?
And Cruz here helped me bring it to tip-top shape.
You encouraged this?
He asks, I help.
Anyway, they sent over a list of tasks for ultimate mission fitness.
And putting together a fan while holding your breath was on it?
Repairing an oxygen filtration system in case of critical error.
[laughter] Okay.
[grunts] [groans] [panting]
We need to widen this up if I'm gonna get through.
- Or I could go.
- No way.
I can fit.
All I have to do is call 911, right?
Yeah.
I can do it.
Okay.
Just go in, use the phone, come back.
Okay.
Laurel. [groans] [grunts] [coughs]
- Wait, wait, wait.
- [coughing]
Wait, come back, come back.
Okay.
Hold on.
[camera snap]
The fumes are already in there.
We need to seal this off.
Mr. Casey.
Perfect.
Yeah, hold this.
Two more.
Here.
What is it?
What is it?
- Nothing.
- The hell it is.
What is it?
The acid's moving toward a pile of aluminum shavings.
So?
When sulfuric acid touches aluminum, there's a chemical reaction.
Acid hits those shavings, there's gonna be an explosion.
We gotta get out of here.
I mean, golf?
Really?
And then for him to have the nerve to be annoyed with me, to tell me I didn't tell him that I canceled Bonnie?
Dawson, no offense.
Maybe you should be talking to Casey.
[laughs] What am I supposed to say?
"I'd rather you not prioritize a golf game over our kid?"
I mean, I kind of thought that was implied.
Okay, take a breath.
Hang on.
[sighs]
Now, do you really think that Casey cares more about golf than Louie?
No.
But I did tell him.
He forgot.
You both have a lot going on.
This is the first time that Louie saw us fight.
If that's a fight, he'll be fine.
[chuckles] [alarm blaring]
- Ambulance 61.
- Thank you.
Elderly person injured from fall, 2012 Princeton Ave, Apartment 6.
[siren wailing]
I heard a thump and I knocked and I got no answer, so I used my key.
Is she okay?
I'm fine.
Just a little bump.
You're gonna have to get some stitches.
- Call Courtney.
- I already did.
Just pop a bandage on it.
You already fell once, and now you got a head injury.
We gotta take you to a trauma center.
It's protocol.
I want to go to North-side, not Chicago Med.
Rules are we have to take you to the nearest hospital.
I don't want to go to a strange doctor who doesn't know my history.
They know me at North-side.
They have... all my...
my... my...
Records.
Let's just see if we...
She's out.
[gagging]
[gagging]
Margot?
Margot?
Margot, see if you can follow my finger with your eyes.
Try not to talk, sweetie, just look at Gabby's finger.
Great.
See if you can squeeze both my hands, honey.
We gotta move.
What's wrong?
What happened?
She had a stroke is what happened.
She's had a T.I.A. before.
Her neurologist is at North-side.
North-side is ten minutes farther away.
She has a request on file.
It's my responsibility to speak for her.
You can speak for her at Med.
For you.
My department chief with a direct order to transport Margot to North-side.
Oh.
Great.
Let me talk to him.
We're going to Med.
What are you doing?
This pipe goes clear through to the next room.
[grunts] If I get a little leverage... [grunting]
Mr. Casey?
Give me a hand.
Just hold that.
[coughs] [panting]
You all right, Ken?
I'm just... [groans] a little winded.
- Dad?
- Why don't you lie down, rest for a minute?
[groans] [coughs]
- All right.
- Dad?
Are you okay?
[breathing heavily]
Dad?
Laurel.
Give me your shirt.
Okay.
Here.
- [coughs]
- It's okay.
Okay, give me your hand. [groans]
It'll make you feel better, Ken.
What?
[panting]
Okay.
I want you to tie this around your dad's face and mouth, like a mask.
Okay.
- Here.
- Okay.
Oh.
Lunch already?
Yeah, lasagna or Chicken à la King.
Frankly, I'm thinking about doubling up, because that beef jerky mac just did not stick to the ribs.
Funny you should say that.
I've been reading up on alternate protein sources, and...
Cricket protein powder.
It makes any food more filling, and I guess you can raise crickets in zero gravity, so endless food supply.
Interesting, and... disgusting.
Nah, man, look. "Virtually tasteless in a smoothie or shake." Huh.
You should give it a try.
Okay.
Thanks.
- No problem.
- [groans]
You're telling me that getting treatment started ten minutes earlier didn't make a difference?
'Cause I heard she already started recovering movement.
No.
What I'm telling you is that I find it hard to believe that there's no way to achieve that result without destroying a city employee's property.
I didn't destroy her property.
I dropped it.
It slipped.
My life was so much easier when you were a firefighter, and here you are, back on ambo, raising my blood pressure one shift at a time.
- If doing right by my patient...
- I'm not disputing your medical judgment.
I'm just saying there's better ways to go do things.
Well, maybe I just don't have your gift of diplomacy.
Gabby.
Brett, what's your take on the situation?
I stand by my partner.
This is par for the course with Dawson, but I expected better of you, Brett.
I'm sorry to hear my confidence has been misplaced.
You can both go.
Welcome to the troublemaker list, girl.
Don't ever put me in that position again.
Oh, come on, Hatcher's just a blowhard who's pissed he's gotta do more paperwork.
Well, I'm not like you, Gabby.
I like following the rules.
I like being liked by my boss.
Showdowns with Hatcher aren't exactly fun for me.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
It's just... that guy just really pushes my buttons.
But, you got to admit, it was kind of fun watching him get all red.
[text alert chimes]
Uh, Louie's daycare.
Go for it.
Hello?
No, uh, no, it should've been Matt Casey.
You couldn't?
[chuckles] Okay, I'm sorry.
I'll call his sitter.
She'll be right there.
[beeps]
Bonnie, hey.
I'm gonna need you to pick up Louie after all.
[grunting]
Mr. Casey?
The acid's hitting the shavings.
It's hissing.
[grunting] [grunting loudly]
[grunting]
[gasps] [coughing] [grunting]
Dad?
Daddy?
Daddy!
[grunting]
Laurel, I need you to see if you can fit through that hole.
But... [pop and air escaping]
Is that the explosion?
No, that would be louder, but I need you to tell me what's happening in there.
[sighs] [inhales sharply]
Okay, okay.
[inhales sharply]
[electrical wires sparking and popping]
The box on the wall is shooting sparks everywhere!
Laurel, listen, the acid's hitting the conduit on the warehouse floor.
I need you to go through that hole, go out the door, and call 911.
What?
What about my dad?
I need to stay here to help him.
It has to be you.
No, no, no, no.
No, I can't do that, I can't leave him, not after my mom...
Laurel.
I'm sorry about your mom.
It's not fair you have to worry about your dad, too.
Nobody else is dying today.
Not if you do what I'm asking you.
[sighs] Okay.
Here, use this.
Cover your head with it, it'll shield you from the sparks.
Okay.
After your dad died, did your mom still make you act like a family?
Not exactly.
Dad made us have these family dinners.
God, I hated them.
Laurel, we're out of time.
If he wakes up, can you tell him dinners weren't so bad?
I'll tell him.
[explosion]
We're out of time!
Go!
Go!
Now!
[sobbing] Okay.
Okay, okay.
Okay.
[groans]
[screams]
How you doing, Laurel?
I'm good!
[electrical wires sparking]
Okay.
[panting]
[explosion]
[grunts]
This isn't over.
We just need to do a rewrite, send more queries.
Oh, and meet more scam artists?
Maybe... we need more...
interpersonal conflict.
We're conflicting right now.
You think it's sexy?
I will quit right now if you can look me in the eye and tell me this hasn't been the most fun you've had all year.
Okay, what if the ambo partners are really different?
One is a wholesome good girl, and the other's rebellious and feisty and...
They make out?
They clash.
But they ultimately realize that their differences make them great.
And then they make out.
Hey.
You mind if we go for a ride?
Sure.
Sure, what is it?
Probably nothing.
I just want to make sure that... [alarm blaring]
Truck 81, Ambulance 61, Squad 3.
Industrial accident.
Acid spill. 625... [sirens wailing]
Oh, God, that's Matt's truck.
Please, hurry!
You guys gotta help!
My dad and Mr. Casey are still inside!
Okay.
You tell me as much as you can.
There was acid.
We got stuck in the break room.
Mr. Casey blew a hole in the wall to get out, but now that room has sparks and fire and... [sobs] Okay, okay.
Battalion 25 to Main, requesting a power shutoff at my location.
Herrmann, find a way to cut the power on site.
All right, hey, split up!
Cover the sides!
Find me those meters.
Everybody mask up.
Tony, Capp, grab your chemical extinguishers.
Cruz, couple sledgehammers.
On it.
Come on, let's get you checked out.
Gabby?
[electrical wires sparking] [groans]
Casey!
Severide?
I got fumes coming in from the spill area!
One civilian.
I had to improvise a cric!
[coughs] All right.
You gotta make the hole big enough to get him out on a backboard!
Tony, Capp, take an extinguisher to that panel!
Cruz, we'll use sledges on this hole!
[screams] Otis, we could really use that power cutoff!
Truck's on it.
Pulling!
Pulling!
Pulling!
[groans] [groans] [coughs]
Ken, I know it's hard, but it's better if you stay still, huh?
[coughing]
She's okay.
She got out.
She wanted me to tell you, she didn't mind the dinners.
After we get out of here, you should try doing those again, huh?
[coughing]
Pulling!
Power should be off!
[grunts] Negative!
It's still hot!
We're getting pinned down in here!
Yeah, we're gonna have to pull the main line feed out of the meter.
- You all ready?
- Yeah.
One, two, pull!
[electrical wires sparking] [panting]
How you doing in there?
Power's off.
We're secure.
Capp, grab a backboard!
- Casey, you all right?
- [coughing]
Hazmat on site.
Entering building now.
[sirens wailing in the distance]
Daddy!
All the way up.
Pick him up there.
Pick him up.
[all talking at once] Good.
Got him?
- You okay?
- I'm good.
- [sighs] - [groans]
- We should get you checked out.
- I'm fine.
I'm fine.
[clears throat]
Hey.
You got a great kid, you know that?
Thank you.
[sighs] [clears throat]
Phew. [panting]
- What's this?
- Spicy Margarita.
I'm trying to convince Herrmann to put it on the menu.
It's great.
What's in it?
- Right?
- No.
It's lime, tequila, jalapeño...
- Mmm.
- Couple of secret ingredients.
It's awesome.
Hey, so I have a little bit of news.
I... am...
leaving Chicago.
- What?
- Yeah.
I found a simulation Mission:
Mars capsule in Australia, right?
So I'm gonna go down there for six months, I'm gonna train.
Sold all my stuff to some guy online, he agreed to buy it, 1,500 bucks.
He's gonna come down with a truck, he's gonna pick it up tomorrow.
You need a new couch, by the way.
Okay, no, wait, this is nuts, man.
You can't do this.
We're talking about my dreams here.
[sighs]
Okay.
Look, Otis, I hate to say this, man, but...
I made it up.
- What?
- The email, the shortlist, I made it all up.
Look, I started reading up on this, and if you actually go, it's literally forever.
And if anything goes wrong, you get, like, suffocated to death.
Like, I thought you were gonna see how crazy this thing is, and then just get over it, not sell our couch...
Which we both bought, by the way...
And move to Australia!
You knew.
How long?
Since the cricket powder.
[sighs]
Good one.
God, I'm so glad you like it, by the way.
[gags] Yeah.
Hey, hey.
Where is she?
The... that girl.
Uh, who?
[sighs] Sylvie Brett.
Huh.
Do you mind explaining this text you sent to my husband?
"The girls can make out if you want."
- Oh, dear Lord.
- That's right, genius.
You grabbed my phone and left yours at home.
Trudy, it is... it is not what you think.
Uh...
Uh, uh...
We... we wrote a romance novel.
- [laughs] - [chuckles] [all laughing]
W-we were just trying to figure out how to spice it up to get publishers interested.
- Randall?
- Hmm?
How many times have I told you about my college roommate Lola and her husband Anton's job... in publishing?
A lot?
I can get you a read, like that.
Well, that'd be great.
Ah!
Mmm.
This one.
This one, he's an idiot.
Such an idiot.
Dr. Bruce, telephone please.
Dr. Bruce, telephone please.
We're gonna screw up.
You know, the both of us.
I mean, this is all still really new.
I know.
But I love you.
And I'm not going anywhere.
I love you too.
You know, there are easier ways to get me to let you play golf.
[both chuckling]
Getting trapped by acid a little over the top, huh?
Just a bit.
[laughs]
Should we go in?
Nah.
They have everything they need.
Hey.
You ready to go?
Reedus:
Northern California is so much different than Southern California.
- Imogen Lehtonen:
It's different.
- It's such a different energy.
Lehtonen:
Epic cliffs and huge ocean underneath it.
Just from right here we can go ride the ocean, get the sun, and we can go right up into the redwoods and be in twisties.
Reedus:
I kind of feel like this is the future.
Cali's the mecca, man.
So many great little excursions on the way up.
Ah!
Whoo!
- (Reedus laughs)
- Lehtonen:
This is so crazy.
I'm so happy we found this place.
Anything that makes noise attracts zombies.
Is your dog snoring right now?
Is that what that was?
- (motors revving)
- Man:
Are we gonna ride or what?
Let's do it.
(theme music playing)
Reedus:
I was in my early 20s when I moved to Los Angeles.
Just a kid trying to figure myself out.
Dreaming of being an artist somehow.
It was in the late '90s, and I kind of fell into this underground scene of outsiders and rebels and actors.
And then there were the bikers.
(motor starts)
I'll always feel at home here.
This is the place where everything came together for me.
The first place where I felt I belonged.
And now?
Now I'm pretty damn lucky.
I have a cool job where I get to ride motorcycles and kill zombies.
On the weekends, I just ride motorcycles.
(music playing)
Even though this is where I really learned to love bikes, and I rode all the time,
I never really had the chance to explore.
That's why I'm so excited to be back.
Taking my first ride up the Pacific Coast Highway.
Announcer:
From the Mexican border, the highway runs parallel with the Pacific coast through California.
At times the highway winds along the sheer cliff face above the sea.
Reedus:
I've heard that the Pacific Coast Highway is one of the most savagely beautiful roads you can do anywhere.
I'm starting out in LA, then winding 400 miles up the coast, stopping in Santa Barbara and Pismo Beach before ending up in the ultimate biker town, Santa Cruz, where I'm gonna talk bikes and "The Walking Dead"
on one of my favorite podcasts.
Before heading out, I'm stopping in Long Beach to pay homage to motorcycle guru Roland Sands.
Roland's an award-winning, record-breaking road racer turned custom bike artist.
He's got a solid rep and towers over the innovative California biker scene.
There's no way I'd miss a chance at finally checking out his shop.
- Hey, what's up, Norman?
- Hey, nice to meet you, Roland.
- Absolutely.
- I've heard great things about you.
Welcome, man.
I've heard some great things about you as well.
Yeah, I came over here on this sucker.
- This Hypermotard.
- Sick, man.
Reedus:
I'm riding a Ducati Hypermotard 939.
It's got a sleek minimalistic design and sweet "Blade Runner" curves.
That makes it great for navigating through mangled city traffic and cutting loose on the open road.
These bikes, man, to me, they're just, like, the sickest hooligan bike ever.
Show me some of your stuff, man.
I want to see everything.
This is our home, dude.
Wow, it's like a museum.
Man, there are so many bikes crammed in here.
- There are 75 bikes in this building.
- Wow.
We build cafe racers out of Sportsters.
So we have a whole line of hard parts that we sell.
That's a Hypermotard slash 999 Ducati.
This is so "Mad Max" right here.
Super zombie killer bike.
Sands:
That's one of the first customs I ever built.
Reedus:
This is beautiful.
You pretty much do everything.
Is there anything you don't do?
Sleep.
I know that very well.
What's up?
Good morning.
Hi.
How's it going, everybody?
(camera clicking)
When people see your bikes, they automatically know they're yours.
- Kind of, yeah.
- What makes a Roland Sands bike?
I think primarily, like, I want to build bikes that work better than the stock bike.
We increase the performance level, better brakes, better wheels, you know, and I think the blending of styles, too.
Like, this bike kind of just kicked off my career in a sense.
'Cause this bike was, like, the blend of sport bike and chopper culture smashed together in one motorcycle.
And people just had never seen that type of approach to a bike before.
Reedus:
Wow.
- Is this your pop right here?
- Yeah.
My dad started a company called Performance Machines.
So, I mean, when I was five years old, I was at drag races.
You know, I used to go to Laguna Seca and go watch the grand prix back then.
Seca's awesome.
So I can ride one of these?
This is the fleet, man.
So we got flat track racers.
Harley softails.
Cafe racers.
This is a Superleggera.
What about this guy?
How's this one?
This is a BMW nineT.
- Reedus:
It's so pretty.
- It's a fun bike.
We did a number plate on the front, moved the oil cooler up so we exposed the breastplate.
Ohlin suspension front and rear.
Custom exhaust, one-off exhaust.
- It's a badass-sounding bike.
- Yeah.
(motor starts)
I'll grab your bike and I'll meet you in the back.
All right, cool.
Reedus:
Roland's taking me to one of his favorite spots nearby.
Never thought I'd get a chance to ride alongside a legit championship racer like him.
The dude makes crazy, mindboggling stunts look easy.
- Reedus:
I've never been here.
- This is my old hood.
- This is your hood right here?
- This is where I grew up.
Yeah. (laughs)
(laughs)
Yeah.
That was awesome.
Yeah, I like to mess around a little bit.
I'm kind of an idiot.
I will not be doing that.
- Loving this.
- You like it?
I like the way this handles and rides.
It's so nice.
Reedus:
There's nothing like being on one of Roland's bikes.
It's clear that he takes pride in every single detail.
The machine fits your body like a glove.
This is beautiful, dude.
Where are we right now?
- Sands:
Palos Verdes.
- Palos Verdes.
This is beautiful up here, man.
Yeah, this is like a ride we do on the weekends.
We come up here.
- And that's Catalina.
- That's Catalina right there.
Spend a lot of time over there.
Is PCH like this?
This sort of vibe?
It's even a little bit more grand.
It's like the mountains just got... like God cut the mountains off and it drops straight down into the ocean.
- Wow.
- It's amazing.
I could live here in a heartbeat.
This is great.
Well, dude, right on.
I'm out.
I'm gonna go head up and go back to work, man.
- I wish I could go with you.
- That would be great.
I would love it.
I might steal your motorcycle and take it with me.
- Go for it.
- (laughs)
- I think it likes you.
- Can I take it?
Yeah, as long as you get it back, I don't care.
- Eeee!
Done.
- (laughs)
- Thank you, bro.
- All right, Norman.
Be safe.
- Have fun and take chances.
- I will.
It'll be fun.

Reedus:
As soon as I was on the bike,
I felt buckled down to the road.
That kind of connection is super rare, and I was honored that Roland let me borrow it for the rest of the ride.
Now I'm heading to West Hollywood to pick up one of the dopest bikers I know.
Imogen Lehtonen.
Imogen's from New Zealand... who came here to open the LA outpost of her family's shop, The Great Frog.
Imogen's family invented the skull ring 40 years ago, and they're still churning out handcrafted, one-of-a-kind pieces to this day.
We met a year ago when she tore through Georgia on a cross-country trip.
She invited me to come ride the PCH back then, and I'm stoked we're finally gonna do it.
- Yay!
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good, how you doing?
- I'm good.
I'm good.
- It's been a minute.
- Hell, yeah.
- Look at this thing.
- Yeah, right?
I took a Ducati to Roland Sands' place, and I liked this so much I kind of stole it from him.
- That is a crazy looking bike.
- Yeah.
So we'll take this up the coast with us.
- I mean, this is yours, right?
- Yes.
Well, it's not mine.
I'm borrowing it, but I love this thing.
Reedus:
Imogen is riding a custom Harley Dyna T-Sport made by LA's own Powerplant Motorcycles.
With high-set T-bar handlebars and a blacked-out powder coating, this bike is as badass as she is.
This'll be great going up the coast.
- I know, and this has, like, an adjustable windshield.
- Oh, it goes up and down?
Reedus:
I'm excited to get on our bikes and start the ride.
- But first...
- Show me your shop.
...I got to pick up a ring Imogen promised me.
- Come in the shop.
- This is awesome in here.
Reedus:
Did you...
I mean, this is all you?
Yes.
So my uncle and my aunt started it, and my parents... my mom and dad met working there together,
So I have a jewelry family.
Wow.
Tell me about that creepy skeleton up there in the corner.
- Real or not real?
- It's not real.
This is actually our resident only real skull in the shop.
Our London shop is actually built on a plague pit.
So when there was, like, the Black Plague and they had mass graves... and they excavated in the basement of our shop, and it was a mass grave.
And a lot of the original skulls we have in our London shop are from there.
What?
What?
That's sort of creepy.
You need to pick a ring as well.
You've got to have a skull ring.
Can you pick one for me?
- I can do that.
- Yeah?
I feel like you need a gnarly looking skull.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is perfect for me.
Let's see if he fits.
Are you excited?
I'm excited, yeah.
This is my first ring ever.
- And it fits.
- Yeah, this is badass.
Were you wearing all your stuff in Atlanta when we met?
On the cross-country trip I wore some of my stuff.
I wasn't as heavily loaded as I usually am when I'm around LA.
That was really fun when you guys all came down.
I had such a good time.
Reedus:
And we're going up PCH to Santa Cruz.
Okay, that's the most beautiful ride in California you can do.
There's a podcast up there which is "Motorcycle Misfits."
Really?
I'm scared to hear my voice on a podcast...
- Your voice is great.
- ...but it'll be fun.
Tonight, there is an Airstream motor camp
- that would be so cool to stay at.
- Oh, nice.
- They deck them out to make them look awesome.
- Where is that?
- In Santa Barbara.
- I love Airstreams, but I've never been in an Airstream.
- All right.
- Cool, let's go hit the highway.
Reedus:
All right, let's do this.
Lehtonen:
All right.
You ready, babe?
This changed so much here.
There used to be this place called Damiano's right there.
A pizza place.
It's where I first became an actor.
- It was in that pizza place.
- That's cool.
Reedus:
It's true, I really did become an actor at Damiano's.
It's a long story, but let's just say
I was in the right place at the right time, and the rest is history.
Now it's time to head north 97 miles to Santa Barbara.
- This is fun.
- I like riding around with you.
It's gonna be even better when we're on the open road, too.
And it will be, like, daytime and, like, beautiful coast.
Reedus:
We'll be picking up the PCH in the morning, so we just need a place to bed down.
And the Santa Barbara Autocamp with personal Airstreams couldn't be more perfect.
- This is so cool.
- They match my bike.
Oh, yeah.
I love that they put AstroTurf around, too.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Oh, my God.
They have a bathtub.
- Coffee pot, check.
- It's even got a little kitchen and a mini fridge.
- I'm having this one.
- This is yours?
You got it.
Done.
Tomorrow's gonna be, like, PCH.
Beautiful, no LA traffic.
- Yeah, let's hope so.
- It'll be the pretty part.
Yeah, good.
I'm gonna go take a bath in an air bubble.
- (laughs)
- Bye!
What the (bleep)?
You peeper.
- (man laughs)
- Little peeper.
- The ocean!
Whoo!
- Oh, the ocean.
- Are these electric?
- Oh, cool.

- He was a garbage man for 30 years.

- Oh, my God!

(bird tweeting)
(camera clicking)
("Hollywood" playing)
- (knocks)
- Are you having a party in here?
This is so cool.
I like sleeping in an airstream.
It was pretty cool except for every time you walk by a desk, you clear the desk by accident.
- You know what I mean?
- I didn't have that problem.
Yeah, well, you're skinny, that's why.
- All right, let's roll.
- You're not exactly fat.
Not exactly fat?
What is that supposed to mean?
(music playing)
- I'm excited to ride.
- Yeah, it's gonna be nice today.
- (motor revving)
- Ready?
Wow, it's so pretty.
- So beautiful.
- Yeah.
Reedus:
We're headed north on the PCH 104 miles from Santa Barbara to Pismo Beach.
Can you hear me?
When do we get to the ocean?
I can't understand you.
Reedus:
How'd you sleep in that Airstream?
I'm just gonna guess at what you're saying.
Something about an alarm clock.
Nothing about Alaska.
(laughs)
A baked Alaska.
- The ocean!
Whoo!
- Oh, the ocean.
- Yeah. - Whoo-hoo!
Reedus:
The Pacific Coast Highway is one of the most breathtaking roads ever.
It opened in the late 1920s as part of the Roosevelt Highway, the first road to link the Mexican and Canadian borders.
With its snaking curves and sharp drops, people travel from all over the world to see what makes it so uniquely Californian.
- Look how sparkly it is.
- Yeah.
Reedus:
With the ocean right there next to you, man, this is how you're supposed to ride.
I mean, check out that view.
Pismo Beach, 15 miles.
Yeah.
Reedus:
Pismo Beach is five and a half miles of pristine sand dunes and one of the only beaches in America you can actually drive onto.
Let's go to the beach.
Reedus:
Which is right up our alley.
I'm down to see what kind of off-road action we can find.
Look how pretty this is.
Yeah, this is beautiful.
(grunts)
What are these little birds called?
Oyster catchers.
They're cute.
Catch one.
How cold you reckon the water is?
- Freezing?
- I bet it's freezing.
Stay away from me.
That looks like a dune buggy, right?
That's cool.
Have you ever dune-buggied?
- Never.
- Me either.
- Let's go dune buggy.
- ♪ Little dune buggy. ♪
Reedus:
Dune buggies on the beach?
Right on.
There's no way we're gonna let this opportunity pass by.
How's it going?
I'm Norman.
- Glad to meet you.
Robert.
- Hi, Imogen.
- Oh, cool.
Thank you.
- Your first time out here?
- First time ever here and on a dune buggy.
- First time dune-buggying.
Part of our protocol too is you have to watch a safety video.
Okay.
What did you do to your screen?
- Well...
- It's beach modified.
It's kind of scary to watch a safety video on this screen.
- You know what I mean?
- We're a little hard on things out here.
Man on video:
Avoid all wildlife.
Can you imagine trying to run over these little birds?
- Do people do that?
- They try.
You are assuming all risks for any damage,
- injury, or loss of life.
- Lehtonen:
This is gonna be fun.
- Loss of life?
- Animal life.
Now you're ready to drive the dunes.
(music playing)
- Reedus:
Shall we hit it?
- Let's do it.
What's the fastest one you have?
This one?
- (laughs)
- Have a good time.
- Yeah, I'm excited.
- Thank you.

Oh!
Whoa, airborne.
I just went airborne.

- I got some air.
- (laughs)
Let's go to the big one.
- Oh, (bleep).
- Oh my god.
And good-bye.
Ah!
Oh, my God, I want to do this for, like, five hours.
All right, all right.
- That was awesome.
- That was so cool.
(camera clicking)
Reedus:
I could seriously ride these dunes forever, but we've got miles of highway in front of us.
- Man:
Was it good?
- Reedus:
Oh, it was rad.
- Any time.
- Thanks, man.
Reedus:
So it's time to get off the beach and back on the road.
Man:
It's basically a place built out of junk.
There's stuff in here from, like, the '30s, '40s,
- up until the '80s.
- Lehtonen:
Wow.
- This is from "The Walking Dead."
- That's rad.
- This bike is running right now.
- Wait, it's running right now?
- It's running right now.
- Shut up.
- Let's do it.
- All right, all right, all right.
You look so cool.
You're a ninja right now.
Yeah, dune buggies are awesome.
Yeah, dude.
I had no idea it was that much fun.
I feel like I've gained weight in my palms on this trip.
My palms have become meaty.
I think that the dune buggying... like, whacking your hands on the steering wheel
I think makes them swell 'cause my rings are all real tight.
Yeah, I couldn't get the thing on my thing.
That's why I put the thing on your thing.
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah.
- Know what I'm saying?
- Know what I'm saying?
(both laugh)
Reedus:
We've ridden 200 miles with another 50 to go tonight.
And this next leg of the ride is magical.
Wow, California sunset right there.
Reedus:
See, that's one thing I don't get to see in New York, an ocean sunset that rolls over the waves to the end of the world.
- So beautiful.
- So beautiful.
Reedus:
When I first got to LA, I worked at a Harley shop called Dr. Carl's Hog Hospital.
I did a lot of grunt work, but on the plus side, I got to see a lot of different bikes.
Back then, I always wondered what it would be like to ride up the California coast.
And this is exactly how I pictured it.
I start to daydream.
I just start like, "Ah."
I have ADDDDDDD.
You know what I mean?
(laughs) No.
- Reedus:
Good-bye, sun.
- Oh, yeah.
- Feel the cold creeping in.
- Yeah.
Reedus:
It sounds like a tornado right now.
I can't hear what you're saying, but I'm happy.
I can't hear what you're saying.
(both laugh)
(wind whistling)
Lehtonen:
Is that an abandoned house?
Yeah, it looks like it.
That looks amazing.
Can we go in there?
What the hell?
- Hey.
- What the...?
- How you guys doing?
- How you doing, man?
Norman.
Hi.
- Pretty good.
My name's Mike.
- Nice to meet you, Mike.
Reedus:
California is full of weird tourist attractions like Nitt Witt Ridge in the small town of Cambria.
The man who built this place, his name was actually Art Beal, but they gave him a couple colorful nicknames, and one of them was Captain Nitwit.
- Oh, wow.
- He started building in 1928.
He lived in this place till 1989, till he was 92 years old.
Lehtonen:
Wow.
- Lehtonen:
I love all the stonework.
- Yeah, that's cool.
- See all these handrails?
- Yeah.
This was the plumbing system.
They all carried water.
There's handrails throughout the whole property.
He also had a lot of toilet seats, which he would actually use for picture frames.
- (laughs)
- Oh, my God.
He called this his woman's room.
- What the?
- Wait, who are you?
Like, how are you involved here?
My wife and I bought this in 1999 from the Art Beal Foundation.
I thought I'd give the Anti-Hearst Castle tour.
William Randolph Hearst built this place in 1919 out of his massive amounts of money, and this is the anti.
This guy was a garbage man in town that took all the garbage from town...
Oh, so he collected garbage and put this together from it?
He got paid as a garbage man.
But now watch your head and I'll take you up this stairway.
Art claimed this stairway stayed 50 degrees.
- This was his refrigerator.
- I feel the chill in here.
It is colder.
- That's his stuff.
- What is that?
There's peaches, there's apricots.
There's stuff in here from, like, the '30s, '40s, up until the '80s.
This is so crazy.
I'm so happy we found this place.
As you guys can see, his clothes are still in here.
Lehtonen:
Oh, my God.
Mike:
People said half the time all he'd be wearing is this bathrobe with nothing else on under it, and he'd walk around town in that thing.
They tell me he got older and it'd get windy.
- Oh, my God.
- (laughing)
And this is his two-seated outhouse.
He said he put his and her toilets in here.
He could sit here and have conversations with people.
Lehtonen:
What a crazy guy.
He thought he was a swinger, but then he never had kids.
- He has no family?
- And he never had any family.
I thought by now, after 15 years I've been up here,
"I'm his grandkid.
I'm his..." no.
It's weird.
But he liked ladies, and ladies liked him.
- He's, like, an enigma.
- He's kind of a romantic.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Mike:
And then a guy with no family or anything created his own legacy with nothing but junk.
Reedus:
This dude literally built his whole life into these walls.
Coming up with a way to turn trash into treasure.
There's a toilet on top of the roof.
And people said that's his throne.
He's the king of the castle up there.
Reedus:
Even toilet seats.
Thank you for showing us all of this.
- Take care, man.
- Yeah, you, too.
Reedus:
This is just the kind of wacky stuff
I've been expecting to see since we crossed from Southern to Northern California.
And just a couple miles away from where we're going to call it a night.
Bye, cool house.
("Swing" playing)
♪ Everyone is seeing that I'm something else ♪
♪ I'm not living on somebody's shelf... ♪
Reedus:
Day three.
There's nothing better than waking up in Big Sur, home of the Bixby Bridge.
260 feet high and 700 feet long, this bridge is a beast.
One of the tallest single span concrete bridges in the world.
And finally, after 400 miles, we're here in Santa Cruz.
Santa Cruz is a little town tucked between the Pacific and the Santa Cruz Mountains.
I just like the way the air smells up here.
It's so clean.
Reedus:
Surrounded by incredible natural beauty, and with a close proximity to the San Francisco counterculture and Silicon Valley tech scenes, it's the perfect spot for anyone coming to California looking for reinvention.
- Look at that crazy house.
- Yeah, that's beautiful.
It's got a nice eclectic feel.
I hate when cities start taking over and making everything look the same.
Reedus:
We're here to drop in on a local podcast.
but first, we're headed to Zero Motorcycles, a pioneer manufacturer of electric motorcycles.
- Are these electric?
- Lehtonen:
Oh, cool.
For some reason I imagined them looking all crazy different.
Reedus:
California is a hotbed of environmental action.
So it makes sense that they made their home here.
- Ready to check this out?
- Yeah.
I used to have a dog named Zero.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Reedus:
Zero's Scot Harden is gonna show us their bikes and take us for a spin.
- Nice to meet you, too.
Welcome to Zero.
- All right.
All right, let's go on back into the belly of the beast.
Harden:
This is where all of the main assembly is done.
Reedus:
It's weird to go into a motorcycle shop, building motorcycles, and it's not loud.
- It's just super weird to me.
- Yeah.
(laughs)
This is where it all started for Zero.
- This is the first electric motorcycle ever built.
- It's like a dirt bike, right?
It was kind of cross between an overgrown mountain bike and a motorcycle.
I think it's cool.
I really like that one.
Well, it was the idea of what could we do to change the way the world experiences motorcycles.
What kind of bike did you ride before you got into electric motorcycles?
I was a dirt bike rider.
I was born in Las Vegas, and I rode dirt bikes.
And then I started doing all the big desert races.
I kept taking on bigger challenges in Europe and then Africa.
Scariest moment in my life on a bike was in Senegal going down these roads at 80, 90, 100 miles an hour with these bushes that are this tall on each side, and there's animals running out in front of you.
Pigs and ostriches.
You're just thinking, "God, don't step out
- in front of my front wheel."
- That's terrifying.
It scared me to death.
I hit a cow at 80 miles an hour.
- You hit a cow?
- I've bounced off the hoods of cars.
- That would mess you up.
- You are so lucky.
I could tell stories.
How's it going, guys?
Do you guys all ride electric bikes now?
- Do you?
- I have ridden some before.
- Yeah?
- I ride my own motorcycles mostly.
- What do you have?
- Got a Harley and a couple dirt bikes.
Is that, like, the enemy, or is it everybody loves everything?
Everybody loves everything around here, yeah.
- Have you gone on one yet?
- We're about to try one.
Yeah?
Sick, dude.
I hope you like it.
Yeah, I'm excited.
Nice to meet you, dude.
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, it's a pleasure.
- How's it going, man?
- Good.
Since you're here.
- Lehtonen:
Oh, my God.
- Uh-oh.
- No way.
- This is from "The Walking Dead."
- That's rad.
- So... (laughs)
- Big fan of yours.
- Thanks, man.
Have you guys ever thought about doing an electric dune buggy?
- I want a hat.
- All right.
- Great Frog!
- Whoo!
That's when I had short hair.
That was way back when.
I feel like I'm the only person whose never (bleep) seen this show.
- I need to watch it.
- Get out of here right now.
(laughter)
Bye, guys.
Go to work.
- Go to work.
- Lehtonen:
Get back to work.
- Okay, I want to see if I can touch the ground.
- Try it out.
See what fits you best.
What's your favorite color?
What's your favorite flavor?
Reedus:
This is a straight up dirt bike right here.
That's an off-road trail bike, yeah.
- I'm taking this one.
- This is the FXS.
This is the inner city hooligan bike.
- It's very lightweight.
- Lehtonen:
It feels light.
Harden:
It's only 290 pounds.
I think you'll really like that one.
All the stuff's where you'd normally expect.
- Your turn signal's here.
- Okay.
Brake where you'd normally expect it.
Foot brake.
And then the last thing you do to arm this thing
- is hit the throttle switch.
- Okay.
Now that means this bike is running right now.
- Wow.
Wait, so it's on already?
- It's running right now?
- It's running right now.
- Shut up.
Wow.
- Wow.
- Away you go.
- Ah!
- I think we've chosen our weapons.
- Let's go out and give them a whirl.
- All right.
- All right?
- Cool.
I can't believe that that was running while we were standing there.
Reedus:
It's weird getting on a bike and not knowing how it's gonna feel, but that's what I love about trying out new bikes.
- Harden:
Are we ready?
- I think so.
Reedus:
Scot's taking us up to see the legendary California redwoods.
Whoa.
- This is so crazy.
- Yeah, this is nuts.
Reedus:
It's gonna be the perfect way to find out what the Zero is all about.
I'm just... this is blowing me away how smooth this is.
It's like your ass is sliding on ice.
(laughs)
Santa Cruz redwoods.
- Hi.
- Oh, (bleep)!
I just creeped up on you and you had no idea.
No, I didn't.
I was like, "Where's Norman?"
Reedus:
Sometimes I get on a bike just to escape.
The roar of the motorcycle creates this wall between me and my surroundings.
- It smells really fresh.
- It does.
- Healthy and green up here.
- Like mossy.
Yeah.
Reedus:
That's what makes being on this bike so strange.
There's no wall.
It's just you and the world feeding off of each other.
I mean, it's perfect really for, like, going through this beautiful forest.
You're just kind of gliding.
I kind of feel like this is the future.
- I really do.
- Yeah, imagine in, like, 50 or 100 years when, like, cities are smogged up, everything will be electric.
Whee!
This is crazy 'cause I can't see the bike.
Does it feel like you're flying?
- Yeah, it does.
- (laughs)
Reedus:
And there's nothing like riding it through the redwoods.
You should try it.
Amazing.
Harden:
Go to sport!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Have you put it in sport mode?
Yeah, dude, it's like, oh, my God.
- It's terrifying.
- Lehtonen:
All right.
Whoa!
Whoa!
I put it in sport.
It's crazy.
You feel the extra tug.
It's like, whaa!
I swallowed my Adam's apple for a second.
(camera clicking)
- It was great riding with your guys.
- You're awesome.
- Thank you so much, Scot.
- Imogen, it was really nice meeting you.
- I want an electric motorcycle now.
- Yeah, me, too.
We got more converts.
That's cool.
Cool.
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, tell me.
This belonged to my late brother Chris.
He was a huge, huge fan of yours.
Used to have posters of you guys up in the room and everything.
- Oh, man.
- He loved you guys a lot.
And this was actually in the wreck with him.
- That's why it's all mangled like this.
- Oh, dude.
I wanted to see if you could sign it.
It would mean the world to me.
Come here.
Come here.
Yeah, dude.
- Thanks, man.
- Of course.
- Sign it to Chris if you would.
- To Chris.
Of course, man.
- It was a pleasure to meet you, man.
- You, too, man.
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, dude.
Yeah.
Be well, dude.
- Ride on.
- Yeah.
Take care, man.
- Later.
- Bye.
Reedus:
Hearing something like that just rips me to shreds.
Reminds me that life is fragile.
I'm honored that I got to meet that guy and hear his brother's story.
Ride on, brother.
Lehtonen:
This is a pretty town.
I like it.
Yeah, it's really cute here.
Reedus:
You know, Santa Cruz has some really cool streets.
This is cool.
Look at this wall.
Reedus:
So it's nice to get off our bikes and check out the details we might have missed when we're riding by it.
Hi.
Oh, shut up, hi.
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you, too.
- Congratulations.
- Do you live up here?
- Yes, this is where I live.
- Shut up.
- You guys know each other?
- Shut up.
How are you, dude?
Nice to see you, sweetheart.
Yeah, what a pleasure.
That lady that just said hi, she was a director on "Walking Dead."
- What a small world.
Santa Cruz.
- She's awesome.
Still have to watch it.
I'm gonna send you every disc.
- Okay.
- Then I'll send you like a little... you'll have to write an essay or something.
How long have you been riding?
How did you get started riding motorcycles?
I'm into riding because of my dad.
I used to hitch a ride on the back of his bike to university and to work.
He had a BMW Dakar dual-sport thing, and I would jump on the back of that.
And now it's carried on as the inspiration as to why I love to ride.
It's because of my dad.
He died, like, a year and a half ago.
So whenever I ride, it's like...
- my special time.
- Yeah.
That cross-country trip was, like, the one-year anniversary of his death.
- I remember.
- So it was very, very special thing to have happen.
I like how your family...
you pass the torch from... like how you do your rings and the store.
- Unintentionally, but, yes.
- It's great.
People don't have that.
It's great.
I like that they have shrubberies everywhere.
- A shrubbery.
- Shrubbery.
- Do you like Monty Python?
- Oh, my God, I love Monty Python.
"Monty Python and the Holy Grail" is my favorite movie of all time.
- With the little rabbit?
- Yeah.
It goes after his throat.
- "We are the Knights that say Ni."
- Exactly.
(music playing)
(motors revving)
It's nice to be back on my own bike.
Yeah, I agree.
Kind of like the rumble, but those bikes were cool, I got to say.
I like how he said, too, he's not trying to replace other motorcycles.
- It's just another experience, you know?
- Yeah.
Reedus:
Last stop, and I couldn't be more excited.
We're headed over to the Re-Cycle Garage...
I like Santa Cruz.
...home of this really cool podcast called "Motorcycles Misfits."
Who doesn't like geeking out on bikes with a bunch of misfits?
Welcome to "Motorcycles Misfits" at the Re-Cycle Garage.
- You guys are getting all Batman on me and stuff.
- (laughs)
What's the best bike for the zombie apocalypse?
I'm gonna tell you, and you're not gonna like my answer.
(music playing)
Reedus:
Wow, I love it up here, I got to tell you.
Lehtonen:
Love it.
Northern California is so much different than Southern California.
- It's different, yeah.
- It's such a different energy.
You know what I mean?
Reedus:
My first big California ride is winding down.
But first, Imogen and I are gonna make one final pit stop at the Re-Cycle Garage where a bunch of local bikers put on one of the coolest weekly podcasts on the West Coast.
It's called "Motorcycles Misfits."
- Hello.
- What's up?
Hi.
- I'm Norman.
- Liza.
- Nice to meet you.
Hi.
- Hi.
Imogen.
- Hey, Imogen.
- Nice to meet you.
These are some nice little rides you got.
This is a little bit nicer version than mine, but you know.
- This is awesome, though.
That's beautiful.
- Thank you.
- I built that one.
- Did you really?
Right on.
Yes.
Do you teach people that don't know how to work on bikes how to work on bikes?
Yes, but nobody here is a mechanic.
- Oh, wow.
- Everyone helps each other work on bikes.
We teach people how to ride, help them buy their gear, teach them what are the cool movies to watch.
Expose them to the entire culture.
- How cool.
- Yeah, so we've kind of built up this crazy community.
Lehtonen:
I like that you have such an eclectic mix of bikes here.
- Liza:
Hey, if they can ride, we'll let them in.
- How did the podcast start?
When you get a group of people sitting around the garage working on bikes, you have conversations.
We play pranks, we tell stories, we share rides and experiences and opinions.
Wow, that's so cool.
So we thought, "How can we bottle this and share it with everyone?
Podcast."
- We're ready.
- Check, one, two.
- Microphone check.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.
We are gonna go in five, four, three...
Hey, there.
Welcome to "Motorcycles Misfits"
at the Re-Cycle Garage here in...
All: ...sunny Santa Cruz, California.
- Warm and sunny.
- It was quite sunny.
Liza:
Let's get to one of our topics.
What's the best bike for the zombie apocalypse?
And we have a special guest here.
Somebody who actually has experience in this field, and I want to get their opinion.
So I'd like to welcome here Norman Reedus.
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
- Hi, thanks for having me.
- Hey, dude.
Welcome.
I'm gonna tell you, and I think you're not gonna like my answer.
- Oh, yeah?
- I think what I would do is I'd get one of these Zero bikes, and I would put a solar panel on the back of it.
(laughing)
'Cause anything that makes noise attracts zombies.
- Right.
- Right?
And I caught a lot of flack for having that Triumph with the ape hangers.
I caught a lot of flack, and then I built another bike, miraculously in, like, six hours on that show.
And I get a lot of flack because that one makes a lot of noise as well.
How did you come to have that bike?
That's supposed to be Merle's bike.
Did he customize the frame up that high?
I guess.
I don't know.
What the (bleep)?
- Um...
- (laughing)
- So I would like to make some suggestions.
- Uh-oh, here we go.
First you should consider an anti-theft device of some kind.
- Oh, I like it.
- Just saying.
Second, more mirrors, I would suggest.
It would be nice to maybe see something coming up behind you.
Yeah, I... yeah.
Lastly, a machine gun on the front because what bike isn't cooler with a machine gun on the front?
Yeah, we've thought about attaching weapons to that thing.
You could just drill a hole in your exhaust and squirt some soap in it and make a smokescreen.
You guys are getting all Batman on me and stuff.
(laughing)
How's motorcycling changed you?
Reedus:
A bunch.
It's changed me a bunch.
Like, I ride to work every day and I think about what I'm about to do and it really gets me in the mood.
And then I ride home.
I think about what I did.
I don't know.
It's almost like yoga or something at some point.
- You know what I mean?
- Lehtonen:
It's therapeutic.
Reedus:
The best rides I think are the spontaneous ones.
I gave an award at the Country Music Awards in Nashville when I was down in Georgia and, you know, they booked me a flight to go there and everything.
And I'm sitting there watering my plants and I'm looking at my bike, and I'm watering my plants, and I said, "(bleep) it." And I grabbed the suit,
I shoved it in a backpack, wrote all my directions on my arm.
And then I kept going through rainstorms, and I just kept losing them.
But that ride to Nashville is one of my favorites.
(snoring)
Is your dog snoring right now?
Is that what that was?
Oh, my God, that's adorable.
Liza:
Thank you, everyone, for listening, and thank you guys for joining us.
Lehtonen:
You guys are so much fun.
Thank you.
I was looking for a group ride when I first moved here, and I ran into Zach.
He had a crappy motorcycle but a nice jacket, so I asked him...
- (laughing)
- I was like, "So where's the ride?"
And I asked him if they could show me how to change my oil.
- And this is where we are now.
- Yeah.
- That was three years ago.
- Nice.
When I fist showed up, Liza just shoved a broken moped at me and was like, "Here, fix this."
She does that to a lot of people.
That's how she hooks you in.
She's like, "Oh, here's this free bike.
Just get it running and it's yours."
- And two years later, I was still here.
- That's cool.
And she's all, "Hey, Dad," when she was 13,
"I want to ride motorcycles." I'm all, "Hell, no."
And she's like, "Whatever.
I'll be 18 someday." I'm like, "Ugh, yeah."
So you guys are father and daughter?
That is so cool.
Yeah, so then I started hanging around.
And then I just got hooked.
You guys all know what it's like.
You hop on the bike, you're rolling the throttle,
- and everything melts away.
- Yeah.
(music playing)
Liza:
So we're chasing the sun.
- Let's saddle up and do a quick ride.
- Shall we hit it?
Reedus:
I always feel at home surrounded by a bunch of outsiders.
And California is a magnet.
It attracts people who don't fit in anywhere else.
Everyone's got a totally different vibe here, but their love of bikes ties them together, and I love that.
And the Misfits are doing the rest of us a huge favor bringing these unique bikes back to life.
That's the kind of passion for motorcycles, for life, that has made my ride up the California coast so incredible.
It's not just here.
California is a place where all of us misfits can fit in.
And sure, you're not gonna find roads like the PCH anywhere else on the planet.
Liza:
It's empowering to learn how to do something.
If you can build or fix something, what else can you do in your life, you know?
Reedus:
But California is more than just breathtaking beauty.
It's the people here.
The sense of rebellion you find everywhere you go.
The creativity.
The freedom to try whatever the hell you want.
That's the California I found on this ride.
And that's the California I'm gonna keep coming back to for the rest of my life.
You guys are awesome.
I really love what you guys have going here.
This is really cool.
- Bye, guys.
- Bye!
- Bye.
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much for coming on this trip.
- It's been a blast.
- You are very welcome.
That was awesome.
Dune buggying.
- Dune buggies, yes.
- Yes, and the coastline and the sunsets.
Northern California is so much different than Southern California.
- It's different.
- It's such a different energy.
Epic cliffs and huge ocean underneath it.
Just from right here we can go ride the ocean, get the sun, and we can go right up into the redwoods and be in twisties.
I kind of feel like this is the future.
Cali's the mecca, man.
So many great little excursions on the way up.
Ah!
Whoo!
This is so crazy.
I'm so happy we found this place.
Anything that makes noise attracts zombies.
Is your dog snoring right now?
Is that what that was?
Are we gonna ride or what?
Let's do it.
I was in my early 20s when I moved to Los Angeles.
Just a kid trying to figure myself out.
Dreaming of being an artist somehow.
It was in the late '90s, and I kind of fell into this underground scene of outsiders and rebels and actors.
And then there were the bikers.
I'll always feel at home here.
This is the place where everything came together for me.
The first place where I felt I belonged.
And now?
Now I'm pretty damn lucky.
I have a cool job where I get to ride motorcycles and kill zombies.
On the weekends, I just ride motorcycles.
Even though this is where I really learned to love bikes, and I rode all the time,
I never really had the chance to explore.
That's why I'm so excited to be back.
Taking my first ride up the Pacific Coast Highway.
From the Mexican border, the highway runs parallel with the Pacific coast through California.
At times the highway winds along the sheer cliff face above the sea.
I've heard that the Pacific Coast Highway is one of the most savagely beautiful roads you can do anywhere.
I'm starting out in LA, then winding 400 miles up the coast, stopping in Santa Barbara and Pismo Beach before ending up in the ultimate biker town, Santa Cruz, where I'm gonna talk bikes and "The Walking Dead"
on one of my favorite podcasts.
Before heading out, I'm stopping in Long Beach to pay homage to motorcycle guru Roland Sands.
Roland's an award-winning, record-breaking road racer turned custom bike artist.
He's got a solid rep and towers over the innovative California biker scene.
There's no way I'd miss a chance at finally checking out his shop.
- Hey, what's up, Norman?
- Hey, nice to meet you, Roland.
- Absolutely.
- I've heard great things about you.
Welcome, man.
I've heard some great things about you as well.
Yeah, I came over here on this sucker.
- This Hypermotard.
- Sick, man.
I'm riding a Ducati Hypermotard 939.
It's got a sleek minimalistic design and sweet "Blade Runner" curves.
That makes it great for navigating through mangled city traffic and cutting loose on the open road.
These bikes, man, to me, they're just, like, the sickest hooligan bike ever.
Show me some of your stuff, man.
I want to see everything.
This is our home, dude.
Wow, it's like a museum.
Man, there are so many bikes crammed in here.
- There are 75 bikes in this building.
- Wow.
We build cafe racers out of Sportsters.
So we have a whole line of hard parts that we sell.
That's a Hypermotard slash 999 Ducati.
This is so "Mad Max" right here.
Super zombie killer bike.
That's one of the first customs I ever built.
This is beautiful.
You pretty much do everything.
Is there anything you don't do?
Sleep.
I know that very well.
What's up?
Good morning.
Hi.
How's it going, everybody?
When people see your bikes, they automatically know they're yours.
- Kind of, yeah.
- What makes a Roland Sands bike?
I think primarily, like, I want to build bikes that work better than the stock bike.
We increase the performance level, better brakes, better wheels, you know, and I think the blending of styles, too.
Like, this bike kind of just kicked off my career in a sense.
'Cause this bike was, like, the blend of sport bike and chopper culture smashed together in one motorcycle.
And people just had never seen that type of approach to a bike before.
Wow.
- Is this your pop right here?
- Yeah.
My dad started a company called Performance Machines.
So, I mean, when I was five years old, I was at drag races.
You know, I used to go to Laguna Seca and go watch the grand prix back then.
Seca's awesome.
So I can ride one of these?
This is the fleet, man.
So we got flat track racers.
Harley softails.
Cafe racers.
This is a Superleggera.
What about this guy?
How's this one?
This is a BMW nineT.
- It's so pretty.
- It's a fun bike.
We did a number plate on the front, moved the oil cooler up so we exposed the breastplate.
Ohlin suspension front and rear.
Custom exhaust, one-off exhaust.
- It's a badass-sounding bike.
- Yeah.
I'll grab your bike and I'll meet you in the back.
All right, cool.
Roland's taking me to one of his favorite spots nearby.
Never thought I'd get a chance to ride alongside a legit championship racer like him.
The dude makes crazy, mindboggling stunts look easy.
- I've never been here.
- This is my old hood.
- This is your hood right here?
- This is where I grew up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was awesome.
Yeah, I like to mess around a little bit.
I'm kind of an idiot.
I will not be doing that.
- Loving this.
- You like it?
I like the way this handles and rides.
It's so nice.
There's nothing like being on one of Roland's bikes.
It's clear that he takes pride in every single detail.
The machine fits your body like a glove.
This is beautiful, dude.
Where are we right now?
- Palos Verdes.
- Palos Verdes.
This is beautiful up here, man.
Yeah, this is like a ride we do on the weekends.
We come up here.
- And that's Catalina.
- That's Catalina right there.
Spend a lot of time over there.
Is PCH like this?
This sort of vibe?
It's even a little bit more grand.
It's like the mountains just got... like God cut the mountains off and it drops straight down into the ocean.
- Wow.
- It's amazing.
I could live here in a heartbeat.
This is great.
Well, dude, right on.
I'm out.
I'm gonna go head up and go back to work, man.
- I wish I could go with you.
- That would be great.
I would love it.
I might steal your motorcycle and take it with me.
Go for it.
- I think it likes you.
- Can I take it?
Yeah, as long as you get it back, I don't care.
Eeee!
Done.
- Thank you, bro.
- All right, Norman.
Be safe.
- Have fun and take chances.
- I will.
It'll be fun.
As soon as I was on the bike,
I felt buckled down to the road.
That kind of connection is super rare, and I was honored that Roland let me borrow it for the rest of the ride.
Now I'm heading to West Hollywood to pick up one of the dopest bikers I know.
Imogen Lehtonen.
Imogen's from New Zealand... who came here to open the LA outpost of her family's shop, The Great Frog.
Imogen's family invented the skull ring 40 years ago, and they're still churning out handcrafted, one-of-a-kind pieces to this day.
We met a year ago when she tore through Georgia on a cross-country trip.
She invited me to come ride the PCH back then, and I'm stoked we're finally gonna do it.
- Yay!
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good, how you doing?
- I'm good.
I'm good.
- It's been a minute.
- Hell, yeah.
- Look at this thing.
- Yeah, right?
I took a Ducati to Roland Sands' place, and I liked this so much I kind of stole it from him.
- That is a crazy looking bike.
- Yeah.
So we'll take this up the coast with us.
- I mean, this is yours, right?
- Yes.
Well, it's not mine.
I'm borrowing it, but I love this thing.
Imogen is riding a custom Harley Dyna T-Sport made by LA's own Powerplant Motorcycles.
With high-set T-bar handlebars and a blacked-out powder coating, this bike is as badass as she is.
This'll be great going up the coast.
- I know, and this has, like, an adjustable windshield.
- Oh, it goes up and down?
I'm excited to get on our bikes and start the ride.
- But first...
- Show me your shop.
...I got to pick up a ring Imogen promised me.
- Come in the shop.
- This is awesome in here.
Did you...
I mean, this is all you?
Yes.
So my uncle and my aunt started it, and my parents... my mom and dad met working there together,
So I have a jewelry family.
Wow.
Tell me about that creepy skeleton up there in the corner.
- Real or not real?
- It's not real.
This is actually our resident only real skull in the shop.
Our London shop is actually built on a plague pit.
So when there was, like, the Black Plague and they had mass graves... and they excavated in the basement of our shop, and it was a mass grave.
And a lot of the original skulls we have in our London shop are from there.
What?
What?
That's sort of creepy.
You need to pick a ring as well.
You've got to have a skull ring.
Can you pick one for me?
- I can do that.
- Yeah?
I feel like you need a gnarly looking skull.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is perfect for me.
Let's see if he fits.
Are you excited?
I'm excited, yeah.
This is my first ring ever.
- And it fits.
- Yeah, this is badass.
Were you wearing all your stuff in Atlanta when we met?
On the cross-country trip I wore some of my stuff.
I wasn't as heavily loaded as I usually am when I'm around LA.
That was really fun when you guys all came down.
I had such a good time.
And we're going up PCH to Santa Cruz.
Okay, that's the most beautiful ride in California you can do.
There's a podcast up there which is "Motorcycle Misfits."
Really?
I'm scared to hear my voice on a podcast...
- Your voice is great.
- ...but it'll be fun.
Tonight, there is an Airstream motor camp
- that would be so cool to stay at.
- Oh, nice.
- They deck them out to make them look awesome.
- Where is that?
- In Santa Barbara.
- I love Airstreams, but I've never been in an Airstream.
- All right.
- Cool, let's go hit the highway.
All right, let's do this.
All right.
You ready, babe?
This changed so much here.
There used to be this place called Damiano's right there.
A pizza place.
It's where I first became an actor.
- It was in that pizza place.
- That's cool.
It's true, I really did become an actor at Damiano's.
It's a long story, but let's just say
I was in the right place at the right time, and the rest is history.
Now it's time to head north 97 miles to Santa Barbara.
- This is fun.
- I like riding around with you.
It's gonna be even better when we're on the open road, too.
And it will be, like, daytime and, like, beautiful coast.
We'll be picking up the PCH in the morning, so we just need a place to bed down.
And the Santa Barbara Autocamp with personal Airstreams couldn't be more perfect.
- This is so cool.
- They match my bike.
Oh, yeah.
I love that they put AstroTurf around, too.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Oh, my God.
They have a bathtub.
- Coffee pot, check.
- It's even got a little kitchen and a mini fridge.
- I'm having this one.
- This is yours?
You got it.
Done.
Tomorrow's gonna be, like, PCH.
Beautiful, no LA traffic.
- Yeah, let's hope so.
- It'll be the pretty part.
Yeah, good.
I'm gonna go take a bath in an air bubble.
Bye!
What the (bleep)?
You peeper.
Little peeper.
- The ocean!
Whoo!
- Oh, the ocean.
- Are these electric?
- Oh, cool.
He built this whole place out of junk.
- He was a garbage man for 30 years.
- Wow.
Oh, my God!
Are you having a party in here?
This is so cool.
I like sleeping in an airstream.
It was pretty cool except for every time you walk by a desk, you clear the desk by accident.
- You know what I mean?
- I didn't have that problem.
Yeah, well, you're skinny, that's why.
- All right, let's roll.
- You're not exactly fat.
Not exactly fat?
What is that supposed to mean?
- I'm excited to ride.
- Yeah, it's gonna be nice today.
Ready?
Wow, it's so pretty.
- So beautiful.
- Yeah.
We're headed north on the PCH 104 miles from Santa Barbara to Pismo Beach.
Can you hear me?
When do we get to the ocean?
I can't understand you.
How'd you sleep in that Airstream?
I'm just gonna guess at what you're saying.
Something about an alarm clock.
Nothing about Alaska.
A baked Alaska.
- The ocean!
Whoo!
- Oh, the ocean.
- Yeah. - Whoo-hoo!
The Pacific Coast Highway is one of the most breathtaking roads ever.
It opened in the late 1920s as part of the Roosevelt Highway, the first road to link the Mexican and Canadian borders.
With its snaking curves and sharp drops, people travel from all over the world to see what makes it so uniquely Californian.
- Look how sparkly it is.
- Yeah.
With the ocean right there next to you, man, this is how you're supposed to ride.
I mean, check out that view.
Pismo Beach, 15 miles.
Yeah.
Pismo Beach is five and a half miles of pristine sand dunes and one of the only beaches in America you can actually drive onto.
Let's go to the beach.
Which is right up our alley.
I'm down to see what kind of off-road action we can find.
Look how pretty this is.
Yeah, this is beautiful.
What are these little birds called?
Oyster catchers.
They're cute.
Catch one.
How cold you reckon the water is?
- Freezing?
- I bet it's freezing.
Stay away from me.
That looks like a dune buggy, right?
That's cool.
Have you ever dune-buggied?
- Never.
- Me either.
- Let's go dune buggy.
- ♪ Little dune buggy. ♪
Dune buggies on the beach?
Right on.
There's no way we're gonna let this opportunity pass by.
How's it going?
I'm Norman.
- Glad to meet you.
Robert.
- Hi, Imogen.
- Oh, cool.
Thank you.
- Your first time out here?
- First time ever here and on a dune buggy.
- First time dune-buggying.
Part of our protocol too is you have to watch a safety video.
Okay.
What did you do to your screen?
- Well...
- It's beach modified.
It's kind of scary to watch a safety video on this screen.
- You know what I mean?
- We're a little hard on things out here.
Avoid all wildlife.
Can you imagine trying to run over these little birds?
- Do people do that?
- They try.
You are assuming all risks for any damage,
- injury, or loss of life.
- This is gonna be fun.
- Loss of life?
- Animal life.
Now you're ready to drive the dunes.
- Shall we hit it?
- Let's do it.
What's the fastest one you have?
This one?
Have a good time.
- Yeah, I'm excited.
- Thank you.
Everybody say "whiplash."
You guys can go.
Whoo!
You ready?
Check this out.
Are you serious?
Oh my god that looks crazy!
Yeah!
Whoo!
This way.
Go right down this big mountain.
Aah!
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
Hold on, I got stuck.
I got stuck on this hill.
I'm over here.
Whoa.
Whoa, I don't know if I can do this.
Whoo!
Whee!
Whoo!
- Aw!
- I'm coming!
- I'm sorry, Norman.
- I got you, babe.
I'm driving like a grandma, aren't I?
Whoo!
This way.
Here we go.
Follow me.
Ah!
Oh!
Whoa, airborne.
I just went airborne.
My God!
Whoo!
Whoo!
I got some air.
Let's go to the big one.
- Oh, (bleep).
- Oh my god.
And good-bye.
Ah!
Oh, my God, I want to do this for, like, five hours.
All right, all right.
- That was awesome.
- That was so cool.
I could seriously ride these dunes forever, but we've got miles of highway in front of us.
- Was it good?
- Oh, it was rad.
- Any time.
- Thanks, man.
So it's time to get off the beach and back on the road.
It's basically a place built out of junk.
There's stuff in here from, like, the '30s, '40s,
- up until the '80s.
- Wow.
- This is from "The Walking Dead."
- That's rad.
- This bike is running right now.
- Wait, it's running right now?
- It's running right now.
- Shut up.
- Let's do it.
- All right, all right, all right.
You look so cool.
You're a ninja right now.
Yeah, dune buggies are awesome.
Yeah, dude.
I had no idea it was that much fun.
I feel like I've gained weight in my palms on this trip.
My palms have become meaty.
I think that the dune buggying... like, whacking your hands on the steering wheel
I think makes them swell 'cause my rings are all real tight.
Yeah, I couldn't get the thing on my thing.
That's why I put the thing on your thing.
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah.
- Know what I'm saying?
- Know what I'm saying?
We've ridden 200 miles with another 50 to go tonight.
And this next leg of the ride is magical.
Wow, California sunset right there.
See, that's one thing I don't get to see in New York, an ocean sunset that rolls over the waves to the end of the world.
- So beautiful.
- So beautiful.
When I first got to LA, I worked at a Harley shop called Dr. Carl's Hog Hospital.
I did a lot of grunt work, but on the plus side, I got to see a lot of different bikes.
Back then, I always wondered what it would be like to ride up the California coast.
And this is exactly how I pictured it.
I start to daydream.
I just start like, "Ah."
I have ADDDDDDD.
You know what I mean?
No.
- Good-bye, sun.
- Oh, yeah.
- Feel the cold creeping in.
- Yeah.
It sounds like a tornado right now.
I can't hear what you're saying, but I'm happy.
I can't hear what you're saying.
Is that an abandoned house?
Yeah, it looks like it.
That looks amazing.
Can we go in there?
What the hell?
- Hey.
- What the...?
- How you guys doing?
- How you doing, man?
Norman.
Hi.
- Pretty good.
My name's Mike.
- Nice to meet you, Mike.
California is full of weird tourist attractions like Nitt Witt Ridge in the small town of Cambria.
The man who built this place, his name was actually Art Beal, but they gave him a couple colorful nicknames, and one of them was Captain Nitwit.
- Oh, wow.
- He started building in 1928.
He lived in this place till 1989, till he was 92 years old.
Wow.
- I love all the stonework.
- Yeah, that's cool.
- See all these handrails?
- Yeah.
This was the plumbing system.
They all carried water.
There's handrails throughout the whole property.
He also had a lot of toilet seats, which he would actually use for picture frames.
Oh, my God.
He called this his woman's room.
- What the?
- Wait, who are you?
Like, how are you involved here?
My wife and I bought this in 1999 from the Art Beal Foundation.
I thought I'd give the Anti-Hearst Castle tour.
William Randolph Hearst built this place in 1919 out of his massive amounts of money, and this is the anti.
This guy was a garbage man in town that took all the garbage from town...
Oh, so he collected garbage and put this together from it?
He got paid as a garbage man.
But now watch your head and I'll take you up this stairway.
Art claimed this stairway stayed 50 degrees.
- This was his refrigerator.
- I feel the chill in here.
It is colder.
- That's his stuff.
- What is that?
There's peaches, there's apricots.
There's stuff in here from, like, the '30s, '40s, up until the '80s.
This is so crazy.
I'm so happy we found this place.
As you guys can see, his clothes are still in here.
Oh, my God.
People said half the time all he'd be wearing is this bathrobe with nothing else on under it, and he'd walk around town in that thing.
They tell me he got older and it'd get windy.
Oh, my God.
And this is his two-seated outhouse.
He said he put his and her toilets in here.
He could sit here and have conversations with people.
What a crazy guy.
He thought he was a swinger, but then he never had kids.
- He has no family?
- And he never had any family.
I thought by now, after 15 years I've been up here,
"I'm his grandkid.
I'm his..." no.
It's weird.
But he liked ladies, and ladies liked him.
- He's, like, an enigma.
- He's kind of a romantic.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
And then a guy with no family or anything created his own legacy with nothing but junk.
This dude literally built his whole life into these walls.
Coming up with a way to turn trash into treasure.
There's a toilet on top of the roof.
And people said that's his throne.
He's the king of the castle up there.
Even toilet seats.
Thank you for showing us all of this.
- Take care, man.
- Yeah, you, too.
This is just the kind of wacky stuff
I've been expecting to see since we crossed from Southern to Northern California.
And just a couple miles away from where we're going to call it a night.
Bye, cool house.
Day three.
There's nothing better than waking up in Big Sur, home of the Bixby Bridge.
260 feet high and 700 feet long, this bridge is a beast.
One of the tallest single span concrete bridges in the world.
And finally, after 400 miles, we're here in Santa Cruz.
Santa Cruz is a little town tucked between the Pacific and the Santa Cruz Mountains.
I just like the way the air smells up here.
It's so clean.
Surrounded by incredible natural beauty, and with a close proximity to the San Francisco counterculture and Silicon Valley tech scenes, it's the perfect spot for anyone coming to California looking for reinvention.
- Look at that crazy house.
- Yeah, that's beautiful.
It's got a nice eclectic feel.
I hate when cities start taking over and making everything look the same.
We're here to drop in on a local podcast.
but first, we're headed to Zero Motorcycles, a pioneer manufacturer of electric motorcycles.
- Are these electric?
- Oh, cool.
For some reason I imagined them looking all crazy different.
California is a hotbed of environmental action.
So it makes sense that they made their home here.
- Ready to check this out?
- Yeah.
I used to have a dog named Zero.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Zero's Scot Harden is gonna show us their bikes and take us for a spin.
- Nice to meet you, too.
Welcome to Zero.
- All right.
All right, let's go on back into the belly of the beast.
This is where all of the main assembly is done.
It's weird to go into a motorcycle shop, building motorcycles, and it's not loud.
- It's just super weird to me.
- Yeah.
This is where it all started for Zero.
- This is the first electric motorcycle ever built.
- It's like a dirt bike, right?
It was kind of cross between an overgrown mountain bike and a motorcycle.
I think it's cool.
I really like that one.
Well, it was the idea of what could we do to change the way the world experiences motorcycles.
What kind of bike did you ride before you got into electric motorcycles?
I was a dirt bike rider.
I was born in Las Vegas, and I rode dirt bikes.
And then I started doing all the big desert races.
I kept taking on bigger challenges in Europe and then Africa.
Scariest moment in my life on a bike was in Senegal going down these roads at 80, 90, 100 miles an hour with these bushes that are this tall on each side, and there's animals running out in front of you.
Pigs and ostriches.
You're just thinking, "God, don't step out
- in front of my front wheel."
- That's terrifying.
It scared me to death.
I hit a cow at 80 miles an hour.
- You hit a cow?
- I've bounced off the hoods of cars.
- That would mess you up.
- You are so lucky.
I could tell stories.
How's it going, guys?
Do you guys all ride electric bikes now?
- Do you?
- I have ridden some before.
- Yeah?
- I ride my own motorcycles mostly.
- What do you have?
- Got a Harley and a couple dirt bikes.
Is that, like, the enemy, or is it everybody loves everything?
Everybody loves everything around here, yeah.
- Have you gone on one yet?
- We're about to try one.
Yeah?
Sick, dude.
I hope you like it.
Yeah, I'm excited.
Nice to meet you, dude.
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, it's a pleasure.
- How's it going, man?
- Good.
Since you're here.
- Oh, my God.
- Uh-oh.
- No way.
- This is from "The Walking Dead."
- That's rad.
- So...
- Big fan of yours.
- Thanks, man.
Have you guys ever thought about doing an electric dune buggy?
- I want a hat.
- All right.
- Great Frog!
- Whoo!
That's when I had short hair.
That was way back when.
I feel like I'm the only person whose never (bleep) seen this show.
- I need to watch it.
- Get out of here right now.
Bye, guys.
Go to work.
- Go to work.
- Get back to work.
- Okay, I want to see if I can touch the ground.
- Try it out.
See what fits you best.
What's your favorite color?
What's your favorite flavor?
This is a straight up dirt bike right here.
That's an off-road trail bike, yeah.
- I'm taking this one.
- This is the FXS.
This is the inner city hooligan bike.
- It's very lightweight.
- It feels light.
It's only 290 pounds.
I think you'll really like that one.
All the stuff's where you'd normally expect.
- Your turn signal's here.
- Okay.
Brake where you'd normally expect it.
Foot brake.
And then the last thing you do to arm this thing
- is hit the throttle switch.
- Okay.
Now that means this bike is running right now.
- Wow.
Wait, so it's on already?
- It's running right now?
- It's running right now.
- Shut up.
Wow.
- Wow.
- Away you go.
- Ah!
- I think we've chosen our weapons.
- Let's go out and give them a whirl.
- All right.
- All right?
- Cool.
I can't believe that that was running while we were standing there.
It's weird getting on a bike and not knowing how it's gonna feel, but that's what I love about trying out new bikes.
- Are we ready?
- I think so.
Scot's taking us up to see the legendary California redwoods.
Whoa.
- This is so crazy.
- Yeah, this is nuts.
It's gonna be the perfect way to find out what the Zero is all about.
I'm just... this is blowing me away how smooth this is.
It's like your ass is sliding on ice.
Santa Cruz redwoods.
- Hi.
- Oh, (bleep)!
I just creeped up on you and you had no idea.
No, I didn't.
I was like, "Where's Norman?"
Sometimes I get on a bike just to escape.
The roar of the motorcycle creates this wall between me and my surroundings.
- It smells really fresh.
- It does.
- Healthy and green up here.
- Like mossy.
Yeah.
That's what makes being on this bike so strange.
There's no wall.
It's just you and the world feeding off of each other.
I mean, it's perfect really for, like, going through this beautiful forest.
You're just kind of gliding.
I kind of feel like this is the future.
- I really do.
- Yeah, imagine in, like, 50 or 100 years when, like, cities are smogged up, everything will be electric.
Whee!
This is crazy 'cause I can't see the bike.
Does it feel like you're flying?
Yeah, it does.
And there's nothing like riding it through the redwoods.
You should try it.
Amazing.
Go to sport!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Have you put it in sport mode?
Yeah, dude, it's like, oh, my God.
- It's terrifying.
- All right.
Whoa!
Whoa!
I put it in sport.
It's crazy.
You feel the extra tug.
It's like, whaa!
I swallowed my Adam's apple for a second.
- It was great riding with your guys.
- You're awesome.
- Thank you so much, Scot.
- Imogen, it was really nice meeting you.
- I want an electric motorcycle now.
- Yeah, me, too.
We got more converts.
That's cool.
Cool.
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, tell me.
This belonged to my late brother Chris.
He was a huge, huge fan of yours.
Used to have posters of you guys up in the room and everything.
- Oh, man.
- He loved you guys a lot.
And this was actually in the wreck with him.
- That's why it's all mangled like this.
- Oh, dude.
I wanted to see if you could sign it.
It would mean the world to me.
Come here.
Come here.
Yeah, dude.
- Thanks, man.
- Of course.
- Sign it to Chris if you would.
- To Chris.
Of course, man.
- It was a pleasure to meet you, man.
- You, too, man.
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, dude.
Yeah.
Be well, dude.
- Ride on.
- Yeah.
Take care, man.
- Later.
- Bye.
Hearing something like that just rips me to shreds.
Reminds me that life is fragile.
I'm honored that I got to meet that guy and hear his brother's story.
Ride on, brother.
This is a pretty town.
I like it.
Yeah, it's really cute here.
You know, Santa Cruz has some really cool streets.
This is cool.
Look at this wall.
So it's nice to get off our bikes and check out the details we might have missed when we're riding by it.
Hi.
Oh, shut up, hi.
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you, too.
- Congratulations.
- Do you live up here?
- Yes, this is where I live.
- Shut up.
- You guys know each other?
- Shut up.
How are you, dude?
Nice to see you, sweetheart.
Yeah, what a pleasure.
That lady that just said hi, she was a director on "Walking Dead."
- What a small world.
Santa Cruz.
- She's awesome.
Still have to watch it.
I'm gonna send you every disc.
- Okay.
- Then I'll send you like a little... you'll have to write an essay or something.
How long have you been riding?
How did you get started riding motorcycles?
I'm into riding because of my dad.
I used to hitch a ride on the back of his bike to university and to work.
He had a BMW Dakar dual-sport thing, and I would jump on the back of that.
And now it's carried on as the inspiration as to why I love to ride.
It's because of my dad.
He died, like, a year and a half ago.
So whenever I ride, it's like...
- my special time.
- Yeah.
That cross-country trip was, like, the one-year anniversary of his death.
- I remember.
- So it was very, very special thing to have happen.
I like how your family...
you pass the torch from... like how you do your rings and the store.
- Unintentionally, but, yes.
- It's great.
People don't have that.
It's great.
I like that they have shrubberies everywhere.
- A shrubbery.
- Shrubbery.
- Do you like Monty Python?
- Oh, my God, I love Monty Python.
"Monty Python and the Holy Grail" is my favorite movie of all time.
- With the little rabbit?
- Yeah.
It goes after his throat.
- "We are the Knights that say Ni."
- Exactly.
It's nice to be back on my own bike.
Yeah, I agree.
Kind of like the rumble, but those bikes were cool, I got to say.
I like how he said, too, he's not trying to replace other motorcycles.
- It's just another experience, you know?
- Yeah.
Last stop, and I couldn't be more excited.
We're headed over to the Re-Cycle Garage...
I like Santa Cruz.
...home of this really cool podcast called "Motorcycles Misfits."
Who doesn't like geeking out on bikes with a bunch of misfits?
Welcome to "Motorcycles Misfits" at the Re-Cycle Garage.
You guys are getting all Batman on me and stuff.
What's the best bike for the zombie apocalypse?
I'm gonna tell you, and you're not gonna like my answer.
Wow, I love it up here, I got to tell you.
Love it.
Northern California is so much different than Southern California.
- It's different, yeah.
- It's such a different energy.
You know what I mean?
My first big California ride is winding down.
But first, Imogen and I are gonna make one final pit stop at the Re-Cycle Garage where a bunch of local bikers put on one of the coolest weekly podcasts on the West Coast.
It's called "Motorcycles Misfits."
- Hello.
- What's up?
Hi.
- I'm Norman.
- Liza.
- Nice to meet you.
Hi.
- Hi.
Imogen.
- Hey, Imogen.
- Nice to meet you.
These are some nice little rides you got.
This is a little bit nicer version than mine, but you know.
- This is awesome, though.
That's beautiful.
- Thank you.
- I built that one.
- Did you really?
Right on.
Yes.
Do you teach people that don't know how to work on bikes how to work on bikes?
Yes, but nobody here is a mechanic.
- Oh, wow.
- Everyone helps each other work on bikes.
We teach people how to ride, help them buy their gear, teach them what are the cool movies to watch.
Expose them to the entire culture.
- How cool.
- Yeah, so we've kind of built up this crazy community.
I like that you have such an eclectic mix of bikes here.
- Hey, if they can ride, we'll let them in.
- How did the podcast start?
When you get a group of people sitting around the garage working on bikes, you have conversations.
We play pranks, we tell stories, we share rides and experiences and opinions.
Wow, that's so cool.
So we thought, "How can we bottle this and share it with everyone?
Podcast."
- We're ready.
- Check, one, two.
- Microphone check.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.
We are gonna go in five, four, three...
Hey, there.
Welcome to "Motorcycles Misfits"
at the Re-Cycle Garage here in sunny Santa Cruz, California.
- Warm and sunny.
- It was quite sunny.
Let's get to one of our topics.
What's the best bike for the zombie apocalypse?
And we have a special guest here.
Somebody who actually has experience in this field, and I want to get their opinion.
So I'd like to welcome here Norman Reedus.
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
- Hi, thanks for having me.
- Hey, dude.
Welcome.
I'm gonna tell you, and I think you're not gonna like my answer.
- Oh, yeah?
- I think what I would do is I'd get one of these Zero bikes, and I would put a solar panel on the back of it.
'Cause anything that makes noise attracts zombies.
- Right.
- Right?
And I caught a lot of flack for having that Triumph with the ape hangers.
I caught a lot of flack, and then I built another bike, miraculously in, like, six hours on that show.
And I get a lot of flack because that one makes a lot of noise as well.
How did you come to have that bike?
That's supposed to be Merle's bike.
Did he customize the frame up that high?
I guess.
I don't know.
What the (bleep)?
Um...
- So I would like to make some suggestions.
- Uh-oh, here we go.
First you should consider an anti-theft device of some kind.
- Oh, I like it.
- Just saying.
Second, more mirrors, I would suggest.
It would be nice to maybe see something coming up behind you.
Yeah, I... yeah.
Lastly, a machine gun on the front because what bike isn't cooler with a machine gun on the front?
Yeah, we've thought about attaching weapons to that thing.
You could just drill a hole in your exhaust and squirt some soap in it and make a smokescreen.
You guys are getting all Batman on me and stuff.
How's motorcycling changed you?
A bunch.
It's changed me a bunch.
Like, I ride to work every day and I think about what I'm about to do and it really gets me in the mood.
And then I ride home.
I think about what I did.
I don't know.
It's almost like yoga or something at some point.
- You know what I mean?
- It's therapeutic.
The best rides I think are the spontaneous ones.
I gave an award at the Country Music Awards in Nashville when I was down in Georgia and, you know, they booked me a flight to go there and everything.
And I'm sitting there watering my plants and I'm looking at my bike, and I'm watering my plants, and I said, "(bleep) it." And I grabbed the suit,
I shoved it in a backpack, wrote all my directions on my arm.
And then I kept going through rainstorms, and I just kept losing them.
But that ride to Nashville is one of my favorites.
Is your dog snoring right now?
Is that what that was?
Oh, my God, that's adorable.
Thank you, everyone, for listening, and thank you guys for joining us.
You guys are so much fun.
Thank you.
I was looking for a group ride when I first moved here, and I ran into Zach.
He had a crappy motorcycle but a nice jacket, so I asked him...
I was like, "So where's the ride?"
And I asked him if they could show me how to change my oil.
- And this is where we are now.
- Yeah.
- That was three years ago.
- Nice.
When I fist showed up, Liza just shoved a broken moped at me and was like, "Here, fix this."
She does that to a lot of people.
That's how she hooks you in.
She's like, "Oh, here's this free bike.
Just get it running and it's yours."
- And two years later, I was still here.
- That's cool.
And she's all, "Hey, Dad," when she was 13,
"I want to ride motorcycles." I'm all, "Hell, no."
And she's like, "Whatever.
I'll be 18 someday." I'm like, "Ugh, yeah."
So you guys are father and daughter?
That is so cool.
Yeah, so then I started hanging around.
And then I just got hooked.
You guys all know what it's like.
You hop on the bike, you're rolling the throttle,
- and everything melts away.
- Yeah.
So we're chasing the sun.
- Let's saddle up and do a quick ride.
- Shall we hit it?
I always feel at home surrounded by a bunch of outsiders.
And California is a magnet.
It attracts people who don't fit in anywhere else.
Everyone's got a totally different vibe here, but their love of bikes ties them together, and I love that.
And the Misfits are doing the rest of us a huge favor bringing these unique bikes back to life.
That's the kind of passion for motorcycles, for life, that has made my ride up the California coast so incredible.
It's not just here.
California is a place where all of us misfits can fit in.
And sure, you're not gonna find roads like the PCH anywhere else on the planet.
It's empowering to learn how to do something.
If you can build or fix something, what else can you do in your life, you know?
But California is more than just breathtaking beauty.
It's the people here.
The sense of rebellion you find everywhere you go.
The creativity.
The freedom to try whatever the hell you want.
That's the California I found on this ride.
And that's the California I'm gonna keep coming back to for the rest of my life.
You guys are awesome.
I really love what you guys have going here.
This is really cool.
- Bye, guys.
- Bye!
- Bye.
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much for coming on this trip.
- It's been a blast.
- You are very welcome.
That was awesome.
Dune buggying.
- Dune buggies, yes.
- Yes, and the coastline and the sunsets.
[♪♪♪]
I take it I'm not being transferred to Leavenworth?
Miss Hitchin doesn't like loose ends.
You understand.
Of course.
Actually, I helped put those protocols in place.
She wanted me to be sure to thank you for your years of service.
I suppose a gold watch would have been too much to hope for.
Let me guess.
You blew a tire, stopped the transport to change it...
-...and shot me as I tried to escape.
- Close.
I pulled over to take a leak, you grabbed a gun.
Took you down...
-...after you shot him in the leg.
- Nobody's shooting me in the leg.
My bad.
You shot him in the head.
Run.
You heard me.
Run.
[GUNSHOTS]
[♪♪♪]
And who might you be?
Are you serious?
What about the rings, and a photographer--
And the dress, and the flowers, and all that stuff.
We don't need it.
They had a cancellation at the church.
I say we go for it.
Hold on, I thought we were gonna try to do things right this time.
Doesn't this feel right?
To do it now, today.
At St. Cecilia's, where we wanted to do it the first time.
It feels kind of crazy.
I mean, there's other dates available.
April 25th.
I'm due on the 22nd.
All right, so let's say we could get this done today.
Which I really don't know if we can.
It's not gonna be perfect.
It'll be better than waiting a week or two and having you roll me down the aisle.
If that is what it takes, I'll roll you wherever you need to go.
[♪♪♪]
But are you absolutely sure about this?
Come on.
It's me and you.
We usually do, like, six impossible things before breakfast.
I love it when you misquote Lewis Carroll.
I know.
That's why I do it.
Ah, ah!
- What?
- Wait till the wedding night.
RAYMOND:
Seventy-two hours ago, Matias Solomon escaped from custody while being transferred to a holding facility.
- How does that happen?
- The official story is he overpowered a guard, wrestled away his gun and managed to kill the entire transport team before vanishing like the proverbial will-of-the-wisp.
And the unofficial story?
The Cabal?
Apparently not, considering all of the dead men were assets of the Cabal.
Yesterday, Solomon reached out to an associate of mine.
A man with a very specialized field of expertise.
Solomon was inquiring about the storage and transport of tactical nuclear weapons.
Which would be troubling enough on its own but coupled with the fact your Air Force is scheduled to transport just such a weapon down the New Jersey Turnpike I'm afraid your wedding plans will have to wait, Lizzy.
Is that what this is really about?
Getting me to delay my wedding?
This is about preventing Matias Solomon from getting his hands on a nuclear weapon.
[♪♪♪]
-l'll take it to the task force.
- I was hoping you'd say that.
But I'm not going to get involved.
What I am going to do is get married.
And I hope you can be there.
Both of you.
Thank you, Elizabeth.
[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]
I just got off the phone with Justice.
Reddington was right about Solomon.
He escaped three days ago.
He left a pile of bodies behind him.
- Why didn't we hear of it?
- Looks like a covert Cabal operation.
- An execution gone wrong.
- And the nuke?
Ran into a wall with the Office of Secure Transportation.
They refused to acknowledge if they had weapons in transit.
The weapon Reddington was talking about is the latest generation of so called gravity bombs.
It's completely maneuverable, and has an adjustable yield so you can choose whether to destroy a small city, or just a couple of blocks.
LIZ:
That's convenient.
Did you get your information from Beyoncé herself?
Oh.
Uh, sorry.
The playlist for the wedding reception.
Which I really need to discuss with you.
Uh, about the wedding.
Uh, it's this afternoon.
- I thought you and Tom hadn't set a date.
- Which is why I came to talk to you.
Let me guess.
You told Reddington, he gave you the case.
Yes.
Which I'm not taking, but I think that you should.
- Even if it means you can't make it.
ARAM:
Hang on.
No.
I don't have the playlist or a gift.
I was gonna lose a few pounds to fit in my slim-fit suit, which is hound's-tooth, by the way.
Uh...
Look, it's very small.
Just a few friends.
I'd love you to be there but preventing Solomon from getting this weapon is more important than watching me re-marry my ex-husband.
COOPER:
I have a meeting with General Baxter at the Pentagon.
I'll find out if there's actually a threat.
Meantime, reach out to Homeland and Nuclear Security at the DOE.
See if Solomon's on anyone's radar.
Hey, look.
I meant what I said about you taking this case.
But if you happen to be done in time, I'd love it if you'd perform the ceremony.
- Liz, I'm flattered, but I'm not qualified.
- You can get ordained online.
It takes like 10 minutes.
Uh, look, there's a minister, but we don't know him.
And I'd just much rather you say a few words.
[♪♪♪]
Assuming I can get away, I'd be honored.
Great.
The service is at 4.
No pressure.
[♪♪♪]
- This is everything?
- We load it in here, we're good to go.
All right then.
Let's go steal ourselves a nuclear warhead.
[♪♪♪]
TOM:
Hey, you.
LIZ:
How are we doing?
Good.
We got the rings, and I got a place to hold the ceremony.
You know, it turns out I am amazing at impromptu wedding planning.
I had no idea.
How you doing?
I got your suit from the cleaner and dropped it at the apartment.
And Reddington?
How did he take the news?
Today's not about him.
It's about you marrying a woman...
-...eight months pregnant.
- Right.
We're screwed.
Should I downgrade your bouquet to daisies?
I told you peonies.
And don't forget the candles.
Candles, peonies.
My first honey-do list.
I'll call you in an hour.
[♪♪♪]
Let me be clear, Harold.
I'm not going to confirm or deny any mission details about movements of our nuclear arsenal.
Rolly, my Cl is reliable.
If he says your convoy will be hit on the Jersey Turnpike...
-...it's gonna be hit.
- Duly noted.
If you're going to ignore me, you could've done it over the phone.
I had you come here because I wanna make it abundantly clear this is a military operation.
You and your team need to stand down.
General Baxter, you have a problem.
I can help.
It's not a request, Harold.
Tell your people to stand down.
- Yeah, look, that's just not gonna happen.
- No.
It's not.
We can't protect the convoy directly, so focus on Solomon.
He's burned with the Cabal.
He needs a team.
I'll check with Mossad.
See what mercs they're tracking.
Have Aram put together a list of equipment they'd need to pull this off.
Liz.
Playlist for the wedding.
It's definitely a work in progress, so...
Hey, you heard Cooper.
We got a lot of work to do.
If there's any way that we can get there, we will.
- Hey.
Are we good?
- Yeah.
Fine.
It's, uh, your big day.
This is about you and Tom.
- Look, I know the two of you have--
- It's not about him and me.
It's about him.
He laid a hand on you.
As far as I'm concerned, there's no coming back from that.
I get where you're coming from and I love you for saying it.
But I kept him prisoner in the hull of a ship and tortured him for two months.
So in my book we're even.
- I said my piece.
- Mm-hm.
If I can be there for you today, I will.
- Mr. Cooper, genius.
- What is it?
ARAM:
No wonder he's the assistant director.
The way his mind works, his attention to detail...
- I can't believe he's living in his office.
-l'm sorry, what?
- Did I just say that or think that?
- He's living in his office?
Oh.
No.
I mean, not living-living.
He's working-living.
He's here all the time.
Point is, he was right.
To handle a nuclear weapon, Solomon and his men will need something to shield themselves from the radiation.
The Hunt Valley Nuclear Research Facility.
Right outside Baltimore.
Robbed an hour ago by a group of armed men who took an isotope transfer cask.
All right, let's go.
WOMAN:
You guys are a little late to the party.
We've already got Homeland, DOE and the FBI interviewing the staff but I was told to help you with whatever you need.
- We're part of a special task force.
- Yeah, you seem pretty special.
- It must've been traumatic this morning.
WOMAN:
It wasn't fun.
About the worst we've had before was anti-nuke yahoos climbing the fences and spray painting the joint.
Show them what we got.
[♪♪♪]
It's definitely Solomon.
WOMAN:
He's the one.
Said something about stealing a nuke.
The other, she was talking about payloads and guidance systems.
Let's see if Aram can ID her.
If I give you a secure e-mail, can you forward this footage?
Yeah, no problem.
[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]
I thought you said it was bad luck to see each other before the wedding.
Liz?
[♪♪♪]
Even worse luck to see me before the wedding.
I thought we had an agreement.
We're done.
- Gina, what are you doing here?
- Just doing a favor for a friend.
[GUN COCKS]
Hello, Jacob.
Long time no see.
[♪♪♪]
Tell me you got something, Aram.
- What about the B-52s?
- The planes?
The band.
Total crowd pleaser, right? "Rock Lobster."
- Aram, please focus.
- Uh, yeah, right.
I've ID'd the woman in the video as Nez Rowan.
Sending you her info now.
She is ex-Navy, where she was a nuclear weapons specialist.
I guess we now know why she's on the team.
She also goes by about a half dozen other aliases.
Been a freelancer for eight years.
- You have anything to trace her?
- One of her preferred aliases Harper Waters, is checked into a motel in Baltimore.
RESSLER:
All right, send us the details and have a TAC team meet us there.
Desk clerk confirmed our target's in room five.
We were able to snake a camera in the air duct from the adjoining room.
Another door opens to the parking lot.
I've got a second team there.
We're gonna breach from the hallway.
Don't let her get out that other door.
[♪♪♪]
- Navabi, you in place?
SAMAR:
Affirmative.
Two.
[MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
MAN 1:
South corridor clear.
MAN 2:
Command Six...
-... you have eyes on the target?
MAN 3:
Go, go, go!
MAN 2:
We've got a silver SUV.
Keep moving.
MAN 1:
Copy.
En route.
Move.
MAN 3:
Keep on blocking the exits.
MAN 1:
We have a runner.
- Move.
Move.
MAN 1:
Female suspect on the move.
- Team one, move up.
- Stop!
[ENGINE SPUTTERING]
Next one's in your head.
Hands where I can see them, now.
[♪♪♪]
See, we got you on video at the Hunt Valley robbery.
We've got a motel room filled with classified documents and two wounded agents, one in critical care who may never walk again.
The only thing going for you at this point is that he's not dead.
- I was unarmed.
- Oh, that doesn't matter.
You're an accessory.
And if your crew succeeds in its attempt to hit that convoy and steal the nuclear device you're gonna get a needle in your arm, just like your boss, Mr. Solomon.
The only reason I mentioned I was unarmed was because it might factor into the deal you're gonna offer.
You've got nothing to bargain with.
I'm a professional.
I pledge allegiance to the highest bidder.
I have no loyalty to Mr. Solomon or anyone else beyond the terms of our business arrangement.
Once they left me in that motel, our contract was null and void.
But if you make me an offer I will tell you what you want to know.
No deal.
Yes.
Deal.
Full immunity.
No jail time.
And witness protection.
Solomon and his friends are very motivated and very powerful.
And if their plan goes south, they'll know who talked.
And they'll be very, very peeved.
Before you throw me in the hole, tell the Pentagon geniuses we know the convoy on the turnpike is a decoy.
Then let's see how fast they wanna cut a deal.
McCREADY:
You are a genuine anomaly.
The St. Regis program has consistently produced reliable operatives.
Except for you.
Is there a question coming?
Where do you think we went wrong?
When did you start to feel love for Elizabeth Keen?
I don't know.
I just know that it happened.
And I'm really glad that it did.
- Even now?
- Especially now.
[♪♪♪]
You were my finest accomplishment.
And my biggest disappointment.
Mine too.
Get up.
Get up.
Turn around.
Get on your knees.
[♪♪♪]
Goodbye, Jacob.
[SILENCED GUNSHOTS]
Was that your plan?
A little sooner would've been nice.
To tell you the truth, up until I pulled the trigger I hadn't made up my mind yet.
Well, have you made it up now?
Those last few weeks when I thought you were dead I actually missed you.
But I meant what I said.
You're my greatest disappointment.
I've acquired new intel regarding your convoy.
I thought I made myself abundantly clear on this issue.
We have a suspect in custody, a nuclear weapons specialist.
She claims the convoy on the turnpike is a decoy.
[♪♪♪]
- Rolly?
-l'm here.
Listen to me, we've got to find out everything she knows.
Immediately.
She's asking for immunity.
I don't care.
Give it to her.
Give her whatever she wants.
Rolly, the truth.
ls the nuke vulnerable?
A minute ago, I would have said no.
I thought you'd come around.
Your deal is contingent upon your intel being valid.
Start talking.
The real convoy is coming in on 95 at 1550 hours.
There's an abandoned van parked under the overpass at mile marker 22 packed with a 1500 pound ANFO bomb.
They'll blow the bridge when the real convoy gets there--
- Shutting down traffic.
- Once the convoy stops, they'll hit it.
Hard.
Twenty-six seasoned mercs with enough firepower to retake Omaha Beach.
Hey, tell all your Feeb buddies to pack extra pairs of shorts.
They're gonna need them.
I've got a satellite view of the overpass.
But if there is a van, we can't see it from the air.
- Who's on site?
- Maryland State Police is coordinating with the Office of Special Transport.
They're shutting down the 95 and rerouting the convoy.
- Explosive Ordinance Disposal en route.
- No, I'll take the call.
I got back-up.
It'll make a difference to Keen if neither of us is at that wedding.
Go.
I'll be okay.
- Give her a hug for me, okay?
- I will.
Be careful.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Yes.
What brings you here?
You need an update on the Solomon case?
I just got off the phone with Agent Navabi.
She thoroughly briefed me on the situation.
Oh.
Then you're here for the wedding.
No, Lizzy.
I'm here to ask you, to implore you please, don't do this.
[♪♪♪]
I'm telling you, no matter what you believe Tom is not the man you think he is.
[SIGHS]
You're wrong.
You don't know him.
He's a criminal.
No.
He's changed.
RAYMOND:
Men like Tom don't change.
You're attempting to build a life with a man who is fundamentally dishonest.
[THUNDER CRASHES]
No.
I am attempting to build a life with the father of my child.
A normal life with two parents who love one another.
With everything you know about me, can't you see that?
Can't you see how important that is to me?
To my child?
RAYMOND:
You were wrong about him once.
What makes you so sure you're not wrong this time?
Do you really want your child to pay the price for that mistake for the rest of his or her life?
Get out.
I want you to go, please.
I don't want you here.

- Traffic's about to be shut down.
- EOD just pulled up.
- All right, well, hurry it up.
Get everybody back, set up a perimeter.
Solomon and his team must be close.
[♪♪♪]
Raymond, we should turn around.
You're upset.
I'm sure Elizabeth didn't mean--
- Why didn't she escape with the others?
- Who?
The mercenary agents Ressler and Navabi arrested at the motel.
She could have fled with Solomon escaped in the SUV with the others.
Agent Navabi said she broke off on her own tried to get away in a second vehicle.

But he's dead.
And I, uh...

Actually, Gina did.
But that's a long story.
But what I want you to know is that it happened because I made it clear that I'm out.

Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe the car means nothing.
Maybe she was just unlucky.
Why didn't it start?
What do you mean?
Starts just fine.
Drove it up onto the flatbed myself.
She's a sacrifice.
Solomon isn't after that weapon.
It's a distraction to keep us looking one way while they go another.
He's after Elizabeth.
[TIRES SCREECHING]
RESSLER:
Listen, give me two two-man teams going north and south, all right?
Thank you.
Reddington, suspect lied about the location of the attack on the convoy.
There is no attack.
There never was.
The target is Agent Keen.
You need to get to the church, Donald.
RESSLER:
What are you talking about?
RAYMOND:
Ever since Elizabeth went public as Masha Rostova still waters have been stirred and old grudges have surfaced.
And now someone out there is singularly focused on coming for her.
RESSLER:
Coming to kill her?
RAYMOND:
No.
To abduct her.
RESSLER:
They're sending Solomon.
RAYMOND:
In retrospect, the perfect choice.
He knows us intimately, he knows about the task force.
They gave us a false trail, and we followed the scent.
Donald, if Fm right, and this was all an elaborate feint all that matters is that you get to that church.
Now.
RESSLER:
On my way.
We are gathered here today in celebration of Elizabeth and Torn.
In my years on this Earth I've been blessed with some remarkable friendships.
And I've come to believe that friends are indeed the family we choose.
We are here today to witness the beginning of a new family inspired by the love of a man and a woman who have found in each other, their truest friend.
Two people who choose each other.
Now, each choice brings with it blessings as well as hardships.
Choosing a partner means choosing that person's life to become your life.
Their joy becomes your joy as do their burdens.
Nobody gets in.
The sum of our choices are a weight that each individual carries alone.
But as man and wife as partners you choose to shoulder that weight together.
And all of us here today we celebrate the choice you've made.
[DOOR OPENS]
[♪♪♪]
Elizabeth, I'm sorry, but we need to go.
What are you doing here?
Men are coming for you.
We need to leave now.

Solomon never intended to take that weapon.
He was contracted by an employer to take you.
[GUNS COCK]

- They're here.

It's curious.
I thought you were the Cabal's most loyal soldier.
Yet here you are, under the patronage of a new benefactor.
I was loyal to the Cabal.
Right up until they tried to kill me.
I'm totally violating my non-compete agreement but what the hell.
So where do we go from here?
I was instructed to deliver Masha Rostova to my employer.
That's what I intend to do.
Send her out, and this can all be over.
So this is your big plan?
An assault on a building filled with armed FBI agents?
Honestly, Matias, I expect better from you.
First of all you and I both know that you are outmanned and outgunned.
The plan was to grab her today, no matter where she was.
Grocery store or house of God, it makes little difference to me.
And for the record, I take no offense that I wasn't invited.
It came together rather nicely.
They went with ruby fringe tulips and pink peonies.
You'd be impressed.
I tell you what, then.
I'll call back in a couple of minutes.
Give you time to consider my offer.
And then, I'm coming in to check out the flowers myself.

They're jamming it.

You owe me this.

Harold, we need to barricade that back door.
- Aram.
- Yeah.
Give me a hand.
It's our only way out.
If we get out at all, it will be through the front.
Most importantly, keep Elizabeth out of sight.
No one's keeping me anywhere.
If anything happens to you, if you're hurt or taken, none of this means anything.
Don't you get it?
I'm the only one in this building they're not gonna shoot.
Exactly.

Previously on The Blacklist...
Yes, I want to marry you.
Anything happened to me, this was to go to Elizabeth, just so she'd know.
You said the name Masha Rostova had been lost to history until the manhunt.
Now it's out there, and someone's looking for me?
It's my mother!
I am asking you to help me.
Walk away.
He came.
How do you want me to handle it?

I take it I'm not actually being transferred to Leavenworth.
Ms. Hitchin doesn't like loose ends.
You understand.
Of course.
Actually...
I helped put those protocols in place.
She wanted me to be sure to thank you for your years of service.
I suppose a gold watch would have been too much to hope for.
Let me guess.
You blew a tire, stopped the transport to change it, and shot me as I tried to escape?
Close.
I pulled over to take a leak, you grabbed Joe's gun, took you down after you shot him in the leg.
Nobody's shooting me in the leg.

I thought we were gonna try to do things right this time.
Doesn't this feel right?
To do it now, today at St. Cecilia's, where we wanted to do it the first time?
It feels kind of crazy.
I mean, there's other dates available.
April 25th.
I'm due on the 22nd.
All right, so let's say we could get this done today, which I...
I really don't know if we can.
It's not gonna be perfect.
But it will be a lot better than waiting a week or two and having you roll me down the aisle.
If that's what it takes,
I will roll you wherever you need to go.
But are you absolutely sure about this?
Come on.
It's me and you.
We usually do like six impossible things before breakfast.
I love it when you misquote Lewis Carroll.
I know.
That's why I do it.
- Ah-ah.
- What?
Wait until the wedding night.
72 hours ago, Matias Solomon escaped from custody while being transferred to a holding facility.
How does that happen?
The official story is he overpowered a guard, wrestled away his gun, and managed to kill the entire transport team before vanishing like the proverbial will-of-the-wisp.
And the unofficial story?
The Cabal?
Apparently not, considering all of the dead men were assets of the Cabal.
Yesterday, Solomon reached out to an associate of mine-- a man with a very specialized field of expertise.
Solomon was inquiring about the storage and transport of tactical nuclear weapons, which would be troubling enough on its own, but coupled with the fact that your Air Force is scheduled to transport just such a weapon down the New Jersey Turnpike,
I'm afraid your wedding plans will have to wait, Lizzy.
Is that what this is really about?
Getting me to delay my wedding?
This is about preventing Matias Solomon from getting his hands on a nuclear weapon.
I'll take it to the task force.
I was hoping you'd say that.
But I'm not going to get involved.
What I am going to do is get married.
And I hope you can be there.
Both of you.
Thank you, Elizabeth.
I just got off the phone with Justice.
Reddington was right about Solomon.
He escaped from a transport vehicle three days ago.
He left a pile of bodies behind him.
Why didn't we hear about this?
Looks like a covert Cabal operation, an execution gone wrong.
And the nuke?
Ran into a brick wall with the Office of Secure Transportation.
They refused to acknowledge whether they had any weapons in transit.
The weapon Mr. Reddington was talking about is the latest generation of so-called "gravity bombs."
It is completely maneuverable and has an adjustable yield, so you can choose whether to destroy a small city or just a couple of blocks.
That's convenient.
Did you get your information from Beyoncé herself?
Oh.
Uh, sorry.
Playlist for the wedding reception.
Which I really need to discuss with you.
Um, about the wedding-- Uh, it's this afternoon.
Uh, I thought you and Tom hadn't set a date.
Which is what I came to talk to you about.
Let me guess-- soon as you told Reddington,
- he gave you the case.
- Yes.
Which I'm not taking, but I think that you should, even if it means you can't make it.
Hang on.
No, no, no, no.
I'm not even done with the playlist.
I don't have your wedding gift.
I was gonna lose a few pounds to fit in my new slim-fit suit, which is houndstooth, by the way...
Look, it's very small.
Just a few friends.
I would love it if you could be there, but preventing Solomon from getting this weapon is much more important than coming to watch me remarry my ex-husband.
I've got a meeting with General Baxter at the Pentagon.
I'll find out if there's actually a threat here.
In the meantime, reach out to Homeland and Nuclear Security at the DOE.
See if Solomon's on anyone's radar.
Hey.
Look, I meant what I said about you taking this case, but if you happen to be done in time,
I would love it if you could perform the ceremony.
Liz, I'm flattered, but I'm not qualified.
You can get ordained online.
It takes like 10 minutes.
Uh, look, there's a minister, but we don't know him, and I'd just much rather you say a few words.
Assuming I can get away, I'd be honored.
Great.
The service is at 4:00.
No pressure.
_
This is everything?
We load it in here, we're good to go.
All right, then.
Let's go steal ourselves a nuclear warhead.
- Hey, you.
- How we doing?
Good.
We got the rings, and I got a place to hold the ceremony.
You know, it turns out I am amazing at impromptu wedding planning.
I had no idea.
How you doing on your end?
I picked up your suit from the cleaners, and I dropped it at the apartment.
And Reddington, how'd he take the news?
Today is not about him.
It's about you marrying a woman who is eight months pregnant.
You're right.
We're screwed.
Should I downgrade your bouquet of roses to daisies?
I told you peonies.
And don't forget the candles.
Candles, peonies-- my first honey-do list.
I'll, uh, call you in an hour.
Let me be clear, Harold.
I'm not gonna confirm or deny any mission details about the movements of our nuclear arsenal.
Rolly, my CI is reliable.
If he says your convoy's gonna be hit on the Jersey Turnpike, it's gonna be hit.
Duly noted.
If you were gonna ignore me, you could have had the courtesy to do it over the phone.
I had you come here because I want to make it abundantly clear-- this is a military operation.
You and your team need to stand down.
General Baxter, you have a problem.
I can help.
It's not a request, Harold.
Tell your people to stand down.
Yeah, look, that's just not gonna happen.
No.
It's not.
We can't protect the convoy directly, so let's focus on Solomon.
He's burned with the Cabal, so he's gonna need a team.
I can check with Mossad.
See what mercs they're tracking in the area.
And have Aram put together a list of equipment they might need to pull this off.
Liz.
- Yeah.
- Uh, playlist for the wedding.
It's definitely a work in progress, so...
You heard Cooper.
We got a lot of work to do, guys.
If there's any way that we can get there, we will.
Hey.
We good?
Yeah.
Fine.
It's, uh, your big day.
This is about you and Tom.
Look, I know the two of you have--
It's not about him and me.
It's about him.
I mean, he laid a hand on you.
As far as I'm concerned, there's no coming back from that.
I get where you're coming from, and I love you for saying it.
But I kept him prisoner in the hull of a ship and tortured him for two months, so in my book we're even.
Hey, I said my piece.
If I can be there for you today, I will.
Mr. Cooper, genius.
What?
What is it?
No wonder he is the Assistant Director.
The way his mind works, his attention to detail,
I can't believe he's living in his office.
I'm sorry.
What?
Did I just say that or think that?
He's living in his office?
Oh.
No.
I mean, not living living.
He's-- he's working living.
He's here all the time.
Point is, he was right.
Uh, to handle a nuclear weapon,
Solomon and his men will need something to shield themselves from the radiation.
The Hunt Valley Nuclear Research Facility.
Right outside of Baltimore.
They were robbed an hour ago by a group of armed men who took an isotope transfer cask.
All right, let's go.
You guys are a little late to the party.
We've already got Homeland, DOE, and the FBI interviewing the staff, but I was told to help you with whatever you need.
We're part of a special task force.
Yeah, you seem pretty special.
It must have been very traumatic this morning.
Well, it wasn't fun.
About the worst we had before that was a bunch of anti-nuke yahoos climbing the fences and spray-painting the joint.
Show them what we got.
That's definitely Solomon.
Yeah, he's the one.
Said something about stealing a nuke.
The other, she was talking about payloads and guidance systems.

The only thing you've got going for you at this point is that he's not dead.
- I was unarmed.
- Oh, that doesn't matter.
You're an accessory.
And if your crew succeeds in its attempt to hit that convoy and steal the nuclear device, you're gonna get a needle in your arm, just like your boss, Mr. Solomon.
The only reason I mentioned I was unarmed was because it might factor into the deal you're gonna offer.
You've got nothing to bargain with.
I'm a professional.
I pledge allegiance to the highest bidder.
I have no loyalty to Mr. Solomon or anyone else beyond the terms of our business arrangement.
Once they left me in that motel, our contract was null and void.
But if you make me an offer,
I will tell you what you want to know.
No deal.
Yes.
Deal.
Full immunity.
No jail time.
And witness protection.
Solomon and his friends are very motivated and very powerful.
And if their plan goes south, they'll know who talked and they'll be very, very peeved.
Before you throw me in the hole, tell the geniuses at the Pentagon we know the convoy on the turnpike is a decoy.
Then let's see how fast they want to cut a deal.
You are a genuine anomaly.

Your deal is contingent upon your intel being valid.

The real convoy is coming in on 95 at 1550 hours.

They're shutting down the 95 and rerouting the convoy.
Explosive Ordinance Disposal is en route.

Their joy becomes your joy, as do their burdens.
Nobody gets in.
The sum of our choices are a weight that each individual carries alone.
But as man and wife, as partners, you choose to shoulder that weight together.
And all of us here today... we celebrate the choice you've made.
Elizabeth, I'm sorry, but we need to go.
What are you doing here?
Men are coming for you.
We need to leave now.
Solomon never intended to take that weapon.
He was contracted by an employer to take you.

They're here.
Tom.
Keep clear of the windows.
Everybody, stay low.
Aram, get these people out of here now.
Stay down, stay down.
Stay down, stay down.
I'm sorry, Lizzy.
You have a team in position?
We have a perimeter.
Agent Ressler's en route.
In the meantime, we'll have to hold the fort.
The others?
Great.
We're surrounded.
Cooper.
Yeah.
You know why I'm here.
Send her out.
It's curious.
I thought you were the Cabal's most loyal soldier.
And yet here you are, under the patronage of a new benefactor.
I was loyal to the Cabal.
Right up until they tried to kill me.
I'm totally violating my non-compete agreement, but... what the hell?
So where do we go from here?
I was instructed to deliver Masha Rostova to my employer and that's what I intend to do.
Send her out, and this can all be over.
So, this is your big plan-- an assault on a building filled with armed FBI agents?
Honestly, Matias, I expect better from you.
First of all, you and I both know that you are outmanned and outgunned.
The plan was to grab her today, no matter where she was.
Grocery store or house of God, it makes little difference to me.
And for the record,
I take no offense that I wasn't invited.
Came together rather nicely.
They went with ruby fringe tulips and pink peonies.
You'd be impressed.
I'll tell you what, then.
I'll call you back in a couple of minutes.
Give you some time to consider my offer.
And then I'm coming in to check out the flowers myself.

Your target is Elizabeth Keen.
She's to be taken alive and unharmed, but please... feel free to kill anybody else.
All right, don't worry.
My friends, they are the best at what they do.
There's no signal.
They're jamming it.
When Solomon calls back, they'll have to stop.
You'll have a few seconds to get a message out.
Reddington.
It's her, isn't it?
Solomon's employer.
It's my mother.
Who else would call me Masha Rostova?
Lizzy, your mother is dead.
Then who is it?
Who?
You owe me this.
I'll tell you what I know as soon as I know you're safe.
We're not all out of options here.
Nobody has to get hurt.
Lizzy, you are not going out there
- under any circumstances.
- Agreed.
You want me to ask those poor, terrified people what they think?
No.
Hello, Matias.
What's it gonna be?
Is she coming out, or am I coming in?
- I'm coming out!
- No.
There seems to be some disagreement on that score.
We'll need a little more time to sort this out.
You've had all the time that you're gonna get.
Brace yourselves.
They're coming.
This is on you.
Yes.
All of this, indeed, is on me.
Your SOS get through?
Let's hope so.
Okay.
Concentrate your fire up front.
Drive them toward the back of the room.
They'll attack the front first.
Try and drive us out the back.
Most of his men will be there.
Once you breach the front doors, it'll be quick.
Pin them down, and we'll come in through the back and put it to bed.
Harold, we need to barricade that back door.
- Aram.
- Yeah.
Give me a hand.
It's our only way out.
If we get out at all, it'll be through the front.
Most importantly, you need to keep Elizabeth out of sight.
No one's keeping me anywhere.
Liz, if anything happens to you, if you get hurt or taken, none of this means anything.
Don't you get it?
I'm the only one in this building they're not gonna shoot.
Exactly.
So if they don't know where you are, they're going to be a lot more careful about where they point their weapons.
Feels familiar, eh?
Kinshasa.
Let's hope this ends better than that did.
Light 'em up.
The baby.
Like you said, you're the only one they're not gonna hurt.
The baby is safe.

Cooper:
Previously on the blacklist...
Yes.
I want to marry you.
If anything happened to me, this was to go to elizabeth.
So she'd know.
You said the name masha rostova had been lost to history
Until the manhunt, now it's out there and someone is looking for me?
It's my mother.
I'm asking you to help me walk away.
He came.
How do you want me to handle it?
I take it I'm not actually being transferred to leavenworth?
Miss hitchin doesn't like loose ends.
(truck door opens)
You understand.
(truck door closes) of course.
Actually, I helped put those protocols in place.
She wanted me to be sure to thank you for your years of service.
I suppose a gold watch would have been too much to hope for?
Let me guess.
You blew a tire, stopped the transport to change it,
And shot me when I tried to escape.
Close.
I pulled over to take a leak, and you grabbed joe's gun.
We took you down after you shot him in the leg.
Nobody's shooting me in the leg.
My bad.
You shot him in the head.
(sighs) run.
You heard me.
Run.
(gun shots)
(groans)
And who might you be?
Are you serious?
What about the rings, and a photographer...
And a dress, and the flowers, and all that stuff.
We don't need it.
They had a cancellation at the church this afternoon,
I say we go for it.
Hold on, I thought we were gonna
Try to do things right this time.
Doesn't this feel right?
To do it now, today,
At st cecilia's, where we wanted to do it the first time.
It feels kind of crazy.
I mean, there's other dates available.
April 25th.
I'm due on the 22nd.
All right, so let's say we could get this done today.
Which I really don't know if we can.
It's not gonna be perfect.
But it will be a lot better than waiting a week or two
And having you roll me down the aisle.
If that is what it takes
I'll roll you wherever you need to go.
But, are you absolutely sure about this?
Come on.
It's me and you.
We usually do like six impossible things before breakfast.
I love it when you misquote lewis carroll.
(laughs) I know.
That's why I do it.
Ah, ah...
Wha...
Wait till the wedding night.
Seventy-two hours ago, matias solomon escaped from custody
While being transferred to a holding facility.
How does that happen?
The official story is,
He overpowered a guard, wrestled away his gun,
And managed to kill the entire transport team
Before vanishing like the proverbial will-o'-the-wisp.
And the unofficial story?
The cabal?
Apparently not,
Considering all of the dead men were assets of the cabal.
Yesterday, solomon reached out to an associate of mine,
A man with a very specialized field of expertise.
Solomon was inquiring about the storage and transport
Of tactical nuclear weapons.
Which would be troubling enough on its own.
But coupled with the fact that your
Air force is scheduled to transport
Just such a weapon down the new jersey turnpike,
I'm afraid your wedding plans will have to wait, lizzy.
Is that what this is really about?
Getting me to delay my wedding?
This is about preventing
Matias solomon from getting his hands on a nuclear weapon.
I'll take it to the task force.
I was hoping you'd say that.
But I'm not going to get involved.
What I am going to do is get married.
And I hope you can be there.
Both of you.
Thank you, elizabeth.
(door closes)
I just got off the phone with justice.
Reddington was right about solomon.
He escaped from a transport vehicle three days ago.
He left a pile of bodies behind him.
Why didn't we hear about this?
Looks like a covert cabal operation, an execution gone wrong.
And the nuke?
Ran into a brick wall with the office of secure transportation.
They refused to acknowledge whether
They had any weapons in transit.
(keys clicking) the weapon mr.
Reddington was talking about Is the latest generation of so called "gravity bombs."
It's completely maneuverable, and has an adjustable yield,
So you can choose whether to destroy a small city,
Or just a couple of blocks.
Liz:
That's convenient.
Did you get your information from beyonce herself?
Oh, uh...
Sorry.
The playlist for the wedding reception.
Which I really need to discuss with you.
Uh, about the wedding.
It's this afternoon.
Uh, I thought you and tom hadn't set a date.
Which is what I came to talk to you about...
Ressler:
Let me guess.
As soon as you told reddington, he gave you the case.
Yes.
Which I'm not taking,
But I think that you should.
Even if it means you can't make it.
Aram:
Hang on.
No.
No, no.
I'm not even done with the playlist.
I don't have your wedding gift,
I was going to lose a few pounds to fit into my slim-fit suit,
Which is houndstooth, by the way.
Aram:
Uh...
Look, it's very small.
Just a few friends.
I'd love it if you could be there,
But preventing solomon from getting this weapon
Is much more important than coming to
Watch me re-marry my ex-husband.
I have a meeting with general baxter at the pentagon.
I'll find out if there's actually a threat here.
In the meantime, reach out to homeland,
And nuclear security at the doe.
See if solomon is on anyone's radar.
(phone ringing)
Hey, look.
I meant what I said about you taking this case.
But if you happen to be done in time,
I would love it if you could perform the ceremony.
Liz, I'm flattered, but I'm not qualified.
You can get ordained online.
It takes like 10 minutes.
Uh, look, there's a minister, but we don't know him.
And I just...
Much rather have you say a few words.
Assuming I can get away, I'd be honored.
Great.
The service is at 4:00.
No pressure.
This is everything?
We load it in here, and we're good to go.
All right then.
Let's go steal ourselves a nuclear warhead.
Tom:
Hey, you.
Liz: (on phone) how are we doing?
Good.
We got the rings,
And, uh, I got a place to hold the ceremony.
You know, it turns out I am amazing at impromptu wedding planning.
I had no idea.
How you doing on your end?
I picked up your suit from the cleaners,
And I dropped it at the apartment.
And reddington?
How did he take the news?
Today is not about him.
It's about you marrying a woman who is eight months pregnant.
You're right.
We're screwed.
Should I downgrade your bouquet of roses to daisies?
I told you peonies.
And don't forget the candles.
Candles, peonies.
My first honey-do list.
I'll, uh, call you in an hour.
(phone beeps)
Major baxter:
Let me be clear, harold.
I'm not going to confirm or deny
Any mission details about the movements of our nuclear arsenal.
Rolly, my ci is reliable.
If he says your convoy's gonna be hit on the jersey turnpike
It's gonna be hit.
Duly noted.
If you were going to ignore me
You could have had the courtesy to do it over the phone.
I had you come here because I wanna make it abundantly clear,
This is a military operation.
You and your team need to stand down.
General baxter, you have a problem.
I can help.
It's not a request, harold.
Tell your people to stand down.
Yeah, look, that's just not gonna happen.
No.
It's not.
We can't protect the convoy directly, so let's focus on solomon.
He's burned with the cabal.
So, he's gonna need a team.
I'll check with mossad.
See what
Mercs they're tracking in the area.
And have aram put together
A list of equipment they might need to pull this off.
Lizzy, play this for the wedding.
It's definitely a work in progress so...
You heard cooper, we got a lot of work to do, guys.
If there's any way that we can get there we will.
Hey.
Are we good?
Yeah.
Fine.
It's your big day.
This is about you and tom.
Look, I know the two of you...
It's not about him and me.
It's about him.
He laid a hand on you.
As far as I'm concerned, there's no coming back from that.
I get where you're coming from and I love you for saying it.
But I kept him prisoner in the hull of a ship,
And tortured him for two months.
So, in my book we're even.
I said my piece.
Mmm.
If I can be there for you today, I will.
Mr. Cooper, genius.
What?
What is it?
Aram:
No wonder he's the assistant director.
The way his mind works, his attention to detail,
I can't believe he's living in his office.
I'm sorry, what?
Did I just say that or think that?
He's living in his office?
Oh.
No.
I mean, not living-living.
He's working-living.
He's here all the time.
Uh, point is, he was right.
To handle a nuclear weapon, solomon
And his men will need something
To shield themselves from the radiation.
The hunt valley nuclear research facility.
Aram:
Right outside of baltimore.
They were robbed an hour ago by a group of armed men
Who took an isotope transfer cask.
All right, let's go.
Shirley:
You guys are a little late to the party. (sighs)
We've already got homeland, doe,
And the fbi interviewing the staff,
But I was told to help you with whatever you need.
We're part of a special task force.
Yeah, you seem pretty special.
It must have been very traumatic this morning.
Shirley:
Well, it wasn't fun.
About the worst thing we've had before that
Was a bunch of anti-nuke yahoos climbing the fences
And spray painting the joint.
Show 'em what we got.
(men talking indistinctly)
It's definitely solomon.
He's the one.
Said something about stealing a nuke.
The other, she was talking about payloads and guidance systems.
Let's see if aram can id her.
Look, if I give you a secure email,
Can you forward this footage?
No problem.
(door opens and closes)
I thought you said it was bad luck
To see each other before the wedding?
(footsteps)
Liz?
Even worse luck to see me before the wedding.
I thought we had an agreement.
We're done.
Gina, what are you doing here?
Just doing a favor for a friend.
(gun clicks)
The major:
Hello, jacob.
Long time no see.
Tell me you've got something, aram.
What about the b-52s?
Ressler:
The planes?
The band.
Total crowd pleaser, right?
Rock lobster.
Aram, please focus.
Uh, yeah, right.
I've id'd the woman in the video as nez rowan.
I'm sending you her info now.
Aram:
She is ex-navy, where she was a nuclear weapons specialist.
Guess we know why she's on the team.
Yeah, she also goes by about a half a dozen other aliases.
Been a freelancer for the past eight years.
You have anything to trace her?
Actually, one of her preferred aliases,
Harper waters, is currently checked into a motel in baltimore.
Ressler:
All right, send us the details and have a tac team meet us there.
Desk clerk confirmed our target's in room five.
We were able to snake a camera
Through the air duct from the adjoining room.
There's another door.
Opens to the parking lot outside.
I've got a second team there.
And we're gonna breach from the hallway.
Don't let her get out that other door.
Navabi, you in place?
Affirmative.
(men shouting)
(groans)
Two.
(man shouting)
Man 1:
South corridor clear.
Man 2:
Commander six, do you have eyes on the target?
Man 3:
Go, go, go!
Man 2:
We've got a silver suv.
Keep moving.
Man 4:
Copy.
En route.
Ressler:
Move.
(men shouting indistinctly)
Man 1:
We have a runner.
Move.
Move.
Female suspect on the move.
Team one, move up.
(car engine starting)
Stop!
(car engine starting)
Next one's in your head.
Hands where I can see them.
Now.
See, we got you on video at the hunt valley robbery.
We've got a motel room filled with classified documents
And two wounded agents,
One in critical care who may never walk again.
The only thing you've got going for you at this point
Is that he's not dead.
I was unarmed.
Oh, that doesn't matter.
You're an accessory.
And if your crew succeeds in its attempt
To hit that convoy and steal the nuclear device,
You're gonna get a needle, in your arm,
Just like your boss, mr.
Solomon.
The only reason I mentioned I was unarmed
Was because it might factor into the deal you're going to offer.
You've got nothing to bargain with.
I am a professional.
I pledge allegiance to the highest bidder.
I have no loyalty to mr.
Solomon or anyone else
Beyond the terms of our business arrangement.
Once they left me in that motel,
Our contract was null and void.
But if you make me an offer,
I will tell you what you want to know.
No deal.
Yes.
Deal.
Full immunity.
No jail time.
And witness protection.
Solomon and his friends are very motivated and very powerful.
And if their plan goes south, they'll know who talked,
And they'll be very, very peeved.
Before you throw me in a hole,
Tell the geniuses at the pentagon
We know the convoy on the turnpike is a decoy.
Then let's see how fast they wanna cut a deal.
You are a genuine anomaly.
The st regis program
Has consistently produced reliable operatives.
Except for you.
Is there a question coming?
The major:
Where do you think we went wrong?
When did you start to feel love for elizabeth keen?
I don't know.
I just know that it happened.
And I'm really glad that it did.
Even now?
Especially now.
You were my finest accomplishment.
And my biggest disappointment.
Mine, too.
Get up.
Get up.
Turn around.
Get on your knees.
Goodbye, jacob.
(silenced gin shots)
(clattering)
Was that your plan?
'cause a little sooner would have been nice.
To tell you the truth, up until I pulled the trigger,
I hadn't made up my mind yet.
Well, have you made it up now?
Those last few weeks,
When I thought you were dead...
I actually missed you.
But I meant what I said.
You are my greatest disappointment.
(door opens and closes)
I've acquired new intel regarding your convoy.
I thought I made myself abundantly clear on this issue.
We have a suspect in custody, a nuclear weapons specialist.
She claims the convoy on the turnpike is a decoy.
Cooper:
Rolly?
I'm here.
Listen to me, we've got to find out everything this woman knows.
Immediately.
Look, she's asking for immunity.
I don't care.
Give it to her.
Give her whatever she wants.
Rolly, the truth.
Is the nuke vulnerable?
A minute ago, I would have said no.
I thought you'd come around.
Your deal is contingent upon your intel being valid.
Start talking.
The real convoy is coming in on 95 at 1550 hours.
There's an abandoned van parked under the overpass
At mile marker 22, packed with a 1,500 pound anfo bomb.
They're gonna blow the bridge
Right before the real convoy gets there...
Shutting down the traffic.
Once the convoy is stopped, they're gonna hit it.
Hard.
Twenty-six seasoned mercs
With enough firepower to retake omaha beach.
Hey, tell all your feeb buddies to pack extra pairs of shorts.
They're gonna need them.
All right, I've got a satellite view of the overpass,
But if there's a van, we can't see it from the air.
Who's on site?
Maryland state police is coordinating
With the office of special transport.
They're shutting down the 95, and rerouting the convoy.
Explosive ordinance disposal's en route...
No, I'll take the call.
(gun cocks)
I got plenty of back-up.
It'll make a huge difference to keen
If neither of us is at that wedding.
Go.
I'll be okay.
Give her a hug for me.
Okay?
I will.
Be careful.
(knock on door)
Yes.
What brings you here?
You need an update on the solomon case?
I just got off the phone with agent navabi.
She thoroughly briefed me on the situation.
Oh.
Then you're here for the wedding?
No, lizzy.
I'm here to ask you, to implore you.
Please, don't do this.
I'm telling you, no matter what you believe,
Tom is not the man you think he is.
You're wrong.
You don't know him.
He's a criminal.
No.
He's changed.
Reddington:
Men like tom don't change.
You are attempting to build a life
With a man who is fundamentally dishonest.
No.
I am attempting to build a life with the father of my child.
Liz:
A normal life.
With two parents who love one another.
(body thuds)
With everything you know about me, can't you see that?
Can't you see how important that is to me?
To my child?
Reddington:
You were wrong about him once.
What makes you so sure you're not wrong this time?
Do you really want your child to pay the price for that mistake
For the rest of his or her life?
(tires screeching)
Get out.
I want you to go.
Please.
I don't want you here.
(somber music playing)
(sniffles)
(inaudible)
Knock-knock.
What is it?
(inhales deeply)
I just didn't expect to feel this nervous.
(chuckles)
Hey.
It's okay to be scared.
What you're doing...
It's a huge step.
What am I doing?
You're trusting tom.
Taking a leap of faith,
One you know could end in disappointment,
But it's because you love him.
Thank you.
You're the closest thing I have to a real father.
I am also officially ordained
As a minister of the first church of life and energy dot com.
And if this is what your heart's telling you to do, liz,
That's all that matters.
I'm so glad you're here.
Liz:
One less thing to worry about.
(music continues)
Ressler:
Come on, come on.
We got to move.
Commander, the convoy's already been diverted.
What's its status?
Traffic's about to be shut down, the eod just pulled up.
All right, well, hurry it up.
Get everybody back, set up a perimeter.
Solomon and his team must be close.
Raymond, we should turn around.
You're upset.
I'm sure elizabeth didn't mean...
Why didn't she escape with the others?
Who?
The mercenary agents ressler and navabi arrested at the motel.
She could have fled with solomon,
Escaped in the suv with the others...
Agent navabi said she broke off on her own,
Tried to get away in a second vehicle.
Hand me the phone, dembe.
I need to see that vehicle.
(music playing on radio)
Tom.
It's aram.
I mean, uh, agent mojtabai.
(chuckles)
Whatever.
I recognize you from...
Mugshot?
Uh, no.
Uh, from your description.
Thanks for coming.
Oh. (chuckles)
Quite a grip.
So, I was, uh...
Yeah.
This car looks great, man.
I know, it's just...
It's my grandfather's.
Oh, wow.
Going to be a pretty sweet getaway car, right?
Not that you would know.
Or ever, uh...
Need one.
A getaway...
Aram, have you seen liz?
Right, yes, uh, she's inside.
Thanks.
Sure.
I'll just, uh, leave the keys in the visor.
Tom:
I told myself no more secrets.
And I promised you that I would be completely honest,
No matter what.
Today the major found me.
Gina told him where to find me,
And he came into our apartment, and tried to kill me.
But he's dead.
And I, uh...
You killed him?
Uh, no.
Actually, gina did, but...
That's a long story.
But what I want you to know is that
It happened because I made it clear that I'm out.
I'm done with those people and that life.
But there are things that I did,
And I might be done with those things,
But I can't promise you that those things are done with me.
And I can't promise you that it's not gonna happen
Tomorrow, or next week, or five years
From now.
And I would understand,
Frankly, if you didn't want to deal with anything...
Stop.
It's me, you remember?
Your ex-wife who shot the attorney general,
And was publicly branded a russian sleeper agent.
I know a little something about baggage.
But I love you.
And I am willing to help you carry yours,
If you can help me carry mine.
(rain falling) (chatter on police radio)
Not enough hazard pay in the world
To convince me to open those doors.
(radio chatter continues)
Come on, come on.
There wasn't anything inside.
You're sure?
Look, I know who you are,
And if there was something to tell, I'd tell you.
But there was nothing inside the car.
Bomb tech:
Door's unlocked.
Doesn't look rigged.
Here we go.
I'm cracking it open.
What the...
What is it?
Nothing.
It's completely empty.
The van is completely empty.
Something wrong, boys?
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe the car means nothing.
Maybe she was just unlucky.
Why didn't it start?
What do you mean?
Starts just fine.
Drove it up on to the flatbed myself.
She's a sacrifice.
Solomon isn't after that weapon.
It's a distraction.
To keep us looking one way while they go another.
He's after elizabeth.
(tires screech)
Ressler:
Listen, gimme two two-man teams
Going north and south, all right?
(cell phone ringing)
Thank you.
Reddington, the suspect lied about
The location of the attack on the convoy.
There is no attack.
There never was.
The target is agent keen.
You need to get to the church, donald.
Ressler:
What are you talking about?
Reddington:
Ever since elizabeth went public
As masha rostova...
(wedding March playing) ...Still waters have been stirred up and old grudges have surfaced.
And now someone out there is singularly focused on coming for her.
Ressler:
Coming to kill her?
Reddington:
No.
To abduct her.
They're sending solomon.
Reddington:
In retrospect, that's the perfect choice.
He knows us intimately, he knows about the task force.
They gave us a false trail, and we followed the scent.
Donald, if I'm right, and this was all an elaborate feint,
All that matters is that you get to that church.
Now.
Ressler:
On my way.
We are gathered here today in celebration of elizabeth and tom.
In my years on this earth,
I've been blessed with some truly remarkable friendships.
And I've come to believe that friends
Are indeed the family we choose.
We are here today to witness the beginning of a new family,
Inspired by the love of a man and a woman
Who have found, in each other, their truest friend.
Two people who choose each other.
Now, each choice brings with it
Blessings as well as hardships.
Choosing a partner means
Choosing that person's life to become your life.
Their joy becomes your joy, as do their burdens.
Nobody gets in.
The sum of our choices
Are a weight that each individual carries alone.
But as man and wife, as partners,
You choose to shoulder that weight together.
And all of us here today,
We celebrate the choice you've made.
(church doors open)
(footsteps approaching)
Elizabeth, I'm sorry, but we need to go.
What are you doing here?
Men are coming for you.
We need to leave, now.
Solomon never intended to take that weapon.
He was contracted by an employer to take you.
(church doors open)
They're here.
Tom.
Keep clear of the windows.
Everybody, stay low.
Reddington:
Aram, get these people out of here, now.
Aram:
Stay down.
Stay down.
(whimpering)
I'm sorry, lizzy.
You have a team in position?
(machine gun fire)
Reddington:
We have a perimeter.
Agent ressler's en route.
In the meantime, we'll have to hold the fort.
(men shouting) (gun fire)
(groans)
The others?
(panting)
Great, we're surrounded.
(dialing)
(cell phone ringing)
Cooper.
Yeah.
You know why I'm here.
Send her out.
It's curious.
I thought you were
The cabal's most loyal soldier.
And yet here you are,
Under the patronage of a new benefactor.
I was loyal to the cabal.
Right up until they tried to kill me.
I'm totally violating my non-compete agreement,
But what the hell.
So where do we go from here?
Mr. Solomon:
I was instructed to deliver masha rostova to my employer.
That's what I intend to do.
Send her out, and this can all be over.
So, this is your big plan?
An assault on a building filled with armed fbi agents?
Honestly, matias, I expect better from you.
First of all, you and I both know
That you are outmanned and outgunned.
The plan was to grab her today, no matter where she was.
Grocery store or house of god, it makes little difference to me.
And for the record, I take no offense that I wasn't invited.
It came together rather nicely.
They went with ruby fringe tulips and pink peonies.
You'd be impressed.
I tell you what, then.
I'll call you back in a couple minutes.
Give you some time to consider my offer.
And then, I'm coming in to check out the flowers myself.
(phone beeps)
(car doors close)
Your target is elizabeth keen.
She is to be taken alive and unharmed,
But please feel free to kill anybody else.
Aram:
All right, don't worry.
My friends, they are the best at what they do.
(sobbing)
(phone beeping) there's no signal.
Reddington:
They're jamming it.
(phone beeps)
When solomon calls back they'll have to stop.
You'll have a few seconds to get a message out.
Reddington.
It's her, isn't it?
Solomon's employer.
It's my mother.
Who else would call me masha rostova?
Lizzy, your mother is dead.
Then, who is it?
Who?
You owe me this.
I'll tell you what I know as soon as I know you're safe.
We're not all out of options here.
Nobody has to get hurt.
Lizzy, you are not going out there, under any circumstances.
Agreed.
You want me to ask those poor,
(cell phone ringing) terrified people what they think?
No.
Hello, matias.
Mr. Solomon:
What's it going to be, is she coming out, or am I coming in?
I'm coming out.
No.
(phone beeps)
There seems to be some disagreement on that score.
We'll need a little more time to sort this out.
You've had all the time that you're gonna get.
Brace yourselves.
They're coming.
(groans)
This is on you.
Yes.
All of this, indeed, is on me.
Your sos get through?
(sighs) let's hope so.
(shuddering)
Okay.
Concentrate your fire up front.
Drive them toward the back of the room.
They'll attack the front first.
Try to drive us out the back.
Most of his men will be there.
Once you breach the front doors, it'll be quick.
Pin them down, and we'll come in
Through the back, and put it to bed.
Harold, we need to barricade that back door.
Aram.
Yeah.
Give me a hand.
It's our only way out.
If we're getting out at all, it will be through the front.
Most importantly, you need to keep elizabeth out of sight.
No one is keeping me anywhere.
Liz, if anything happens to you, if you get hurt, or taken,
None of this means anything.
Don't you get it?
I am the only one in this building they're not gonna shoot.
Exactly.
So if they don't know where you are,
They're going to be a lot more careful about
Where they point their weapons.
Feels familiar, eh?
Kinshasa.
Let's hope this ends better than that did.
Light them up.
(whimpering and sobbing)
(gun fire)
The baby.
Like you said,
You're the only one they're not gonna hurt.
The baby is safe.
(sighs)
Hold.
Baz.
Harold, some cover.
(gun shots)
(trigger clicks)
I'm out.
Dembe, the bag.
Liz.
Elizabeth.
(heavy breathing)
We will get you out of this.
(liz breathes heavily)
Please don't ever do that again.
No promises.
We just heard from operator 46, the police have been alerted
And are three minutes out.
Take the doors.
(woman whimpering)
Aram:
Oh, god.
What?
(woman sobbing)
Okay, hold on, hold on.
Hold on.
You're okay.
You're okay.
I got you.
Just stay with me.
Stay with me.
It's gonna stop.
No.
(aram panting)
Oh, god. (exclaiming)
(gun fire)
Aram:
You need to go.
(gun fire continues)
(gun shot)
(body thuds)
Tom, get her out of here.
You're ready for this?
Yeah.
(music playing)
(gun shot)
(cans rattling)
(police sirens wailing)
Previouslyon The Blacklist...
Yes.
I want to marry you.
If anything happened to me, this was to go to Elizabeth.
So she'd know.
You said the name Masha Rostova had been lost to history until the manhunt, now it's out there and someone is looking for me?
It's my mother.
I'm asking you to help me walk away.
He came.
How do you want me to handle it?
I take it I'm not actually being transferred to Leavenworth?
Miss Hitchin doesn't like loose ends.
You understand.
Of course.
Actually, I helped put those protocols in place.
She wanted me to be sure to thank you for your years of service.
I suppose a gold watch would have been too much to hope for?
Let me guess.
You blew a tire, stopped the transport to change it, and shot me when I tried to escape.
Close.
I pulled over to take a leak, and you grabbed Joe's gun.
We took you down after you shot him in the leg.
Nobody's shooting me in the leg.
My bad.
You shot him in the head.
Run.
You heard me.
Run.
And who might you be?
Are you serious?
What about the rings, and a photographer...
And a dress, and the flowers, and all that stuff.
We don't need it.
They had a cancellation at the church this afternoon,
I say we go for it.
Hold on, I thought we were gonna try to do things right this time.
Doesn't this feel right?
To do it now, today, at St Cecilia's, where we wanted to do it the first time.
It feels kind of crazy.
I mean, there's other dates available.
April 25th.
I'm due on the 22nd.
All right, so let's say we could get this done today.
Which I really don't know if we can.
It's not gonna be perfect.
But it will be a lot better than waiting a week or two and having you roll me down the aisle.
If that is what it takes
I'll roll you wherever you need to go.
But, are you absolutely sure about this?
Come on.
It's me and you.
We usually do like six impossible things before breakfast.
I love it when you misquote Lewis Carroll.
I know.
That's why I do it.
Wha...
Wait till the wedding night.
Seventy-two hours ago, Matias Solomon escaped from custody while being transferred to a holding facility.
How does that happen?
The official story is, he overpowered a guard, wrestled away his gun, and managed to kill the entire transport team before vanishing like the proverbial will-o'-the-wisp.
And the unofficial story?
The Cabal?
Apparently not, considering all of the dead men were assets of the Cabal.
Yesterday, Solomon reached out to an associate of mine, a man with a very specialized field of expertise.
Solomon was inquiring about the storage and transport of tactical nuclear weapons.
Which would be troubling enough on its own.
But coupled with the fact that your.
Air Force is scheduled to transport just such a weapon down the New Jersey Turnpike,
I'm afraid your wedding plans will have to wait, Lizzy.
Is that what this is really about?
Getting me to delay my wedding?
This is about preventing.
Matias Solomon from getting his hands on a nuclear weapon.
I'll take it to the task force.
I was hoping you'd say that.
But I'm not going to get involved.
What I am going to do is get married.
And I hope you can be there.
Both of you.
Thank you, Elizabeth.
I just got off the phone with Justice.
Reddington was right about Solomon.
He escaped from a transport vehicle three days ago.
He left a pile of bodies behind him.
Why didn't we hear about this?
Looks like a covert Cabal operation, an execution gone wrong.
And the nuke?
Ran into a brick wall with the Office of Secure Transportation.
They refused to acknowledge whether they had any weapons in transit.
The weapon Mr. Reddington was talking about... is the latest generation of so called "gravity bombs."
It's completely maneuverable, and has an adjustable yield, so you can choose whether to destroy a small city, or just a couple of blocks.
That's convenient.
Did you get your information from Beyonce herself?
Sorry.
The playlist for the wedding reception.
Which I really need to discuss with you.
About the wedding.
It's this afternoon.
I thought you and Tom hadn't set a date.
Which is what I came to talk to you about...
Let me guess.
As soon as you told Reddington, he gave you the case.
Yes.
Which I'm not taking, but I think that you should.
Even if it means you can't make it.
Hang on.
No.
No, no.
I'm not even done with the playlist.
I don't have your wedding gift,
I was going to lose a few pounds to fit into my slim-fit suit, which is houndstooth, by the way.
Look, it's very small.
Just a few friends.
I'd love it if you could be there, but preventing Solomon from getting this weapon is much more important than coming to watch me re-marry my ex-husband.
I have a meeting with General Baxter at the Pentagon.
I'll find out if there's actually a threat here.
In the meantime, reach out to Homeland, and Nuclear Security at the DOE.
See if Solomon is on anyone's radar.
Hey, look.
I meant what I said about you taking this case.
But if you happen to be done in time,
I would love it if you could perform the ceremony.
Liz, I'm flattered, but I'm not qualified.
You can get ordained online.
It takes like 10 minutes.
Look, there's a minister, but we don't know him.
And I just...
Much rather have you say a few words.
Assuming I can get away, I'd be honored.
Great.
The service is at 4:00.
No pressure.
This is everything?
We load it in here, and we're good to go.
All right then.
Let's go steal ourselves a nuclear warhead.
Hey, you.
How are we doing?
Good.
We got the rings, and, I got a place to hold the ceremony.
You know, it turns out I am amazing at impromptu wedding planning.
I had no idea.
How you doing on your end?
I picked up your suit from the cleaners, and I dropped it at the apartment.
And Reddington?
How did he take the news?
Today is not about him.
It's about you marrying a woman who is eight months pregnant.
You're right.
We're screwed.
Should I downgrade your bouquet of roses to daisies?
I told you peonies.
And don't forget the candles.
Candles, peonies.
My first honey-do list.
I'll, call you in an hour.
Let me be clear, Harold.
I'm not going to confirm or deny any mission details about the movements of our nuclear arsenal.
Rolly, my CI is reliable.
If he says your convoy's gonna be hit on the Jersey Turnpike it's gonna be hit.
Duly noted.
If you were going to ignore me you could have had the courtesy to do it over the phone.
I had you come here because I wanna make it abundantly clear, this is a military operation.
You and your team need to stand down.
General Baxter, you have a problem.
I can help.
It's not a request, Harold.
Tell your people to stand down.
Yeah, look, that's just not gonna happen.
No.
It's not.
We can't protect the convoy directly, so let's focus on Solomon.
He's burned with the Cabal.
So, he's gonna need a team.
I'll check with Mossad.
See what mercs they're tracking in the area.
And have Aram put together a list of equipment they might need to pull this off.
Lizzy, play this for the wedding.
It's definitely a work in progress so...
You heard Cooper, we got a lot of work to do, guys.
If there's any way that we can get there we will.
Hey.
Are we good?
Yeah.
Fine.
It's your big day.
This is about you and Tom.
Look, I know the two of you...
It's not about him and me.
It's about him.
He laid a hand on you.
As far as I'm concerned, there's no coming back from that.
I get where you're coming from and I love you for saying it.
But I kept him prisoner in the hull of a ship, and tortured him for two months.
So, in my book we're even.
I said my piece.
If I can be there for you today, I will.
Mr. Cooper, genius.
What?
What is it?
No wonder he's the Assistant Director.
The way his mind works, his attention to detail,
I can't believe he's living in his office.
I'm sorry, what?
Did I just say that or think that?
He's living in his office?
No.
I mean, not living-living.
He's working-living.
He's here all the time.
Point is, he was right.
To handle a nuclear weapon, Solomon and his men will need something to shield themselves from the radiation.
The Hunt Valley Nuclear Research Facility.
Right outside of Baltimore.
They were robbed an hour ago by a group of armed men who took an isotope transfer cask.
All right, let's go.
You guys are a little late to the party.
We've already got Homeland, DOE, and the FBI interviewing the staff, but I was told to help you with whatever you need.
We're part of a special task force.
Yeah, you seem pretty special.
It must have been very traumatic this morning.
Well, it wasn't fun.
About the worst thing we've had before that was a bunch of anti-nuke yahoos climbing the fences and spray painting the joint.
Show 'em what we got.
It's definitely Solomon.
He's the one.
Said something about stealing a nuke.
The other, she was talking about payloads and guidance systems.
Let's see if Aram can ID her.
Look, if I give you a secure email, can you forward this footage?
No problem.
I thought you said it was bad luck to see each other before the wedding?
Liz?
Even worse luck to see me before the wedding.
I thought we had an agreement.
We're done.
Gina, what are you doing here?
Just doing a favor for a friend.
Hello, Jacob.
Long time no see.
Tell me you've got something, Aram.
- What about the B-52s?
- The planes?
The band.
Total crowd pleaser, right?
Rock Lobster.
Aram, please focus.
Yeah, right.
I've ID'd the woman in the video as Nez Rowan.
I'm sending you her info now.
Sheisex-Navy,whereshe was a nuclear weapons specialist.
Guess we know why she's on the team.
Yeah, she also goes by about a half a dozen other aliases.
Been a freelancer for the past eight years.
You have anything to trace her?
Actually, one of her preferred aliases,
Harper Waters, is currently checked into a motel in Baltimore.
Allright,sendusthedetails and have a TAC team meet us there.
Desk clerk confirmed our target's in room five.
We were able to snake a camera through the air duct from the adjoining room.
There's another door.
Opens to the parking lot outside.
I've got a second team there.
And we're gonna breach from the hallway.
Don't let her get out that other door.
Navabi, you in place?
Affirmative.
Two.
Southcorridorclear.
CommanderSix,do you have eyes on the target?
Go, go, go!
We'vegotasilverSUV.
Keep moving.
Copy.
Enroute.
Move.
Wehavearunner.
Move.
Move.
Female suspect on the move.
Team one, move up.
Stop!
Next one's in your head.
Hands where I can see them.
Now.
See, we got you on video at the Hunt Valley robbery.
We've got a motel room filled with classified documents and two wounded agents, one in critical care who may never walk again.
The only thing you've got going for you at this point is that he's not dead.
I was unarmed.
That doesn't matter.
You're an accessory.
And if your crew succeeds in its attempt to hit that convoy and steal the nuclear device, you're gonna get a needle, in your arm, just like your boss, Mr. Solomon.
The only reason I mentioned I was unarmed was because it might factor into the deal you're going to offer.
You've got nothing to bargain with.
I am a professional.
I pledge allegiance to the highest bidder.
I have no loyalty to Mr. Solomon or anyone else beyond the terms of our business arrangement.
Once they left me in that motel, our contract was null and void.
But if you make me an offer,
I will tell you what you want to know.
No deal.
Yes.
Deal.
Full immunity.
No jail time.
And witness protection.
Solomon and his friends are very motivated and very powerful.
And if their plan goes south, they'll know who talked, and they'll be very, very peeved.
Before you throw me in a hole, tell the geniuses at the Pentagon we know the convoy on the turnpike is a decoy.
Then let's see how fast they wanna cut a deal.
You are a genuine anomaly.
The St Regis program has consistently produced reliable operatives.
Except for you.
Is there a question coming?
Where do you think we went wrong?
When did you start to feel love for Elizabeth Keen?
I don't know.
I just know that it happened.
And I'm really glad that it did.
Even now?
Especially now.
You were my finest accomplishment.
And my biggest disappointment.
Mine, too.
Get up.
Get up.
Turn around.
Get on your knees.
Goodbye, Jacob.
Was that your plan?
'Cause a little sooner would have been nice.
To tell you the truth, up until I pulled the trigger,
I hadn't made up my mind yet.
Well, have you made it up now?
Those last few weeks, when I thought you were dead...
I actually missed you.
But I meant what I said.
You are my greatest disappointment.
I've acquired new intel regarding your convoy.
I thought I made myself abundantly clear on this issue.
We have a suspect in custody, a nuclear weapons specialist.
She claims the convoy on the turnpike is a decoy.
Rolly?
I'm here.
Listen to me, we've got to find out everything this woman knows.
Immediately.
Look, she's asking for immunity.
I don't care.
Give it to her.
Give her whatever she wants.
Rolly, the truth.
Is the nuke vulnerable?
A minute ago, I would have said no.
I thought you'd come around.
Your deal is contingent upon your intel being valid.
Start talking.
The real convoy is coming in on 95 at 1550 hours.
There's an abandoned van parked under the overpass at mile marker 22, packed with a 1,500 pound ANFO bomb.
They're gonna blow the bridge right before the real convoy gets there...
Shutting down the traffic.
Once the convoy is stopped, they're gonna hit it.
Hard.
Twenty-six seasoned mercs with enough firepower to retake Omaha Beach.
Hey, tell all your Feeb buddies to pack extra pairs of shorts.
They're gonna need them.
All right, I've got a satellite view of the overpass, but if there's a van, we can't see it from the air.
Who's on site?
Maryland State Police is coordinating with the Office of Special Transport.
They're shutting down the 95, and rerouting the convoy.
Explosive Ordinance Disposal's en route...
No, I'll take the call.
I got plenty of back-up.
It'll make a huge difference to Keen if neither of us is at that wedding.
Go.
I'll be okay.
Give her a hug for me.
Okay?
I will.
Be careful.
Yes.
What brings you here?
You need an update on the Solomon case?
I just got off the phone with Agent Navabi.
She thoroughly briefed me on the situation.
Then you're here for the wedding?
No, Lizzy.
I'm here to ask you, to implore you.
Please, don't do this.
I'm telling you, no matter what you believe,
Tom is not the man you think he is.
You're wrong.
You don't know him.
He's a criminal.
No.
He's changed.
Men like Tom don't change.
You are attempting to build a life with a man who is fundamentally dishonest.
No.
I am attempting to build a life with the father of my child.
Anormallife.
With two parents who love one another.
With everything you know about me, can't you see that?
Can't you see how important that is to me?
To my child?
You were wrong about him once.
What makes you so sure you're not wrong this time?
Do you really want your child to pay the price for that mistake for the rest of his or her life?
Get out.
I want you to go.
Please.
I don't want you here.
Knock-knock.
What is it?
I just didn't expect to feel this nervous.
Hey.
It's okay to be scared.
What you're doing...
It's a huge step.
What am I doing?
You're trusting Tom.
Taking a leap of faith, one you know could end in disappointment, but it's because you love him.
Thank you.
You're the closest thing I have to a real father.
I am also officially ordained as a Minister of The First Church of Life and Energy dot com.
And if this is what your heart's telling you to do, Liz, that's all that matters.
I'm so glad you're here.
One less thing to worry about.
Come on, come on.
We got to move.
Commander, the convoy's already been diverted.
What's its status?
Traffic's about to be shut down, the EOD just pulled up.
All right, well, hurry it up.
Get everybody back, set up a perimeter.
Solomon and his team must be close.
Raymond, we should turn around.
You're upset.
I'm sure Elizabeth didn't mean...
Why didn't she escape with the others?
Who?
The mercenary Agents Ressler and Navabi arrested at the motel.
She could have fled with Solomon, escaped in the SUV with the others...
Agent Navabi said she broke off on her own, tried to get away in a second vehicle.
Hand me the phone, Dembe.
I need to see that vehicle.
Tom.
It's Aram.
I mean, Agent Mojtabai.
Whatever.
I recognize you from...
Mugshot?
No.
From your description.
Thanks for coming.
Quite a grip.
So, I was...
Yeah.
This car looks great, man.
I know, it's just...
It's my grandfather's.
Wow.
Going to be a pretty sweet getaway car, right?
Not that you would know.
Or ever...
Need one.
A getaway...
Aram, have you seen Liz?
Right, yes, she's inside.
Thanks.
Sure.
I'll just, leave the keys in the visor.
I told myself no more secrets.
And I promised you that I would be completely honest, no matter what.
Today The Major found me.
Gina told him where to find me, and he came into our apartment, and tried to kill me.
But he's dead.
And I...
You killed him?
No.
Actually, Gina did, but...
That's a long story.
But what I want you to know is that it happened because I made it clear that I'm out.
I'm done with those people and that life.
But there are things that I did, and I might be done with those things, but I can't promise you that those things are done with me.
And I can't promise you that it's not gonna happen tomorrow, or next week, or five years from now.
And I would understand, frankly, if you didn't want to deal with anything...
Stop.
It's me, you remember?
Your ex-wife who shot the Attorney General, and was publicly branded a Russian sleeper agent.
I know a little something about baggage.
But I love you.
And I am willing to help you carry yours, if you can help me carry mine.
Not enough hazard pay in the world to convince me to open those doors.
Come on, come on.
There wasn't anything inside.
You're sure?
Look, I know who you are, and if there was something to tell, I'd tell you.
But there was nothing inside the car.
Door'sunlocked.
Doesn't look rigged.
Here we go.
I'm cracking it open.
What the...
What is it?
Nothing.
It's completely empty.
The van is completely empty.
Something wrong, boys?
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe the car means nothing.
Maybe she was just unlucky.
Why didn't it start?
What do you mean?
Starts just fine.
Drove it up on to the flatbed myself.
She's a sacrifice.
Solomon isn't after that weapon.
It's a distraction.
To keep us looking one way while they go another.
He's after Elizabeth.
Listen, gimme two two-man teams going north and south, all right?
Thank you.
Reddington, the suspect lied about the location of the attack on the convoy.
There is no attack.
There never was.
The target is Agent Keen.
You need to get to the church, Donald.
Whatareyou talking about?
Eversince Elizabeth went public as Masha Rostova... still waters have been stirred up and old grudges have surfaced.
And now someone out there is singularly focused on coming for her.
Comingtokillher ?
No.
Toabducther .
They're sending Solomon.
Inretrospect, that's the perfect choice.
He knows us intimately, he knows about the task force.
They gave us a false trail, and we followed the scent.
Donald, if I'm right, and this was all an elaborate feint, all that matters is that you get to that church.
Now.
On my way.
We are gathered here today in celebration of Elizabeth and Tom.
In my years on this Earth,
I've been blessed with some truly remarkable friendships.
And I've come to believe that friends are indeed the family we choose.
We are here today to witness the beginning of a new family, inspired by the love of a man and a woman who have found, in each other, their truest friend.
Two people who choose each other.
Now, each choice brings with it blessings as well as hardships.
Choosing a partner means choosing that person's life to become your life.
Their joy becomes your joy, as do their burdens.
Nobody gets in.
The sum of our choices are a weight that each individual carries alone.
But as man and wife, as partners, you choose to shoulder that weight together.
And all of us here today, we celebrate the choice you've made.
Elizabeth, I'm sorry, but we need to go.
What are you doing here?
Men are coming for you.
We need to leave, now.
Solomon never intended to take that weapon.
He was contracted by an employer to take you.
They're here.
Tom.
Keep clear of the windows.
Everybody, stay low.
Aram, get these people out of here, now.
Stay down.
Stay down.
I'm sorry, Lizzy.
You have a team in position?
We have a perimeter.
Agent Ressler's en route.
In the meantime, we'll have to hold the fort.
The others?
Great, we're surrounded.
Cooper.
Yeah.
You know why I'm here.
Send her out.
It's curious.
I thought you were the Cabal's most loyal soldier.
And yet here you are, under the patronage of a new benefactor.
I was loyal to the Cabal.
Right up until they tried to kill me.
I'm totally violating my non-compete agreement, but what the hell.
So where do we go from here?
Iwasinstructedto deliver Masha Rostova to my employer.
That's what I intend to do.
Send her out, and this can all be over.
So, this is your big plan?
An assault on a building filled with armed FBI agents?
Honestly, Matias, I expect better from you.
First of all, you and I both know that you are outmanned and outgunned.
The plan was to grab her today, no matter where she was.
Grocery store or house of God, it makes little difference to me.
And for the record, I take no offense that I wasn't invited.
It came together rather nicely.
They went with ruby fringe tulips and pink peonies.
You'd be impressed.
I tell you what, then.
I'll call you back in a couple minutes.
Give you some time to consider my offer.
And then, I'm coming in to check out the flowers myself.
Your target is Elizabeth Keen.
She is to be taken alive and unharmed, but please feel free to kill anybody else.
All right, don't worry.
My friends, they are the best at what they do.
There's no signal.
They're jamming it.
When Solomon calls back they'll have to stop.
You'll have a few seconds to get a message out.
Reddington.
It's her, isn't it?
Solomon's employer.
It's my mother.
Who else would call me Masha Rostova?
Lizzy, your mother is dead.
Then, who is it?
Who?
You owe me this.
I'll tell you what I know as soon as I know you're safe.
We're not all out of options here.
Nobody has to get hurt.
Lizzy, you are not going out there, under any circumstances.
Agreed.
You want me to ask those poor, terrified people what they think?
No.
Hello, Matias.
What'sitgoingtobe, is she coming out, or am I coming in?
I'm coming out.
No.
There seems to be some disagreement on that score.
We'll need a little more time to sort this out.
You've had all the time that you're gonna get.
Brace yourselves.
They're coming.
This is on you.
Yes.
All of this, indeed, is on me.
Your SOS get through?
Let's hope so.
Okay.
Concentrate your fire up front.
Drive them toward the back of the room.
They'll attack the front first.
Try to drive us out the back.
Most of his men will be there.
Once you breach the front doors, it'll be quick.
Pin them down, and we'll come in through the back, and put it to bed.
Harold, we need to barricade that back door.
Aram.
Yeah.
Give me a hand.
It's our only way out.
If we're getting out at all, it will be through the front.
Most importantly, you need to keep Elizabeth out of sight.
No one is keeping me anywhere.
Liz, if anything happens to you, if you get hurt, or taken, none of this means anything.
Don't you get it?
I am the only one in this building they're not gonna shoot.
Exactly.
So if they don't know where you are, they're going to be a lot more careful about where they point their weapons.
Feels familiar?
Kinshasa.
Let's hope this ends better than that did.
Light them up.
The baby.
Like you said, you're the only one they're not gonna hurt.
The baby is safe.
Hold.
Baz.
Harold, some cover.
I'm out.
Dembe, the bag.
Liz.
Elizabeth.
We will get you out of this.
Please don't ever do that again.
No promises.
We just heard from operator 46, the police have been alerted and are three minutes out.
Take the doors.
God.
What?
Okay, hold on, hold on.
Hold on.
You're okay.
You're okay.
I got you.
Just stay with me.
Stay with me.
It's gonna stop.
No.
God.
You need to go.
Tom, get her out of here.
You're ready for this?
Yeah.
Previously on The Blacklist...
Yes, I want to marry you.
Anything happened to me, this was to go to Elizabeth, just so she'd know.
You said the name Masha Rostova had been lost to history until the manhunt.
Now it's out there, and someone's looking for me?
It's my mother!
I am asking you to help me.
Walk away.
He came.
How do you want me to handle it?
_
I take it I'm not actually being transferred to Leavenworth.
Ms. Hitchin doesn't like loose ends.
You understand.
Of course.
Actually...
I helped put those protocols in place.
She wanted me to be sure to thank you for your years of service.
I suppose a gold watch would have been too much to hope for.
Let me guess.
You blew a tire, stopped the transport to change it, and shot me as I tried to escape?
Close.
I pulled over to take a leak, you grabbed Joe's gun, took you down after you shot him in the leg.
Nobody's shooting me in the leg.
My bad.
You shot him in the head.
Run.
You heard me.
Run.
And who might you be?
_
Are you serious?
What about the rings and the photographer?
And the dress and the flowers and all that stuff.
We don't need it.
They had a cancelation at the church this afternoon.
- I say we go for it.
- Hold on.
I thought we were gonna try to do things right this time.
Doesn't this feel right?
To do it now, today at St. Cecilia's, where we wanted to do it the first time?
It feels kind of crazy.
I mean, there's other dates available.
April 25th.
I'm due on the 22nd.
All right, so let's say we could get this done today, which I...
I really don't know if we can.
It's not gonna be perfect.
But it will be a lot better than waiting a week or two and having you roll me down the aisle.
If that's what it takes,
I will roll you wherever you need to go.
But are you absolutely sure about this?
Come on.
It's me and you.
We usually do like six impossible things before breakfast.
I love it when you misquote Lewis Carroll.
I know.
That's why I do it.
- Ah-ah.
- What?
Wait until the wedding night.
72 hours ago, Matias Solomon escaped from custody while being transferred to a holding facility.
How does that happen?
The official story is he overpowered a guard, wrestled away his gun, and managed to kill the entire transport team before vanishing like the proverbial will-of-the-wisp.
And the unofficial story?
The Cabal?
Apparently not, considering all of the dead men were assets of the Cabal.
Yesterday, Solomon reached out to an associate of mine-- a man with a very specialized field of expertise.
Solomon was inquiring about the storage and transport of tactical nuclear weapons, which would be troubling enough on its own, but coupled with the fact that your Air Force is scheduled to transport just such a weapon down the New Jersey Turnpike,
I'm afraid your wedding plans will have to wait, Lizzy.
Is that what this is really about?
Getting me to delay my wedding?
This is about preventing Matias Solomon from getting his hands on a nuclear weapon.
I'll take it to the task force.
I was hoping you'd say that.
But I'm not going to get involved.
What I am going to do is get married.
And I hope you can be there.
Both of you.
Thank you, Elizabeth.
I just got off the phone with Justice.
Reddington was right about Solomon.
He escaped from a transport vehicle three days ago.
He left a pile of bodies behind him.
Why didn't we hear about this?
Looks like a covert Cabal operation, an execution gone wrong.
And the nuke?
Ran into a brick wall with the Office of Secure Transportation.
They refused to acknowledge whether they had any weapons in transit.
The weapon Mr. Reddington was talking about is the latest generation of so-called "gravity bombs."
It is completely maneuverable and has an adjustable yield, so you can choose whether to destroy a small city or just a couple of blocks.
That's convenient.
Did you get your information from Beyoncé herself?
Oh.
Uh, sorry.
Playlist for the wedding reception.
Which I really need to discuss with you.
Um, about the wedding-- Uh, it's this afternoon.
Uh, I thought you and Tom hadn't set a date.
Which is what I came to talk to you about.
Let me guess-- soon as you told Reddington,
- he gave you the case.
- Yes.
Which I'm not taking, but I think that you should, even if it means you can't make it.
Hang on.
No, no, no, no.
I'm not even done with the playlist.
I don't have your wedding gift.
I was gonna lose a few pounds to fit in my new slim-fit suit, which is houndstooth, by the way...
Look, it's very small.
Just a few friends.
I would love it if you could be there, but preventing Solomon from getting this weapon is much more important than coming to watch me remarry my ex-husband.
I've got a meeting with General Baxter at the Pentagon.
I'll find out if there's actually a threat here.
In the meantime, reach out to Homeland and Nuclear Security at the DOE.
See if Solomon's on anyone's radar.
Hey.
Look, I meant what I said about you taking this case, but if you happen to be done in time,
I would love it if you could perform the ceremony.
Liz, I'm flattered, but I'm not qualified.
You can get ordained online.
It takes like 10 minutes.
Uh, look, there's a minister, but we don't know him, and I'd just much rather you say a few words.
Assuming I can get away, I'd be honored.
Great.
The service is at 4:00.
No pressure.
_
This is everything?
We load it in here, we're good to go.
All right, then.
Let's go steal ourselves a nuclear warhead.
- Hey, you.
- How we doing?
Good.
We got the rings, and I got a place to hold the ceremony.
You know, it turns out I am amazing at impromptu wedding planning.
I had no idea.
How you doing on your end?
I picked up your suit from the cleaners, and I dropped it at the apartment.
And Reddington, how'd he take the news?
Today is not about him.
It's about you marrying a woman who is eight months pregnant.
You're right.
We're screwed.
Should I downgrade your bouquet of roses to daisies?
I told you peonies.
And don't forget the candles.
Candles, peonies-- my first honey-do list.
I'll, uh, call you in an hour.
Let me be clear, Harold.
I'm not gonna confirm or deny any mission details about the movements of our nuclear arsenal.
Rolly, my CI is reliable.
If he says your convoy's gonna be hit on the Jersey Turnpike, it's gonna be hit.
Duly noted.
If you were gonna ignore me, you could have had the courtesy to do it over the phone.
I had you come here because I want to make it abundantly clear-- this is a military operation.
You and your team need to stand down.
General Baxter, you have a problem.
I can help.
It's not a request, Harold.
Tell your people to stand down.
Yeah, look, that's just not gonna happen.
No.
It's not.
We can't protect the convoy directly, so let's focus on Solomon.
He's burned with the Cabal, so he's gonna need a team.
I can check with Mossad.
See what mercs they're tracking in the area.
And have Aram put together a list of equipment they might need to pull this off.
Liz.
- Yeah.
- Uh, playlist for the wedding.
It's definitely a work in progress, so...
You heard Cooper.
We got a lot of work to do, guys.
If there's any way that we can get there, we will.
Hey.
We good?
Yeah.
Fine.
It's, uh, your big day.
This is about you and Tom.
Look, I know the two of you have--
It's not about him and me.
It's about him.
I mean, he laid a hand on you.
As far as I'm concerned, there's no coming back from that.
I get where you're coming from, and I love you for saying it.
But I kept him prisoner in the hull of a ship and tortured him for two months, so in my book we're even.
Hey, I said my piece.
If I can be there for you today, I will.
Mr. Cooper, genius.
What?
What is it?
No wonder he is the Assistant Director.
The way his mind works, his attention to detail,
I can't believe he's living in his office.
I'm sorry.
What?
Did I just say that or think that?
He's living in his office?
Oh.
No.
I mean, not living living.
He's-- he's working living.
He's here all the time.
Point is, he was right.
Uh, to handle a nuclear weapon,
Solomon and his men will need something to shield themselves from the radiation.
The Hunt Valley Nuclear Research Facility.
Right outside of Baltimore.
They were robbed an hour ago by a group of armed men who took an isotope transfer cask.
All right, let's go.
You guys are a little late to the party.
We've already got Homeland, DOE, and the FBI interviewing the staff, but I was told to help you with whatever you need.
We're part of a special task force.
Yeah, you seem pretty special.
It must have been very traumatic this morning.
Well, it wasn't fun.
About the worst we had before that was a bunch of anti-nuke yahoos climbing the fences and spray-painting the joint.
Show them what we got.
That's definitely Solomon.
Yeah, he's the one.
Said something about stealing a nuke.
The other, she was talking about payloads and guidance systems.
Let's see if Aram can ID her.
Look, if I give you a secure e-mail, can you forward this footage?
Yeah, no problem.
_
_
I thought you said it was bad luck to see each other before the wedding.
Liz.
Even worse luck to see me before the wedding.
I thought we had an agreement.
We're done.
Gina, what are you doing here?
Just doing a favor for a friend.
Hello, Jacob.
Long time no see.
Tell me you got something, Aram.
- What about the B-52s?
- The planes?
The band.
Total crowd pleaser, right?
"Rock Lobster."
Aram, please focus.
Uh, yeah, right.
I've ID'd the woman in the video as Nez Rowan.
Sending you her info now.
She is ex-Navy, where she was a nuclear weapons specialist.
I guess we now know why she's on the team.
Yeah, she also goes by about a half-dozen other aliases.
Been a freelancer for the past eight years.
Do you have anything to trace her?
Actually, one of her preferred aliases-
- Harper Waters-- is currently checked into a motel in Baltimore.
All right, send us the details and have a TAC team meet us there.
Desk clerk confirmed our target's in room five.
We were able to snake a camera through the air duct from the adjoining room.
There's another door, opens to the parking lot outside.
I've got a second team there.
All right, we're gonna breach from the hallway.
Don't let her get out that other door.
- Navabi, you in place?
- Affirmative.
Two.
South corridor, clear.
Command six, do you have eyes on the target?
Go, go, go!
We've got a silver SUV.
En route.
Copy.
En route.
Move.
We have a runner.
Move, move!
Female suspect on the move.
Team one, move up.
Stop!
Next one's in your head.
Hands where I can see them now!
See, we've got you on video at the Hunt Valley robbery.
We got a motel room filled with classified documents and two wounded agents, one in critical care who may never walk again.
The only thing you've got going for you at this point is that he's not dead.
- I was unarmed.
- Oh, that doesn't matter.
You're an accessory.
And if your crew succeeds in its attempt to hit that convoy and steal the nuclear device, you're gonna get a needle in your arm, just like your boss, Mr. Solomon.
The only reason I mentioned I was unarmed was because it might factor into the deal you're gonna offer.
You've got nothing to bargain with.
I'm a professional.
I pledge allegiance to the highest bidder.
I have no loyalty to Mr. Solomon or anyone else beyond the terms of our business arrangement.
Once they left me in that motel, our contract was null and void.
But if you make me an offer,
I will tell you what you want to know.
No deal.
Yes.
Deal.
Full immunity.
No jail time.
And witness protection.
Solomon and his friends are very motivated and very powerful.
And if their plan goes south, they'll know who talked and they'll be very, very peeved.
Before you throw me in the hole, tell the geniuses at the Pentagon we know the convoy on the turnpike is a decoy.
Then let's see how fast they want to cut a deal.
You are a genuine anomaly.
The St. Regis program has consistently produced reliable operatives, except for you.
Is there a question coming?
Where do you think we went wrong?
When did you start to feel love for Elizabeth Keen?
I don't know.
I just know that it happened.
And I'm really glad that it did.
Even now?
Especially now.
You were my finest accomplishment.
And my biggest disappointment.
Mine too.
Get up.
Get up.
Turn around.
Get on your knees.
Goodbye, Jacob.
Was that your plan?
'Cause a little sooner would've been nice.
To tell you the truth, up until I pulled the trigger,
I hadn't made up my mind yet.
Well, have you made it up now?
Those last few weeks, when I thought you were dead...
I actually missed you.
But I meant what I said.
You're my greatest disappointment.
I've acquired new intel regarding your convoy.
I thought I made myself abundantly clear on this issue.
We have a suspect in custody, a nuclear weapons specialist.
She claims the convoy on the turnpike is a decoy.
Rolly?
I'm here.
Listen to me.
We've got to find out everything this woman knows, immediately.
Look, she's asking for immunity.
I don't care.
Give it to her.
Give her whatever she wants.
Rolly, the truth.
Is the nuke vulnerable?
A minute ago, I would have said no.
I thought you'd come around.
Your deal is contingent upon your intel being valid.
Start talking.
The real convoy is coming in on 95 at 1550 hours.
There's an abandoned van parked under the overpass at mile marker 22 packed with a 1,500-pound ANFO bomb.
They're gonna blow the bridge right before the real convoy gets there...
Shutting down the traffic.
Once the convoy's stopped, they're gonna hit it-- hard.
26 seasoned mercs with enough firepower to retake Omaha Beach.
Hey, tell all your Feeb buddies to pack extra pairs of shorts!
They're gonna need them.
All right, I've got a satellite view of the overpass, but if there is a van, we can't see it from the air.
Who's on site?
Maryland State Police is coordinating with the Office of Special Transport.
They're shutting down the 95 and rerouting the convoy.
Explosive Ordinance Disposal is en route.
No, I'll take the call.
I got plenty of backup.
It'll make a huge difference to Keen if neither of us is at that wedding.
Go.
I'll be okay.
Give her a hug for me, okay?
Yeah, I will.
Be careful.
Yes?
What brings you here?
You need an update on the Solomon case?
I just got off the phone with Agent Navabi.
She thoroughly briefed me on the situation.
Oh.
Then you're here for the wedding?
No, Lizzy.
I'm here to ask you, to implore you, please, don't do this.
I'm telling you, no matter what you believe,
Tom is not the man you think he is.
You're wrong.
You don't know him.
He's a criminal.
No.
He's changed.
Men like Tom don't change.
You're attempting to build a life with a man who is fundamentally dishonest.
No.
I am attempting to build a life with the father of my child.
A normal life with two parents who love one another.
With everything you know about me, can't you see that?
Can't you see how important that is to me?
To my child?
You were wrong about him once.
What makes you so sure you're not wrong this time?
Do you really want your child to pay the price for that mistake for the rest of his or her life?
Get out.
I want you to go.
Please?
I don't want you here.

Commander, convoy's already been diverted.
What's our status?
Traffic's about to be shut down.
The EOD just pulled up.
All right, well, hurry it up.
Get everybody back, set up a perimeter.
Solomon and his team must be close.
Raymond, we should turn around.
You're upset.
I'm sure Elizabeth didn't mean--
Why didn't she escape with the others?
Who?
The mercenary Agents Ressler and Navabi arrested at the motel.
She could have fled with Solomon, escaped in the SUV with the others.
Agent Navabi said she broke off on her own, tried to get away in a second vehicle.
Hand me the phone, Dembe.
I need to see that vehicle.

Quite a grip.
Sor-
- I was, uh...
Yeah, this car looks great, man.
I know.
Right?
It's, uh-- It's my grandfather's.
Oh, wow.
Going to be a pretty sweet getaway car, right?
Uh, not that you would know.
Or ever, uh, like, uh, need one.
A getaway, y-you know?

- Yeah.
Have you seen Liz?
Ah, right.
Yes.
Uh, she's inside.
- Thanks.
- Sure.
I'll just-
- I'll leave the keys in the visor.
I told myself no more secrets.
And I promised you that I would be completely honest, no matter what.
Today the Major found me.
Gina told him where to find me, and he came into our apartment and tried to kill me.
But he's dead.
And I, uh...
You killed him?
Uh, no.
A-Actually, Gina did, but that's a long story.
Look, what I want you to know is that it happened because I made it clear that I'm out.
I'm done with those people and that life.
But there are things that I did, and-- and-- and I might be done with those things, but I can't promise you that those things are done with me.
And I can't promise you that it's not gonna happen... tomorrow or next week or-- or five years from now.
- Hey.
- And I would understand, frankly,
- if you didn't want to deal with any of--
- Stop.
It's me, remember?
Your ex-wife who shot the Attorney General and was publicly branded a Russian sleeper agent.
I know a little something about baggage.
But I love you.
And I am willing to help you carry yours if you can help me carry mine.
Not enough hazard pay in the world to convince me to open those doors.
Come on.
Come on.
There wasn't anything inside.
You're sure?
Look, I know who you are, and if there was something to tell I'd tell you, but there was nothing inside the car.
Door's unlocked.
Doesn't look rigged.
Here we go.
Cracking it open.
What the...?
What is it?
Nothing.
It's completely empty.
The van's completely empty.
Something wrong, boys?
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe the car means nothing.
Maybe she was just unlucky.
Why didn't it start?
What do you mean?
Starts just fine.
Drove it up onto the flatbed myself.
She's a sacrifice.
Solomon isn't after that weapon.
It's a distraction to keep us looking one way while they go another.
He's after Elizabeth.
Listen, give me two two-man teams going north and south.
All right?
Thank you.
Reddington, the suspect lied about the location of the attack on the convoy.
There is no attack.
There never was.
The target is Agent Keen.
You need to get to the church, Donald.
What are you talking about?
Ever since Elizabeth went public as Masha Rostova, still waters have been stirred up and old grudges have surfaced.
And now someone out there is singularly focused on coming for her.
- Coming to kill her?
- No.
To abduct her.
They're sending Solomon.
In retrospect, that's a perfect choice.
He knows us intimately.
He knows about the task force.
They gave us a false trail, and we followed the scent.
Donald, if I'm right and this was all an elaborate feint, all that matters is that you get to that church now.
On my way.
We are gathered here today in celebration of Elizabeth and Tom.
In my years on this Earth,
I've been blessed with some truly remarkable friendships.
And I've come to believe that friends are indeed the family we choose.
We are here today to witness the beginning of a new family, inspired by the love of a man and a woman who have found, in each other, their truest friend.
Two people who choose each other.
Now, each choice brings with it blessings as well as hardships.
Choosing a partner means choosing that person's life to become your life.
Their joy becomes your joy, as do their burdens.
Nobody gets in.
The sum of our choices are a weight that each individual carries alone.
But as man and wife, as partners, you choose to shoulder that weight together.
And all of us here today... we celebrate the choice you've made.
Elizabeth, I'm sorry, but we need to go.
What are you doing here?
Men are coming for you.
We need to leave now.
Solomon never intended to take that weapon.
He was contracted by an employer to take you.
They're here.
Tom.
Keep clear of the windows.
Everybody, stay low.
Aram, get these people out of here now.
Stay down, stay down.
Stay down, stay down.
I'm sorry, Lizzy.
You have a team in position?
We have a perimeter.
Agent Ressler's en route.
In the meantime, we'll have to hold the fort.
The others?
Great.
We're surrounded.
Cooper.
Yeah.
You know why I'm here.
Send her out.
It's curious.
I thought you were the Cabal's most loyal soldier.
And yet here you are, under the patronage of a new benefactor.
I was loyal to the Cabal.
Right up until they tried to kill me.
I'm totally violating my non-compete agreement, but... what the hell?
So where do we go from here?
I was instructed to deliver Masha Rostova to my employer and that's what I intend to do.
Send her out, and this can all be over.
So, this is your big plan-- an assault on a building filled with armed FBI agents?
Honestly, Matias, I expect better from you.
First of all, you and I both know that you are outmanned and outgunned.
The plan was to grab her today, no matter where she was.
Grocery store or house of God, it makes little difference to me.
And for the record,
I take no offense that I wasn't invited.
Came together rather nicely.
They went with ruby fringe tulips and pink peonies.
You'd be impressed.
I'll tell you what, then.
I'll call you back in a couple of minutes.
Give you some time to consider my offer.
And then I'm coming in to check out the flowers myself.
Your target is Elizabeth Keen.
She's to be taken alive and unharmed, but please... feel free to kill anybody else.
All right, don't worry.
My friends, they are the best at what they do.
There's no signal.
They're jamming it.
When Solomon calls back, they'll have to stop.
You'll have a few seconds to get a message out.

It's her, isn't it?
Solomon's employer.
It's my mother.
Who else would call me Masha Rostova?
Lizzy, your mother is dead.
Then who is it?
Who?
You owe me this.
I'll tell you what I know as soon as I know you're safe.
We're not all out of options here.
Nobody has to get hurt.
Lizzy, you are not going out there
- under any circumstances.
- Agreed.
You want me to ask those poor, terrified people what they think?
No.
Hello, Matias.
What's it gonna be?
Is she coming out, or am I coming in?
- I'm coming out!
- No.
There seems to be some disagreement on that score.
We'll need a little more time to sort this out.
You've had all the time that you're gonna get.
Brace yourselves.
They're coming.
This is on you.
Yes.
All of this, indeed, is on me.
Your SOS get through?
Let's hope so.
Okay.
Concentrate your fire up front.
Drive them toward the back of the room.
They'll attack the front first.
Try and drive us out the back.
Most of his men will be there.
Once you breach the front doors, it'll be quick.
Pin them down, and we'll come in through the back and put it to bed.
Harold, we need to barricade that back door.
- Aram.
- Yeah.
Give me a hand.
It's our only way out.
If we get out at all, it'll be through the front.
Most importantly, you need to keep Elizabeth out of sight.
No one's keeping me anywhere.
Liz, if anything happens to you, if you get hurt or taken, none of this means anything.
Don't you get it?
I'm the only one in this building they're not gonna shoot.
Exactly.
So if they don't know where you are, they're going to be a lot more careful about where they point their weapons.
Feels familiar, eh?

Let's hope this ends better than that did.

- Ah-ah.
- What?
Wait until the wedding night.
72 hours ago, Matias Solomon escaped from custody while being transferred to a holding facility.
How does that happen?
The official story is he overpowered a guard, wrestled away his gun, and managed to kill the entire transport team before vanishing like the proverbial will-of-the-wisp.
And the unofficial story?
The Cabal?
Apparently not, considering all of the dead men were assets of the Cabal.
Yesterday, Solomon reached out to an associate of mine-- a man with a very specialized field of expertise.
Solomon was inquiring about the storage and transport of tactical nuclear weapons, which would be troubling enough on its own, but coupled with the fact that your Air Force is scheduled to transport just such a weapon down the New Jersey Turnpike,
I'm afraid your wedding plans will have to wait, Lizzy.
Is that what this is really about?
Getting me to delay my wedding?
This is about preventing Matias Solomon from getting his hands on a nuclear weapon.
I'll take it to the task force.
I was hoping you'd say that.
But I'm not going to get involved.
What I am going to do is get married.
And I hope you can be there.
Both of you.
Thank you, Elizabeth.
[ Door opens, closes ]
I just got off the phone with Justice.
Reddington was right about Solomon.
He escaped from a transport vehicle three days ago.
He left a pile of bodies behind him.
Why didn't we hear about this?
Looks like a covert Cabal operation, an execution gone wrong.
And the nuke?
Ran into a brick wall with the Office of Secure Transportation.
They refused to acknowledge whether they had any weapons in transit.
The weapon Mr. Reddington was talking about is the latest generation of so-called "gravity bombs."
It is completely maneuverable and has an adjustable yield, so you can choose whether to destroy a small city or just a couple of blocks.
Liz:
That's convenient.
Did you get your information from Beyoncé herself?
Oh.

I would love it if you could be there, but preventing Solomon from getting this weapon is much more important than coming to watch me remarry my ex-husband.
I've got a meeting with General Baxter at the Pentagon.
I'll find out if there's actually a threat here.
In the meantime, reach out to Homeland and Nuclear Security at the DOE.
See if Solomon's on anyone's radar.

We are here today to witness the beginning of a new family, inspired by the love of a man and a woman who have found, in each other, their truest friend.
Two people who choose each other.
Now, each choice brings with it blessings as well as hardships.
Choosing a partner means choosing that person's life to become your life.
Their joy becomes your joy, as do their burdens.
Nobody gets in.
The sum of our choices are a weight that each individual carries alone.
But as man and wife, as partners, you choose to shoulder that weight together.
And all of us here today... we celebrate the choice you've made.

Wait until the wedding night.
72 hours ago, Matias Solomon escaped from custody while being transferred to a holding facility.
How does that happen?
The official story is he overpowered a guard, wrestled away his gun, and managed to kill the entire transport team before vanishing like the proverbial will-of-the-wisp.
And the unofficial story?
The Cabal?
Apparently not, considering all of the dead men were assets of the Cabal.
Yesterday, Solomon reached out to an associate of mine-- a man with a very specialized field of expertise.
Solomon was inquiring about the storage and transport of tactical nuclear weapons, which would be troubling enough on its own, but coupled with the fact that your Air Force is scheduled to transport just such a weapon down the New Jersey Turnpike,
I'm afraid your wedding plans will have to wait, Lizzy.
Is that what this is really about?
Getting me to delay my wedding?
This is about preventing Matias Solomon from getting his hands on a nuclear weapon.
I'll take it to the task force.
I was hoping you'd say that.
But I'm not going to get involved.
What I am going to do is get married.
And I hope you can be there.
Both of you.
Thank you, Elizabeth.
[ Door opens, closes ]
I just got off the phone with Justice.
Reddington was right about Solomon.
He escaped from a transport vehicle three days ago.
He left a pile of bodies behind him.
Why didn't we hear about this?
Looks like a covert Cabal operation, an execution gone wrong.
And the nuke?
Ran into a brick wall with the Office of Secure Transportation.
They refused to acknowledge whether they had any weapons in transit.
The weapon Mr. Reddington was talking about is the latest generation of so-called "gravity bombs."
It is completely maneuverable and has an adjustable yield, so you can choose whether to destroy a small city or just a couple of blocks.
Liz:
That's convenient.
Did you get your information from Beyoncé herself?
Oh.
Uh, sorry.

I would love it if you could be there, but preventing Solomon from getting this weapon is much more important than coming to watch me remarry my ex-husband.

I'll find out if there's actually a threat here.
In the meantime, reach out to Homeland and Nuclear Security at the DOE.
See if Solomon's on anyone's radar.

Man:
Door's unlocked.
Doesn't look rigged.

Cracking it open.
What the...?
What is it?
Nothing.
It's completely empty.
The van's completely empty.
Something wrong, boys?
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe the car means nothing.
Maybe she was just unlucky.
Why didn't it start?
What do you mean?
Starts just fine.
Drove it up onto the flatbed myself.
She's a sacrifice.
Solomon isn't after that weapon.
It's a distraction to keep us looking one way while they go another.
He's after Elizabeth.
Listen, give me two two-man teams going north and south.
- [ Cellphone ringing ]
- All right?
Thank you.
Reddington, the suspect lied about the location of the attack on the convoy.
There is no attack.
There never was.
The target is Agent Keen.
You need to get to the church, Donald.
What are you talking about?
Ever since Elizabeth went public as Masha Rostova, still waters have been stirred up and old grudges have surfaced.
And now someone out there is singularly focused on coming for her.
- Coming to kill her?
- No.
To abduct her.
They're sending Solomon.
In retrospect, that's a perfect choice.
He knows us intimately.
He knows about the task force.
They gave us a false trail, and we followed the scent.
Donald, if I'm right and this was all an elaborate feint, all that matters is that you get to that church now.
On my way.
We are gathered here today in celebration of Elizabeth and Tom.
In my years on this Earth,
I've been blessed with some truly remarkable friendships.
And I've come to believe that friends are indeed the family we choose.
We are here today to witness the beginning of a new family, inspired by the love of a man and a woman who have found, in each other, their truest friend.
Two people who choose each other.
Now, each choice brings with it blessings as well as hardships.
Choosing a partner means choosing that person's life to become your life.
Their joy becomes your joy, as do their burdens.
Nobody gets in.
The sum of our choices are a weight that each individual carries alone.
But as man and wife, as partners, you choose to shoulder that weight together.
And all of us here today... we celebrate the choice you've made.
[ Door opens ]
Elizabeth, I'm sorry, but we need to go.
What are you doing here?
Men are coming for you.
We need to leave now.
Solomon never intended to take that weapon.
He was contracted by an employer to take you.

Cooper.
Yeah.
You know why I'm here.
Send her out.
It's curious.
I thought you were the Cabal's most loyal soldier.
And yet here you are, under the patronage of a new benefactor.
I was loyal to the Cabal.
Right up until they tried to kill me.
I'm totally violating my non-compete agreement, but... what the hell?
So where do we go from here?
I was instructed to deliver Masha Rostova to my employer and that's what I intend to do.
Send her out, and this can all be over.
So, this is your big plan-- an assault on a building filled with armed FBI agents?
Honestly, Matias, I expect better from you.
First of all, you and I both know that you are outmanned and outgunned.
The plan was to grab her today, no matter where she was.
Grocery store or house of God, it makes little difference to me.
And for the record,
I take no offense that I wasn't invited.
Came together rather nicely.
They went with ruby fringe tulips and pink peonies.
You'd be impressed.
I'll tell you what, then.
I'll call you back in a couple of minutes.
Give you some time to consider my offer.
And then I'm coming in to check out the flowers myself.

It's my mother.
Who else would call me Masha Rostova?
Lizzy, your mother is dead.
Then who is it?

You owe me this.
I'll tell you what I know as soon as I know you're safe.
We're not all out of options here.
Nobody has to get hurt.

- Agreed.
You want me to ask those poor, terrified people

Hello, Matias.
Matias:
What's it gonna be?
Is she coming out, or am I coming in?
- I'm coming out!

We'll need a little more time to sort this out.

Okay.

Drive them toward the back of the room.
They'll attack the front first.
Try and drive us out the back.
Most of his men will be there.
Once you breach the front doors, it'll be quick.
Pin them down, and we'll come in through the back and put it to bed.
Harold, we need to barricade that back door.
- Aram.
- Yeah.
Give me a hand.
It's our only way out.
If we get out at all, it'll be through the front.
Most importantly, you need to keep Elizabeth out of sight.
No one's keeping me anywhere.
Liz, if anything happens to you, if you get hurt or taken, none of this means anything.
Don't you get it?
I'm the only one in this building they're not gonna shoot.
Exactly.
So if they don't know where you are, they're going to be a lot more careful about where they point their weapons.

"We did what we had to do and we did it well."

But that's the idea.
So whenever you're feeling worried, whenever your thoughts start to...
wander, just bring them back to the mantra...

But I've grown bigger and hotter since then, and he's dead.

I could shove it up your ass.
Hmm, I'm not so big on ass play.

Yeah, I heard about it.
Well, I'm one of a group of citizens trying to convince the city council to turn that lot into a park space instead.
I was wondering if you'd be willing to have a friendly discussion, or maybe even sign our petition?
Sure... if you take your top off.
- Okay, that is inappropriate.
- Yes.
Inappropriate things do happen out there.
How would you handle it?
You really think a grown man is gonna ask me to take my top off?
Well, there's a sex offender at 3134 10th Street.
He might.
No, you do not have to go to the sex offender's house.
No one has to knock on any door that makes him or her feel uncomfortable.
But I do urge you all to be bold and stretch yourself.
By the way, has everyone signed their liability waivers?
Oh, shit.
I hear he likes little boys.
Little boy, Asian girl, are they really that far apart?
You said our break-up was going to be amicable.
Yeah, I said a lot of things.
So did you, like, "I love you.
I'll always love you.
This is not because of Oren."
Wait, what?
She dumped me to get with you.
I'm not sweet enough arm-candy.
Oh, my God!
Could you kids drop the soap opera for another time?
We're going out there this afternoon.
You need to feel like you're prepared.
Well, clearly, she's not.
She can't even handle "take your top off."
Okay, 50 bucks says I get more signatures than you, Ethan.
No bet.
People will sign just to shut you up.
But here's a bet.
Get the pedo to sign, I'll give you your 50 bucks.
And Oren will go on a date with you.
Cool?
- I'm not really in...
- Okay!
You are so on.
He will sign and you will give me cash, and I will spend it on a new hemp messenger bag and strawberry lube, because Oren seems like a strawberry kind of guy.
Well...
Great, now let's talk one more time about mirroring body language.
I'm just saying, if you bought me a watch,
I'd be on the time better.
- There's a clock on the wall.
- Not in my office.
I'll put a clock in your office.
Or you could buy me a watch, so when we out of the office like now,
I could tell you things like, "Hey, Mr. Caputo, we're only a few minutes late to meet Piscatella, and you the boss anyhow, so relax."
I will consider your watch request.
Hey, I'm just trying to make your life better.
This ain't about me.

- Take notes.
- Hold up, hold up.
"Take notes." Got you.

What are you possibly writing that will have any salience past this moment in time?
Well, Mr. Caputo wants notes.
Now, I don't know what salience is, but I think a checklist of what's completed and what's not is hella revalent.
You mean "rel." Relevant.
I mean, I'm trying to do my job, same as you, big man.

I will watch... you.
- Go!
- I'm goin'.

- Look at me go.
- Go.
- May I ask you a question, Mr. Caputo?
- Shoot.
How did you choose her to be your assistant, exactly?
- Between you and me?
- Yes, sir.
She's the only semi-intelligent one that I'm only... semi-attracted to.
Well, if you'll follow me, I'll show you the bathroom.
What are you writing?
Man, why everybody act like they ain't never seen a black woman with a clipboard before?
No, it's your pen.
It's exorbitantly scratchy and it's giving me anxiety.

"Anxiety" wasn't from the calendar.
That's just me.
But... "exorbitant" was.

So, hey, how come you don't get to live here, Luschek?
- Because I have a home, inmate.
- Oh, yeah?
- An entire basement to myself.
- Hmm.
You gotta admit, though, it is kind of swanky... you know?
I mean, you could fit an entire family just right in here and still have room for a TV.

Home sweet home.
- Did you just say X-rays?
- I did say X-rays.

'Cause the doctor was really nice, and my mom was doing him on the side.

- Vinnie?
Hurry up!
- I'm busy!
All right?
Lorna, I can't really do this today, okay?
Well, can you at least try?
No, my roommates!
It's awkward.
Well, I'm talking about kissing crotches in front of 50 other women, but for you, it's awkward?
I don't know, I thought you were into that.
Well, uh...
Maybe you could feel that way about your roommates.
Don't say that.
Well, do you have a speaker?
Put me on speaker, baby.
I'll talk so nice for you and the boys.

Lorna, my roommates are my parents and my kid brother.
What?

Oh, guilty as charged, in all respects.

You know, a lot of people in here are funny without meaning to be.
I learned the hard way to hold my mirth.
Oh, well, let your mirth fly free.
I mean to be funny.
All right.
Um... actually,
I was wondering if I could speak to you about my friend.
Oh, that little retarded girl?
She's actually not... challenged at all, which is what we're supposed to say, not the R-word.
Oh, uh...
"R"s, "F"s, "L-M-N-O-P"s and "Q"s.
You know, I get in more trouble for expanding those single letter words, but never "N" s.
Despite this drawl, I'm brighter than that.
So, now, you were saying?
About your friend who is not challenged.
Am I allowed to say "special"?
No, she's not special.
Well, she is to me.
- Mmm.
- But not euphemistically.
She's a fan and whenever she sees you, she freaks out.
You've gotta understand.
Institutional racism... traps the most vulnerable people in our society in this cycle of incarceration which, in turn, leads to a cycle of poverty.
It makes someone like you...
someone rich and powerful and white, virtually unapproachable.
All right, so now let me get this straight.
Your friend acts like a moron around me because she's black and poor?
- Is that right?
- Basically... yes.
I think her mother was a crack addict or something.
You might as well be an alien.
But you could bridge the divide.
- The way you did.
- Yeah, exactly!
All right, how about this?
Why don't you bring her over at lunch?
Okay.
It'll be like, uh...
the 1% sitting with the other 1%.
Oh, my God.
"The other 1%" is such a good hashtag.

- Hi!

- Look and I was wondering if...
Take your picture or smash an egg in my face, or whatever you need to do for you and your friends to get your jollies.
- But spare me the setup, all right?
- I don't have a setup.
You know who I am?
Yeah, I do, actually.
You're a member of the community who has as much right as any of your neighbors to be concerned about the big-box monstrosity that's being proposed for the corner of Exposition and Euclid.
I'd be happy to talk about it with you, if you have the time.
Look, I'm watching this Hurricane Katrina stuff.
It's really intense.
The world's gonna be lousy with Katrinas if we let mega-corporations like Walmart carbon-bomb our planet.
You wanna come in?
Sure.
Yeah, I'll give you the whole shpiel.
Spiel.
Sorry, I never know how to pronounce that.
Wait, um... how old are you?
Nineteen.
Okay.
Come in.
...aspect of this terrible hurricane that came on land with 145 mile-an-hour...
Okay.
I don't know if you realize, but the introduction of mega-retailers, like Walmart, almost invariably have a negative effect on property values...
- You're so nervous.
- I'm not nervous.
I'm passionate about saving local businesses.
Like Lola's Bloomers.
- May I?
- Sure.
Sure.
Conservative estimates are that there will be thousands of more cars in the neighborhood per day because of the construction...
It says you wanna put a park in instead.
I can't live within 2,500 feet of a park.
They would literally kick me out of my own home.
Sorry.
Can I talk about the elephant in the room for a second?
I wish you wouldn't.
I look across from me and I don't see a monster.
I see a human being fighting to control the animalistic parts of his brain, true grit overcoming impulse.
Not everybody judges you.
What if I told you it was kiddie porn?
I'd... say you need support, and I'd applaud your restraint for finding an outlet for your compulsions.
Wow!
You will really say whatever it takes.
Well, it was a lot worse than kiddie porn.
Wanna see?
No, I don't...
I don't need...
No.
No need.
Um...
Wait, all you did was have sex on the beach?
Consenting adults on an empty beach.
Well, except for the creeper that filmed it and turned us in to the cops.
But you think that pervo got in trouble?
That is insane.
I mean...
You are such a cautionary tale.
I would be, if people got the story right.
But once I had to go around door-to-door announcing my status, the rumors got started...
I don't know.
It's all so fucked.
Here.
It's not like Walmart's gonna lose.
Awesome.
Oh...
Uh...
Warden Caputo's office.
This is Ms. Jefferson speaking, how may I assist you?
Is Warden Caputo available?
Let me place you on a brief hold while I go and check.
Fuck.
Oh, well, you gonna call back.
Hello?
I'm still here.
Damn, you are still there.
Then why the little light go out?
Anyway, don't matter, I ain't got him right now.
Will you please let him know I called?
All right, you take good care now.
Yeah.
Shit.
What?
What happened?
I didn't quite get his name.
You don't know who it was?
Well, it was some brother, sounded like a salesman-type, if you ask me.
So I probably did you a favor there.
Oh!
And then some white lady, she called about a get-together.
Mmm-hmm.
It happened twice?
Jesus, Jefferson, what am I paying you for?
Are you sure she said "get-together"?
What does that even mean?
Like...
like, a meeting?
Like a meeting.
Or...
like a date, maybe.
You holding out on me?
You somebody's Ca-baby-boo-to?
You're on thin fucking ice, Jefferson.
Was it Linda?
Possibly.
It wasn't Natalie, was it?
Linda sounds more right.
Okay.
Get Linda from MCC on the line.
All right.
Press the button that says "Line one."
- One.
- Nine and the number.
Nine...
Got you.
Uh, hello?
Yes, hello.
I have Director Caputo.
I will transfer you now.
Shit!
Warden Caputo's office.
Jefferson, I got it.
My bad!
My bad!
- Hello, uh, Joe?
- Linda, hi.
Uh...
Jefferson, hang up your line.
I don't wanna disconnect y'all.
Hang up the phone!
Uh, I'm still training her.
Uh, I got your message about a get-together.
Oh, uh... wrong Linda, I think.
But we do need to celebrate our victory.
All these veterans becoming guards.
Yes.
Yes, we absolutely do.
Any chance you're free tonight?
Tonight?
Yes, it's perfect.
Um...
We can celebrate and, uh, talk business.
- How about La Fontana's at 8:00?
- Yeah, great.
- Great.
I'll see you tonight.
- Okay, bye.
Ah!
Even the staff waits for the bathroom now, hmm?
What can I do for you, Red?
I want to talk to you about the King woman.
You two are hitting it off, right?
You gave her the run of my garden.
How did you think that would go?
You know, planting a flag on the Moon doesn't mean that you own it.
You're Russian.
I thought you'd appreciate that attitude.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm only concerned for her.
Respect in prison has to be earned.
I don't know about that.
You've received a lot of leeway from staff around here.
You seem to be doing all right.
Was that what this is about?
Are you punishing me?
Did you do something wrong?
I did the only reasonable thing I could.
There's no such thing as a consensual relationship between a prisoner and a guard.
Lorna's wedding was a bittersweet end to a relationship that never actually happened, Sam.
You're reading something into this that isn't there, Reznikov.
And what goes on with Mrs. King is none of your business.
You're pampering her.
Oops!
She even gets a magazine?
What do you want, Ruiz?
I heard about your labor dispute.
I thought maybe my friends could fill in?
This is Pidge.
You know Ouija, or she knows you.
And that's Zirconia.
Zirconia?
I took out all my rocks before I come in, so nobody would think they was diamonds and rip 'em out.
Plus...
I don't think it's allowed.
They're all ready and willing to join your panty party.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Privately, please.
What are you doing?
This is not a publicly traded company.
Its very existence depends on keeping its existence hidden.
Chill the fuck out.
I was just trying to help you.
I don't need your help.
What I need is your discretion, and you bringing a bunch of thugs into my house is the opposite of that.
I decide who knows about Felonious Spunk.
I decide who gets hired.
I am the prison pussy panty business.
Somebody's getting a little big for her panties, I think.
I'm gonna choose to assume you're talking about yourself and take that as an apology.
You're talking shit out a paper asshole, Chapman.
But when an actual hard-ass bitch decides to call you on it... well...
Pretty sure she was talking about herself on that last one.
It's not fair.
It is the most unfair thing that's ever happened in this prison.
Mmm, what about when Carson went to SHU for sneezing too loud?
Or what's-her-face, the Puerto Rican girl, with the gimpy eye?
And when she got the wrong meds by accident in the med line and went nutso, and gimped her other eye with a spork.
Now, she double gimp-eyed.
Or how 'bout when Pornstache used to make the meth heads blow him for drugs in the mop closet?
Or the time Chapman got furlough?
I retract and redact.
New statement.
It's easily the top 138 most unfair things that has ever happened here.
What is?
Your new job.
My job is the bomb!
You sit at a desk all day when you were plucked from the most rewarding job.
I'm not saying it's on par with all the human rights abuses in here, but women fought for a long time to shake the role of desk-ridden secretary.
Are you for real?
Hey!
Do you get the Internet?
- Do you have a mini-fridge?
- Ah!
Do you have a skeleton key made from real human bone that opens a door to a world of talking animals?
Man, I got me a clipboard and a personal relationship with Mr. Caputo.
Man, if George R. R. Martin wrote about prisons,
I'd be, like... the Hand of the Warden.
Yo, don't the Hand always die in them books?
Man, whatever, okay?
Winter is coming, bitches.
And I'm getting me a watch.
- For real?
- Yes.
Hey.
Yo...
I feel like she's smiling and waving at me.
Maybe she can see dead people and there's one standing right... right in front of you.
Are the hairs standing up on the back of your neck?
I feel like I'm the dead person.
I... may have set you up on a blind friend date!
- Wait, you did what?
No!
- Surprise!
- What?
- I just talked you up.
- Go!
Be yourself.
- Yo...
- Go, P!
- Go, P!
Go, P!
- Let me fix your clothes.
- Get off me!
Hey.
You must be Poo-see.
She called her Poo-see!
No, I'm sorry.
Did I say that right?
Yeah, yeah.
Poussey, it's French.
Oh, French.
I was named after a great aunt who hid pearls from the Yankees under her pendulous breasts.
And she also brewed a famous home remedy that supposedly cured hookworm.
- Not quite so exotic.
- Listen.
- Hmm.
- I...
I feel...
I feel like I need to apologize...
- Uh-uh.
- ...for just being all, like, weird and stuff, you know, I just...
I dig your whole thing, you know.
And I just, I watch your show so much, so seeing you in person was just, you know, I got all tongue-tied, and fan-girly and stuff.
So I'd try to say words, but when they came out of my mouth, it just sound like...
All right, all right, all right.
Relax, darlin'.
Your friend has told me the whole story.
She has got you covered.
You gotta sink a hook in the keepers, especially in this place.
- Uh-huh.
- You know, it's funny.
Me and Brook, we never would've crossed paths.
I mean, growing up all over the world, bouncing culture to culture with a strict, conservative family, versus, you know, sleeping in tent cities with a bunch of dirty hippies, eating food out of dumpsters.
Oof!
You have been through a lot.
Nah, it was...
I mean, it was good.
Well, I mean, it was hard, you know?
Like, I guess being transient, and not really having any long-term friends, but I do know three languages.
Hmm!
Wait...
- you know three languages?
- Yeah.
How does the child of a crack whore learn three languages?
- That is remarkable.
- Excuse me?
What languages?
English, French and German.
Did you just call my mother a crack whore?
My mother had a masters in Art History and she could barely take an aspirin.
- Excuse me?
- My dad is a major in the army.
I was supposed to go to West Point.
I guess you were expecting just another ghetto prison rat.
At least one of us lives up to the stereotype.
What, no!
Sweetheart, no!
You have snatched the taste right out of my mouth.
I'm just parroting what your girlfriend told me about you.
You came out of a cycle of poverty, blah, blah, blah.
I mean, it seems to me that you two formed this relationship without talking much.
Did you know I am learning Italian?
So, did Chester the Molester sign?
You owe me 50 bucks.
- Whoa.
- And you better take me out.
I can't believe you had the balls to do it.
Whatever, he probably finger-banged his 15-year-old girlfriend when he was 17 or something else no big.
The sex offender lists are full of sob stories about people's lives being ruined by technicalities.
You know, as a matter of fact, he was a fucking horrible child-molester rapist.
Because I'm so sure he told you that.
Yeah, 'cause he...
He fucking tried to seduce me.
He invited me in for lemonade.
- And you went in?
- Yeah.
He told me I didn't look 19.
That's when I knew I was in trouble.
Shit.
He stroked my hair.
He wanted to brag, so he showed me the newspaper article about how he stalked this nine-year-old girl from his church, for, like, a year.
Earning her trust, gradually convincing her to...
Well, to...
To...
And then I was running down the street.
For your fucking bet, Ethan.
For 50 fucking dollars.
But also because I... because I wanted to go out with you.
I really appreciate you coming all the way down from Utica.
Sorry, again, I couldn't get a seat in one of the gondolas.
No, no, it's okay.
This is great.
I'm really glad that you thought I called.
These new guards, they're a... they're a big win for us.
Like, "us" us.
And the company, but especially "us" us.
Yeah.
We're not a bad team, Linda from Purchasing.
To us, Joe from Litchfield Human Activity, and our continued wins.
- And to the veterans, of course.
- Of course.
What?
The bald guy... is, uh... one of our former guards.
A really good guy.
Donaldson.
A good guy...
who walked out in the middle of an inmate transfer/high-profile self-surrender?
Yeah, I get your point.
Don't beat yourself up, Joe.
You handled that situation like a total boss.
Meant both literally and in that hip-kid lingo way.
Jesus!
He's not even a fucking waiter.
He's a busboy.
- What?
- No, just... you could've lost your job... or faced prosecution had inmates gone missing that day.
I mean, you're concerned about...
these jerks that hung you out to dry.
You're quite a guy, Joe Caputo.
There you go, sir.
Whenever you're ready.
- Uh, do me a favor, will you?
- Mmm-hmm.
- The change is yours.
- Okay.
Give a 20 to that busboy over there.
Wait till we're gone.
I don't want to make a thing of it, okay?
Okay.
Hey, Mr. Caputo!
- Look, Donaldson...
- I don't need your money, Mr. Caputo.
It's nothing, take it, it's...
Nah, this is not to help me.
This is to make you feel better about that... pardon my French, miss, bullshit you pulled.
- Okay, Joe, let's go.
- The bullshit I pulled?
I work three jobs.
This is the good one.
O'Neill?
I heard he had kidney stones.
But no health insurance.
So he thought he'd power through, wait for it to pass.
It didn't.
Now he's on dialysis.
He may lose a kidney.
- Jesus.
- Yeah.
So take your $20 and drown your conscience in a bottle of gin, because paying me to feel better about it ain't gonna work.
Donaldson.
You tell O'Neill I'm sorry about his stones.
I'm also sorry you gotta work here.
But I need you to understand something.
I'm sorry for you.
I don't regret firing any of you.
You walked out on the biggest day the prison's faced in 25 fuckin' years.
You put the prisoners at risk, you put your fellow cos at risk, you put this whole town in danger!
The shit hit and instead of moving the fan away, you plugged it in and you hit "oscillate."
I was gonna make you captain of the guard, Wade.
Really.
You keep the 20.
Least I could do for helping me dodge a bullet.
I'm sorry about this.
These houses are yours to live in, but they are prison property.
They will be treated with respect.
As long as they are treated with respect, you will be as well.
Okay, the warden has asked me to do a... icebreaker event.
I will demonstrate this activity with CO...
- McCullough, sir.
- Okay, McCullough.
Tell me two true things about you and one lie.
I will attempt to guess the lie.
Okay, um...
I came to say I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Okay, please don't lock me out.
You're right to be upset.
How would you know?
You don't know anything about me, Soso.
And, what, you think I'm upset about my mom's crack abuse or because I grew up poor, black and uneducated in the urban jungle?
Okay, I watched The Wire a lot.
I made assumptions.
But you spent time with me.
I mean, did you even listen when I talked?
Like, what the fuck about me, besides the color of my skin, would indicate that I'm some indigent hood rat?
I don't know.
No, it's fine, it's cool.
I'm guilty, too.
I won't lie.
You know, I like the story of the rich, white, hippie girl in my bed.
I've been working that on my end.
I don't want this to end.
What good is coming up here and sitting in the lobby every weekend gonna do?
She wants to get Sophia out, she needs to get a lawyer or a non-profit involved or something.
Ms. Burset said that the prison has tons of lawyers, so at least coming up here and waiting for the warden to come out to get into his face is something...
Michael started a Kickstarter campaign.
Kickstarter?
What that mean?
Not much, usually.
There's nothing to be ashamed about.
Plenty of guys live with their parents.
Right, yeah, I mean, you know...
I'm just doing this to save money, you know?
'Cause I could live on my own, obviously.
Oof!
Obviously.
I mean, very, very obviously.
It just makes the most financial sense, you know?
For the both of us.
Oh!
That's my manicotti, always thinking of his little lasagna.
Hey...
I made you something.
Fresh baked.
Lorna...
No, no, no, don't say it.
You know, even though it took a lot of time, and I had to go to the store twice, you... are worth it.
Hmm.
Mmm!
- Mmm!
- It's still warm.
My favorite.
Peanut butter and MM's.
- Snickerdoodles.
- Oh!
- I love you.
- Oh!
And you should.
I am quite a catch.
Oh, my God, you are.
You so are.
Fuck.
I want you.
- Vinnie.
- I want you.
It's our living room.
The neighbors want to look in, that's their good luck.
I'm already unbuttoning my shirt.
My goodness, you know that I can't resist your muscular chest.
Oh, my God.
My hands, they're in your hair right now.
I'm stroking it real soft.
Till I grab a handful of it and pull it back.
You're such a man.
Oh, God.
I'm licking your neck.
Kissing your ears.
My hand is on that big mountain in your pants, and I am unzipping you right now.
And I'm pulling your shirt off real slow.
No, no, no, it's a button-up.
- I unbutton it real slow.
- No, no, no, tear it off.
- Pulling it off.
It's off.
- Tear it off.
It's off, the buttons, they're everywhere.
They're everywhere.
Oh, my God, my mouth...
My mouth is on those big titties.
- My nipples are so hard right now.
- Oh, my God, my cock.
Oh, my God, my cock is really hard.
I know, baby.
No, it's really hard.
Like, right now, it's really hard.
- I know, Vinnie...
- Oh, God.
- Vinnie, put it inside me.
- Yeah?
Oh, my God, it's in you.
Oh, it's in you.
Oh, my God, it's in you.
It feels so good.
You're so wet.
You are so wet.
I actually am.
- I'm super wet right now.
- I know.
Do it to me.
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
- Don't stop.
- I'm not stopping.
I'm not stopping.
I'm not gonna stop.
I'm not gonna stop.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, baby!
- Oh, my God!
He's humping the table.
What the hell?
Hey!
Hey, stay right here.
Stay looking at me, all right?
Jesus Christ.
Don't think I don't see you.
Pleasure, as always.
Also, I want to talk to you about something.
If this is about last week, I don't get to control my flow.
I think it's all the stress of all these new bitches in here.
I know these last few weeks have had their challenges.
So...
I wanted to say thank you.
And keep up the good work.
Your morale is important to me.
Oh!
That's so sweet.
Ovaltine?
It's to make chocolate milk.
Pretty much only Chinese people drink it now, which is probably why it's at commissary, but it's really good.
So, it's chocolate powder for my powdered milk?
It's got vitamins.
Oh!
See?
New bitches.
Why are they always staring like they're waiting for a donkey show to start?
I don't think they're staring at you.
They were following us earlier.
And you didn't say anything?
People can stare.
- It's a free country.
- Not in prison.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
I bet your Bloody Mary gonna come early, too.
Hey.
Hey.
You okay?
No.
You?
No.
Do you want to talk about it?
Not really.
You?
But have you ever heard the phrase "paper asshole"?
No.
Ruiz said it to me.
I think I pissed off the Dominicans.
Relax.
You run the Litchfield panty company...
not the Sinaloa drug cartel.
No one's stitching your face to a soccer ball.
See ya around, Pipes.
What's this?
It's for the eyes.
Takes the red out.
I know what it is, pendeja.
What's it doing out?
It's contraband.
Whoops!
I need to be more careful.
Yeah, you do.
A few drops of that falls into the food, and this whole prison will be shitting their brains out.
Really?
I had no idea.
She acts so tough, but to stress-eat this food?
The poor woman.
Oh, you evil, Russian bitch.
What can I say?
I do a lot with a little.
No!
No!
No!
What the fuck?
That's my toilet paper.
Oh!
I talk a lot.
I babble... until I find something the person I'm with is interested in.
And I'll say anything I can to get them to like me.
But I... really... really like you.
The real you.
You don't know the real me.
But I want to.
So in, like, a minute, I'm gonna put down this radio, and I'm gonna listen to you tell me about yourself.
And I'm not gonna try to rewrite your story in my head.
And then, when you're done, I'd like to tell you about myself.
And some of it will be embarrassing and ugly... but mostly boring.
And then... maybe afterwards, we could, like...
quiz each other or something?
Eminem?
Yeah, it's not a presumption about you liking rap.
It's just...
AM 700 The OG is the only station that comes in clear.
Jackson, North Carolina.
Is that where you were born?
No, that's where my great-grandmother was born.
I mean, stuffed crust shoulda revolutionized pizza,
- but it was just a fad.
- Man, nah, it's the same thing.
- Man, it is not the same thing!
- All right.
'Cause that's Italian...
this is Mexican.
You got a stuffed tortilla, and you stuff that with more stuff.
Man, it's my golden ticket, and I'm gonna do it right with that business savvy and shit.
Hey, hey, hey!
Do you hear that?
What is that?
Wow, look at that.
That's a drone.
- It's a drone.
- Shit!
What's it doing here?
Like we some Iraqi wedding?
Man, come on.
We're gonna be late.
He was a bad man and we did good things.
He did bad things and we killed him good.
No, we did bad.
No!
We did well.
Hey.
Have you seen Whitehill?
Yeah, I forgot the garden needed turning.
If Rikerson comes back, just tell him where we went, okay?
Oh, fuck!
- No!
No!
- Lolly, Lolly.
Listen, listen.
They know!
They know!
They found you!
We have to move the body!
Shut up.
We cannot move the body.
There's drones.
Stop it, Lolly.
We cannot move it.
If I told you I already moved it, would it calm you down?
Maybe for a minute.
Good, 'cause I did.
Now, scat.
You didn't actually move it.
Hell, no.
And I'm not about to.
We're gonna have to kill her.
How are we supposed to clean the floors with nonstop bitches tracking their shit through?
We are like he whom the gods have condemned to push the boulder up the hill only to watch it roll back down.
Oh, right, right, right, right.
And then he has to cut his arm off to get out from underneath it.
What is that guy's name?
Oh, James Franco!
Sisyphus.
I did hear that rumor.
You know those Hollywood types, they will stick it in any warm hole.
Well, you don't have to be from Hollywood to wanna put it in a warm place.
It's called having a dick.
No, my Vinnie would never.
Well, maybe not in a man-hole, but you away a long time.
He could be getting his MM melting in some ho's mouth and not in his hand.
No.
No, that's never gonna happen because we're talking sexy on the phone, like, 24/7, and I mean real sexy.
And I give very good phone.
Are we talking about peanut MM's or regular?
Inmate Jefferson, Tasha Jefferson, report to the warden's office.
Inmate Tasha Jefferson to the warden's office.
Who's Tasha Jefferson?
Oh, Taystee?
Taystee, go to the warden's office.
We have a warden?
-Your name's Tasha?
-What is this about?
The main thing is answering the phones and organizational stuff.
General assisting.
I don't know.
I've never had an assistant before.
We will figure it out together.
And you swear this is legit?
'Cause I seen Shawshank and I don't wanna go to Seg because I did your taxes too good.
I guarantee you, you will never see anything with my social security number on it.
Never say never.
You work for MCC.
Maybe one day you realize you need food stamps and you don't know how to fill out the forms.
Well, I'm your girl.
I can walk you through it, but I'm gonna need them digits.
However...
I'm a vault.
I don't say nothing.
And I ain't never crawling through a tunnel of piss and dookie, so rest easy.
Okay.
As of now, you're off janitorial and you're with me.
Praise Jesus.
Every day.
When I'm working, you're working.
Is this 'cause I won at job fair?
- Sure.
- I told them bitches.
Take a clipboard, write things down, look busy.
Outside.
Alert!
Alert!
Alert!
-What?
-Mmm!
What?
Healy's just showing her around.
Frieda's over there.
It's all good.
Why does she get some special garden tour like some fancy Shiba Inu?
She's a celebrity, okay?
Fucking relax.
Uh...
Not okay.
Not...
Not really relaxed.
I think you are way too relaxed... to be in this big, brown shit-uation that we're in!
Lolly, believe me.
My insides have completely liquefied and I wanna vomit all the time... but I have chosen to keep my voice low and appear calm.
You have to do the same.
- I can't.
- You have to.
- Look at me.
You...
Listen.
You have to.
Change the record in your head.
Play, "He was a bad man.
We did what we had to do and we did it well.
So now it's through."
It's a mantra.
Say it.
"We did what we had to do and we did it well."
You forgot the bad man part.
And the end.
But that's the idea.
So whenever you're feeling worried, whenever your thoughts start to... wander, just bring them back to the mantra...
and then come and find me.
Okay?
"He was a bad man who did bad things well, and now he's gone."
Got it!
"He was a bad man, now he's gone from the well..."
Now that is one happy tomato.
I hope I do as well here.
-Hey, there's a good idea.
-Hmm.
Maybe we should fertilize our women, too.
--I do love your good intentions.
- Hey, Judy.
- Hey.
Hi.
You've got quite a following.
Yeah, I was hoping the novelty would wear off soon.
Might have to hide myself in that corn.
Oh, look, how beautiful!
Help yourself.
Oh!
All right.
Oh, really?
Free-for-all on the produce now, huh?
Regardless of who's in the club.
Who's worked the soil, pulled the weeds, tended the seedlings.
Is that the new policy?
-This is Judy King.
-Oh, I know who she is.
I've seen her... daytime TV program.
But we haven't had the pleasure.
Mrs. King is going to be joining your club, Red.
So I'll leave you to it.
-Thank you.
-Yeah.
I'm sure you'll find a lot in common.
Hair and... accents.
You know, my daddy used to call me "Red."
Really?
That's sweet.
My papa called me solnyshko.
It means little sun.
But I've grown bigger and hotter since then, and he's dead.
So what are you going to do with that ear, now that you've picked it?
Well, I guess that depends on what else I can find around here.
I could do a Southern fried corn, a dilled corn shooter,
Taiwanese-style street corn.
Listen to fancy pants.
I could shove it up your ass.
Hmm, I'm not so big on ass play.
What do you suggest I do, Miss Red?
I'm thinking.
- Can I have some seeds?
You bought Ovaltine.
Reap what you sow.
Ovaltine's got vitamins.
I'll trade you Ovaltine powder later for some seeds now.
I'm good for it.
No deal.
You'll regret it.
That's some malty goodness you're passing up.
Excuse me?
You knew going into this I had bad knees.
My feet are killing me.
We are putting out a vibe.
If you are sitting and/or eating my seeds, no vibe.
Right now, there is no vibe.
See?
Look at this.
-All of a sudden, I'm approachable.
-Picking up or dropping off?
Neither.
We're out.
I gave you guys new ones yesterday.
We're hanging up our lacy intimates.
If this is because of the money Stella took, I'm good for it.
I'll pay you back.
It's not worth it anymore.
We're smelling the beginning of the end.
You and all your posturing, shipping the kangaroo down the hill.
It's starting to feel dangerous.
You've even got a heavy on the payroll.
Ha!
I see what you did there.
-"Heavy."
-Not on purpose.
Fine, jump ship like rats.
And I'm not talking about the Disney-Pixar kind.
I was gonna fire one of you anyway, but I'm not gonna say which one.
Chew on that.
We're gonna take a walk on the track, you wanna join us, kahuna?
No, she does not.
She's got bad knees.
Enjoy sweating for free.
I expect all my undies still in your possession returned posthaste.
"Posthaste"?
That's nuts.
-Do you have something to say?
-Sure.
But I'll wait till I'm with my friends.
Off the backboard.
- Oh!
Short, black and bad at basketball.
-Subverting expectations since 1990.
-Oh, it's okay.
Litchfield's latest lesbos, in fun-size.
Look, how much longer do you think the world's longest game of Horse is gonna go on?
She ain't a lesbian.
I see.
Testing the waters before diving in face-first?
I'm attracted to people, not genders.
Well, aren't you special.
Tell you what, why don't you use some of that sexual fluidity to slide off the court so the real men can play?
Come on.
Even though I do think labeling is a total sham...
I see the power in reclaiming an epithet.
Like you guys have with "nigga."
Okay, maybe not that exactly.
But...
I really like you.
Like, really a lot.
And I just--
I wanna honor your feelings, you know, if you wanna call this something.
Like, we're girlfriend-girlfriend, or... lezzy togezzy.
I don't know.
How about we say we're happy, yeah?
Leave it at that?
Okay.
Oh, shit.
Hey!
Hi!
Hi...
Judy, I'm...
Hey, girl.
You're...
Fuck!
It is so cute how moony you get every time she's around.
By "cute" you mean, "lame as fuck."
Well, yeah.
You need to pull it together.
I mean, she's a person you admire, but she's still just a person.
A person.
Right.
You should be able to have a conversation with anyone.
Hi, I'm Brook.
I'm your neighbor.
I was wondering if you'd heard about the plans to build a Walmart at the corner of Exposition and Euclid?
Yeah, I heard about it.
Well, I'm one of a group of citizens trying to convince the city council to turn that lot into a park space instead.
I was wondering if you'd be willing to have a friendly discussion, or maybe even sign our petition?
- Sure... if you take your top off.
-Okay, that is inappropriate.
-Yes.
Inappropriate things do happen out there.
How would you handle it?
You really think a grown man is gonna ask me to take my top off?
Well, there's a sex offender at 3134 10th Street.
He might.
No, you do not have to go to the sex offender's house.
No one has to knock on any door that makes him or her feel uncomfortable.
But I do urge you all to be bold and stretch yourself.
By the way, has everyone signed their liability waivers?
Oh, shit.
I hear he likes little boys.
Little boy, Asian girl, are they really that far apart?
You said our break-up was going to be amicable.
Yeah, I said a lot of things.
So did you, like, "I love you.
I'll always love you.
This is not because of Oren."
Wait, what?
She dumped me to get with you.
I'm not sweet enough arm-candy.
Oh, my God!
Could you kids drop the soap opera for another time?
We're going out there this afternoon.
You need to feel like you're prepared.
Well, clearly, she's not.
She can't even handle "take your top off."
Okay, 50 bucks says I get more signatures than you, Ethan.
No bet.
People will sign just to shut you up.
But here's a bet.
Get the pedo to sign, I'll give you your 50 bucks.
And Oren will go on a date with you.
Cool?
-I'm not really in--
-Okay!
You are so on.
He will sign and you will give me cash, and I will spend it on a new hemp messenger bag and strawberry lube, because Oren seems like a strawberry kind of guy.
Well--
Great, now let's talk one more time about mirroring body language.
I'm just saying, if you bought me a watch, I'd be on the time better.
-There's a clock on the wall.
-Not in my office.
I'll put a clock in your office.
Or you could buy me a watch, so when we out of the office like now,
I could tell you things like, "Hey, Mr. Caputo, we're only a few minutes late to meet Piscatella, and you the boss anyhow, so relax."
I will consider your watch request.
Hey, I'm just trying to make your life better.
This ain't about me.
By the way, what you want me to do once we there?
-Take notes.
-Hold up, hold up.
"Take notes." Got you.
Mop it all around.
Damn!
This place is like Litchfield Edition.
And with, like, real addicts.
So, in a nutshell... electrical is still having Internet issues, plumbing works, but no hot water yet.
All beds and extraneous furniture are assembled and ready for move-in.
--Now, the interior paint--
Uh, inmate?
What are you possibly writing that will have any salience past this moment in time?
Well, Mr. Caputo wants notes.
Now, I don't know what salience is, but I think a checklist of what's completed and what's not is hella revalent.
You mean "rel." Relevant.
I mean, I'm trying to do my job, same as you, big man.
Are you...
suggesting that we are in any way, on any planet, in any universe, the same, inmate?
Why don't you go check on Luschek and the Internet situation?
-What?
-Let me watch you go.
Oh, you gonna "watch me" watch me?
I will watch... you.
- Go!
- I'm goin'.
It's clearly that...
time.
-Look at me go.
-Go.
-May I ask you a question, Mr. Caputo?
-Shoot.
How did you choose her to be your assistant, exactly?
-Between you and me?
-Yes, sir.
She's the only semi-intelligent one that I'm only... semi-attracted to.
Well, if you'll follow me, I'll show you the bathroom.
--What are you writing?
Man, why everybody act like they ain't never seen a black woman with a clipboard before?
No, it's your pen.
It's exorbitantly scratchy and it's giving me anxiety.
Damn, Word-A-Day.
I need to get me one of them calendars.
"Anxiety" wasn't from the calendar.
That's just me.
But... "exorbitant" was.
Check out these fat phone cords.
Shit, I could make so many bracelets out of the wires in one of these--
Uh-uh.
Those ain't phone cords.
They're for the Internet.
And believe me, you want some of them guards to be able to watch their porn and get it all out before they on duty, so you best leave it.
So, hey, how come you don't get to live here, Luschek?
-Because I have a home, inmate.
-Oh, yeah?
-An entire basement to myself.
-Hmm.
You gotta admit, though, it is kind of swanky... you know?
I mean, you could fit an entire family just right in here and still have room for a TV.
Couple of pictures of X-rays.
Home sweet home.
-Did you just say X-rays?
-I did say X-rays.
'Cause when my grandmammy broke her pelvis, all of us kids got X-rays.
'Cause the doctor was really nice, and my mom was doing him on the side.
--That's funny, huh?
He literally took an entire X-ray of my whole skeleton, and I hung it up on my wall like a fancy English guy.
But it was just pictures of bones instead of--
You know, it wasn't, like, real bones.
Your life is grotesque.
-Another big word.
-What are you even doing here?
Mr. Caputo wanted me to check up on the Internet issue.
Inmate...
Scar-neck, explain the problem.
It doesn't work.
There you go.
Hey, baby.
Yeah, I thought you were getting home an hour ago.
Oh, I know, the traffic was awful coming back from the store.
I think there was a wreck or something.
Anyway, how was work?
How are you?
-Vinnie?
-Look, I'm sorry.
I'm just in a mood.
Well, don't you worry.
You just sit right down.
I'm gonna give you such a nice backrub.
- Lorna...
-Lorna!
-Honey, you're so tense.
I'm reaching around and I'm feeling down your chiseled and bumpy abs.
Oh, my goodness.
I just found your cock-a-doodle-doo and it's so hard.
- Vinnie?
Hurry up!
- I'm busy!
All right?
Lorna, I can't really do this today, okay?
Well, can you at least try?
No, my roommates!
It's awkward.
Well, I'm talking about kissing crotches in front of 50 other women, but for you, it's awkward?
I don't know, I thought you were into that.
Well, uh...
Maybe you could feel that way about your roommates.
Don't say that.
Well, do you have a speaker?
Put me on speaker, baby.
I'll talk so nice for you and the boys.
Vinnie, are you gonna help him with his homework?
Lorna, my roommates are my parents and my kid brother.
What?
All right?
There, now you know.
Well, why didn't you say that before?
I mean, what kind of fantasy is that gonna be?
You thought you married a man, not a boy.
Look, I gotta go, all right?
Gino's back from school.
I gotta help him with his homework.
Okay.
I think he shares a room with his kid brother.
Does that mean no more phone-boning in front of everybody?
Because, legit, that shit was kind of gross.
But also hot.
I'm having mixed emotions right now.
Yeah, me, too.
She's taking all the green beans.
I asked her not to!
Nicely, even!
Ignored.
And her flunkeys, always lurking around now.
-Look!
-I'm looking.
In Russia, we have a saying...
"Don't open your mouth to eat other people's bread."
Or what?
Ask the Germans in wintertime.
-Uh, Miss Judy?
-Uh-huh.
Uh, I was wondering if you would sign my cookbook.
Of course.
That's so nice.
Um...
I'll buy one and bring it to you when we both get out.
All right, well, we have a date, then.
Now, thank you, ladies.
Bye-bye for now.
All right.
Mmm.
Hey, there, Judy King.
Oh, guilty as charged, in all respects.
That's a joke, darlin'.
Oh!
You know, a lot of people in here are funny without meaning to be.
I learned the hard way to hold my mirth.
Oh, well, let your mirth fly free.
I mean to be funny.
All right.
Um... actually, I was wondering if I could speak to you about my friend.
Oh, that little retarded girl?
She's actually not...
challenged at all, which is what we're supposed to say, not the R-word.
Oh, uh...
"R"s, "F"s, "L-M-N-O-P"s and "Q"s.
You know, I get in more trouble for expanding those single letter words, but never "N"s.
Despite this drawl, I'm brighter than that.
So, now, you were saying?
About your friend who is not challenged.
--Am I allowed to say "special"?
No, she's not special.
Well, she is to me.
-Mmm.
-But not euphemistically.
She's a fan and whenever she sees you, she freaks out.
You've gotta understand.
Institutional racism... traps the most vulnerable people in our society in this cycle of incarceration which, in turn, leads to a cycle of poverty.
It makes someone like you...
someone rich and powerful and white, virtually unapproachable.
All right, so now let me get this straight.
Your friend acts like a moron around me because she's black and poor?
-Is that right?
-Basically... yes.
I think her mother was a crack addict or something.
You might as well be an alien.
But you could bridge the divide.
- The way you did.
- Yeah, exactly!
All right, how about this?
Why don't you bring her over at lunch?
Okay.
It'll be like, uh...
the 1% sitting with the other 1%.
Oh, my God.
"The other 1%" is such a good hashtag.
The New Orleans police put out a call to...
-Hi!
My name is Brook...
-Look and I was wondering if--
Take your picture or smash an egg in my face, or whatever you need to do for you and your friends to get your jollies.
-But spare me the setup, all right?
-I don't have a setup.
You know who I am?
Yeah, I do, actually.
You're a member of the community who has as much right as any of your neighbors to be concerned about the big-box monstrosity that's being proposed for the corner of Exposition and Euclid.
I'd be happy to talk about it with you, if you have the time.
Look, I'm watching this Hurricane Katrina stuff.
It's really intense.
The world's gonna be lousy with Katrinas if we let mega-corporations like Walmart carbon-bomb our planet.
You wanna come in?
Sure.
Yeah, I'll give you the whole shpiel.
Spiel.
Sorry, I never know how to pronounce that.
Wait, um... how old are you?
Nineteen.
Okay.
Come in.
...aspect of this terrible hurricane that came on land with 145 mile-an-hour...
Okay.
I don't know if you realize, but the introduction of mega-retailers, like Walmart, almost invariably have a negative effect on property values--
-You're so nervous.
-I'm not nervous.
I'm passionate about saving local businesses.
Like Lola's Bloomers.
-May I?
-Sure.
Sure.
Conservative estimates are that there will be thousands of more cars in the neighborhood per day because of the construction--
It says you wanna put a park in instead.
I can't live within 2,500 feet of a park.
They would literally kick me out of my own home.
Sorry.
Can I talk about the elephant in the room for a second?
I wish you wouldn't.
I look across from me and I don't see a monster.
I see a human being fighting to control the animalistic parts of his brain, true grit overcoming impulse.
Not everybody judges you.
What if I told you it was kiddie porn?
I'd... say you need support, and I'd applaud your restraint for finding an outlet for your compulsions.
Wow!
You will really say whatever it takes.
Well, it was a lot worse than kiddie porn.
Wanna see?
No, I don't...
I don't need...
No.
No need.
Um...
Wait, all you did was have sex on the beach?
Consenting adults on an empty beach.
Well, except for the creeper that filmed it and turned us in to the cops.
-But you think that pervo got in trouble?
-That is insane.
I mean...
You are such a cautionary tale.
I would be, if people got the story right.
But once I had to go around door-to-door announcing my status, the rumors got started...
I don't know.
It's all so fucked.
Here.
It's not like Walmart's gonna lose.
Awesome.
- Oh...
Uh...
Warden Caputo's office.
This is Ms. Jefferson speaking, how may I assist you?
Is Warden Caputo available?
Let me place you on a brief hold while I go and check.
Fuck.
Oh, well, you gonna call back.
Hello?
I'm still here.
Damn, you are still there.
Then why the little light go out?
Anyway, don't matter, I ain't got him right now.
Will you please let him know I called?
All right, you take good care now.
- Yeah.
Shit.
What?
What happened?
I didn't quite get his name.
You don't know who it was?
Well, it was some brother, sounded like a salesman-type, if you ask me.
So I probably did you a favor there.
Oh!
And then some white lady, she called about a get-together.
Mmm-hmm.
It happened twice?
Jesus, Jefferson, what am I paying you for?
Are you sure she said "get-together"?
What does that even mean?
Like...
like, a meeting?
Like a meeting.
Or...
like a date, maybe.
You holding out on me?
You somebody's Ca-baby-boo-to?
You're on thin fucking ice, Jefferson.
Was it Linda?
Possibly.
It wasn't Natalie, was it?
Linda sounds more right.
Okay.
Get Linda from MCC on the line.
All right.
Press the button that says "Line one."
-One.
-Nine and the number.
Nine...
Got you.
--Uh, hello?
Yes, hello.
I have Director Caputo.
I will transfer you now.
Shit!
Warden Caputo's office.
Jefferson, I got it.
My bad!
My bad!
- Hello, uh, Joe?
- Linda, hi.
Uh...
Jefferson, hang up your line.
I don't wanna disconnect y'all.
Hang up the phone!
Uh, I'm still training her.
Uh, I got your message about a get-together.
Oh, uh...
wrong Linda, I think.
--But we do need to celebrate our victory.
All these veterans becoming guards.
Yes.
Yes, we absolutely do.
Any chance you're free tonight?
Tonight?
Yes, it's perfect.
Um...
We can celebrate and, uh, talk business.
- How about La Fontana's at 8:00?
- Yeah, great.
-Great.
I'll see you tonight.
-Okay, bye.
Ah!
Even the staff waits for the bathroom now, hmm?
What can I do for you, Red?
I want to talk to you about the King woman.
You two are hitting it off, right?
You gave her the run of my garden.
How did you think that would go?
You know, planting a flag on the Moon doesn't mean that you own it.
You're Russian.
I thought you'd appreciate that attitude.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm only concerned for her.
Respect in prison has to be earned.
I don't know about that.
You've received a lot of leeway from staff around here.
You seem to be doing all right.
Was that what this is about?
Are you punishing me?
Did you do something wrong?
I did the only reasonable thing I could.
There's no such thing as a consensual relationship between a prisoner and a guard.
Lorna's wedding was a bittersweet end to a relationship that never actually happened, Sam.
--You're reading something into this that isn't there, Reznikov.
And what goes on with Mrs. King is none of your business.
You're pampering her.
Oops!
She even gets a magazine?
What do you want, Ruiz?
I heard about your labor dispute.
I thought maybe my friends could fill in?
This is Pidge.
You know Ouija, or she knows you.
And that's Zirconia.
Zirconia?
I took out all my rocks before I come in, so nobody would think they was diamonds and rip 'em out.
Plus...
I don't think it's allowed.
They're all ready and willing to join your panty party.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Privately, please.
What are you doing?
This is not a publicly traded company.
Its very existence depends on keeping its existence hidden.
Chill the fuck out.
I was just trying to help you.
I don't need your help.
What I need is your discretion, and you bringing a bunch of thugs into my house is the opposite of that.
I decide who knows about Felonious Spunk.
I decide who gets hired.
I am the prison pussy panty business.
Somebody's getting a little big for her panties, I think.
I'm gonna choose to assume you're talking about yourself and take that as an apology.
You're talking shit out a paper asshole, Chapman.
But when an actual hard-ass bitch decides to call you on it... well...
Pretty sure she was talking about herself on that last one.
It's not fair.
It is the most unfair thing that's ever happened in this prison.
Mmm, what about when Carson went to SHU for sneezing too loud?
Or what's-her-face, the Puerto Rican girl, with the gimpy eye?
And when she got the wrong meds by accident in the med line and went nutso, and gimped her other eye with a spork.
Now, she double gimp-eyed.
Or how 'bout when Pornstache used to make the meth heads blow him for drugs in the mop closet?
Or the time Chapman got furlough?
I retract and redact.
New statement.
It's easily the top 138 most unfair things that has ever happened here.
What is?
Your new job.
My job is the bomb!
You sit at a desk all day when you were plucked from the most rewarding job.
I'm not saying it's on par with all the human rights abuses in here, but women fought for a long time to shake the role of desk-ridden secretary.
Are you for real?
- Hey!
Do you get the Internet?
-Do you have a mini-fridge?
-Ah!
Do you have a skeleton key made from real human bone that opens a door to a world of talking animals?
Man, I got me a clipboard and a personal relationship with Mr. Caputo.
Man, if George R. R. Martin wrote about prisons,
I'd be, like...
the Hand of the Warden.
Yo, don't the Hand always die in them books?
Man, whatever, okay?
Winter is coming, bitches.
And I'm getting me a watch.
-For real?
-Yes.
Hey.
Yo...
I feel like she's smiling and waving at me.
Maybe she can see dead people and there's one standing right... right in front of you.
Are the hairs standing up on the back of your neck?
I feel like I'm the dead person.
I... may have set you up on a blind friend date!
-Wait, you did what?
No!
-Surprise!
- What?
- I just talked you up.
-Go!
Be yourself.
-Yo...
-Go, P!
-Go, P!
Go, P!
-Let me fix your clothes.
-Get off me!
Hey.
You must be Poo-see.
She called her Poo-see!
No, I'm sorry.
Did I say that right?
Yeah, yeah.
Poussey, it's French.
Oh, French.
I was named after a great aunt who hid pearls from the Yankees under her pendulous breasts.
And she also brewed a famous home remedy that supposedly cured hookworm.
-Not quite so exotic.
-Listen.
-Hmm.
-I...
I feel...
I feel like I need to apologize...
-Uh-uh.
-...for just being all, like, weird and stuff, you know, I just...
- I dig your whole thing, you know.
And I just, I watch your show so much, so seeing you in person was just, you know, I got all tongue-tied, and fan-girly and stuff.
So I'd try to say words, but when they came out of my mouth, it just sound like...
All right, all right, all right.
Relax, darlin'.
Your friend has told me the whole story.
She has got you covered.
You gotta sink a hook in the keepers, especially in this place.
-Uh-huh.
-You know, it's funny.
Me and Brook, we never would've crossed paths.
I mean, growing up all over the world, bouncing culture to culture with a strict, conservative family, versus, you know, sleeping in tent cities with a bunch of dirty hippies, eating food out of dumpsters.
Oof!
You have been through a lot.
Nah, it was...
I mean, it was good.
Well, I mean, it was hard, you know?
Like, I guess being transient, and not really having any long-term friends, but I do know three languages.
Hmm!
Wait...
- you know three languages?
- Yeah.
How does the child of a crack whore learn three languages?
-That is remarkable.
-Excuse me?
What languages?
English, French and German.
Did you just call my mother a crack whore?
My mother had a masters in Art History and she could barely take an aspirin.
-Excuse me?
-My dad is a major in the army.
I was supposed to go to West Point.
I guess you were expecting just another ghetto prison rat.
At least one of us lives up to the stereotype.
What, no!
Sweetheart, no!
You have snatched the taste right out of my mouth.
I'm just parroting what your girlfriend told me about you.
You came out of a cycle of poverty, blah, blah, blah.
I mean, it seems to me that you two formed this relationship without talking much.
Did you know I am learning Italian?
So, did Chester the Molester sign?
You owe me 50 bucks.
-Whoa.
-And you better take me out.
I can't believe you had the balls to do it.
Whatever, he probably finger-banged his 15-year-old girlfriend when he was 17 or something else no big.
The sex offender lists are full of sob stories about people's lives being ruined by technicalities.
You know, as a matter of fact, he was a fucking horrible child-molester rapist.
Because I'm so sure he told you that.
Yeah, 'cause he...
He fucking tried to seduce me.
He invited me in for lemonade.
-And you went in?
-Yeah.
He told me I didn't look 19.
That's when I knew I was in trouble.
Shit.
He stroked my hair.
He wanted to brag, so he showed me the newspaper article about how he stalked this nine-year-old girl from his church, for, like, a year.
Earning her trust, gradually convincing her to...
Well, to...
To...
And then I was running down the street.
For your fucking bet, Ethan.
For 50 fucking dollars.
But also because I... because I wanted to go out with you.
I really appreciate you coming all the way down from Utica.
Sorry, again, I couldn't get a seat in one of the gondolas.
No, no, it's okay.
This is great.
I'm really glad that you thought I called.
These new guards, they're a... they're a big win for us.
Like, "us" us.
And the company, but especially "us" us.
Yeah.
We're not a bad team, Linda from Purchasing.

What?
The bald guy... is, uh... one of our former guards.
A really good guy.
Donaldson.
A good guy...
who walked out in the middle of an inmate transfer/high-profile self-surrender?
Yeah, I get your point.
Don't beat yourself up, Joe.
You handled that situation like a total boss.
Meant both literally and in that hip-kid lingo way.
Jesus!
He's not even a fucking waiter.
- He's a busboy.
-What?
-No, just... you could've lost your job... or faced prosecution had inmates gone missing that day.
I mean, you're concerned about...
these jerks that hung you out to dry.
You're quite a guy, Joe Caputo.
There you go, sir.
Whenever you're ready.
- Uh, do me a favor, will you?
- Mmm-hmm.
-The change is yours.
-Okay.
Give a 20 to that busboy over there.
Wait till we're gone.
I don't want to make a thing of it, okay?
Okay.
Hey, Mr. Caputo!
-Look, Donaldson--
-I don't need your money, Mr. Caputo.
It's nothing, take it, it's--
Nah, this is not to help me.
This is to make you feel better about that... pardon my French, miss, bullshit you pulled.
-Okay, Joe, let's go.
-The bullshit I pulled?
I work three jobs.
This is the good one.
O'Neill?
I heard he had kidney stones.
But no health insurance.
So he thought he'd power through, wait for it to pass.
It didn't.
Now he's on dialysis.
He may lose a kidney.
-Jesus.
-Yeah.
So take your $20 and drown your conscience in a bottle of gin, because paying me to feel better about it ain't gonna work.
Donaldson.
You tell O'Neill I'm sorry about his stones.
I'm also sorry you gotta work here.
But I need you to understand something.
I'm sorry for you.
I don't regret firing any of you.
You walked out on the biggest day the prison's faced in 25 fuckin' years.
You put the prisoners at risk, you put your fellow cos at risk, you put this whole town in danger!
The shit hit and instead of moving the fan away, you plugged it in and you hit "oscillate."
I was gonna make you captain of the guard, Wade.
Really.
You keep the 20.
Least I could do for helping me dodge a bullet.
I'm sorry about this.
These houses are yours to live in, but they are prison property.
They will be treated with respect.
As long as they are treated with respect, you will be as well.
Okay, the warden has asked me to do a... icebreaker event.
I will demonstrate this activity with CO...
-McCullough, sir.
-Okay, McCullough.
Tell me two true things about you and one lie.
I will attempt to guess the lie.
Okay, um...
I came to say I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Okay, please don't lock me out.
You're right to be upset.
How would you know?
You don't know anything about me, Soso.
And, what, you think I'm upset about my mom's crack abuse or because I grew up poor, black and uneducated in the urban jungle?
Okay, I watched The Wire a lot.
I made assumptions.
But you spent time with me.
I mean, did you even listen when I talked?
Like, what the fuck about me, besides the color of my skin, would indicate that I'm some indigent hood rat?
- I don't know.
No, it's fine, it's cool.
I'm guilty, too.
I won't lie.
You know, I like the story of the rich, white, hippie girl in my bed.
I've been working that on my end.
I don't want this to end.
What good is coming up here and sitting in the lobby every weekend gonna do?
She wants to get Sophia out, she needs to get a lawyer or a non-profit involved or something.
Ms. Burset said that the prison has tons of lawyers, so at least coming up here and waiting for the warden to come out to get into his face is something...
Michael started a Kickstarter campaign.
Kickstarter?
What that mean?
Not much, usually.
There's nothing to be ashamed about.
Plenty of guys live with their parents.
Right, yeah, I mean, you know...
I'm just doing this to save money, you know?
'Cause I could live on my own, obviously.
Oof!
Obviously.
I mean, very, very obviously.
It just makes the most financial sense, you know?
For the both of us.
Oh!
That's my manicotti, always thinking of his little lasagna.
Hey...
I made you something.
Fresh baked.
Lorna...
No, no, no, don't say it.
You know, even though it took a lot of time, and I had to go to the store twice, you... are worth it.
Hmm.
Mmm!
-Mmm!
-It's still warm.
My favorite.
Peanut butter and MM's.
-Snickerdoodles.
-Oh!
-I love you.
-Oh!
And you should.
I am quite a catch.
Oh, my God, you are.
You so are.
Fuck.
I want you.
-Vinnie.
-I want you.
It's our living room.
The neighbors want to look in, that's their good luck.
I'm already unbuttoning my shirt.
My goodness, you know that I can't resist your muscular chest.
Oh, my God.
My hands, they're in your hair right now.
- I'm stroking it real soft.
Till I grab a handful of it and pull it back.
You're such a man.
Oh, God.
I'm licking your neck.
Kissing your ears.
My hand is on that big mountain in your pants, and I am unzipping you right now.
And I'm pulling your shirt off real slow.
No, no, no, it's a button-up.
-I unbutton it real slow.
-No, no, no, tear it off.
-Pulling it off.
It's off.
-Tear it off.
It's off, the buttons, they're everywhere.
They're everywhere.
Oh, my God, my mouth...
My mouth is on those big titties.
-My nipples are so hard right now.
-Oh, my God, my cock.
Oh, my God, my cock is really hard.
I know, baby.
No, it's really hard.
Like, right now, it's really hard.
-I know, Vinnie...
-Oh, God.
-Vinnie, put it inside me.
-Yeah?
Oh, my God, it's in you.
Oh, it's in you.
- Oh, my God, it's in you.
It feels so good.
You're so wet.
You are so wet.
I actually am.
-I'm super wet right now.
-I know.
Do it to me.
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
-Don't stop.
-I'm not stopping.
I'm not stopping.
I'm not gonna stop.
I'm not gonna stop.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, baby!
- Oh, my God!
He's humping the table.
--What the hell?
Hey!
Hey, stay right here.
Stay looking at me, all right?
Jesus Christ.
Don't think I don't see you.
Pleasure, as always.
Also, I want to talk to you about something.
If this is about last week, I don't get to control my flow.
I think it's all the stress of all these new bitches in here.
I know these last few weeks have had their challenges.
So...
I wanted to say thank you.
And keep up the good work.
Your morale is important to me.
Oh!
That's so sweet.
Ovaltine?
It's to make chocolate milk.
Pretty much only Chinese people drink it now, which is probably why it's at commissary, but it's really good.
So, it's chocolate powder for my powdered milk?
It's got vitamins.
Oh!
See?
New bitches.
Why are they always staring like they're waiting for a donkey show to start?
I don't think they're staring at you.
They were following us earlier.
And you didn't say anything?
People can stare.
-It's a free country.
-Not in prison.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
I bet your Bloody Mary gonna come early, too.
Hey.
Hey.
You okay?
- No.
You?
No.
Do you want to talk about it?
Not really.
You?
But have you ever heard the phrase "paper asshole"?
No.
Ruiz said it to me.
I think I pissed off the Dominicans.
Relax.
You run the Litchfield panty company...
not the Sinaloa drug cartel.
No one's stitching your face to a soccer ball.
See ya around, Pipes.
What's this?
It's for the eyes.
Takes the red out.
I know what it is, pendeja.
What's it doing out?
It's contraband.
Whoops!
I need to be more careful.
Yeah, you do.
A few drops of that falls into the food, and this whole prison will be shitting their brains out.
Really?
I had no idea.
She acts so tough, but to stress-eat this food?
The poor woman.
Oh, you evil, Russian bitch.
What can I say?
I do a lot with a little.
No!
No!
No!
What the fuck?
That's my toilet paper.
--Oh!
I talk a lot.
I babble... until I find something the person I'm with is interested in.
And I'll say anything I can to get them to like me.
But I... really... really like you.
The real you.
You don't know the real me.
But I want to.
So in, like, a minute, I'm gonna put down this radio, and I'm gonna listen to you tell me about yourself.
And I'm not gonna try to rewrite your story in my head.
And then, when you're done, I'd like to tell you about myself.
And some of it will be embarrassing and ugly... but mostly boring.
And then... maybe afterwards, we could, like...
quiz each other or something?
Eminem?
Yeah, it's not a presumption about you liking rap.
It's just...
AM 700 The OG is the only station that comes in clear.
Jackson, North Carolina.
Is that where you were born?
No, that's where my great-grandmother was born.
I mean, stuffed crust shoulda revolutionized pizza,
-but it was just a fad.
-Man, nah, it's the same thing.
-Man, it is not the same thing!
-All right.
'Cause that's Italian...
this is Mexican.
You got a stuffed tortilla, and you stuff that with more stuff.
--Man, it's my golden ticket, and I'm gonna do it right with that business savvy and shit.
--Hey, hey, hey!
Do you hear that?
What is that?
Wow, look at that.
That's a drone.
-It's a drone.
-Shit!
What's it doing here?
Like we some Iraqi wedding?
Man, come on.
We're gonna be late.
He was a bad man and we did good things.
He did bad things and we killed him good.
No, we did bad.
No!
We did well.
Hey.
Have you seen Whitehill?
Yeah, I forgot the garden needed turning.
If Rikerson comes back, just tell him where we went, okay?
Oh, fuck!
-No!
No!
-Lolly, Lolly.
--Listen, listen.
They know!
They know!
They found you!
We have to move the body!
Shut up.
We cannot move the body.
There's drones.
Stop it, Lolly.
We cannot move it.
If I told you I already moved it, would it calm you down?
Maybe for a minute.
Good, 'cause I did.
Now, scat.
You didn't actually move it.
Hell, no.
And I'm not about to.
We're gonna have to kill her.

How are we supposed to clean the floors with nonstop bitches tracking they shit through?
We are like he whom the gods have condemned to push the boulder up the hill, only to watch it roll back down.
Oh, right, right, right, right.
And then he has to cut his arm off to get out from underneath it.
What is that guy's name?
Oh, James Franco.
Sisyphus.
I did hear that rumor.
You know those Hollywood types.
- They will stick it in any warm hole.
- You don't have to be from Hollywood to want to put it in a warm place.
It's called having a dick.
No.
My Vinny would never.
Well, maybe not a in a man-hole, but you away a long time.
He could be getting his MM meltin' in some ho's mouth and not in his hand.
No.
No.
That's never gonna happen, because we're talking sexy on the phone like 24/7, and I mean real sexy.
And I give very good phone.
Are we talking about peanut MM's or regular?
Ooh!
Inmate Jefferson, Tasha Jefferson, report to the warden's office.
Inmate Tasha Jefferson to the warden's office.
Who's Tasha Jefferson?
Oh, Taystee?
Taystee, go to the warden's office.
We have a warden?
Your name's Tasha?
What is this about?
The main thing is answering the phones and organizational... stuff.
General assisting.
I don't know.
I've never had an assistant before.
We will figure it out together.
And you swear this is legit?
'Cause I seen "Shawshank," and I don't want to go to seg because I did your taxes too good.
I guarantee you, you will never see anything with my social security number on it.
Never say never.
You work for MCC.
Maybe one day you realize you need food stamps and you don't know how to fill out the forms.
Well, I'm your girl.
I can walk you through it.
But I'ma need them digits.
However, I'm a vault.
I don't say nothing, and I ain't never crawling through a tunnel of piss and dookie, so rest easy.
Okay.
As of now, you're off janitorial and you're with me.
Praise Jesus.
Every day, when I'm working, you're working.
Is this 'cause I won at job fair?
Sure.
I told them bitches.
Take a clipboard.
Write things down.
Look busy.
Outside.
- Alert.
Alert.
Alert.
- What?
What?
Healy's just showing her around.
Frieda's over there.
It's all good.
Why does she get some special garden tour like some fancy shiba inu?
She's a celebrity, okay?
Fucking relax.
Uh, not okay.
Not... not.
Really?
Relax?
I think you are way too relaxed to be in this big brown shit-uation that we're in.
Lolly, believe me, my insides have completely liquefied, and I want to vomit all the time.
But I have chosen to keep my voice low and appear calm.
- You have to do the same.
- I can't.
You have to.
Look at me.
You...
listen.
You have to.
Change the record in your head.
Play, "He was a bad man.
We did what we had to do, and we did it well.
So now it's through."
It's a mantra.
Say it.
We did what we had to do, and we did it well.
You forgot the "bad man" part and the end.
But that's the idea.
So, whenever you're feeling worried, whenever your thoughts start to... wander, just bring them back to the mantra.
And then come and find me, okay?
He was a bad man who did bad things well, and now he's gone.
Got it.
He was a bad man.
Now he's gone...
Now, that is one happy tomato.
I hope I do as well here.
- Hey, there's a good idea.
- Mm.
Maybe we should fertilize our women, too.
I do love your good intentions.
Hey, Judy.
Hey.
Oh.
You've got quite a following.
Yeah.
I was hoping the novelty would wear off soon.
I'll have to hide myself in that corn.
Oh!
Look how beautiful!
Help yourself.
Oh, all right.
Oh, really?
Free-for-all on the produce now, huh?
Regardless of who's in the club, who's worked the soil, pulled the weeds, tended the seedlings?
Is that the new policy?
This is Judy King.
Oh, I know who she is.
I've seen her daytime TV program.
But we haven't had the pleasure.
Mrs. King is going to be joining your club, Red, so I'll...
I'll leave you to it.
Thank you.
I'm sure you'll find a lot in common.
Hair and... accents.
You know, my daddy used to call me Red.
Oh, really?
That's sweet.
My papa called me Solnyshko.
It means "Little Sun."
But I've grown bigger and hotter since then, and he's dead.
So, what are you going to do with that ear now that you've picked it?
Well, I guess that depends on what else I can find around here.
I could do a southern fried corn, a dilled corn shooter, Taiwanese-style street corn.
Listen to fancy pants.
I could shove it up your ass.
Mm.
I'm not so big on ass play.
What do you suggest I do, Miss Red?
I'm thinking.
Can I have some seeds?
You bought Ovaltine.
Reap what you sow.
Ovaltine's got vitamins.
I'll trade you Ovaltine powder later for some seeds now.
- I'm good for it.
- No deal.
You'll regret it.
That's some malty goodness you're passing up.
Excuse me?
You knew going into this I had bad knees.
My feet are killing me.
We are putting out a vibe.
If you are sitting and or eating my seeds, no vibe.
Right now, there is no vibe.
See?
Look at this.
All of a sudden, I'm approachable.
Picking up or dropping off?
Neither.
We're out.
I gave you guys new ones yesterday.
We're hanging up our lacy intimates.
If this is because of the money Stella took, I'm good for it.
I'll pay you back.
It's not worth it anymore.
We're smelling the beginning of the end.
You and all your posturing, shipping the kangaroo down the hill.
It's starting to feel dangerous.
You've even got a heavy on the payroll.
I see what you did there.
- Heavy.
- Not on purpose.
Fine.
Jump ship like rats.
And I'm not talking about the Disney/Pixar kind.
I was gonna fire one of you anyway, but I'm not gonna say which one.
Chew on that.
We're gonna take a walk on the track.
You want to join us, kahuna?
No, she does not.
She's got bad knees.
Enjoy sweating for free.
I expect all my undies still in your possession returned post-haste.
Post-haste?
Aznuts.
Do you have something to say?
Sure.
But I'll wait till I'm with my friends.
Off the backboard.
Oh.
Aww, man!
Short, black, and bad at basketball.
Subverting expectations since 1990.
Aww, it's okay.
Litchfield's latest lesbos.
In fun-size.
Look, how much longer do you think the world's longest game of horse is gonna go on?
She ain't a lesbian.
I see.
Testing the waters before diving in face-first?
I'm attracted to people, not genders.
Well, aren't you special.
Tell you what.
Why don't you use some of that sexual fluidity to slide off the court so the real men can play?
Come on.
Even though I do think labeling is a total sham,
I see the power in reclaiming an epithet, like you guys have with "nigga."
Okay.
Maybe not that, exactly.
But I really like you.
Like, really, a lot, and I just...
I want to honor your feelings, you know?
If you want to call this something, like, we're girlfriend-girlfriend or...
lezzy togezzy.
I don't know.
How about we say we're happy?
Yeah?
Leave it at that?
Okay.
Oh, shit.
Hey, hi!
Hi!
Judy.
I'm... hey, girl.
Ju...
You're... you're
It is so cute how moony you get every time she's around.
And by cute, you mean lame as fuck?
Well, yeah.
You need to pull it together.
I mean, she's a person you admire,
- but she's still just a person.
- A person.
Right.
You should be able to have a conversation with anyone.
Hi.
I'm Brook.
I'm your neighbor.
I was wondering if you'd heard about the plans to build a Walmart at the corner of Exposition and Euclid.
Yeah, I heard about it.
Well, I'm one of a group of citizens trying to convince the city council to turn that lot into a park space instead.
I was wondering if you'd be willing to have a friendly discussion or maybe even sign our petition?
Sure.
If you take your top off.
Okay, that is inappropriate.
Yes.
Inappropriate things do happen out there.
How would you handle it?
You really think a grown man is gonna ask me to take my top off?
Well, there's a sex offender at, uh, 3134 10th street.
He might.
No.
You do not have to go to the sex offender's house.
No one has to knock on any door that makes him or her feel uncomfortable, but I do urge you all to be bold and stretch yourself.
By the way, has everyone signed their liability waivers?
Oh, shit.
I hear he likes little boys.
Little boy, Asian girl.
Are they really that far apart?
You said our breakup was going to be amicable.
Yeah, I said a lot of things.
So did you, like, "I love you.
I'll always love you.
This is not because of Oren."
Wait.
What?
She dumped me to get with you.
- I'm not sweet enough arm candy.
- Oh, my god!
Uh, could you kids drop the soap opera for another time?
We're going out there this afternoon...
Need to feel like you're prepared.
Well, clearly she's not.
She can't even handle, "take your top off."
Okay.
Fifty bucks says I get more signatures than you, Ethan.
No bet.
People will sign just to shut you up.
But here's a bet.
Get the pedo to sign, I'll give you your 50 bucks.
Oren will go on a date with you.
- Cool?
- Uh, I'm not really in...
Okay.
You are so on.
He will sign and you will give me cash and I will spend it on a new hemp messenger bag and strawberry lube because Oren seems like a strawberry kind of guy.
- Well, um...
- Great.
Now, let's talk one more time about mirroring body language.
I'm just saying...
if you bought me a watch,
I'd be on the time better.
- The clock on the wall.
- Not in my office.
I'll put a clock in your office.
Or you could buy me a watch so when we out of the office, like now, I could tell you things like, "Hey, Mr. Caputo, we only a few minutes late to meet Piscatella,
and you the boss, anyhow, so relax."
I will consider your watch request.
Hey, I'm just trying to make your life better.
This ain't about me.
By the way, what you want me to do once we there?
- Take notes.
- Hold up.
Hold up.
Take... notes.
Got you.
Damn.
This place is like "Rehab Addict, Litchfield Edition."
and with, like, real addicts.
So, in a nutshell, uh, electrical is still having internet issues.
Plumbing works, but no hot water yet.
All beds and extraneous furniture are assembled and ready for move-in.
Now, the, uh, interior paint... uh, inmate, what are you possibly writing that will have any salience past this moment in time?
Well, Mr. Caputo wants notes.
Now, I don't know what salience is, but I think a checklist of what's completed and what's not is hella revelant.
You mean "rel"... relevant.
I mean I'm trying to do my job, same as you, big man.
Are you... suggesting that we are, in any way, on any planet, in any universe the same, inmate?
Why don't you go check on Luschek and the internet situation?
What?
Let me watch you go.
Oh, you gonna watch me, watch me?
I will watch you.
Go.
Oh, I'm going.
It's clearly that... time.
Look at me go.
Go.
- May I ask you a question, Mr. Caputo?
- Shoot.
How did you choose her to be your assistant, exactly?
- Between you and me...
- Yes, sir?
She's the only semi-intelligent one that I'm only semi-attracted to.
Well, if you'll follow me, I'll show you the bathroom.
What are you writing?
Man, why everybody acting like they ain't never seen a black woman with a clipboard before?
No.
It's your pen.
It's exorbitantly scratchy, and it's giving me anxiety.
Damn, word-a-day.
I need to get me one of them calendars.
Anxiety wasn't from the calendar.
That's just me.
But... exorbitant was.
Check out these fat phone cords.
Shit, I can make so many bracelets out the wires in one of these.
Unh-Unh.
Those ain't phone cords.
They're for the internet.
And believe me, you want some of them guards to be able to watch they porn and get it all out before they on duty, so you best leave it.
So, hey, how come you don't get to live here, Luschek?
- Because I have a home, inmate.
- Yeah?
- An entire basement to myself.
- Mm.
You got to admit, though, it is kind of swanky.
You know, I mean, you could fit an entire family just right in here and still have room for a TV, a couple pictures of X-Rays...
home, sweet home.
Did you just say X-rays?
I did say X-rays, 'cause when my grandmammy broke her pelvis, all of us kids got X-rays 'cause the doctor was really nice and my mom was doing him on the side.
That's funny, huh?
He literally took an entire X-Ray of my whole skeleton.
And I hung it up on my wall like a fancy English guy.
But it was just pictures of bones instead of, you know, like, real bones.
Your life is grotesque.
- 'Nother big word.
- What are you even doing here?
Mr. Caputo wanted me to check up on the internet issue.
Inmate...
Scar-Neck, explain the problem.
It doesn't work.
There you go.
Hey, baby.
Yeah.
I thought you were getting home an hour ago.
Oh, I know.
The traffic... it was awful coming back from the store.
I...
I think there was a wreck or something.
Anyway, how was work?
How are you?
Vinny?
Look.
I'm sorry.
I'm just in a mood.
Well, don't you worry.
You just sit right there, and I'm gonna give you such a nice back rub.
- Lorna...
- Mm.
Ooh.
- Lorna.
- Honey, you're so tense.
I'm reaching around and I'm feeling down your chiseled and bumpy abs.
Oh, my goodness.
I just found your cock-a-doodle-doo, and it's so hard.
Vinny!
Hurry up!
I'm busy!
All right?
!
Lorna, I can't really do this today, okay?
Wh...
Can you at least try?
No.
My roommates... it's awkward.
Well, I'm talking about kissing crotches in front of 50 other women, but for you, it's awkward?
I don't know.
I thought you were into that.
Well, I... maybe you could feel that way about your roommates.
Don't say that.
Well, do you have a speaker?
Put me on speaker, baby.
I'll talk so nice for you and the boys.
Vinny, are you gonna help him with his homework?
Lorna, my roommates are my parents and my kid brother.
What?
All right?
There.
Now you know.
Well, why didn't you say that before?
I mean, what kind of fantasy is that gonna be?
You thought... you thought you married a man, not a boy.
Look, I got to go, all right?
Gino's back from school, and I'm gonna help him with his homework.
Okay.
I think he shares a room with his kid brother.
Does that mean no more phone-boning in front of everybody?
Because, legit, that shit was kind of gross.
But also hot.
I'm having mixed emotions right now.
Yeah.
Me, too.
She's talking all the green beans.
I asked her not to.
Nicely, even.
Ignored.
And her flunkies...
Always lurking around now.
Look!
I'm looking.
In Russia, we have a saying.
Na chuzhoy karavay rot ne razevay.
"Don't open your mouth to eat other people's bread."
Or what?
Ask the Germans in wintertime.
- Uh, Miss Judy?
- Uh-huh.
I...
I was wondering if you would sign my cookbook.
- Of course.
- That's so nice.
Um, I'll buy one and bring it to you when we both get out.
All right.
Well, we have a date, then.
Now, thank you, ladies.
Bye-bye for now.
Mmm.
Hey, there.
Judy King.
Oh, guilty as charged, in all respects.
That's a joke, darling.
Oh.
You know, a lot of people in here are funny without meaning to be.
I learned the hard way to hold my mirth.
Oh, well, let your mirth fly free.
I mean to be funny.
All right.
Um, actually, I was wondering if I could speak to you about my friend.
Oh, that little retarded girl.
She's actually not... challenged at all, which is what we're supposed to say, not the "r" word.
Oh, uh, "R's." "F's," "L-M-N-O-P's" and "Q's."
You know, I get in more trouble for expanding those single-letter words, but never "n's." Despite this drawl, I'm brighter than that.
So, now, you were saying about your friend who is not challenged.
Am I allowed to say "special?"
No, she's not special.
- Well, she is to me.
- Mm-Hmm.
But not euphemistically.
She's a fan, and whenever she sees you, she freaks out.
You've got to understand.
Institutional racism traps the most vulnerable people in our society in this cycle of incarceration, which, in turn, leads to a cycle of poverty.
It makes someone like you, someone rich and powerful and white, virtually unapproachable.
All right.
So, now, let me get this straight.
Your friend acts like a moron around me because she's black and poor?
- Is that right?
- Basically.
- Mm.
- Yes.
I think her mother was a crack addict or something.
You might as well be an alien.
But...
But you could bridge the divide.
The way you did.
Yeah.
Exactly.
How about this;
why don't you bring her over at lunch?
Okay.
It'll be like, um, the one percent sitting with the other one percent.
Oh, my god.
"The other one percent" is such a good hashtag.
The New Orleans police put out a call to...
Hi.
My name is Brook.
- Look...
- And I was wondering if... take your picture or smash an egg in my face or whatever you need to do for you and your friends to get your jollies.
- But spare me the setup, all right?
- I don't have a setup.
You know who I am?
Yeah, I do, actually.
...we are flying... you're a member of the community who has as much right as any of your neighbors to be concerned about the big-box monstrosity that's being proposed for the corner of Exposition and Euclid.
I'd be happy to talk about it with you if you have the time.
Look, I'm watching this Hurricane Katrina stuff.
It's really intense.
The world's gonna be lousy with Katrinas if we let mega-corporations like Walmart carbon-bomb our planet.
You want to come in?
Sure.
Yeah, I'll give you the...
the whole shpiel.
Spiel.
Uh, sorry.
I never know how to pronounce that.
Uh, wait.
Um...
How old are you?
Nineteen.
Okay.
Come in.
...this terrible hurricane that came on land with 145-mile-an-hour...
Okay.
I don't know if you realize, but the introduction of mega-retailers like Walmart almost invariably have a negative effect
- on property values...
- You're so nervous.
I'm not nervous.
I'm passionate about saving local businesses like Lola's Bloomers.
May I?
Sure.
Sure.
Conservative estimates are that there will be thousands of more cars in the neighborhood per day because of the construction...
It says you want to put a park in instead.
I can't live within 2,500 feet of a park.
They would literally kick me out of my own home.
Sorry.
Can I talk about the elephant in the room for a second?
I wish you wouldn't.
I look across from me, and I don't see a monster.
I see a human being fighting to control the animalistic parts of his brain, true grit overcoming impulse.
Not everybody judges you.
What if I told you it was kiddie porn?
I'd... say you need support, and I'd applaud your restraint for finding an outlet for your compulsions.
Wow.
You will really say whatever it takes.
Well, it was a lot worse than kiddie porn.
Want to see?
No, I don't...
I don't need... no.
No need.
Um...
Wait.
All you did was have sex on the beach?
Consenting adults on an empty beach.
Well, except for the creeper that filmed it and turned us in to the cops.
- But you think that pervo got in trouble?
- That is insane.
I mean, you are such a cautionary tale.
I would be if people got the story right.
But once I had to go around, door-to-door, announcing my status, the rumors got started.
I don't know.
It's all so fucked.
Here.
It's not like Walmart's gonna lose.
Awesome.
Oh... um...
Uh Warden Caputo's office.
This is Ms. Jefferson speaking.
How may I assist you?
Is Warden Caputo available?
Uh, let me place you on a brief hold while I go and check.
Fuck.
- Oh, well, you gonna call back.
- Hello?
I'm still here.
Damn, you are still there.
Then why the little light go out?
Anyway, don't matter.
I ain't got him right now.
Will you please let him know I called.
- All right.
You take good care now.
- Yeah...
Shit.
What?
What happened?
I didn't quite get his name.
You don't know who it was?
Well, it was some brother.
Sounded like a salesman type, if you ask me, so I probably did you a favor there.
Oh, and then some white lady...
she called about a get-together.
Mm-hmm.
It happened twice?
Jesus, Jefferson, what am I paying you for?
Are you sure she said "get-together?"
what does that even mean?
Like...
like a meeting?
Like a meeting.
Or...
like a date, maybe.
You holding out on me?
You somebody's Ca-baby-boo-to?
You're on thin fucking ice, Jefferson.
Was it Linda?
Possibly.
It wasn't Natalie, was it?
Linda sounds more right.
Okay.
Get Linda from MCC on the line.
All right.
- Press the button that says "Line 1."
- One.
- "9" and the number.
- Got you.
Uh, hello?
Yes, hello.
I have Director Caputo.
I will transfer you now.
Shit!
- Warden Caputo's office.
- Uh, Jefferson, I got it.
My bad!
My bad!
Hello, uh, Joe?
Uh, Linda.
Hi.
Uh...
Jefferson, hang up your line.
- I don't want to disconnect y'all.
- Hang up the phone!
Uh, I'm still training her.
Uh, I...
I got your message about a get-together.
Oh, uh, wrong Linda, I think.
But we do need to celebrate our victory...
All these veterans becoming guards.
Yes.
Yes, we absolutely do.
Any chance you're free tonight?
Tonight?
Ye... yes.
It's perfect.
Um... we can celebrate and, uh, talk business?
Uh, how about... how about La Fontana's at 8:00?
Yeah.
Great.
Great.
I...
I'll see you tonight.
Okay.
Bye.
Huh.
Even the staff waits for the bathroom now, hmm?
What can I do for you, Red?
I want to talk to you about the King woman.
You two are hitting it off, right?
You gave her the run of my garden.
How did you think that would go?
You know, planting a flag on the moon doesn't mean that you own it.
You're Russian.
I thought you'd appreciate that attitude.
Oh.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm only concerned for her.
Respect in prison has to be earned.
I don't know about that.
You've received a lot of leeway from staff around here.
You seem to be doing all right.
Oh, is that what this is about?
Are you punishing me?
Did you do something wrong?
I did the only reasonable thing I could.
There's no such thing as a consensual relationship between a prisoner and a guard.
Lorna's wedding was a bittersweet end to a relationship that never actually happened, Sam.
You're reading something into this that isn't there, Reznikov.
And what goes on with Mrs. King is none of your business.
You're pampering her.
Oops.
She even gets a magazine?
!
What do you want, Ruiz?
I heard about your labor dispute.
I thought maybe my friends could fill in.
This is Pidge.
You know Ouija, or she knows you.
And that's Zirconia.
Zirconia?
I took out all my rocks before I come in so nobody would think they was diamonds and rip 'em out.
Plus...
I don't think it's allowed.
They're all ready and willing to join your panty party.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Privately, please.
What are you doing?
This is not a publicly traded company.
Its very existence depends on keeping its existence hidden.
Chill the fuck out.
I was just trying to help you.
I don't need your help.
What I need is your discretion, and you bringing a bunch of thugs into my house is the opposite of that.
I decide who knows about Felonious Spunk.
I decide who gets hired.
I am the prison pussy panty business.
Somebody's getting a little big for her panties, I think.
I'm gonna choose to assume you're talking about yourself and take that as an apology.
You're talking shit out a paper asshole, Chapman.
But when an actual hard-ass bitch decides to call you on it,
Well...
Pretty sure she was talking about herself on that last one.
It's not fair.
It is the most unfair thing that's ever happened in this prison.
Mm, what about when Carson went to SHU for sneezing too loud?
Or what's-her-face, the Puerto Rican girl with the gimpy eye, and when she got the wrong meds by accident in the med line and went nutso and gimped her other eye with a spork, and now she double gimp-eyed.
Or how about when pornstache used to make the methheads blow him for drugs in the mop closet?
Or the time Chapman got furlough?
I retract and redact.
New statement.
It's easily the top 138 most unfair things that has ever happened here.
- What is?
- Your new job.
My job is the bomb.
You sit at a desk all day when you were plucked from the most rewarding job.
I'm not saying it's on par with all the human rights abuses in here, but women fought for a long time to shake the role of desk-ridden secretary.
Are you for real?
Do you get the internet?
- Do you have a mini-fridge?
- Ah!
Do you have a skeleton key made from real human bone that opens a door to a world of talking animals?
Man, I got me a clipboard.
And a personal relationship with Mr. Caputo.
Man, if George R.R. Martin wrote about prisons,
I'd be, like, the Hand of the Warden.
Don't the hand always die in them books?
- Ooh.
- Man, whatever, okay?
Winter is coming, bitches, and I'm getting me a watch.
- For real?
- Yes!
Look.
I feel like she's smiling and waving at me.
Maybe she can see dead people, and there's one standing right... right in front of you.
Are the hairs standing up on the back of your neck?
I feel like I'm the dead person.
I... may have set you up on a blind friend date.
Surprise!
I just talked you up.
Go.
Be yourself.
- Go, P.
- Go, P.
- Let me fix your clothes.
- Get off me!
Hey.
You must be Poo-see.
She called her Poo-see.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
Did I say that wrong?
Yeah, yeah, uh, Poussey.
It's French.
Oh, French.
I was named after a great aunt who hid pearls from the yankees under her pendulous breasts.
Oh, and she also brewed a famous home remedy that supposedly cured hookworm.
Not quite so exotic.
Listen, I...
I...
I feel like I need to apologize
- for just being all, like, weird and stuff.
- Uh-uh.
You know, I just...
I dig your whole thing, you know?
And I just...
I watch your show so much, so seeing you in person was just... you know, I got all tongue-tied and fangirl-y and stuff.
So I'd try to say words, but when they came out my mouth, they just sound like blah, blah...
All right.
All right.
Relax, darling.
Your friend has told me the whole story.
She has got you covered.
You got to sink a hook in the keepers, especially in this place.
- Uh-huh.
- You know, it's funny.
Me and Brook... we never would have crossed paths.
I mean, growing up all over the world, bouncing culture to culture with a strict, conservative family versus, you know, sleeping in tent cities with a bunch of dirty hippies, eating food out of dumpsters.
Ooph.
You have been through a lot.
Uh, no, I was...
I mean, it was good.
Well, I mean, it was hard, you know, like, I guess being transient and, uh, you know, not really having any long-term friends, but I do know three languages.
Mm.
Wait.
You know three languages?
How does the child of a crack whore learn three languages?
That is remarkable.
- Excuse me?
- What languages?
English, French, and German.
Did you just call my mother a crack whore?
My mother had a Masters in Art History, and she could barely take an aspirin.
- Excuse me?
- My dad is a major in the army.
I was supposed to go to West Point.
Guess you were expecting just another ghetto prison rat.
Well, at least one of us lives up to the stereotype.
What?
No.
Sweetheart, no.
You have snatched the taste right out of my mouth.
I'm just parroting what your girlfriend told me about you.
You came out of a cycle of poverty, blah, blah, blah.
I mean, it seems to me that you two have formed this relationship without talking much.
Did you know I am learning Italian?
So, did Chester the Molester sign?
You owe me 50 bucks.
Whoa.
And you better take me out.
I can't believe you had the balls to do it.
Whatever.
He probably finger-banged his 15-year-old girlfriend when he was 17 or something else... no big.
The sex offender lists are full of sob stories about people's lives being ruined by technicalities.
You know, as a matter of fact, he was a fucking horrible child-molester rapist.
'Cause I'm so sure he told you that.
Yeah. 'cause he... he fucking tried to seduce me.
He invited me in for lemonade.
And you went in?
Yeah.
Told me I didn't look 19.
That's when I knew I was in trouble.
Shit.
He stroked my hair.
He wanted to brag, so he showed me the newspaper article about how he stalked this 9-year-old girl from his church for like a year, earning her trust, gradually convincing her to... well, to... to...
Then I was running down the street.
For your fucking bet, Ethan.
For 50 fucking dollars.
But also 'cause I...
Because I wanted to go out with you.
I really appreciate you coming all the way down from Utica.
Sorry again I couldn't get a seat in one of the gondolas.
No, no.
It's... it's okay.
This is great.
I'm really glad that you thought I called.
These new guards... they're a... they're a big win for us...
like, us, us.
And the company, but especially us, us.
Yeah.
We're not a bad team, Linda from purchasing.
To us, Joe from Litchfield human activity, and our continued wins.
- And to the veterans, of course.
- Of course.
♪ Happy Birthday, clappy ♪
♪ Join us as we celebrate ♪
♪ Clap your hands and dance around ♪
♪ Have a laugh and eat some cake ♪
♪ Happy Birthday Happy Birthday ♪
♪ Happy Birthday you're so great ♪
Whoo!
Shit.
What?
The bald guy is, uh, one of our former guards.
A really good guy.
Donaldson.
A good guy?
Who walked out in the middle of an inmate-transfer-slash-high-profile self-surrender?
Yeah.
I get your point.
Don't beat yourself up, Joe.
You handled that situation like a total boss, meant both literally and in that hip-kid lingo way.
Jesus.
He's not even a fucking waiter.
He's a busboy.
What?
Just...
you could have lost your job or faced prosecution, had inmates gone missing that day.
I mean, you're concerned about these jerks that hung you out to dry.
You're quite a guy, Joe Caputo.
There you go, Sir.
Whenever you're ready.
- Uh, do me a favor, will you?
- Mm-hmm.
- The change is yours.
- Okay.
Give a $20 to that busboy over there.
Wait till we're gone.
I don't want to make a thing of it, okay?
Okay.
Hey, Mr. Caputo!
- Look, Donaldson...
- I don't need your money, Mr. Caputo.
- It's nothing.
Take it.
It's...
- No, this is not to help me.
This is to make you feel better about that... pardon my French, Miss...
Bullshit you pulled.
- Okay, Joe.
Let's go.
- Bullshit I pulled?
I work three jobs.
This is the good one.
O'neill...
I heard he had kidney stones.
But no health insurance, so he thought he'd power through, wait for it to pass.
It didn't.
Now he's on dialysis.
He may lose a kidney.
- Jesus.
- Yeah.
So, take your $20 and drown your conscience in a bottle of gin because paying me to feel better about it ain't gonna work.
Donaldson.
You tell O'neill I'm sorry about his stones.
I'm also sorry you got to work here, but I need you to understand something.
I'm sorry for you.
I don't regret firing any of you.
You walked out on the biggest day the prison's faced in 25 fucking years.
You put the prisoners at risk, you put your fellow C.O.'s at risk, you put this whole town in danger.
The shit hit, and instead of moving the fan away, you... you... you plugged it in and you hit "oscillate."
I was gonna make you Captain of the Guard, Wade.
Really.
You keep the $20.
Least I could do for helping me dodge a bullet.
I'm sorry about this.
These houses are yours to live in.
But they are prison property.
They will be treated with respect.
As long as they are treated with respect, you will be, as well.
Okay.
The warden has asked me to do a... icebreaker event.
I will demonstrate this activity with C.O...
- McCullough, Sir.
- Okay, McCullough.
Tell me two true things about you and one lie.
I will attempt to guess the lie.
Okay.
Um...
I came to say I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Okay, please don't lock me out.
You're right to be upset.
How would you know?
You don't know anything about me, Soso.
And what?
You think I'm upset about my mom's crack abuse or because I grew up poor, black, and uneducated in the urban jungle?
Okay, I watched "The Wire" a lot.
- I made assumptions.
- But you spent time with me.
I mean, did you even listen when I talked?
Like, what the fuck about me, besides the color of my skin, would indicate that I'm some indigent hood rat?
I don't know.
Oh, well, it's fine.
It's cool.
I'm guilty, too.
I won't lie.
You know, I like the story of the rich white hippie girl in my bed.
I've been working that on my end.
I don't want this to end.
What good is coming up here and sitting in the lobby every weekend gonna do?
She wants to get Sophia out, she needs to get a lawyer or a non-profit involved or something.
Mrs. Burset said that the prison has tons of lawyers, so at least coming up here and waiting for the warden to come out to get into his face is something.
Michael started a Kickstarter campaign.
Kickstarter?
What that mean?
Not much, usually.
There's nothing to be ashamed about.
Plenty of guys live with their parents.
Well, yeah, I mean, you know,
I'm just doing this to save money, you know?
'Cause I could live on my own, obviously.
Obviously.
I mean, very, very obviously.
It just makes the most financial sense, you know, for the both of us.
Oh!
That's my manicotti... always thinking of his little lasagna.
Hey...
I made you something.
Fresh baked.
Lorna...
No, no, no.
Don't say it.
You know, even though it took a lot of time and I had to go to the store twice, you are worth it.
Mm.
- Mmm.
Still warm.
- Mmm.
My favorite.
- Peanut butter and MMs.
- Snickerdoodles.
- I love you.
- Oh.
And you should.
I'm quite a catch.
Oh, god, you are.
You so are.
Fuck.
I want you.
- Vinny.
- I want you.
It's our living room.
The neighbors want to look in, that's their good luck.
I'm already unbuttoning my shirt.
My goodness.
You know that I can't resist your muscular chest.
Oh, god.
My hands.
They're in your hair right now.
I'm stroking it real soft.
Till I grab a handful and pull it back.
Oh.
You're such a man.
Oh, god.
I'm licking your neck.
- Oh.
- Kissing your ears.
My hand is on that big mountain in your pants, and I am unzipping you right now.
- I'm pulling your shirt off real slow.
- No, no, no.
It's a button-up.
- I'm unbuttoning it real slow.
- No, no, no, no.
Tear it off.
Pulling it off.
It's off.
The buttons are everywhere.
They're everywhere.
Oh, my god.
My mouth... my mouth is on those big titties.
My nipples are so hard right now.
Oh, my cock.
Oh, my god.
My cock is really hard.
- I know, baby.
- No, it's really hard, like, right now.
- It's really hard.
- I know.
- Oh.
- Vinny, Vinny.
Put it inside me.
Oh, my god.
It's in you.
Oh, it's in you.
- Ooh.
- Oh, my god.
It's in you.
It feels so good.
You're so wet.
You are so wet.
- I actually am.
I'm so wet right now.
- You are so wet.
I know.
Do it to me.
Oh, I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
- Don't stop.
- Don't stop.
Don't stop.
Don't stop.
Oh, my god.
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, my god.
Ah!
Ah!
He's humping the table.
- Oh.
- Oh.
What the hell?
Hey.
Hey.
Stay right here.
Stay looking at me, all right?
Jesus Christ.
Don't think I don't see you.
Pleasure, as always.
Also, I want to talk to you about something.
If this is about last week, I don't get to control my flow.
I think it's all the stress of all these new bitches in here.
I know these last few weeks have had their challenges.
So...
I wanted to say thank you.
And keep up the good work.
Your morale is important to me.
Oh.
That's so sweet.
- Ovaltine?
- It's to make chocolate milk.
Pretty much only Chinese people drink it now, which is probably why it's at commissary, but it's really good.
So, it's chocolate powder for my powdered milk?
It's got vitamins.
Oh.
See?
New bitches.
Why are they always staring like they're waiting for a donkey show to start?
I don't think they're staring at you.
They were following us earlier.
And you didn't say anything?
People can stare.
It's a free country.
Not in prison.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
I bet your Bloody Mary gonna come early, too.
Hey.
Hey.
You okay?
No.
You?
No.
You want to talk about it?
Not really.
You?
But have you ever heard the phrase "paper asshole"?
No.
Ruiz said it to me.
I think I pissed off the Dominicans.
Relax.
You run the Litchfield panty company, not the Sinaloa Drug Cartel.
No one's stitching your face to a soccer ball.
See you around, Pipes.
What's this?
I know what is is, pendeja.
What's it doing out?
It's contraband.
Whoops.
I need to be more careful.
Yeah, you do.
A few drops of that falls into the food, and this whole prison would be shitting their brains out.
Really?
I had no idea.
She acts so tough, but to stress-eat this food?
The poor woman.
Oh, you evil Russian bitch.
What can I say?
I do a lot with a little.
No!
No!
No!
What the fuck?
That's my toilet paper.
Oh!
I talk a lot.
I babble until I find something the person I'm with is interested in.
And I'll say anything I can to get them to like me.
But I really, really like you.
The real you.
You don't know the real me.
But I want to.
So in, like, a minute, I'm gonna put down this radio, and I'm gonna listen to you tell me about yourself.
And I'm not gonna try to rewrite your story in my head.
And then, when you're done, I'd like to tell you about myself.
And some of it will be embarrassing and ugly, but mostly boring.
And then, maybe afterwards, we could, like, quiz each other or something?
Eminem?
Yeah, it... it's not a presumption about you liking rap.
It's just AM 700 "The O.G." Is the only station that comes in clear.
Jackson, North Carolina.
Is that where you were born?
No.
That's where my great-grandmother was born.
Stuffed crust should have revolutionized pizza,
- but it was just a fad.
- Man, nah.
It's the same thing.
- Man, it is not the same thing!
- Okay.
'Cause that's Italian.
This is Mexican.
You got a stuffed tortilla, and you stuff that with more stuff.
Man, it's my golden ticket, and I'm gonna do it right with that business savvy and shit.
- Ooh, ri-ki-ki-ki.
- Hey, hey, hey!
You hear that?
What is that?
Wow, look at that.
That's a drone.
- It's a drone.
- Oh, shit.
What's it doing here like we some Iraqi wedding.
Man, come on.
We're gonna be late.
He was a bad man, and we did good things.
He did bad things, and we killed him good.
No.
We did bad.
No!
We did well.
Hey.
Have you seen Whitehill?
Yeah.
I forgot the garden needed turning.
If Rikerson comes back, just tell him where we went, okay?
Fuck.
- Lolly, Lolly.
Shh.
- Listen, listen.
They know.
They know.
They found you.
We have to move the body.
Shut up.
We cannot move the body.
There's drones.
Stop it, Lolly.
We cannot move it.
If I told you I already moved it, would it calm you down?
Maybe for a minute.
Good. 'Cause I did.
Now scat.
You didn't actually move it?
Hell, no.
And I'm not about to.
We're gonna have to kill her.

-Hey, there's a good idea.
-Hmm.
Maybe we should fertilize our women, too.
-[both chuckle]
-I do love your good intentions.
-[Maureen] Hey, Judy.
-Hey.
Hi.
You've got quite a following.
Yeah, I was hoping the novelty would wear off soon.
Might have to hide myself in that corn.
[chuckles]
Oh, look, how beautiful!
Help yourself.
Oh!
All right.
[Red] Oh, really?
Free-for-all on the produce now, huh?
Regardless of who's in the club.
Who's worked the soil, pulled the weeds, tended the seedlings.
Is that the new policy?
-This is Judy King.
-Oh, I know who she is.
I've seen her... daytime TV program.
But we haven't had the pleasure.
Mrs. King is going to be joining your club, Red.
So I'll leave you to it.
-Thank you.
-Yeah.
I'm sure you'll find a lot in common.
Hair and... accents.
You know, my daddy used to call me "Red." [laughs]
Really?
That's sweet.
[chuckles]
My papa called me solnyshko.
It means little sun.
But I've grown bigger and hotter since then, and he's dead.
So what are you going to do with that ear, now that you've picked it?
Well, I guess that depends on what else I can find around here.
I could do a Southern fried corn, a dilled corn shooter,
Taiwanese-style street corn.
Listen to fancy pants.
I could shove it up your ass.
Hmm, I'm not so big on ass play.
What do you suggest I do, Miss Red?
I'm thinking.
-Can I have some seeds?
-[blowing]
You bought Ovaltine.
Reap what you sow.
Ovaltine's got vitamins.
I'll trade you Ovaltine powder later for some seeds now.
I'm good for it.
No deal.
You'll regret it.
That's some malty goodness you're passing up.
Excuse me?
You knew going into this I had bad knees.
My feet are killing me.
We are putting out a vibe.
If you are sitting and/or eating my seeds, no vibe.
Right now, there is no vibe.
See?
Look at this.
-All of a sudden, I'm approachable.
-Picking up or dropping off?
Neither.
We're out.
I gave you guys new ones yesterday.
We're hanging up our lacy intimates.
If this is because of the money Stella took, I'm good for it.
I'll pay you back.
It's not worth it anymore.
We're smelling the beginning of the end.
You and all your posturing, shipping the kangaroo down the hill.
[tutting]
It's starting to feel dangerous.
You've even got a heavy on the payroll.
Ha!
I see what you did there.
-"Heavy."
-Not on purpose.
Fine, jump ship like rats.
And I'm not talking about the Disney-Pixar kind.
I was gonna fire one of you anyway, but I'm not gonna say which one.
Chew on that.
We're gonna take a walk on the track, you wanna join us, kahuna?
No, she does not.
She's got bad knees.
[sighs]
Enjoy sweating for free.
I expect all my undies still in your possession returned posthaste.
[chuckling] "Posthaste"?
That's nuts.
-Do you have something to say?
-Sure.
But I'll wait till I'm with my friends.
Off the backboard.
[clicking and grunts]
-[Poussey] Oh!
-[Brook laughs]
Short, black and bad at basketball.
-Subverting expectations since 1990.
-Oh, it's okay.
Litchfield's latest lesbos, in fun-size.
Look, how much longer do you think the world's longest game of Horse is gonna go on?
[exhales deeply] She ain't a lesbian.
I see.
Testing the waters before diving in face-first?
I'm attracted to people, not genders.
Well, aren't you special.
Tell you what, why don't you use some of that sexual fluidity to slide off the court so the real men can play?
[scoffs] Come on.
Even though I do think labeling is a total sham...
I see the power in reclaiming an epithet.
Like you guys have with "nigga."
Okay, maybe not that exactly.
But...
I really like you.
Like, really a lot.
And I just--
I wanna honor your feelings, you know, if you wanna call this something.
Like, we're girlfriend-girlfriend, or... lezzy togezzy.
[laughing] I don't know.
How about we say we're happy, yeah?
Leave it at that?
Okay. [chuckles]
Oh, shit.
Hey!
Hi!
Hi...
Judy, I'm...
Hey, girl.
[chuckles]
[Poussey stammers]
You're...
Fuck!
[grumbling]
It is so cute how moony you get every time she's around.
By "cute" you mean, "lame as fuck."
Well, yeah.
You need to pull it together.
I mean, she's a person you admire, but she's still just a person.
A person.
Right.
You should be able to have a conversation with anyone.
Hi, I'm Brook.
I'm your neighbor.
I was wondering if you'd heard about the plans to build a Walmart at the corner of Exposition and Euclid?
Yeah, I heard about it.
Well, I'm one of a group of citizens trying to convince the city council to turn that lot into a park space instead.
I was wondering if you'd be willing to have a friendly discussion, or maybe even sign our petition?
-Sure... if you take your top off.
-[all snickering]
-Okay, that is inappropriate.
-Yes.
Inappropriate things do happen out there.
How would you handle it?
You really think a grown man is gonna ask me to take my top off?
Well, there's a sex offender at 3134 10th Street.
He might.
No, you do not have to go to the sex offender's house.
No one has to knock on any door that makes him or her feel uncomfortable.
But I do urge you all to be bold and stretch yourself.
By the way, has everyone signed their liability waivers?
Oh, shit.
I hear he likes little boys.
Little boy, Asian girl, are they really that far apart?
You said our break-up was going to be amicable.
Yeah, I said a lot of things.
So did you, like, "I love you.
I'll always love you.
This is not because of Oren."
Wait, what?
She dumped me to get with you.
I'm not sweet enough arm-candy.
Oh, my God!
Could you kids drop the soap opera for another time?
We're going out there this afternoon.
You need to feel like you're prepared.
Well, clearly, she's not.
She can't even handle "take your top off."
Okay, 50 bucks says I get more signatures than you, Ethan.
No bet.
People will sign just to shut you up.
But here's a bet.
Get the pedo to sign, I'll give you your 50 bucks.
And Oren will go on a date with you.
Cool?
-I'm not really in--
-Okay!
You are so on.
He will sign and you will give me cash, and I will spend it on a new hemp messenger bag and strawberry lube, because Oren seems like a strawberry kind of guy.
Well-- [man] Great, now let's talk one more time about mirroring body language.
I'm just saying, if you bought me a watch, I'd be on the time better.
-There's a clock on the wall.
-Not in my office.
I'll put a clock in your office.
Or you could buy me a watch, so when we out of the office like now,
I could tell you things like, "Hey, Mr. Caputo, we're only a few minutes late to meet Piscatella, and you the boss anyhow, so relax."
I will consider your watch request.
Hey, I'm just trying to make your life better.
This ain't about me.
By the way, what you want me to do once we there?
-Take notes.
-Hold up, hold up.
"Take notes." Got you.
[Piscatella] Mop it all around.
Damn!
This place is like Rehab Addict:
Litchfield Edition.
And with, like, real addicts.
[Piscatella] So, in a nutshell... electrical is still having Internet issues, plumbing works, but no hot water yet.
All beds and extraneous furniture are assembled and ready for move-in.
-[scribbling]
-Now, the interior paint--
Uh, inmate?
What are you possibly writing that will have any salience past this moment in time?
Well, Mr. Caputo wants notes.
Now, I don't know what salience is, but I think a checklist of what's completed and what's not is hella revalent.
You mean "rel." Relevant.
I mean, I'm trying to do my job, same as you, big man.
Are you...
suggesting that we are in any way, on any planet, in any universe, the same, inmate?
Why don't you go check on Luschek and the Internet situation?
-What?
-Let me watch you go.
Oh, you gonna "watch me" watch me?
I will watch... you.
-Go!
-[chuckles] I'm goin'.
It's clearly that...
[whispers] time.
-Look at me go.
-Go.
-May I ask you a question, Mr. Caputo?
-Shoot.
How did you choose her to be your assistant, exactly?
-Between you and me?
-Yes, sir.
She's the only semi-intelligent one that I'm only... semi-attracted to.
[laughs]
Well, if you'll follow me, I'll show you the bathroom.
-[scribbling]
-What are you writing?
Man, why everybody act like they ain't never seen a black woman with a clipboard before?
No, it's your pen.
It's exorbitantly scratchy and it's giving me anxiety.
Damn, Word-A-Day.
I need to get me one of them calendars.
"Anxiety" wasn't from the calendar.
That's just me.
But... "exorbitant" was.
Check out these fat phone cords.
Shit, I could make so many bracelets out of the wires in one of these--
Uh-uh.
Those ain't phone cords.
They're for the Internet.
And believe me, you want some of them guards to be able to watch their porn and get it all out before they on duty, so you best leave it.
So, hey, how come you don't get to live here, Luschek?
-Because I have a home, inmate.
-Oh, yeah?
-An entire basement to myself.
-Hmm.
You gotta admit, though, it is kind of swanky... you know?
I mean, you could fit an entire family just right in here and still have room for a TV.
Couple of pictures of X-rays.
Home sweet home.
-Did you just say X-rays?
-I did say X-rays.
'Cause when my grandmammy broke her pelvis, all of us kids got X-rays.
'Cause the doctor was really nice, and my mom was doing him on the side.
-[both laugh]
-That's funny, huh?
He literally took an entire X-ray of my whole skeleton, and I hung it up on my wall like a fancy English guy.
But it was just pictures of bones instead of--
You know, it wasn't, like, real bones.
Your life is grotesque.
-Another big word.
-What are you even doing here?
Mr. Caputo wanted me to check up on the Internet issue.
Inmate...
Scar-neck, explain the problem.
It doesn't work.
There you go.
[Lorna] Hey, baby.
[Vince] Yeah, I thought you were getting home an hour ago.
Oh, I know, the traffic was awful coming back from the store.
I think there was a wreck or something.
Anyway, how was work?
How are you?
-Vinnie?
-Look, I'm sorry.
I'm just in a mood.
Well, don't you worry.
You just sit right down.
I'm gonna give you such a nice backrub.
-Lorna...
-[Lorna moans]
-Lorna!
-Honey, you're so tense.
I'm reaching around and I'm feeling down your chiseled and bumpy abs.
Oh, my goodness.
I just found your cock-a-doodle-doo and it's so hard.
-[woman knocking] Vinnie?
Hurry up!
-I'm busy!
All right?
Lorna, I can't really do this today, okay?
Well, can you at least try?
No, my roommates!
It's awkward.
Well, I'm talking about kissing crotches in front of 50 other women, but for you, it's awkward?
I don't know, I thought you were into that.
Well, uh...
Maybe you could feel that way about your roommates.
Don't say that.
Well, do you have a speaker?
Put me on speaker, baby.
I'll talk so nice for you and the boys.
[woman] Vinnie, are you gonna help him with his homework?
Lorna, my roommates are my parents and my kid brother.
[scoffs] What?
All right?
There, now you know.
Well, why didn't you say that before?
I mean, what kind of fantasy is that gonna be?
[stammers] You thought you married a man, not a boy.
Look, I gotta go, all right?
Gino's back from school.
I gotta help him with his homework.
[scoffs]
Okay.
I think he shares a room with his kid brother.
Does that mean no more phone-boning in front of everybody?
Because, legit, that shit was kind of gross.
But also hot.
I'm having mixed emotions right now.
Yeah, me, too.
[gasps]
She's taking all the green beans.
I asked her not to!
Nicely, even!
Ignored.
And her flunkeys, always lurking around now.
-Look!
-I'm looking.
In Russia, we have a saying... [speaking Russian]
"Don't open your mouth to eat other people's bread."
Or what?
Ask the Germans in wintertime.
-Uh, Miss Judy?
-Uh-huh.
Uh, I was wondering if you would sign my cookbook.
Of course.
That's so nice.
Um...
I'll buy one and bring it to you when we both get out.
All right, well, we have a date, then.
Now, thank you, ladies.
Bye-bye for now.
All right.
Mmm.
Hey, there, Judy King.
Oh, guilty as charged, in all respects.
That's a joke, darlin'.
Oh!
[laughs]
You know, a lot of people in here are funny without meaning to be.
I learned the hard way to hold my mirth.
Oh, well, let your mirth fly free.
I mean to be funny.
All right. [laughs]
Um... actually, I was wondering if I could speak to you about my friend.
Oh, that little retarded girl?
She's actually not...
challenged at all, which is what we're supposed to say, not the R-word.
Oh, uh...
"R"s, "F"s, "L-M-N-O-P"s and "Q"s.
You know, I get in more trouble for expanding those single letter words, but never "N"s.
Despite this drawl, I'm brighter than that.
So, now, you were saying?
About your friend who is not challenged.
-[chuckles]
-Am I allowed to say "special"?
No, she's not special.
Well, she is to me.
-Mmm.
-But not euphemistically.
She's a fan and whenever she sees you, she freaks out.
You've gotta understand.
Institutional racism... traps the most vulnerable people in our society in this cycle of incarceration which, in turn, leads to a cycle of poverty.
It makes someone like you...
someone rich and powerful and white, virtually unapproachable.
All right, so now let me get this straight.
Your friend acts like a moron around me because she's black and poor?
-Is that right?
-Basically... yes.
[sighs] I think her mother was a crack addict or something.
You might as well be an alien.
But you could bridge the divide.
-The way you did.
-Yeah, exactly!
[chuckles]
All right, how about this?
Why don't you bring her over at lunch?
Okay. [chuckles]
It'll be like, uh...
the 1% sitting with the other 1%.
Oh, my God.
"The other 1%" is such a good hashtag.
[chuckles] [chuckles]
[man on TV] The New Orleans police put out a call to...
-Hi!
My name is Brook...
-Look and I was wondering if--
Take your picture or smash an egg in my face, or whatever you need to do for you and your friends to get your jollies.
-But spare me the setup, all right?
-I don't have a setup.
You know who I am?
Yeah, I do, actually.
You're a member of the community who has as much right as any of your neighbors to be concerned about the big-box monstrosity that's being proposed for the corner of Exposition and Euclid.
I'd be happy to talk about it with you, if you have the time.
Look, I'm watching this Hurricane Katrina stuff.
It's really intense.
The world's gonna be lousy with Katrinas if we let mega-corporations like Walmart carbon-bomb our planet.
You wanna come in?
Sure.
Yeah, I'll give you the whole shpiel.
Spiel.
Sorry, I never know how to pronounce that.
Wait, um... how old are you?
Nineteen.
Okay.
Come in.
[man on TV] ...aspect of this terrible hurricane that came on land with 145 mile-an-hour...
Okay.
I don't know if you realize, but the introduction of mega-retailers, like Walmart, almost invariably have a negative effect on property values--
-You're so nervous.
-I'm not nervous.
I'm passionate about saving local businesses.
Like Lola's Bloomers.
-May I?
-Sure.
Sure.
Conservative estimates are that there will be thousands of more cars in the neighborhood per day because of the construction--
It says you wanna put a park in instead.
I can't live within 2,500 feet of a park.
They would literally kick me out of my own home.
Sorry.
Can I talk about the elephant in the room for a second?
I wish you wouldn't.
I look across from me and I don't see a monster.
I see a human being fighting to control the animalistic parts of his brain, true grit overcoming impulse.
Not everybody judges you.
What if I told you it was kiddie porn?
I'd... say you need support, and I'd applaud your restraint for finding an outlet for your compulsions.
[scoffs] Wow!
You will really say whatever it takes.
Well, it was a lot worse than kiddie porn.
Wanna see?
No, I don't...
I don't need...
No.
No need.
Um...
Wait, all you did was have sex on the beach?
Consenting adults on an empty beach.
Well, except for the creeper that filmed it and turned us in to the cops.
-But you think that pervo got in trouble?
-That is insane.
I mean... [sighs] You are such a cautionary tale.
I would be, if people got the story right.
But once I had to go around door-to-door announcing my status, the rumors got started...
I don't know.
It's all so fucked.
Here.
It's not like Walmart's gonna lose.
Awesome.
[sharpener whirring]
[phone ringing]
-Oh...
-[continues ringing]
Uh... [clears throat]
Warden Caputo's office.
This is Ms. Jefferson speaking, how may I assist you?
[man] Is Warden Caputo available?
Let me place you on a brief hold while I go and check.
[beeping]
Fuck.
Oh, well, you gonna call back.
Hello?
I'm still here.
Damn, you are still there.
Then why the little light go out?
Anyway, don't matter, I ain't got him right now.
Will you please let him know I called?
All right, you take good care now.
-Yeah.
-[breathes deeply]
Shit.
What?
What happened?
I didn't quite get his name.
[sighs] You don't know who it was?
Well, it was some brother, sounded like a salesman-type, if you ask me.
So I probably did you a favor there.
Oh!
And then some white lady, she called about a get-together.
Mmm-hmm.
It happened twice?
Jesus, Jefferson, what am I paying you for?
Are you sure she said "get-together"?
What does that even mean?
Like...
like, a meeting?
Like a meeting.
Or...
like a date, maybe.
You holding out on me?
You somebody's Ca-baby-boo-to?
You're on thin fucking ice, Jefferson.
Was it Linda?
Possibly.
It wasn't Natalie, was it?
[clicks tongue] Linda sounds more right.
Okay.
Get Linda from MCC on the line.
All right.
Press the button that says "Line one."
-One.
-Nine and the number.
Nine...
Got you.
-[muttering] -[line ringing]
-[clears throat] -[Linda] Uh, hello?
Yes, hello.
I have Director Caputo.
I will transfer you now.
[beeps] [blows raspberries] Shit!
-[dialing] -[phone rings]
Warden Caputo's office.
[Caputo] Jefferson, I got it.
My bad!
My bad!
-[Linda] Hello, uh, Joe?
-Linda, hi.
Uh...
Jefferson, hang up your line.
I don't wanna disconnect y'all.
Hang up the phone!
Uh, I'm still training her.
Uh, I got your message about a get-together.
Oh, uh...
wrong Linda, I think.
-[sighs]
-But we do need to celebrate our victory.
All these veterans becoming guards.
Yes.
Yes, we absolutely do.
Any chance you're free tonight?
Tonight?
Yes, it's perfect.
Um...
We can celebrate and, uh, talk business.
-How about La Fontana's at 8:00?
-Yeah, great. [chuckles]
-Great.
I'll see you tonight.
-Okay, bye.
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]
Ah!
Even the staff waits for the bathroom now, hmm?
What can I do for you, Red?
[sighs]
I want to talk to you about the King woman.
You two are hitting it off, right?
You gave her the run of my garden.
How did you think that would go?
You know, planting a flag on the Moon doesn't mean that you own it.
You're Russian.
I thought you'd appreciate that attitude.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm only concerned for her.
Respect in prison has to be earned.
I don't know about that.
You've received a lot of leeway from staff around here.
You seem to be doing all right.
Was that what this is about?
Are you punishing me?
Did you do something wrong?
I did the only reasonable thing I could.
There's no such thing as a consensual relationship between a prisoner and a guard.
Lorna's wedding was a bittersweet end to a relationship that never actually happened, Sam.
-[toilet flushes]
-You're reading something into this that isn't there, Reznikov.
And what goes on with Mrs. King is none of your business.
You're pampering her.
Oops!
[sighs]
She even gets a magazine?
What do you want, Ruiz?
I heard about your labor dispute.
I thought maybe my friends could fill in?
This is Pidge.
You know Ouija, or she knows you.
And that's Zirconia.
Zirconia?
I took out all my rocks before I come in, so nobody would think they was diamonds and rip 'em out.
Plus...
I don't think it's allowed.
They're all ready and willing to join your panty party.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Privately, please.
What are you doing?
This is not a publicly traded company.
Its very existence depends on keeping its existence hidden.
Chill the fuck out.
I was just trying to help you.
I don't need your help.
What I need is your discretion, and you bringing a bunch of thugs into my house is the opposite of that.
I decide who knows about Felonious Spunk.
I decide who gets hired.
I am the prison pussy panty business.
Somebody's getting a little big for her panties, I think.
I'm gonna choose to assume you're talking about yourself and take that as an apology.
[snickers]
You're talking shit out a paper asshole, Chapman.
But when an actual hard-ass bitch decides to call you on it... well...
[tutting and inhales sharply]
Pretty sure she was talking about herself on that last one.
[Suzanne] It's not fair.
It is the most unfair thing that's ever happened in this prison.
Mmm, what about when Carson went to SHU for sneezing too loud?
Or what's-her-face, the Puerto Rican girl, with the gimpy eye?
And when she got the wrong meds by accident in the med line and went nutso, and gimped her other eye with a spork.
Now, she double gimp-eyed.
Or how 'bout when Pornstache used to make the meth heads blow him for drugs in the mop closet?
Or the time Chapman got furlough?
I retract and redact.
New statement.
It's easily the top 138 most unfair things that has ever happened here.
What is?
Your new job.
My job is the bomb!
You sit at a desk all day when you were plucked from the most rewarding job.
I'm not saying it's on par with all the human rights abuses in here, but women fought for a long time to shake the role of desk-ridden secretary.
Are you for real?
-Hey!
-[all laugh]
Do you get the Internet?
-Do you have a mini-fridge?
-Ah!
Do you have a skeleton key made from real human bone that opens a door to a world of talking animals?
Man, I got me a clipboard and a personal relationship with Mr. Caputo.
-[mimics buzzing] -[all laugh]
Man, if George R. R. Martin wrote about prisons,
I'd be, like...
the Hand of the Warden.
Yo, don't the Hand always die in them books?
Man, whatever, okay?
Winter is coming, bitches.
And I'm getting me a watch.
-For real?
-Yes.
Hey. [chuckles]
Yo...
I feel like she's smiling and waving at me.
[mouthing]
Maybe she can see dead people and there's one standing right... right in front of you.
Are the hairs standing up on the back of your neck?
I feel like I'm the dead person.
I... may have set you up on a blind friend date!
-Wait, you did what?
No!
-Surprise!
-What?
-[chuckling] I just talked you up.
-Go!
Be yourself.
-Yo... [both giggling]
-Go, P!
-Go, P!
Go, P!
-Let me fix your clothes.
-Get off me!
Hey. [chuckles]
You must be Poo-see.
She called her Poo-see!
No, I'm sorry.
Did I say that right?
Yeah, yeah.
Poussey, it's French.
Oh, French.
I was named after a great aunt who hid pearls from the Yankees under her pendulous breasts.
[laughs nervously]
And she also brewed a famous home remedy that supposedly cured hookworm.
-Not quite so exotic.
-Listen.
-Hmm.
-I...
I feel...
I feel like I need to apologize...
-Uh-uh.
-...for just being all, like, weird and stuff, you know, I just...
-I dig your whole thing, you know.
-[chuckles]
And I just, I watch your show so much, so seeing you in person was just, you know, I got all tongue-tied, and fan-girly and stuff.
So I'd try to say words, but when they came out of my mouth, it just sound like...
All right, all right, all right.
Relax, darlin'.
Your friend has told me the whole story.
She has got you covered.
You gotta sink a hook in the keepers, especially in this place.
-Uh-huh.
-You know, it's funny.
Me and Brook, we never would've crossed paths.
I mean, growing up all over the world, bouncing culture to culture with a strict, conservative family, versus, you know, sleeping in tent cities with a bunch of dirty hippies, eating food out of dumpsters.
Oof!
You have been through a lot.
[stammers] Nah, it was...
I mean, it was good.
Well, I mean, it was hard, you know?
Like, I guess being transient, and not really having any long-term friends, but I do know three languages.
Hmm!
Wait...
-you know three languages?
-[chuckles] Yeah.
How does the child of a crack whore learn three languages?
-That is remarkable.
-Excuse me?
What languages?
English, French and German.
Did you just call my mother a crack whore?
My mother had a masters in Art History and she could barely take an aspirin.
-Excuse me?
-My dad is a major in the army.
I was supposed to go to West Point.
I guess you were expecting just another ghetto prison rat.
At least one of us lives up to the stereotype.
What, no!
Sweetheart, no!
You have snatched the taste right out of my mouth.
I'm just parroting what your girlfriend told me about you.
You came out of a cycle of poverty, blah, blah, blah.
I mean, it seems to me that you two formed this relationship without talking much.
Did you know I am learning Italian?
[sighs]
[stammers] [sighs]
[indistinct chatter]
So, did Chester the Molester sign?
You owe me 50 bucks.
-Whoa.
-And you better take me out.
I can't believe you had the balls to do it.
Whatever, he probably finger-banged his 15-year-old girlfriend when he was 17 or something else no big.
The sex offender lists are full of sob stories about people's lives being ruined by technicalities.
[scoffs] You know, as a matter of fact, he was a fucking horrible child-molester rapist.
Because I'm so sure he told you that.
Yeah, 'cause he...
He fucking tried to seduce me.
He invited me in for lemonade.
-And you went in?
-Yeah.
He told me I didn't look 19.
[inhales deeply] That's when I knew I was in trouble.
Shit.
He stroked my hair.
[scoffs] He wanted to brag, so he showed me the newspaper article about how he stalked this nine-year-old girl from his church, for, like, a year.
Earning her trust, gradually convincing her to...
Well, to... [sighs] To... [exhales sharply] And then I was running down the street.
For your fucking bet, Ethan.
For 50 fucking dollars.
But also because I... because I wanted to go out with you.
[exhales deeply]
[Caputo] I really appreciate you coming all the way down from Utica.
Sorry, again, I couldn't get a seat in one of the gondolas.
No, no, it's okay.
This is great.
I'm really glad that you thought I called.
[chuckles]
These new guards, they're a... they're a big win for us.
Like, "us" us.
And the company, but especially "us" us.
Yeah.
We're not a bad team, Linda from Purchasing.
To us, Joe from Litchfield Human Activity, and our continued wins.
-And to the veterans, of course.
-Of course. [chuckles]
♪ Happy, happy birthday clappy ♪
♪ Join us as we celebrate ♪
♪ Clap your hands and dance around ♪
♪ Have a laugh and eat some cake ♪
♪ Happy birthday, happy birthday Happy birthday ♪
♪ You're so great!
♪ [all cheering]
What?
The bald guy... is, uh... one of our former guards.
A really good guy.
Donaldson.
A good guy...
who walked out in the middle of an inmate transfer/high-profile self-surrender?
Yeah, I get your point.
Don't beat yourself up, Joe.
You handled that situation like a total boss.
Meant both literally and in that hip-kid lingo way.
Jesus!
He's not even a fucking waiter.
-He's a busboy.
-[laughs]
-What?
-No, just... you could've lost your job... or faced prosecution had inmates gone missing that day.
I mean, you're concerned about...
these jerks that hung you out to dry.
You're quite a guy, Joe Caputo.
[waiter] There you go, sir.
Whenever you're ready.
-Uh, do me a favor, will you?
-[waiter] Mmm-hmm.
-The change is yours.
-Okay.
Give a 20 to that busboy over there.
Wait till we're gone.
I don't want to make a thing of it, okay?
[waiter] Okay.
Hey, Mr. Caputo!
-Look, Donaldson--
-I don't need your money, Mr. Caputo.
It's nothing, take it, it's--
Nah, this is not to help me.
This is to make you feel better about that... pardon my French, miss, bullshit you pulled.
-Okay, Joe, let's go.
-The bullshit I pulled?
I work three jobs.
This is the good one.
O'Neill?
I heard he had kidney stones.
But no health insurance.
So he thought he'd power through, wait for it to pass.
It didn't.
Now he's on dialysis.
He may lose a kidney.
-Jesus.
-Yeah.
So take your $20 and drown your conscience in a bottle of gin, because paying me to feel better about it ain't gonna work.
Donaldson.
You tell O'Neill I'm sorry about his stones.
I'm also sorry you gotta work here.
But I need you to understand something.
I'm sorry for you.
I don't regret firing any of you.
You walked out on the biggest day the prison's faced in 25 fuckin' years.
You put the prisoners at risk, you put your fellow cos at risk, you put this whole town in danger!
The shit hit and instead of moving the fan away, [stammers] you plugged it in and you hit "oscillate."
I was gonna make you captain of the guard, Wade.
Really.
You keep the 20.
Least I could do for helping me dodge a bullet.
I'm sorry about this.
These houses are yours to live in, but they are prison property.
They will be treated with respect.
As long as they are treated with respect, you will be as well.
Okay, the warden has asked me to do a... icebreaker event.
I will demonstrate this activity with CO...
-McCullough, sir.
-Okay, McCullough.
Tell me two true things about you and one lie.
I will attempt to guess the lie.
Okay, um... [woman speaking indistinctly on PA]
I came to say I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Okay, please don't lock me out.
You're right to be upset.
How would you know?
You don't know anything about me, Soso.
[scoffs]
And, what, you think I'm upset about my mom's crack abuse or because I grew up poor, black and uneducated in the urban jungle?
Okay, I watched The Wire a lot.
I made assumptions.
But you spent time with me.
I mean, did you even listen when I talked?
Like, what the fuck about me, besides the color of my skin, would indicate that I'm some indigent hood rat?
-I don't know.
-[scoffs]
No, it's fine, it's cool.
I'm guilty, too.
I won't lie.
You know, I like the story of the rich, white, hippie girl in my bed.
I've been working that on my end.
I don't want this to end.
[Gloria] What good is coming up here and sitting in the lobby every weekend gonna do?
She wants to get Sophia out, she needs to get a lawyer or a non-profit involved or something.
Ms. Burset said that the prison has tons of lawyers, so at least coming up here and waiting for the warden to come out to get into his face is something...
Michael started a Kickstarter campaign.
Kickstarter?
What that mean?
Not much, usually.
There's nothing to be ashamed about.
Plenty of guys live with their parents.
Right, yeah, I mean, you know...
I'm just doing this to save money, you know?
'Cause I could live on my own, obviously.
Oof!
Obviously.
I mean, very, very obviously.
It just makes the most financial sense, you know?
For the both of us.
Oh!
That's my manicotti, always thinking of his little lasagna.
[chuckles] Hey...
I made you something.
Fresh baked.
Lorna...
No, no, no, don't say it.
You know, even though it took a lot of time, and I had to go to the store twice, you... are worth it.
[exhales deeply] [sniffs]
Hmm.
Mmm!
-Mmm!
-It's still warm.
My favorite.
Peanut butter and MM's.
-Snickerdoodles.
-Oh!
-I love you.
-Oh!
And you should.
I am quite a catch.
Oh, my God, you are.
You so are.
[exhales deeply]
Fuck.
I want you.
-Vinnie.
-I want you.
It's our living room.
The neighbors want to look in, that's their good luck.
I'm already unbuttoning my shirt.
My goodness, you know that I can't resist your muscular chest.
Oh, my God.
My hands, they're in your hair right now.
-I'm stroking it real soft.
-[panting]
Till I grab a handful of it and pull it back.
[moans] You're such a man.
[Vince] Oh, God.
I'm licking your neck.
Kissing your ears.
My hand is on that big mountain in your pants, and I am unzipping you right now.
And I'm pulling your shirt off real slow.
No, no, no, it's a button-up.
-I unbutton it real slow.
-No, no, no, tear it off.
-Pulling it off.
It's off.
-Tear it off.
It's off, the buttons, they're everywhere.
They're everywhere.
Oh, my God, my mouth...
My mouth is on those big titties.
-My nipples are so hard right now.
-Oh, my God, my cock.
Oh, my God, my cock is really hard.
I know, baby.
No, it's really hard.
Like, right now, it's really hard.
-I know, Vinnie...
-Oh, God.
-Vinnie, put it inside me.
-Yeah?
Oh, my God, it's in you.
Oh, it's in you.
-Oh, my God, it's in you.
-[Lorna moaning]
It feels so good.
You're so wet.
You are so wet.
I actually am.
-I'm super wet right now.
-I know.
[both panting]
Do it to me.
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
-Don't stop.
-I'm not stopping.
I'm not stopping.
I'm not gonna stop.
I'm not gonna stop.
Oh, my God.
-Oh, baby!
-[strained] Oh, my God!
[yells] [man] He's humping the table.
[Vince sighs]
-[panting] -[woman] What the hell?
Hey!
Hey, stay right here.
Stay looking at me, all right?
Jesus Christ.
[man] Don't think I don't see you.
Pleasure, as always.
Also, I want to talk to you about something.
If this is about last week, I don't get to control my flow.
I think it's all the stress of all these new bitches in here.
I know these last few weeks have had their challenges.
So...
I wanted to say thank you.
And keep up the good work.
Your morale is important to me.
Oh!
That's so sweet.
Ovaltine?
It's to make chocolate milk.
Pretty much only Chinese people drink it now, which is probably why it's at commissary, but it's really good.
So, it's chocolate powder for my powdered milk?
It's got vitamins.
Oh!
See?
New bitches.
Why are they always staring like they're waiting for a donkey show to start?
I don't think they're staring at you.
They were following us earlier.
And you didn't say anything?
People can stare.
-It's a free country.
-Not in prison.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
I bet your Bloody Mary gonna come early, too.
[indistinct chatter]
Hey.
Hey.
[sighs]
You okay?
-No.
You?
-[exhales deeply]
No.
Do you want to talk about it?
Not really.
You?
But have you ever heard the phrase "paper asshole"?
[chuckles] No.
Ruiz said it to me.
I think I pissed off the Dominicans.
Relax.
You run the Litchfield panty company...
not the Sinaloa drug cartel.
No one's stitching your face to a soccer ball.
See ya around, Pipes.
[Gloria] What's this?
[in Spanish] It's for the eyes.
Takes the red out.
[in English] I know what it is, pendeja.
What's it doing out?
It's contraband.
Whoops!
I need to be more careful.
Yeah, you do.
A few drops of that falls into the food, and this whole prison will be shitting their brains out.
Really?
I had no idea.
She acts so tough, but to stress-eat this food?
The poor woman.
[laughs] Oh, you evil, Russian bitch.
What can I say?
I do a lot with a little.
[laughs]
No!
No!
No!
[inmate] What the fuck?
That's my toilet paper.
-[defecating]
-Oh!
[rap music playing in distance]
I talk a lot.
I babble... until I find something the person I'm with is interested in.
And I'll say anything I can to get them to like me.
But I... really... really like you.
The real you.
[scoffs] You don't know the real me.
But I want to.
So in, like, a minute, I'm gonna put down this radio, and I'm gonna listen to you tell me about yourself.
And I'm not gonna try to rewrite your story in my head.
And then, when you're done, I'd like to tell you about myself.
[sighs]
And some of it will be embarrassing and ugly... but mostly boring. [exhales]
And then... maybe afterwards, we could, like...
quiz each other or something?
Eminem?
[chuckles]
Yeah, it's not a presumption about you liking rap.
It's just...
AM 700 The OG is the only station that comes in clear.
[snickers and clears throat]
Jackson, North Carolina.
Is that where you were born?
No, that's where my great-grandmother was born.
I mean, stuffed crust shoulda revolutionized pizza,
-but it was just a fad.
-Man, nah, it's the same thing.
-Man, it is not the same thing!
-All right.
'Cause that's Italian...
this is Mexican.
You got a stuffed tortilla, and you stuff that with more stuff.
-[faint humming]
-Man, it's my golden ticket, and I'm gonna do it right with that business savvy and shit.
-[scatting]
-Hey, hey, hey!
Do you hear that?
[humming continues]
What is that?
[inmate] Wow, look at that.
[inmates chatting indistinctly]
That's a drone.
-It's a drone.
-Shit!
What's it doing here?
Like we some Iraqi wedding?
Man, come on.
We're gonna be late.
He was a bad man and we did good things.
He did bad things and we killed him good.
No, we did bad.
No!
We did well.
[whispering] Hey.
Have you seen Whitehill?
Yeah, I forgot the garden needed turning.
If Rikerson comes back, just tell him where we went, okay?
Oh, fuck!
[grunting]
-No!
No!
-Lolly, Lolly.
-[shushing]
-Listen, listen.
They know!
They know!
They found you!
We have to move the body!
[whispering] Shut up.
We cannot move the body.
There's drones.
Stop it, Lolly.
We cannot move it.
If I told you I already moved it, would it calm you down?
Maybe for a minute.
Good, 'cause I did.
Now, scat.
[fence opens and closes]
You didn't actually move it.
Hell, no.
And I'm not about to.
[sucks teeth] We're gonna have to kill her.
[rap music playing]
[cell door slams] [theme song playing]
[cell door slams]
[cell door slams] [inmate speaking Spanish]
[Taystee exhales heavily]
How are we supposed to clean the floors with nonstop bitches tracking their shit through?
[Suzanne] We are like he whom the gods have condemned to push the boulder up the hill only to watch it roll back down.
Oh, right, right, right, right.
And then he has to cut his arm off to get out from underneath it.
What is that guy's name?
Oh, James Franco!
Sisyphus.
I did hear that rumor.
You know those Hollywood types, they will stick it in any warm hole.
Well, you don't have to be from Hollywood to wanna put it in a warm place.
It's called having a dick.
No, my Vinnie would never.
Well, maybe not in a man-hole, but you away a long time.
He could be getting his MM melting in some ho's mouth and not in his hand. [chuckles]
No.
No, that's never gonna happen because we're talking sexy on the phone, like, 24/7, and I mean real sexy.
And I give very good phone.
Are we talking about peanut MM's or regular?
[both laughing] [man on PA] Inmate Jefferson, Tasha Jefferson, report to the warden's office.
Inmate Tasha Jefferson to the warden's office.
Who's Tasha Jefferson?
Oh, Taystee?
Taystee, go to the warden's office.
We have a warden?
- Your name's Tasha?
- What is this about?
The main thing is answering the phones and organizational stuff.
General assisting.
I don't know.
I've never had an assistant before.
We will figure it out together.
And you swear this is legit?
'Cause I seen Shawshank and I don't wanna go to Seg because I did your taxes too good.
I guarantee you, you will never see anything with my social security number on it.
Never say never.
You work for MCC.
Maybe one day you realize you need food stamps and you don't know how to fill out the forms.
Well, I'm your girl.
I can walk you through it, but I'm gonna need them digits.
However... [whispers] I'm a vault.
I don't say nothing.
And I ain't never crawling through a tunnel of piss and dookie, so rest easy.
Okay.
As of now, you're off janitorial and you're with me.
Praise Jesus.
Every day.
When I'm working, you're working.
Is this 'cause I won at job fair?
- Sure.
- [scoffs] I told them bitches.
Take a clipboard, write things down, look busy.
Outside.
Alert!
Alert!
Alert!
- What?
- Mmm!
[Alex] What?
Healy's just showing her around.
Frieda's over there.
It's all good.
Why does she get some special garden tour like some fancy Shiba Inu?
[scoffs] She's a celebrity, okay?
Fucking relax.
Uh... [stammering]
Not okay.
Not...
Not really relaxed.
I think you are way too relaxed... to be in this big, brown shit-uation that we're in!
Lolly, believe me.
My insides have completely liquefied and I wanna vomit all the time... but I have chosen to keep my voice low and appear calm.
You have to do the same.
- [exhales deeply] I can't.
- You have to.
- Look at me.
You...
- [inhales sharply]
Listen.
You have to.
Change the record in your head.
Play, "He was a bad man.
We did what we had to do and we did it well.
So now it's through."
It's a mantra.
Say it.
"We did what we had to do and we did it well."
You forgot the bad man part.
And the end.
But that's the idea.
So whenever you're feeling worried, whenever your thoughts start to...
wander, just bring them back to the mantra...
and then come and find me.
Okay?
"He was a bad man who did bad things well, and now he's gone."
Got it!
"He was a bad man, now he's gone from the well..."
[Judy] Now that is one happy tomato.
[chuckles]
I hope I do as well here.
- Hey, there's a good idea.
- Hmm.
Maybe we should fertilize our women, too.
- [both chuckle]
- I do love your good intentions.
- [Maureen] Hey, Judy.
- Hey.
Hi.
You've got quite a following.
Yeah, I was hoping the novelty would wear off soon.
Might have to hide myself in that corn.
[chuckles]
Oh, look, how beautiful!
Help yourself.
Oh!
All right.
[Red] Oh, really?
Free-for-all on the produce now, huh?
Regardless of who's in the club.
Who's worked the soil, pulled the weeds, tended the seedlings.
Is that the new policy?
- This is Judy King.
- Oh, I know who she is.
I've seen her... daytime TV program.
But we haven't had the pleasure.
Mrs. King is going to be joining your club, Red.
So I'll leave you to it.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
I'm sure you'll find a lot in common.
Hair and... accents.
You know, my daddy used to call me "Red." [laughs]
Really?
That's sweet. [chuckles]
My papa called me solnyshko.
It means little sun.
But I've grown bigger and hotter since then, and he's dead.
So what are you going to do with that ear, now that you've picked it?
Well, I guess that depends on what else I can find around here.
I could do a Southern fried corn, a dilled corn shooter,
Taiwanese-style street corn.
Listen to fancy pants.
I could shove it up your ass.
Hmm, I'm not so big on ass play.
What do you suggest I do, Miss Red?
I'm thinking.
- Can I have some seeds?
- [blowing]
You bought Ovaltine.
Reap what you sow.
Ovaltine's got vitamins.
I'll trade you Ovaltine powder later for some seeds now.
I'm good for it.
No deal.
You'll regret it.
That's some malty goodness you're passing up.
Excuse me?
You knew going into this I had bad knees.
My feet are killing me.
We are putting out a vibe.
If you are sitting and/or eating my seeds, no vibe.
Right now, there is no vibe.
See?
Look at this.
- All of a sudden, I'm approachable.
- Picking up or dropping off?
Neither.
We're out.
I gave you guys new ones yesterday.
We're hanging up our lacy intimates.
If this is because of the money Stella took, I'm good for it.
I'll pay you back.
It's not worth it anymore.
We're smelling the beginning of the end.
You and all your posturing, shipping the kangaroo down the hill.
[tutting]
It's starting to feel dangerous.
You've even got a heavy on the payroll.
Ha!
I see what you did there.
- "Heavy."
- Not on purpose.
Fine, jump ship like rats.
And I'm not talking about the Disney-Pixar kind.
I was gonna fire one of you anyway, but I'm not gonna say which one.
Chew on that.
We're gonna take a walk on the track, you wanna join us, kahuna?
No, she does not.
She's got bad knees.
[sighs]
Enjoy sweating for free.
I expect all my undies still in your possession returned posthaste.
[chuckling] "Posthaste"?
That's nuts.
- Do you have something to say?
- Sure.
But I'll wait till I'm with my friends.
Off the backboard. [clicking and grunts]
- [Poussey] Oh!
- [Brook laughs]
Short, black and bad at basketball.
- Subverting expectations since 1990.
- Oh, it's okay.
Litchfield's latest lesbos, in fun-size.
Look, how much longer do you think the world's longest game of Horse is gonna go on?
[exhales deeply] She ain't a lesbian.
I see.
Testing the waters before diving in face-first?
I'm attracted to people, not genders.
Well, aren't you special.
Tell you what, why don't you use some of that sexual fluidity to slide off the court so the real men can play?
[scoffs] Come on.
Even though I do think labeling is a total sham...
I see the power in reclaiming an epithet.
Like you guys have with "nigga."
Okay, maybe not that exactly.
But...
I really like you.
Like, really a lot.
And I just...
I wanna honor your feelings, you know, if you wanna call this something.
Like, we're girlfriend-girlfriend, or... lezzy togezzy.
[laughing] I don't know.
How about we say we're happy, yeah?
Leave it at that?
Okay. [chuckles]
Oh, shit.
Hey!
Hi!
Hi...
Judy, I'm...
Hey, girl. [chuckles]
[Poussey stammers]
You're...
Fuck!
[grumbling]
It is so cute how moony you get every time she's around.
By "cute" you mean, "lame as fuck."
Well, yeah.
You need to pull it together.
I mean, she's a person you admire, but she's still just a person.
A person.
Right.
You should be able to have a conversation with anyone.
Hi, I'm Brook.
I'm your neighbor.
I was wondering if you'd heard about the plans to build a Walmart at the corner of Exposition and Euclid?
Yeah, I heard about it.
Well, I'm one of a group of citizens trying to convince the city council to turn that lot into a park space instead.
I was wondering if you'd be willing to have a friendly discussion, or maybe even sign our petition?
- Sure... if you take your top off.
- [all snickering]
- Okay, that is inappropriate.
- Yes.
Inappropriate things do happen out there.
How would you handle it?
You really think a grown man is gonna ask me to take my top off?
Well, there's a sex offender at 3134 10th Street.
He might.
No, you do not have to go to the sex offender's house.
No one has to knock on any door that makes him or her feel uncomfortable.
But I do urge you all to be bold and stretch yourself.
By the way, has everyone signed their liability waivers?
Oh, shit.
I hear he likes little boys.
Little boy, Asian girl, are they really that far apart?
You said our break-up was going to be amicable.
Yeah, I said a lot of things.
So did you, like, "I love you.
I'll always love you.
This is not because of Oren."
Wait, what?
She dumped me to get with you.
I'm not sweet enough arm-candy.
Oh, my God!
Could you kids drop the soap opera for another time?
We're going out there this afternoon.
You need to feel like you're prepared.
Well, clearly, she's not.
She can't even handle "take your top off."
Okay, 50 bucks says I get more signatures than you, Ethan.
No bet.
People will sign just to shut you up.
But here's a bet.
Get the pedo to sign, I'll give you your 50 bucks.
And Oren will go on a date with you.
Cool?
- I'm not really in...
- Okay!
You are so on.
He will sign and you will give me cash, and I will spend it on a new hemp messenger bag and strawberry lube, because Oren seems like a strawberry kind of guy.
Well... [man] Great, now let's talk one more time about mirroring body language.
I'm just saying, if you bought me a watch,
I'd be on the time better.
- There's a clock on the wall.
- Not in my office.
I'll put a clock in your office.
Or you could buy me a watch, so when we out of the office like now,
I could tell you things like, "Hey, Mr. Caputo, we're only a few minutes late to meet Piscatella, and you the boss anyhow, so relax."
I will consider your watch request.
Hey, I'm just trying to make your life better.
This ain't about me.
By the way, what you want me to do once we there?
- Take notes.
- Hold up, hold up.
"Take notes." Got you.
[Piscatella] Mop it all around.
Damn!
This place is like Rehab Addict:
Litchfield Edition.
And with, like, real addicts.
[Piscatella] So, in a nutshell... electrical is still having Internet issues, plumbing works, but no hot water yet.
All beds and extraneous furniture are assembled and ready for move-in.
- [scribbling]
- Now, the interior paint...
Uh, inmate?
What are you possibly writing that will have any salience past this moment in time?
Well, Mr. Caputo wants notes.
Now, I don't know what salience is, but I think a checklist of what's completed and what's not is hella revalent.
You mean "rel." Relevant.
I mean, I'm trying to do my job, same as you, big man.
Are you...
suggesting that we are in any way, on any planet, in any universe, the same, inmate?
Why don't you go check on Luschek and the Internet situation?
- What?
- Let me watch you go.
Oh, you gonna "watch me" watch me?
I will watch... you.
- Go!
- [chuckles] I'm goin'.
It's clearly that... [whispers] time.
- Look at me go.
- Go.
- May I ask you a question, Mr. Caputo?
- Shoot.
How did you choose her to be your assistant, exactly?
- Between you and me?
- Yes, sir.
She's the only semi-intelligent one that I'm only... semi-attracted to.
[laughs]
Well, if you'll follow me, I'll show you the bathroom.
- [scribbling]
- What are you writing?
Man, why everybody act like they ain't never seen a black woman with a clipboard before?
No, it's your pen.
It's exorbitantly scratchy and it's giving me anxiety.
Damn, Word-A-Day.
I need to get me one of them calendars.
"Anxiety" wasn't from the calendar.
That's just me.
But... "exorbitant" was.
Check out these fat phone cords.
Shit, I could make so many bracelets out of the wires in one of these...
Uh-uh.
Those ain't phone cords.
They're for the Internet.
And believe me, you want some of them guards to be able to watch their porn and get it all out before they on duty, so you best leave it.
So, hey, how come you don't get to live here, Luschek?
- Because I have a home, inmate.
- Oh, yeah?
- An entire basement to myself.
- Hmm.
You gotta admit, though, it is kind of swanky... you know?
I mean, you could fit an entire family just right in here and still have room for a TV.
Couple of pictures of X-rays.
Home sweet home.
- Did you just say X-rays?
- I did say X-rays.
'Cause when my grandmammy broke her pelvis, all of us kids got X-rays.
'Cause the doctor was really nice, and my mom was doing him on the side.
- [both laugh]
- That's funny, huh?
He literally took an entire X-ray of my whole skeleton, and I hung it up on my wall like a fancy English guy.
But it was just pictures of bones instead of...
You know, it wasn't, like, real bones.
Your life is grotesque.
- Another big word.
- What are you even doing here?
Mr. Caputo wanted me to check up on the Internet issue.
Inmate...
Scar-neck, explain the problem.
It doesn't work.
There you go.
[Lorna] Hey, baby.
[Vince] Yeah, I thought you were getting home an hour ago.
Oh, I know, the traffic was awful coming back from the store.
I think there was a wreck or something.
Anyway, how was work?
How are you?
- Vinnie?
- Look, I'm sorry.
I'm just in a mood.
Well, don't you worry.
You just sit right down.
I'm gonna give you such a nice backrub.
- Lorna...
- [Lorna moans]
- Lorna!
- Honey, you're so tense.
I'm reaching around and I'm feeling down your chiseled and bumpy abs.
Oh, my goodness.
I just found your cock-a-doodle-doo and it's so hard.
- [woman knocking] Vinnie?
Hurry up!
- I'm busy!
All right?
Lorna, I can't really do this today, okay?
Well, can you at least try?
No, my roommates!
It's awkward.
Well, I'm talking about kissing crotches in front of 50 other women, but for you, it's awkward?
I don't know, I thought you were into that.
Well, uh...
Maybe you could feel that way about your roommates.
Don't say that.
Well, do you have a speaker?
Put me on speaker, baby.
I'll talk so nice for you and the boys.
[woman] Vinnie, are you gonna help him with his homework?
Lorna, my roommates are my parents and my kid brother.
[scoffs] What?
All right?
There, now you know.
Well, why didn't you say that before?
I mean, what kind of fantasy is that gonna be?
[stammers] You thought you married a man, not a boy.
Look, I gotta go, all right?
Gino's back from school.
I gotta help him with his homework.
[scoffs]
Okay.
I think he shares a room with his kid brother.
Does that mean no more phone-boning in front of everybody?
Because, legit, that shit was kind of gross.
But also hot.
I'm having mixed emotions right now.
Yeah, me, too.
[gasps]
She's taking all the green beans.
I asked her not to!
Nicely, even!
Ignored.
And her flunkeys, always lurking around now.
- Look!
- I'm looking.
In Russia, we have a saying... [speaking Russian]
"Don't open your mouth to eat other people's bread."
Or what?
Ask the Germans in wintertime.
- Uh, Miss Judy?
- Uh-huh.
Uh, I was wondering if you would sign my cookbook.
Of course.
That's so nice.
Um...
I'll buy one and bring it to you when we both get out.
All right, well, we have a date, then.
Now, thank you, ladies.
Bye-bye for now.
All right.
Mmm.
Hey, there, Judy King.
Oh, guilty as charged, in all respects.
That's a joke, darlin'.
Oh!
[laughs]
You know, a lot of people in here are funny without meaning to be.
I learned the hard way to hold my mirth.
Oh, well, let your mirth fly free.
I mean to be funny.
All right. [laughs]
Um... actually,
I was wondering if I could speak to you about my friend.
Oh, that little retarded girl?
She's actually not... challenged at all, which is what we're supposed to say, not the R-word.
Oh, uh...
"R"s, "F"s, "L-M-N-O-P"s and "Q"s.
You know, I get in more trouble for expanding those single letter words, but never "N" s.
Despite this drawl, I'm brighter than that.
So, now, you were saying?
About your friend who is not challenged.
- [chuckles]
- Am I allowed to say "special"?
No, she's not special.
Well, she is to me.
- Mmm.
- But not euphemistically.
She's a fan and whenever she sees you, she freaks out.
You've gotta understand.
Institutional racism... traps the most vulnerable people in our society in this cycle of incarceration which, in turn, leads to a cycle of poverty.
It makes someone like you...
someone rich and powerful and white, virtually unapproachable.
All right, so now let me get this straight.
Your friend acts like a moron around me because she's black and poor?
- Is that right?
- Basically... yes.
[sighs] I think her mother was a crack addict or something.
You might as well be an alien.
But you could bridge the divide.
- The way you did.
- Yeah, exactly!
[chuckles]
All right, how about this?
Why don't you bring her over at lunch?
Okay. [chuckles]
It'll be like, uh...
the 1% sitting with the other 1%.
Oh, my God.
"The other 1%" is such a good hashtag.
[chuckles] [chuckles]
[man on TV] The New Orleans police put out a call to...
- Hi!
My name is Brook...
- Look and I was wondering if...
Take your picture or smash an egg in my face, or whatever you need to do for you and your friends to get your jollies.
- But spare me the setup, all right?
- I don't have a setup.
You know who I am?
Yeah, I do, actually.
You're a member of the community who has as much right as any of your neighbors to be concerned about the big-box monstrosity that's being proposed for the corner of Exposition and Euclid.
I'd be happy to talk about it with you, if you have the time.
Look, I'm watching this Hurricane Katrina stuff.
It's really intense.
The world's gonna be lousy with Katrinas if we let mega-corporations like Walmart carbon-bomb our planet.
You wanna come in?
Sure.
Yeah, I'll give you the whole shpiel.
Spiel.
Sorry, I never know how to pronounce that.
Wait, um... how old are you?
Nineteen.
Okay.
Come in.
[man on TV] ...aspect of this terrible hurricane that came on land with 145 mile-an-hour...
Okay.
I don't know if you realize, but the introduction of mega-retailers, like Walmart, almost invariably have a negative effect on property values...
- You're so nervous.
- I'm not nervous.
I'm passionate about saving local businesses.
Like Lola's Bloomers.
- May I?
- Sure.
Sure.
Conservative estimates are that there will be thousands of more cars in the neighborhood per day because of the construction...
It says you wanna put a park in instead.
I can't live within 2,500 feet of a park.
They would literally kick me out of my own home.
Sorry.
Can I talk about the elephant in the room for a second?
I wish you wouldn't.
I look across from me and I don't see a monster.
I see a human being fighting to control the animalistic parts of his brain, true grit overcoming impulse.
Not everybody judges you.
What if I told you it was kiddie porn?
I'd... say you need support, and I'd applaud your restraint for finding an outlet for your compulsions.
[scoffs] Wow!
You will really say whatever it takes.
Well, it was a lot worse than kiddie porn.
Wanna see?
No, I don't...
I don't need...
No.
No need.
Um...
Wait, all you did was have sex on the beach?
Consenting adults on an empty beach.
Well, except for the creeper that filmed it and turned us in to the cops.
But you think that pervo got in trouble?
That is insane.
I mean... [sighs] You are such a cautionary tale.
I would be, if people got the story right.
But once I had to go around door-to-door announcing my status, the rumors got started...
I don't know.
It's all so fucked.
Here.
It's not like Walmart's gonna lose.
Awesome.
[sharpener whirring]
[phone ringing]
- Oh...
- [continues ringing]
Uh... [clears throat]
Warden Caputo's office.
This is Ms. Jefferson speaking, how may I assist you?
[man] Is Warden Caputo available?
Let me place you on a brief hold while I go and check.
[beeping]
Fuck.
Oh, well, you gonna call back.
Hello?
I'm still here.
Damn, you are still there.
Then why the little light go out?
Anyway, don't matter, I ain't got him right now.
Will you please let him know I called?
All right, you take good care now.
- Yeah.
- [breathes deeply]
Shit.
What?
What happened?
I didn't quite get his name.
[sighs] You don't know who it was?
Well, it was some brother, sounded like a salesman-type, if you ask me.
So I probably did you a favor there.
Oh!
And then some white lady, she called about a get-together.
Mmm-hmm.
It happened twice?
Jesus, Jefferson, what am I paying you for?
Are you sure she said "get-together"?
What does that even mean?
Like...
like, a meeting?
Like a meeting.
Or...
like a date, maybe.
You holding out on me?
You somebody's Ca-baby-boo-to?
You're on thin fucking ice, Jefferson.
Was it Linda?
Possibly.
It wasn't Natalie, was it?
[clicks tongue] Linda sounds more right.
Okay.
Get Linda from MCC on the line.
All right.
Press the button that says "Line one."
- One.
- Nine and the number.
Nine...
Got you.
- [muttering] - [line ringing]
- [clears throat] - [Linda] Uh, hello?
Yes, hello.
I have Director Caputo.
I will transfer you now.
[beeps] [blows raspberries] Shit!
- [dialing] - [phone rings]
Warden Caputo's office.
[Caputo] Jefferson, I got it.
My bad!
My bad!
- [Linda] Hello, uh, Joe?
- Linda, hi.
Uh...
Jefferson, hang up your line.
I don't wanna disconnect y'all.
Hang up the phone!
Uh, I'm still training her.
Uh, I got your message about a get-together.
Oh, uh... wrong Linda, I think.
But we do need to celebrate our victory.
All these veterans becoming guards.
Yes.
Yes, we absolutely do.
Any chance you're free tonight?
Tonight?
Yes, it's perfect.
Um...
We can celebrate and, uh, talk business.
- How about La Fontana's at 8:00?
- Yeah, great. [chuckles]
- Great.
I'll see you tonight.
- Okay, bye.
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]
Ah!
Even the staff waits for the bathroom now, hmm?
What can I do for you, Red?
[sighs]
I want to talk to you about the King woman.
You two are hitting it off, right?
You gave her the run of my garden.
How did you think that would go?
You know, planting a flag on the Moon doesn't mean that you own it.
You're Russian.
I thought you'd appreciate that attitude.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm only concerned for her.
Respect in prison has to be earned.
I don't know about that.
You've received a lot of leeway from staff around here.
You seem to be doing all right.
Was that what this is about?
Are you punishing me?
Did you do something wrong?
I did the only reasonable thing I could.
There's no such thing as a consensual relationship between a prisoner and a guard.
Lorna's wedding was a bittersweet end to a relationship that never actually happened, Sam.
- [toilet flushes]
- You're reading something into this that isn't there, Reznikov.
And what goes on with Mrs. King is none of your business.
You're pampering her.
Oops!
[sighs]
She even gets a magazine?
What do you want, Ruiz?
I heard about your labor dispute.
I thought maybe my friends could fill in?
This is Pidge.
You know Ouija, or she knows you.
And that's Zirconia.
Zirconia?
I took out all my rocks before I come in, so nobody would think they was diamonds and rip 'em out.
Plus...
I don't think it's allowed.
They're all ready and willing to join your panty party.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Privately, please.
What are you doing?
This is not a publicly traded company.
Its very existence depends on keeping its existence hidden.
Chill the fuck out.
I was just trying to help you.
I don't need your help.
What I need is your discretion, and you bringing a bunch of thugs into my house is the opposite of that.
I decide who knows about Felonious Spunk.
I decide who gets hired.
I am the prison pussy panty business.
Somebody's getting a little big for her panties, I think.
I'm gonna choose to assume you're talking about yourself and take that as an apology.
[snickers]
You're talking shit out a paper asshole, Chapman.
But when an actual hard-ass bitch decides to call you on it... well... [tutting and inhales sharply]
Pretty sure she was talking about herself on that last one.
[Suzanne] It's not fair.
It is the most unfair thing that's ever happened in this prison.
Mmm, what about when Carson went to SHU for sneezing too loud?
Or what's-her-face, the Puerto Rican girl, with the gimpy eye?
And when she got the wrong meds by accident in the med line and went nutso, and gimped her other eye with a spork.
Now, she double gimp-eyed.
Or how 'bout when Pornstache used to make the meth heads blow him for drugs in the mop closet?
Or the time Chapman got furlough?
I retract and redact.
New statement.
It's easily the top 138 most unfair things that has ever happened here.
What is?
Your new job.
My job is the bomb!
You sit at a desk all day when you were plucked from the most rewarding job.
I'm not saying it's on par with all the human rights abuses in here, but women fought for a long time to shake the role of desk-ridden secretary.
Are you for real?
- Hey!
- [all laugh]
Do you get the Internet?
- Do you have a mini-fridge?
- Ah!
Do you have a skeleton key made from real human bone that opens a door to a world of talking animals?
Man, I got me a clipboard and a personal relationship with Mr. Caputo.
- [mimics buzzing] - [all laugh]
Man, if George R. R. Martin wrote about prisons,
I'd be, like... the Hand of the Warden.
Yo, don't the Hand always die in them books?
Man, whatever, okay?
Winter is coming, bitches.
And I'm getting me a watch.
- For real?
- Yes.
Hey. [chuckles]
Yo...
I feel like she's smiling and waving at me.
[mouthing]
Maybe she can see dead people and there's one standing right... right in front of you.
Are the hairs standing up on the back of your neck?
I feel like I'm the dead person.
I... may have set you up on a blind friend date!
- Wait, you did what?
No!
- Surprise!
- What?
- [chuckling] I just talked you up.
- Go!
Be yourself.
- Yo... [both giggling]
- Go, P!
- Go, P!
Go, P!
- Let me fix your clothes.
- Get off me!
Hey. [chuckles]
You must be Poo-see.
She called her Poo-see!
No, I'm sorry.
Did I say that right?
Yeah, yeah.
Poussey, it's French.
Oh, French.
I was named after a great aunt who hid pearls from the Yankees under her pendulous breasts.
[laughs nervously]
And she also brewed a famous home remedy that supposedly cured hookworm.
- Not quite so exotic.
- Listen.
- Hmm.
- I...
I feel...
I feel like I need to apologize...
- Uh-uh.
- ...for just being all, like, weird and stuff, you know, I just...
- I dig your whole thing, you know.
- [chuckles]
And I just, I watch your show so much, so seeing you in person was just, you know, I got all tongue-tied, and fan-girly and stuff.
So I'd try to say words, but when they came out of my mouth, it just sound like...
All right, all right, all right.
Relax, darlin'.
Your friend has told me the whole story.
She has got you covered.
You gotta sink a hook in the keepers, especially in this place.
- Uh-huh.
- You know, it's funny.
Me and Brook, we never would've crossed paths.
I mean, growing up all over the world, bouncing culture to culture with a strict, conservative family, versus, you know, sleeping in tent cities with a bunch of dirty hippies, eating food out of dumpsters.
Oof!
You have been through a lot.
[stammers] Nah, it was...
I mean, it was good.
Well, I mean, it was hard, you know?
Like, I guess being transient, and not really having any long-term friends, but I do know three languages.
Hmm!
Wait...
- you know three languages?
- [chuckles] Yeah.
How does the child of a crack whore learn three languages?
- That is remarkable.
- Excuse me?
What languages?
English, French and German.
Did you just call my mother a crack whore?
My mother had a masters in Art History and she could barely take an aspirin.
- Excuse me?
- My dad is a major in the army.
I was supposed to go to West Point.
I guess you were expecting just another ghetto prison rat.
At least one of us lives up to the stereotype.
What, no!
Sweetheart, no!
You have snatched the taste right out of my mouth.
I'm just parroting what your girlfriend told me about you.
You came out of a cycle of poverty, blah, blah, blah.
I mean, it seems to me that you two formed this relationship without talking much.
Did you know I am learning Italian?
[sighs]
[stammers] [sighs]
[indistinct chatter]
So, did Chester the Molester sign?
You owe me 50 bucks.
- Whoa.
- And you better take me out.
I can't believe you had the balls to do it.
Whatever, he probably finger-banged his 15-year-old girlfriend when he was 17 or something else no big.
The sex offender lists are full of sob stories about people's lives being ruined by technicalities.
[scoffs] You know, as a matter of fact, he was a fucking horrible child-molester rapist.
Because I'm so sure he told you that.
Yeah, 'cause he...
He fucking tried to seduce me.
He invited me in for lemonade.
- And you went in?
- Yeah.
He told me I didn't look 19.
[inhales deeply] That's when I knew I was in trouble.
Shit.
He stroked my hair.
[scoffs] He wanted to brag, so he showed me the newspaper article about how he stalked this nine-year-old girl from his church, for, like, a year.
Earning her trust, gradually convincing her to...
Well, to... [sighs] To... [exhales sharply] And then I was running down the street.
For your fucking bet, Ethan.
For 50 fucking dollars.
But also because I... because I wanted to go out with you.
[exhales deeply]
[Caputo] I really appreciate you coming all the way down from Utica.
Sorry, again, I couldn't get a seat in one of the gondolas.
No, no, it's okay.
This is great.
I'm really glad that you thought I called.
[chuckles]
These new guards, they're a... they're a big win for us.
Like, "us" us.
And the company, but especially "us" us.
Yeah.
We're not a bad team, Linda from Purchasing.
To us, Joe from Litchfield Human Activity, and our continued wins.
- And to the veterans, of course.
- Of course. [chuckles]
♪ Happy, happy birthday clappy ♪
♪ Join us as we celebrate ♪
♪ Clap your hands and dance around ♪
♪ Have a laugh and eat some cake ♪
♪ Happy birthday, happy birthday Happy birthday ♪
♪ You're so great!
♪ [all cheering]
What?
The bald guy... is, uh... one of our former guards.
A really good guy.
Donaldson.
A good guy...
who walked out in the middle of an inmate transfer/high-profile self-surrender?
Yeah, I get your point.
Don't beat yourself up, Joe.
You handled that situation like a total boss.
Meant both literally and in that hip-kid lingo way.
Jesus!
He's not even a fucking waiter.
- He's a busboy.
- [laughs]
- What?
- No, just... you could've lost your job... or faced prosecution had inmates gone missing that day.
I mean, you're concerned about...
these jerks that hung you out to dry.
You're quite a guy, Joe Caputo.
[waiter] There you go, sir.
Whenever you're ready.
- Uh, do me a favor, will you?
- [waiter] Mmm-hmm.
- The change is yours.
- Okay.
Give a 20 to that busboy over there.
Wait till we're gone.
I don't want to make a thing of it, okay?
[waiter] Okay.
Hey, Mr. Caputo!
- Look, Donaldson...
- I don't need your money, Mr. Caputo.
It's nothing, take it, it's...
Nah, this is not to help me.
This is to make you feel better about that... pardon my French, miss, bullshit you pulled.
- Okay, Joe, let's go.
- The bullshit I pulled?
I work three jobs.
This is the good one.
O'Neill?
I heard he had kidney stones.
But no health insurance.
So he thought he'd power through, wait for it to pass.
It didn't.
Now he's on dialysis.
He may lose a kidney.
- Jesus.
- Yeah.
So take your $20 and drown your conscience in a bottle of gin, because paying me to feel better about it ain't gonna work.
Donaldson.
You tell O'Neill I'm sorry about his stones.
I'm also sorry you gotta work here.
But I need you to understand something.
I'm sorry for you.
I don't regret firing any of you.
You walked out on the biggest day the prison's faced in 25 fuckin' years.
You put the prisoners at risk, you put your fellow cos at risk, you put this whole town in danger!
The shit hit and instead of moving the fan away, [stammers] you plugged it in and you hit "oscillate."
I was gonna make you captain of the guard, Wade.
Really.
You keep the 20.
Least I could do for helping me dodge a bullet.
I'm sorry about this.
These houses are yours to live in, but they are prison property.
They will be treated with respect.
As long as they are treated with respect, you will be as well.
Okay, the warden has asked me to do a... icebreaker event.
I will demonstrate this activity with CO...
- McCullough, sir.
- Okay, McCullough.
Tell me two true things about you and one lie.
I will attempt to guess the lie.
Okay, um... [woman speaking indistinctly on PA]
I came to say I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Okay, please don't lock me out.
You're right to be upset.
How would you know?
You don't know anything about me, Soso.
[scoffs]
And, what, you think I'm upset about my mom's crack abuse or because I grew up poor, black and uneducated in the urban jungle?
Okay, I watched The Wire a lot.
I made assumptions.
But you spent time with me.
I mean, did you even listen when I talked?
Like, what the fuck about me, besides the color of my skin, would indicate that I'm some indigent hood rat?
- I don't know.
- [scoffs]
No, it's fine, it's cool.
I'm guilty, too.
I won't lie.
You know, I like the story of the rich, white, hippie girl in my bed.
I've been working that on my end.
I don't want this to end.
[Gloria] What good is coming up here and sitting in the lobby every weekend gonna do?
She wants to get Sophia out, she needs to get a lawyer or a non-profit involved or something.
Ms. Burset said that the prison has tons of lawyers, so at least coming up here and waiting for the warden to come out to get into his face is something...
Michael started a Kickstarter campaign.
Kickstarter?
What that mean?
Not much, usually.
There's nothing to be ashamed about.
Plenty of guys live with their parents.
Right, yeah, I mean, you know...
I'm just doing this to save money, you know?
'Cause I could live on my own, obviously.
Oof!
Obviously.
I mean, very, very obviously.
It just makes the most financial sense, you know?
For the both of us.
Oh!
That's my manicotti, always thinking of his little lasagna.
[chuckles] Hey...
I made you something.
Fresh baked.
Lorna...
No, no, no, don't say it.
You know, even though it took a lot of time, and I had to go to the store twice, you... are worth it.
[exhales deeply] [sniffs]
Hmm.
Mmm!
- Mmm!
- It's still warm.
My favorite.
Peanut butter and MM's.
- Snickerdoodles.
- Oh!
- I love you.
- Oh!
And you should.
I am quite a catch.
Oh, my God, you are.
You so are.
[exhales deeply]
Fuck.
I want you.
- Vinnie.
- I want you.
It's our living room.
The neighbors want to look in, that's their good luck.
I'm already unbuttoning my shirt.
My goodness, you know that I can't resist your muscular chest.
Oh, my God.
My hands, they're in your hair right now.
- I'm stroking it real soft.
- [panting]
Till I grab a handful of it and pull it back.
[moans] You're such a man.
[Vince] Oh, God.
I'm licking your neck.
Kissing your ears.
My hand is on that big mountain in your pants, and I am unzipping you right now.
And I'm pulling your shirt off real slow.
No, no, no, it's a button-up.
- I unbutton it real slow.
- No, no, no, tear it off.
- Pulling it off.
It's off.
- Tear it off.
It's off, the buttons, they're everywhere.
They're everywhere.
Oh, my God, my mouth...
My mouth is on those big titties.
- My nipples are so hard right now.
- Oh, my God, my cock.
Oh, my God, my cock is really hard.
I know, baby.
No, it's really hard.
Like, right now, it's really hard.
- I know, Vinnie...
- Oh, God.
- Vinnie, put it inside me.
- Yeah?
Oh, my God, it's in you.
Oh, it's in you.
- Oh, my God, it's in you.
- [Lorna moaning]
It feels so good.
You're so wet.
You are so wet.
I actually am.
- I'm super wet right now.
- I know.
[both panting]
Do it to me.
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
- Don't stop.
- I'm not stopping.
I'm not stopping.
I'm not gonna stop.
I'm not gonna stop.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, baby!
- [strained] Oh, my God!
[yells] [man] He's humping the table.
[Vince sighs]
- [panting] - [woman] What the hell?
Hey!
Hey, stay right here.
Stay looking at me, all right?
Jesus Christ.
[man] Don't think I don't see you.
Pleasure, as always.
Also, I want to talk to you about something.
If this is about last week, I don't get to control my flow.
I think it's all the stress of all these new bitches in here.
I know these last few weeks have had their challenges.
So...
I wanted to say thank you.
And keep up the good work.
Your morale is important to me.
Oh!
That's so sweet.
Ovaltine?
It's to make chocolate milk.
Pretty much only Chinese people drink it now, which is probably why it's at commissary, but it's really good.
So, it's chocolate powder for my powdered milk?
It's got vitamins.
Oh!
See?
New bitches.
Why are they always staring like they're waiting for a donkey show to start?
I don't think they're staring at you.
They were following us earlier.
And you didn't say anything?
People can stare.
- It's a free country.
- Not in prison.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
I bet your Bloody Mary gonna come early, too.
[indistinct chatter]
Hey.
Hey.
[sighs]
You okay?
- No.
You?
- [exhales deeply]
No.
Do you want to talk about it?
Not really.
You?
But have you ever heard the phrase "paper asshole"?
[chuckles] No.
Ruiz said it to me.
I think I pissed off the Dominicans.
Relax.
You run the Litchfield panty company...
not the Sinaloa drug cartel.
No one's stitching your face to a soccer ball.
See ya around, Pipes.
[Gloria] What's this?
[in Spanish] It's for the eyes.
Takes the red out.
[in English] I know what it is, pendeja.
What's it doing out?
It's contraband.
Whoops!
I need to be more careful.
Yeah, you do.
A few drops of that falls into the food, and this whole prison will be shitting their brains out.
Really?
I had no idea.
She acts so tough, but to stress-eat this food?
The poor woman.
[laughs] Oh, you evil, Russian bitch.
What can I say?
I do a lot with a little.
[laughs]
No!
No!
No!
[inmate] What the fuck?
That's my toilet paper.
- [defecating]
- Oh!
[rap music playing in distance]
I talk a lot.
I babble... until I find something the person I'm with is interested in.
And I'll say anything I can to get them to like me.
But I... really... really like you.
The real you.
[scoffs] You don't know the real me.
But I want to.
So in, like, a minute, I'm gonna put down this radio, and I'm gonna listen to you tell me about yourself.
And I'm not gonna try to rewrite your story in my head.
And then, when you're done, I'd like to tell you about myself.
[sighs]
And some of it will be embarrassing and ugly... but mostly boring. [exhales]
And then... maybe afterwards, we could, like...
quiz each other or something?
Eminem?
[chuckles]
Yeah, it's not a presumption about you liking rap.
It's just...
AM 700 The OG is the only station that comes in clear.
[snickers and clears throat]
Jackson, North Carolina.
Is that where you were born?
No, that's where my great-grandmother was born.
I mean, stuffed crust shoulda revolutionized pizza,
- but it was just a fad.
- Man, nah, it's the same thing.
- Man, it is not the same thing!
- All right.
'Cause that's Italian...
this is Mexican.
You got a stuffed tortilla, and you stuff that with more stuff.
- [faint humming]
- Man, it's my golden ticket, and I'm gonna do it right with that business savvy and shit.
- [scatting]
- Hey, hey, hey!
Do you hear that?
[humming continues]
What is that?
[inmate] Wow, look at that.
[inmates chatting indistinctly]
That's a drone.
- It's a drone.
- Shit!
What's it doing here?
Like we some Iraqi wedding?
Man, come on.
We're gonna be late.
He was a bad man and we did good things.
He did bad things and we killed him good.
No, we did bad.
No!
We did well.
[whispering] Hey.
Have you seen Whitehill?
Yeah, I forgot the garden needed turning.
If Rikerson comes back, just tell him where we went, okay?
Oh, fuck!
[grunting]
- No!
No!
- Lolly, Lolly.
- [shushing]
- Listen, listen.
They know!
They know!
They found you!
We have to move the body!
[whispering] Shut up.
We cannot move the body.
There's drones.
Stop it, Lolly.
We cannot move it.
If I told you I already moved it, would it calm you down?
Maybe for a minute.
Good, 'cause I did.
Now, scat.
[fence opens and closes]
You didn't actually move it.
Hell, no.
And I'm not about to.
[sucks teeth] We're gonna have to kill her.
[rap music playing]
[cell door slams] [theme song playing]
[cell door slams]
[cell door slams] [inmate speaking Spanish]
[Taystee exhales heavily]
How are we supposed to clean the floors with nonstop bitches tracking their shit through?
[Suzanne] We are like he whom the gods have condemned to push the boulder up the hill only to watch it roll back down.
Oh, right, right, right, right.
And then he has to cut his arm off to get out from underneath it.
What is that guy's name?
Oh, James Franco!
Sisyphus.
I did hear that rumor.
You know those Hollywood types, they will stick it in any warm hole.
Well, you don't have to be from Hollywood to wanna put it in a warm place.
It's called having a dick.
No, my Vinnie would never.
Well, maybe not in a man-hole, but you away a long time.
He could be getting his MM melting in some ho's mouth and not in his hand.
[chuckles]
No.
No, that's never gonna happen because we're talking sexy on the phone, like, 24/7, and I mean real sexy.
And I give very good phone.
Are we talking about peanut MM's or regular?
[both laughing] [man on PA] Inmate Jefferson, Tasha Jefferson, report to the warden's office.
Inmate Tasha Jefferson to the warden's office.
Who's Tasha Jefferson?
Oh, Taystee?
Taystee, go to the warden's office.
We have a warden?
-Your name's Tasha?
-What is this about?
The main thing is answering the phones and organizational stuff.
General assisting.
I don't know.
I've never had an assistant before.
We will figure it out together.
And you swear this is legit?
'Cause I seen Shawshank and I don't wanna go to Seg because I did your taxes too good.
I guarantee you, you will never see anything with my social security number on it.
Never say never.
You work for MCC.
Maybe one day you realize you need food stamps and you don't know how to fill out the forms.
Well, I'm your girl.
I can walk you through it, but I'm gonna need them digits.
However...
[whispers] I'm a vault.
I don't say nothing.
And I ain't never crawling through a tunnel of piss and dookie, so rest easy.
Okay.
As of now, you're off janitorial and you're with me.
Praise Jesus.
Every day.
When I'm working, you're working.
Is this 'cause I won at job fair?
-Sure.
-[scoffs] I told them bitches.
Take a clipboard, write things down, look busy.
Outside.
Alert!
Alert!
Alert!
-What?
-Mmm!
[Alex] What?
Healy's just showing her around.
Frieda's over there.
It's all good.
Why does she get some special garden tour like some fancy Shiba Inu?
[scoffs] She's a celebrity, okay?
Fucking relax.
Uh... [stammering]
Not okay.
Not...
Not really relaxed.
I think you are way too relaxed... to be in this big, brown shit-uation that we're in!
Lolly, believe me.
My insides have completely liquefied and I wanna vomit all the time... but I have chosen to keep my voice low and appear calm.
You have to do the same.
-[exhales deeply] I can't.
-You have to.
-Look at me.
You...
-[inhales sharply]
Listen.
You have to.
Change the record in your head.
Play, "He was a bad man.
We did what we had to do and we did it well.
So now it's through."
It's a mantra.
Say it.
"We did what we had to do and we did it well."
You forgot the bad man part.
And the end.
But that's the idea.
So whenever you're feeling worried, whenever your thoughts start to... wander, just bring them back to the mantra...
and then come and find me.
Okay?
"He was a bad man who did bad things well, and now he's gone."
Got it!
"He was a bad man, now he's gone from the well..."
[Judy] Now that is one happy tomato.
[chuckles]
I hope I do as well here.
-Hey, there's a good idea.
-Hmm.
Maybe we should fertilize our women, too.
-[both chuckle]
-I do love your good intentions.
-[Maureen] Hey, Judy.
-Hey.
Hi.
You've got quite a following.
Yeah, I was hoping the novelty would wear off soon.
Might have to hide myself in that corn.
[chuckles]
Oh, look, how beautiful!
Help yourself.
Oh!
All right.
[Red] Oh, really?
Free-for-all on the produce now, huh?
Regardless of who's in the club.
Who's worked the soil, pulled the weeds, tended the seedlings.
Is that the new policy?
-This is Judy King.
-Oh, I know who she is.
I've seen her... daytime TV program.
But we haven't had the pleasure.
Mrs. King is going to be joining your club, Red.
So I'll leave you to it.
-Thank you.
-Yeah.
I'm sure you'll find a lot in common.
Hair and... accents.
You know, my daddy used to call me "Red." [laughs]
Really?
That's sweet.
[chuckles]
My papa called me solnyshko.
It means little sun.
But I've grown bigger and hotter since then, and he's dead.
So what are you going to do with that ear, now that you've picked it?
Well, I guess that depends on what else I can find around here.
I could do a Southern fried corn, a dilled corn shooter,
Taiwanese-style street corn.
Listen to fancy pants.
I could shove it up your ass.
Hmm, I'm not so big on ass play.
What do you suggest I do, Miss Red?
I'm thinking.
-Can I have some seeds?
-[blowing]
You bought Ovaltine.
Reap what you sow.
Ovaltine's got vitamins.
I'll trade you Ovaltine powder later for some seeds now.
I'm good for it.
No deal.
You'll regret it.
That's some malty goodness you're passing up.
Excuse me?
You knew going into this I had bad knees.
My feet are killing me.
We are putting out a vibe.
If you are sitting and/or eating my seeds, no vibe.
Right now, there is no vibe.
See?
Look at this.
-All of a sudden, I'm approachable.
-Picking up or dropping off?
Neither.
We're out.
I gave you guys new ones yesterday.
We're hanging up our lacy intimates.
If this is because of the money Stella took, I'm good for it.
I'll pay you back.
It's not worth it anymore.
We're smelling the beginning of the end.
You and all your posturing, shipping the kangaroo down the hill.
[tutting]
It's starting to feel dangerous.
You've even got a heavy on the payroll.
Ha!
I see what you did there.
-"Heavy."
-Not on purpose.
Fine, jump ship like rats.
And I'm not talking about the Disney-Pixar kind.
I was gonna fire one of you anyway, but I'm not gonna say which one.
Chew on that.
We're gonna take a walk on the track, you wanna join us, kahuna?
No, she does not.
She's got bad knees.
[sighs]
Enjoy sweating for free.
I expect all my undies still in your possession returned posthaste.
[chuckling] "Posthaste"?
That's nuts.
-Do you have something to say?
-Sure.
But I'll wait till I'm with my friends.
Off the backboard.
[clicking and grunts]
-[Poussey] Oh!
-[Brook laughs]
Short, black and bad at basketball.
-Subverting expectations since 1990.
-Oh, it's okay.
Litchfield's latest lesbos, in fun-size.
Look, how much longer do you think the world's longest game of Horse is gonna go on?
[exhales deeply] She ain't a lesbian.
I see.
Testing the waters before diving in face-first?
I'm attracted to people, not genders.
Well, aren't you special.
Tell you what, why don't you use some of that sexual fluidity to slide off the court so the real men can play?
[scoffs] Come on.
Even though I do think labeling is a total sham...
I see the power in reclaiming an epithet.
Like you guys have with "nigga."
Okay, maybe not that exactly.
But...
I really like you.
Like, really a lot.
And I just--
I wanna honor your feelings, you know, if you wanna call this something.
Like, we're girlfriend-girlfriend, or... lezzy togezzy.
[laughing] I don't know.
How about we say we're happy, yeah?
Leave it at that?
Okay. [chuckles]
Oh, shit.
Hey!
Hi!
Hi...
Judy, I'm...
Hey, girl.
[chuckles]
[Poussey stammers]
You're...
Fuck!
[grumbling]
It is so cute how moony you get every time she's around.
By "cute" you mean, "lame as fuck."
Well, yeah.
You need to pull it together.
I mean, she's a person you admire, but she's still just a person.
A person.
Right.
You should be able to have a conversation with anyone.
Hi, I'm Brook.
I'm your neighbor.
I was wondering if you'd heard about the plans to build a Walmart at the corner of Exposition and Euclid?
Yeah, I heard about it.
Well, I'm one of a group of citizens trying to convince the city council to turn that lot into a park space instead.
I was wondering if you'd be willing to have a friendly discussion, or maybe even sign our petition?
-Sure... if you take your top off.
-[all snickering]
-Okay, that is inappropriate.
-Yes.
Inappropriate things do happen out there.
How would you handle it?
You really think a grown man is gonna ask me to take my top off?
Well, there's a sex offender at 3134 10th Street.
He might.
No, you do not have to go to the sex offender's house.
No one has to knock on any door that makes him or her feel uncomfortable.
But I do urge you all to be bold and stretch yourself.
By the way, has everyone signed their liability waivers?
Oh, shit.
I hear he likes little boys.
Little boy, Asian girl, are they really that far apart?
You said our break-up was going to be amicable.
Yeah, I said a lot of things.
So did you, like, "I love you.
I'll always love you.
This is not because of Oren."
Wait, what?
She dumped me to get with you.
I'm not sweet enough arm-candy.
Oh, my God!
Could you kids drop the soap opera for another time?
We're going out there this afternoon.
You need to feel like you're prepared.
Well, clearly, she's not.
She can't even handle "take your top off."
Okay, 50 bucks says I get more signatures than you, Ethan.
No bet.
People will sign just to shut you up.
But here's a bet.
Get the pedo to sign, I'll give you your 50 bucks.
And Oren will go on a date with you.
Cool?
-I'm not really in--
-Okay!
You are so on.
He will sign and you will give me cash, and I will spend it on a new hemp messenger bag and strawberry lube, because Oren seems like a strawberry kind of guy.
Well-- [man] Great, now let's talk one more time about mirroring body language.
I'm just saying, if you bought me a watch, I'd be on the time better.
-There's a clock on the wall.
-Not in my office.
I'll put a clock in your office.
Or you could buy me a watch, so when we out of the office like now,
I could tell you things like, "Hey, Mr. Caputo, we're only a few minutes late to meet Piscatella, and you the boss anyhow, so relax."
I will consider your watch request.
Hey, I'm just trying to make your life better.
This ain't about me.
By the way, what you want me to do once we there?
-Take notes.
-Hold up, hold up.
"Take notes." Got you.
[Piscatella] Mop it all around.
Damn!
This place is like Rehab Addict:
Litchfield Edition.
And with, like, real addicts.
[Piscatella] So, in a nutshell... electrical is still having Internet issues, plumbing works, but no hot water yet.
All beds and extraneous furniture are assembled and ready for move-in.
-[scribbling]
-Now, the interior paint--
Uh, inmate?
What are you possibly writing that will have any salience past this moment in time?
Well, Mr. Caputo wants notes.
Now, I don't know what salience is, but I think a checklist of what's completed and what's not is hella revalent.
You mean "rel." Relevant.
I mean, I'm trying to do my job, same as you, big man.
Are you...
suggesting that we are in any way, on any planet, in any universe, the same, inmate?
Why don't you go check on Luschek and the Internet situation?
-What?
-Let me watch you go.
Oh, you gonna "watch me" watch me?
I will watch... you.
-Go!
-[chuckles] I'm goin'.
It's clearly that...
[whispers] time.
-Look at me go.
-Go.
-May I ask you a question, Mr. Caputo?
-Shoot.
How did you choose her to be your assistant, exactly?
-Between you and me?
-Yes, sir.
She's the only semi-intelligent one that I'm only... semi-attracted to.
[laughs]
Well, if you'll follow me, I'll show you the bathroom.
-[scribbling]
-What are you writing?
Man, why everybody act like they ain't never seen a black woman with a clipboard before?
No, it's your pen.
It's exorbitantly scratchy and it's giving me anxiety.
Damn, Word-A-Day.
I need to get me one of them calendars.
"Anxiety" wasn't from the calendar.
That's just me.
But... "exorbitant" was.
Check out these fat phone cords.
Shit, I could make so many bracelets out of the wires in one of these--
Uh-uh.
Those ain't phone cords.
They're for the Internet.
And believe me, you want some of them guards to be able to watch their porn and get it all out before they on duty, so you best leave it.
So, hey, how come you don't get to live here, Luschek?
-Because I have a home, inmate.
-Oh, yeah?
-An entire basement to myself.
-Hmm.
You gotta admit, though, it is kind of swanky... you know?
I mean, you could fit an entire family just right in here and still have room for a TV.
Couple of pictures of X-rays.
Home sweet home.
-Did you just say X-rays?
-I did say X-rays.
'Cause when my grandmammy broke her pelvis, all of us kids got X-rays.
'Cause the doctor was really nice, and my mom was doing him on the side.
-[both laugh]
-That's funny, huh?
He literally took an entire X-ray of my whole skeleton, and I hung it up on my wall like a fancy English guy.
But it was just pictures of bones instead of--
You know, it wasn't, like, real bones.
Your life is grotesque.
-Another big word.
-What are you even doing here?
Mr. Caputo wanted me to check up on the Internet issue.
Inmate...
Scar-neck, explain the problem.
It doesn't work.
There you go.
[Lorna] Hey, baby.
[Vince] Yeah, I thought you were getting home an hour ago.
Oh, I know, the traffic was awful coming back from the store.
I think there was a wreck or something.
Anyway, how was work?
How are you?
-Vinnie?
-Look, I'm sorry.
I'm just in a mood.
Well, don't you worry.
You just sit right down.
I'm gonna give you such a nice backrub.
-Lorna...
-[Lorna moans]
-Lorna!
-Honey, you're so tense.
I'm reaching around and I'm feeling down your chiseled and bumpy abs.
Oh, my goodness.
I just found your cock-a-doodle-doo and it's so hard.
-[woman knocking] Vinnie?
Hurry up!
-I'm busy!
All right?
Lorna, I can't really do this today, okay?
Well, can you at least try?
No, my roommates!
It's awkward.
Well, I'm talking about kissing crotches in front of 50 other women, but for you, it's awkward?
I don't know, I thought you were into that.
Well, uh...
Maybe you could feel that way about your roommates.
Don't say that.
Well, do you have a speaker?
Put me on speaker, baby.
I'll talk so nice for you and the boys.
[woman] Vinnie, are you gonna help him with his homework?
Lorna, my roommates are my parents and my kid brother.
[scoffs] What?
All right?
There, now you know.
Well, why didn't you say that before?
I mean, what kind of fantasy is that gonna be?
[stammers] You thought you married a man, not a boy.
Look, I gotta go, all right?
Gino's back from school.
I gotta help him with his homework.
[scoffs]
Okay.
I think he shares a room with his kid brother.
Does that mean no more phone-boning in front of everybody?
Because, legit, that shit was kind of gross.
But also hot.
I'm having mixed emotions right now.
Yeah, me, too.
[gasps]
She's taking all the green beans.
I asked her not to!
Nicely, even!
Ignored.
And her flunkeys, always lurking around now.
-Look!
-I'm looking.
In Russia, we have a saying... [speaking Russian]
"Don't open your mouth to eat other people's bread."
Or what?
Ask the Germans in wintertime.
-Uh, Miss Judy?
-Uh-huh.
Uh, I was wondering if you would sign my cookbook.
Of course.
That's so nice.
Um...
I'll buy one and bring it to you when we both get out.
All right, well, we have a date, then.
Now, thank you, ladies.
Bye-bye for now.
All right.
Mmm.
Hey, there, Judy King.
Oh, guilty as charged, in all respects.
That's a joke, darlin'.
Oh!
[laughs]
You know, a lot of people in here are funny without meaning to be.
I learned the hard way to hold my mirth.
Oh, well, let your mirth fly free.
I mean to be funny.
All right. [laughs]
Um... actually, I was wondering if I could speak to you about my friend.
Oh, that little retarded girl?
She's actually not...
challenged at all, which is what we're supposed to say, not the R-word.
Oh, uh...
"R"s, "F"s, "L-M-N-O-P"s and "Q"s.
You know, I get in more trouble for expanding those single letter words, but never "N"s.
Despite this drawl, I'm brighter than that.
So, now, you were saying?
About your friend who is not challenged.
-[chuckles]
-Am I allowed to say "special"?
No, she's not special.
Well, she is to me.
-Mmm.
-But not euphemistically.
She's a fan and whenever she sees you, she freaks out.
You've gotta understand.
Institutional racism... traps the most vulnerable people in our society in this cycle of incarceration which, in turn, leads to a cycle of poverty.
It makes someone like you...
someone rich and powerful and white, virtually unapproachable.
All right, so now let me get this straight.
Your friend acts like a moron around me because she's black and poor?
-Is that right?
-Basically... yes.
[sighs] I think her mother was a crack addict or something.
You might as well be an alien.
But you could bridge the divide.
-The way you did.
-Yeah, exactly!
[chuckles]
All right, how about this?
Why don't you bring her over at lunch?
Okay. [chuckles]
It'll be like, uh...
the 1% sitting with the other 1%.
Oh, my God.
"The other 1%" is such a good hashtag.
[chuckles] [chuckles]
[man on TV] The New Orleans police put out a call to...
-Hi!
My name is Brook...
-Look and I was wondering if--
Take your picture or smash an egg in my face, or whatever you need to do for you and your friends to get your jollies.
-But spare me the setup, all right?
-I don't have a setup.
You know who I am?
Yeah, I do, actually.
You're a member of the community who has as much right as any of your neighbors to be concerned about the big-box monstrosity that's being proposed for the corner of Exposition and Euclid.
I'd be happy to talk about it with you, if you have the time.
Look, I'm watching this Hurricane Katrina stuff.
It's really intense.
The world's gonna be lousy with Katrinas if we let mega-corporations like Walmart carbon-bomb our planet.
You wanna come in?
Sure.
Yeah, I'll give you the whole shpiel.
Spiel.
Sorry, I never know how to pronounce that.
Wait, um... how old are you?
Nineteen.
Okay.
Come in.
[man on TV] ...aspect of this terrible hurricane that came on land with 145 mile-an-hour...
Okay.
I don't know if you realize, but the introduction of mega-retailers, like Walmart, almost invariably have a negative effect on property values--
-You're so nervous.
-I'm not nervous.
I'm passionate about saving local businesses.
Like Lola's Bloomers.
-May I?
-Sure.
Sure.
Conservative estimates are that there will be thousands of more cars in the neighborhood per day because of the construction--
It says you wanna put a park in instead.
I can't live within 2,500 feet of a park.
They would literally kick me out of my own home.
Sorry.
Can I talk about the elephant in the room for a second?
I wish you wouldn't.
I look across from me and I don't see a monster.
I see a human being fighting to control the animalistic parts of his brain, true grit overcoming impulse.
Not everybody judges you.
What if I told you it was kiddie porn?
I'd... say you need support, and I'd applaud your restraint for finding an outlet for your compulsions.
[scoffs] Wow!
You will really say whatever it takes.
Well, it was a lot worse than kiddie porn.
Wanna see?
No, I don't...
I don't need...
No.
No need.
Um...
Wait, all you did was have sex on the beach?
Consenting adults on an empty beach.
Well, except for the creeper that filmed it and turned us in to the cops.
-But you think that pervo got in trouble?
-That is insane.
I mean... [sighs] You are such a cautionary tale.
I would be, if people got the story right.
But once I had to go around door-to-door announcing my status, the rumors got started...
I don't know.
It's all so fucked.
Here.
It's not like Walmart's gonna lose.
Awesome.
[sharpener whirring]
[phone ringing]
-Oh...
-[continues ringing]
Uh... [clears throat]
Warden Caputo's office.
This is Ms. Jefferson speaking, how may I assist you?
[man] Is Warden Caputo available?
Let me place you on a brief hold while I go and check.
[beeping]
Fuck.
Oh, well, you gonna call back.
Hello?
I'm still here.
Damn, you are still there.
Then why the little light go out?
Anyway, don't matter, I ain't got him right now.
Will you please let him know I called?
All right, you take good care now.
-Yeah.
-[breathes deeply]
Shit.
What?
What happened?
I didn't quite get his name.
[sighs] You don't know who it was?
Well, it was some brother, sounded like a salesman-type, if you ask me.
So I probably did you a favor there.
Oh!
And then some white lady, she called about a get-together.
Mmm-hmm.
It happened twice?
Jesus, Jefferson, what am I paying you for?
Are you sure she said "get-together"?
What does that even mean?
Like...
like, a meeting?
Like a meeting.
Or...
like a date, maybe.
You holding out on me?
You somebody's Ca-baby-boo-to?
You're on thin fucking ice, Jefferson.
Was it Linda?
Possibly.
It wasn't Natalie, was it?
[clicks tongue] Linda sounds more right.
Okay.
Get Linda from MCC on the line.
All right.
Press the button that says "Line one."
-One.
-Nine and the number.
Nine...
Got you.
-[muttering] -[line ringing]
-[clears throat] -[Linda] Uh, hello?
Yes, hello.
I have Director Caputo.
I will transfer you now.
[beeps] [blows raspberries] Shit!
-[dialing] -[phone rings]
Warden Caputo's office.
[Caputo] Jefferson, I got it.
My bad!
My bad!
-[Linda] Hello, uh, Joe?
-Linda, hi.
Uh...
Jefferson, hang up your line.
I don't wanna disconnect y'all.
Hang up the phone!
Uh, I'm still training her.
Uh, I got your message about a get-together.
Oh, uh...
wrong Linda, I think.
-[sighs]
-But we do need to celebrate our victory.
All these veterans becoming guards.
Yes.
Yes, we absolutely do.
Any chance you're free tonight?
Tonight?
Yes, it's perfect.
Um...
We can celebrate and, uh, talk business.
-How about La Fontana's at 8:00?
-Yeah, great. [chuckles]
-Great.
I'll see you tonight.
-Okay, bye.
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]
Ah!
Even the staff waits for the bathroom now, hmm?
What can I do for you, Red?
[sighs]
I want to talk to you about the King woman.
You two are hitting it off, right?
You gave her the run of my garden.
How did you think that would go?
You know, planting a flag on the Moon doesn't mean that you own it.
You're Russian.
I thought you'd appreciate that attitude.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm only concerned for her.
Respect in prison has to be earned.
I don't know about that.
You've received a lot of leeway from staff around here.
You seem to be doing all right.
Was that what this is about?
Are you punishing me?
Did you do something wrong?
I did the only reasonable thing I could.
There's no such thing as a consensual relationship between a prisoner and a guard.
Lorna's wedding was a bittersweet end to a relationship that never actually happened, Sam.
-[toilet flushes]
-You're reading something into this that isn't there, Reznikov.
And what goes on with Mrs. King is none of your business.
You're pampering her.
Oops!
[sighs]
She even gets a magazine?
What do you want, Ruiz?
I heard about your labor dispute.
I thought maybe my friends could fill in?
This is Pidge.
You know Ouija, or she knows you.
And that's Zirconia.
Zirconia?
I took out all my rocks before I come in, so nobody would think they was diamonds and rip 'em out.
Plus...
I don't think it's allowed.
They're all ready and willing to join your panty party.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Privately, please.
What are you doing?
This is not a publicly traded company.
Its very existence depends on keeping its existence hidden.
Chill the fuck out.
I was just trying to help you.
I don't need your help.
What I need is your discretion, and you bringing a bunch of thugs into my house is the opposite of that.
I decide who knows about Felonious Spunk.
I decide who gets hired.
I am the prison pussy panty business.
Somebody's getting a little big for her panties, I think.
I'm gonna choose to assume you're talking about yourself and take that as an apology.
[snickers]
You're talking shit out a paper asshole, Chapman.
But when an actual hard-ass bitch decides to call you on it... well...
[tutting and inhales sharply]
Pretty sure she was talking about herself on that last one.
[Suzanne] It's not fair.
It is the most unfair thing that's ever happened in this prison.
Mmm, what about when Carson went to SHU for sneezing too loud?
Or what's-her-face, the Puerto Rican girl, with the gimpy eye?
And when she got the wrong meds by accident in the med line and went nutso, and gimped her other eye with a spork.
Now, she double gimp-eyed.
Or how 'bout when Pornstache used to make the meth heads blow him for drugs in the mop closet?
Or the time Chapman got furlough?
I retract and redact.
New statement.
It's easily the top 138 most unfair things that has ever happened here.
What is?
Your new job.
My job is the bomb!
You sit at a desk all day when you were plucked from the most rewarding job.
I'm not saying it's on par with all the human rights abuses in here, but women fought for a long time to shake the role of desk-ridden secretary.
Are you for real?
-Hey!
-[all laugh]
Do you get the Internet?
-Do you have a mini-fridge?
-Ah!
Do you have a skeleton key made from real human bone that opens a door to a world of talking animals?
Man, I got me a clipboard and a personal relationship with Mr. Caputo.
-[mimics buzzing] -[all laugh]
Man, if George R. R. Martin wrote about prisons,
I'd be, like...
the Hand of the Warden.
Yo, don't the Hand always die in them books?
Man, whatever, okay?
Winter is coming, bitches.
And I'm getting me a watch.
-For real?
-Yes.
Hey. [chuckles]
Yo...
I feel like she's smiling and waving at me.
[mouthing]
Maybe she can see dead people and there's one standing right... right in front of you.
Are the hairs standing up on the back of your neck?
I feel like I'm the dead person.
I... may have set you up on a blind friend date!
-Wait, you did what?
No!
-Surprise!
-What?
-[chuckling] I just talked you up.
-Go!
Be yourself.
-Yo... [both giggling]
-Go, P!
-Go, P!
Go, P!
-Let me fix your clothes.
-Get off me!
Hey. [chuckles]
You must be Poo-see.
She called her Poo-see!
No, I'm sorry.
Did I say that right?
Yeah, yeah.
Poussey, it's French.
Oh, French.
I was named after a great aunt who hid pearls from the Yankees under her pendulous breasts.
[laughs nervously]
And she also brewed a famous home remedy that supposedly cured hookworm.
-Not quite so exotic.
-Listen.
-Hmm.
-I...
I feel...
I feel like I need to apologize...
-Uh-uh.
-...for just being all, like, weird and stuff, you know, I just...
-I dig your whole thing, you know.
-[chuckles]
And I just, I watch your show so much, so seeing you in person was just, you know, I got all tongue-tied, and fan-girly and stuff.
So I'd try to say words, but when they came out of my mouth, it just sound like...
All right, all right, all right.
Relax, darlin'.
Your friend has told me the whole story.
She has got you covered.
You gotta sink a hook in the keepers, especially in this place.
-Uh-huh.
-You know, it's funny.
Me and Brook, we never would've crossed paths.
I mean, growing up all over the world, bouncing culture to culture with a strict, conservative family, versus, you know, sleeping in tent cities with a bunch of dirty hippies, eating food out of dumpsters.
Oof!
You have been through a lot.
[stammers] Nah, it was...
I mean, it was good.
Well, I mean, it was hard, you know?
Like, I guess being transient, and not really having any long-term friends, but I do know three languages.
Hmm!
Wait...
-you know three languages?
-[chuckles] Yeah.
How does the child of a crack whore learn three languages?
-That is remarkable.
-Excuse me?
What languages?
English, French and German.
Did you just call my mother a crack whore?
My mother had a masters in Art History and she could barely take an aspirin.
-Excuse me?
-My dad is a major in the army.
I was supposed to go to West Point.
I guess you were expecting just another ghetto prison rat.
At least one of us lives up to the stereotype.
What, no!
Sweetheart, no!
You have snatched the taste right out of my mouth.
I'm just parroting what your girlfriend told me about you.
You came out of a cycle of poverty, blah, blah, blah.
I mean, it seems to me that you two formed this relationship without talking much.
Did you know I am learning Italian?
[sighs]
[stammers] [sighs]
[indistinct chatter]
So, did Chester the Molester sign?
You owe me 50 bucks.
-Whoa.
-And you better take me out.
I can't believe you had the balls to do it.
Whatever, he probably finger-banged his 15-year-old girlfriend when he was 17 or something else no big.
The sex offender lists are full of sob stories about people's lives being ruined by technicalities.
[scoffs] You know, as a matter of fact, he was a fucking horrible child-molester rapist.
Because I'm so sure he told you that.
Yeah, 'cause he...
He fucking tried to seduce me.
He invited me in for lemonade.
-And you went in?
-Yeah.
He told me I didn't look 19.
[inhales deeply] That's when I knew I was in trouble.
Shit.
He stroked my hair.
[scoffs] He wanted to brag, so he showed me the newspaper article about how he stalked this nine-year-old girl from his church, for, like, a year.
Earning her trust, gradually convincing her to...
Well, to... [sighs] To... [exhales sharply] And then I was running down the street.
For your fucking bet, Ethan.
For 50 fucking dollars.
But also because I... because I wanted to go out with you.
[exhales deeply]
[Caputo] I really appreciate you coming all the way down from Utica.
Sorry, again, I couldn't get a seat in one of the gondolas.
No, no, it's okay.
This is great.
I'm really glad that you thought I called.
[chuckles]
These new guards, they're a... they're a big win for us.
Like, "us" us.
And the company, but especially "us" us.
Yeah.
We're not a bad team, Linda from Purchasing.
To us, Joe from Litchfield Human Activity, and our continued wins.
-And to the veterans, of course.
-Of course. [chuckles]
♪ Happy, happy birthday clappy ♪
♪ Join us as we celebrate ♪
♪ Clap your hands and dance around ♪
♪ Have a laugh and eat some cake ♪
♪ Happy birthday, happy birthday Happy birthday ♪
♪ You're so great!
♪ [all cheering]
What?
The bald guy... is, uh... one of our former guards.
A really good guy.
Donaldson.
A good guy...
who walked out in the middle of an inmate transfer/high-profile self-surrender?
Yeah, I get your point.
Don't beat yourself up, Joe.
You handled that situation like a total boss.
Meant both literally and in that hip-kid lingo way.
Jesus!
He's not even a fucking waiter.
-He's a busboy.
-[laughs]
-What?
-No, just... you could've lost your job... or faced prosecution had inmates gone missing that day.
I mean, you're concerned about...
these jerks that hung you out to dry.
You're quite a guy, Joe Caputo.
[waiter] There you go, sir.
Whenever you're ready.
-Uh, do me a favor, will you?
-[waiter] Mmm-hmm.
-The change is yours.
-Okay.
Give a 20 to that busboy over there.
Wait till we're gone.
I don't want to make a thing of it, okay?
[waiter] Okay.
Hey, Mr. Caputo!
-Look, Donaldson--
-I don't need your money, Mr. Caputo.
It's nothing, take it, it's--
Nah, this is not to help me.
This is to make you feel better about that... pardon my French, miss, bullshit you pulled.
-Okay, Joe, let's go.
-The bullshit I pulled?
I work three jobs.
This is the good one.
O'Neill?
I heard he had kidney stones.
But no health insurance.
So he thought he'd power through, wait for it to pass.
It didn't.
Now he's on dialysis.
He may lose a kidney.
-Jesus.
-Yeah.
So take your $20 and drown your conscience in a bottle of gin, because paying me to feel better about it ain't gonna work.
Donaldson.
You tell O'Neill I'm sorry about his stones.
I'm also sorry you gotta work here.
But I need you to understand something.
I'm sorry for you.
I don't regret firing any of you.
You walked out on the biggest day the prison's faced in 25 fuckin' years.
You put the prisoners at risk, you put your fellow cos at risk, you put this whole town in danger!
The shit hit and instead of moving the fan away, [stammers] you plugged it in and you hit "oscillate."
I was gonna make you captain of the guard, Wade.
Really.
You keep the 20.
Least I could do for helping me dodge a bullet.
I'm sorry about this.
These houses are yours to live in, but they are prison property.
They will be treated with respect.
As long as they are treated with respect, you will be as well.
Okay, the warden has asked me to do a... icebreaker event.
I will demonstrate this activity with CO...
-McCullough, sir.
-Okay, McCullough.
Tell me two true things about you and one lie.
I will attempt to guess the lie.
Okay, um... [woman speaking indistinctly on PA]
I came to say I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Okay, please don't lock me out.
You're right to be upset.
How would you know?
You don't know anything about me, Soso.
[scoffs]
And, what, you think I'm upset about my mom's crack abuse or because I grew up poor, black and uneducated in the urban jungle?
Okay, I watched The Wire a lot.
I made assumptions.
But you spent time with me.
I mean, did you even listen when I talked?
Like, what the fuck about me, besides the color of my skin, would indicate that I'm some indigent hood rat?
-I don't know.
-[scoffs]
No, it's fine, it's cool.
I'm guilty, too.
I won't lie.
You know, I like the story of the rich, white, hippie girl in my bed.
I've been working that on my end.
I don't want this to end.
[Gloria] What good is coming up here and sitting in the lobby every weekend gonna do?
She wants to get Sophia out, she needs to get a lawyer or a non-profit involved or something.
Ms. Burset said that the prison has tons of lawyers, so at least coming up here and waiting for the warden to come out to get into his face is something...
Michael started a Kickstarter campaign.
Kickstarter?
What that mean?
Not much, usually.
There's nothing to be ashamed about.
Plenty of guys live with their parents.
Right, yeah, I mean, you know...
I'm just doing this to save money, you know?
'Cause I could live on my own, obviously.
Oof!
Obviously.
I mean, very, very obviously.
It just makes the most financial sense, you know?
For the both of us.
Oh!
That's my manicotti, always thinking of his little lasagna.
[chuckles] Hey...
I made you something.
Fresh baked.
Lorna...
No, no, no, don't say it.
You know, even though it took a lot of time, and I had to go to the store twice, you... are worth it.
[exhales deeply] [sniffs]
Hmm.
Mmm!
-Mmm!
-It's still warm.
My favorite.
Peanut butter and MM's.
-Snickerdoodles.
-Oh!
-I love you.
-Oh!
And you should.
I am quite a catch.
Oh, my God, you are.
You so are.
[exhales deeply]
Fuck.
I want you.
-Vinnie.
-I want you.
It's our living room.
The neighbors want to look in, that's their good luck.
I'm already unbuttoning my shirt.
My goodness, you know that I can't resist your muscular chest.
Oh, my God.
My hands, they're in your hair right now.
-I'm stroking it real soft.
-[panting]
Till I grab a handful of it and pull it back.
[moans] You're such a man.
[Vince] Oh, God.
I'm licking your neck.
Kissing your ears.
My hand is on that big mountain in your pants, and I am unzipping you right now.
And I'm pulling your shirt off real slow.
No, no, no, it's a button-up.
-I unbutton it real slow.
-No, no, no, tear it off.
-Pulling it off.
It's off.
-Tear it off.
It's off, the buttons, they're everywhere.
They're everywhere.
Oh, my God, my mouth...
My mouth is on those big titties.
-My nipples are so hard right now.
-Oh, my God, my cock.
Oh, my God, my cock is really hard.
I know, baby.
No, it's really hard.
Like, right now, it's really hard.
-I know, Vinnie...
-Oh, God.
-Vinnie, put it inside me.
-Yeah?
Oh, my God, it's in you.
Oh, it's in you.
-Oh, my God, it's in you.
-[Lorna moaning]
It feels so good.
You're so wet.
You are so wet.
I actually am.
-I'm super wet right now.
-I know.
[both panting]
Do it to me.
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
-Don't stop.
-I'm not stopping.
I'm not stopping.
I'm not gonna stop.
I'm not gonna stop.
Oh, my God.
-Oh, baby!
-[strained] Oh, my God!
[yells] [man] He's humping the table.
[Vince sighs]
-[panting] -[woman] What the hell?
Hey!
Hey, stay right here.
Stay looking at me, all right?
Jesus Christ.
[man] Don't think I don't see you.
Pleasure, as always.
Also, I want to talk to you about something.
If this is about last week, I don't get to control my flow.
I think it's all the stress of all these new bitches in here.
I know these last few weeks have had their challenges.
So...
I wanted to say thank you.
And keep up the good work.
Your morale is important to me.
Oh!
That's so sweet.
Ovaltine?
It's to make chocolate milk.
Pretty much only Chinese people drink it now, which is probably why it's at commissary, but it's really good.
So, it's chocolate powder for my powdered milk?
It's got vitamins.
Oh!
See?
New bitches.
Why are they always staring like they're waiting for a donkey show to start?
I don't think they're staring at you.
They were following us earlier.
And you didn't say anything?
People can stare.
-It's a free country.
-Not in prison.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
I bet your Bloody Mary gonna come early, too.
[indistinct chatter]
Hey.
Hey.
[sighs]
You okay?
-No.
You?
-[exhales deeply]
No.
Do you want to talk about it?
Not really.
You?
But have you ever heard the phrase "paper asshole"?
[chuckles] No.
Ruiz said it to me.
I think I pissed off the Dominicans.
Relax.
You run the Litchfield panty company...
not the Sinaloa drug cartel.
No one's stitching your face to a soccer ball.
See ya around, Pipes.
[Gloria] What's this?
[in Spanish] It's for the eyes.
Takes the red out.
[in English] I know what it is, pendeja.
What's it doing out?
It's contraband.
Whoops!
I need to be more careful.
Yeah, you do.
A few drops of that falls into the food, and this whole prison will be shitting their brains out.
Really?
I had no idea.
She acts so tough, but to stress-eat this food?
The poor woman.
[laughs] Oh, you evil, Russian bitch.
What can I say?
I do a lot with a little.
[laughs]
No!
No!
No!
[inmate] What the fuck?
That's my toilet paper.
-[defecating]
-Oh!
[rap music playing in distance]
I talk a lot.
I babble... until I find something the person I'm with is interested in.
And I'll say anything I can to get them to like me.
But I... really... really like you.
The real you.
[scoffs] You don't know the real me.
But I want to.
So in, like, a minute, I'm gonna put down this radio, and I'm gonna listen to you tell me about yourself.
And I'm not gonna try to rewrite your story in my head.
And then, when you're done, I'd like to tell you about myself.
[sighs]
And some of it will be embarrassing and ugly... but mostly boring. [exhales]
And then... maybe afterwards, we could, like...
quiz each other or something?
Eminem?
[chuckles]
Yeah, it's not a presumption about you liking rap.
It's just...
AM 700 The OG is the only station that comes in clear.
[snickers and clears throat]
Jackson, North Carolina.
Is that where you were born?
No, that's where my great-grandmother was born.
I mean, stuffed crust shoulda revolutionized pizza,
-but it was just a fad.
-Man, nah, it's the same thing.
-Man, it is not the same thing!
-All right.
'Cause that's Italian...
this is Mexican.
You got a stuffed tortilla, and you stuff that with more stuff.
-[faint humming]
-Man, it's my golden ticket, and I'm gonna do it right with that business savvy and shit.
-[scatting]
-Hey, hey, hey!
Do you hear that?
[humming continues]
What is that?
[inmate] Wow, look at that.
[inmates chatting indistinctly]
That's a drone.
-It's a drone.
-Shit!
What's it doing here?
Like we some Iraqi wedding?
Man, come on.
We're gonna be late.
He was a bad man and we did good things.
He did bad things and we killed him good.
No, we did bad.
No!
We did well.
[whispering] Hey.
Have you seen Whitehill?
Yeah, I forgot the garden needed turning.
If Rikerson comes back, just tell him where we went, okay?
Oh, fuck!
[grunting]
-No!
No!
-Lolly, Lolly.
-[shushing]
-Listen, listen.
They know!
They know!
They found you!
We have to move the body!
[whispering] Shut up.
We cannot move the body.
There's drones.
Stop it, Lolly.
We cannot move it.
If I told you I already moved it, would it calm you down?
Maybe for a minute.
Good, 'cause I did.
Now, scat.
[fence opens and closes]
You didn't actually move it.
Hell, no.
And I'm not about to.
[sucks teeth] We're gonna have to kill her.
[rap music playing] :46:33,081 -- 00:46:34,708 [both panting]
Do it to me.
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
-Don't stop.
-I'm not stopping.
I'm not stopping.
I'm not gonna stop.
I'm not gonna stop.
Oh, my God.
-Oh, baby!
-[strained] Oh, my God!
[yells] [man] He's humping the table.
[Vince sighs]
-[panting] -[woman] What the hell?

[rap music playing in distance]
I talk a lot.
I babble... until I find something the person I'm with is interested in.
And I'll say anything I can to get them to like me.
But I... really... really like you.
The real you.
[scoffs] You don't know the real me.
But I want to.
So in, like, a minute, I'm gonna put down this radio, and I'm gonna listen to you tell me about yourself.
And I'm not gonna try to rewrite your story in my head.
And then, when you're done, I'd like to tell you about myself.
[sighs]
And some of it will be embarrassing and ugly... but mostly boring. [exhales]
And then... maybe afterwards, we could, like...
quiz each other or something?
Eminem?
[chuckles]
Yeah, it's not a presumption about you liking rap.
It's just...
AM 700 The OG is the only station that comes in clear.
[snickers and clears throat]
Jackson, North Carolina.
Is that where you were born?
No, that's where my great-grandmother was born.
I mean, stuffed crust shoulda revolutionized pizza,
-but it was just a fad.
-Man, nah, it's the same thing.
-Man, it is not the same thing!
-All right.
'Cause that's Italian...
this is Mexican.
You got a stuffed tortilla, and you stuff that with more stuff.
-[faint humming]
-Man, it's my golden ticket, and I'm gonna do it right with that business savvy and shit.
-[scatting]
-Hey, hey, hey!
Do you hear that?
[humming continues]
What is that?
[inmate] Wow, look at that.
[inmates chatting indistinctly]
That's a drone.
-It's a drone.
-Shit!
What's it doing here?
Like we some Iraqi wedding?
Man, come on.
We're gonna be late.
He was a bad man and we did good things.
He did bad things and we killed him good.
No, we did bad.
No!
We did well.
[whispering] Hey.
Have you seen Whitehill?
Yeah, I forgot the garden needed turning.
If Rikerson co
How are we supposed to clean the floors with nonstop bitches tracking their shit through?
We are like he whom the gods have condemned to push the boulder up the hill only to watch it roll back down.
Oh, right, right, right, right.
And then he has to cut his arm off to get out from underneath it.
What is that guy's name?
Oh, James Franco!
Sisyphus.
I did hear that rumor.
You know those Hollywood types, they will stick it in any warm hole.
Well, you don't have to be from Hollywood to wanna put it in a warm place.
It's called having a dick.
No, my Vinnie would never.
Well, maybe not in a man-hole, but you away a long time.
He could be getting his MM melting in some ho's mouth and not in his hand.
No.
No, that's never gonna happen because we're talking sexy on the phone, like, 24/7, and I mean real sexy.
And I give very good phone.
Are we talking about peanut MM's or regular?
Inmate Jefferson, Tasha Jefferson, report to the warden's office.
Inmate Tasha Jefferson to the warden's office.
Who's Tasha Jefferson?
Oh, Taystee?
Taystee, go to the warden's office.
We have a warden?
-Your name's Tasha?
-What is this about?
The main thing is answering the phones and organizational stuff.
General assisting.
I don't know.
I've never had an assistant before.
We will figure it out together.
And you swear this is legit?
'Cause I seen Shawshank and I don't wanna go to Seg because I did your taxes too good.
I guarantee you, you will never see anything with my social security number on it.
Never say never.
You work for MCC.
Maybe one day you realize you need food stamps and you don't know how to fill out the forms.
Well, I'm your girl.
I can walk you through it, but I'm gonna need them digits.
However...
I'm a vault.
I don't say nothing.
And I ain't never crawling through a tunnel of piss and dookie, so rest easy.
Okay.
As of now, you're off janitorial and you're with me.
Praise Jesus.
Every day.
When I'm working, you're working.
Is this 'cause I won at job fair?
- Sure.
- I told them bitches.
Take a clipboard, write things down, look busy.
Outside.
Alert!
Alert!
Alert!
-What?
-Mmm!
What?
Healy's just showing her around.
Frieda's over there.
It's all good.
Why does she get some special garden tour like some fancy Shiba Inu?
She's a celebrity, okay?
Fucking relax.
Uh...
Not okay.
Not...
Not really relaxed.
I think you are way too relaxed... to be in this big, brown shit-uation that we're in!
Lolly, believe me.
My insides have completely liquefied and I wanna vomit all the time... but I have chosen to keep my voice low and appear calm.
You have to do the same.
- I can't.
- You have to.
- Look at me.
You...
Listen.
You have to.
Change the record in your head.
Play, "He was a bad man.
We did what we had to do and we did it well.
So now it's through."
It's a mantra.
Say it.
"We did what we had to do and we did it well."
You forgot the bad man part.
And the end.
But that's the idea.
So whenever you're feeling worried, whenever your thoughts start to... wander, just bring them back to the mantra...
and then come and find me.
Okay?
"He was a bad man who did bad things well, and now he's gone."
Got it!
"He was a bad man, now he's gone from the well..."
Now that is one happy tomato.
I hope I do as well here.
-Hey, there's a good idea.
-Hmm.
Maybe we should fertilize our women, too.
--I do love your good intentions.
- Hey, Judy.
- Hey.
Hi.
You've got quite a following.
Yeah, I was hoping the novelty would wear off soon.
Might have to hide myself in that corn.
Oh, look, how beautiful!
Help yourself.
Oh!
All right.
Oh, really?
Free-for-all on the produce now, huh?
Regardless of who's in the club.
Who's worked the soil, pulled the weeds, tended the seedlings.
Is that the new policy?
-This is Judy King.
-Oh, I know who she is.
I've seen her... daytime TV program.
But we haven't had the pleasure.
Mrs. King is going to be joining your club, Red.
So I'll leave you to it.
-Thank you.
-Yeah.
I'm sure you'll find a lot in common.
Hair and... accents.
You know, my daddy used to call me "Red."
Really?
That's sweet.
My papa called me solnyshko.
It means little sun.
But I've grown bigger and hotter since then, and he's dead.
So what are you going to do with that ear, now that you've picked it?
Well, I guess that depends on what else I can find around here.
I could do a Southern fried corn, a dilled corn shooter,
Taiwanese-style street corn.
Listen to fancy pants.
I could shove it up your ass.
Hmm, I'm not so big on ass play.
What do you suggest I do, Miss Red?
I'm thinking.
- Can I have some seeds?
You bought Ovaltine.
Reap what you sow.
Ovaltine's got vitamins.
I'll trade you Ovaltine powder later for some seeds now.
I'm good for it.
No deal.
You'll regret it.
That's some malty goodness you're passing up.
Excuse me?
You knew going into this I had bad knees.
My feet are killing me.
We are putting out a vibe.
If you are sitting and/or eating my seeds, no vibe.
Right now, there is no vibe.
See?
Look at this.
-All of a sudden, I'm approachable.
-Picking up or dropping off?
Neither.
We're out.
I gave you guys new ones yesterday.
We're hanging up our lacy intimates.
If this is because of the money Stella took, I'm good for it.
I'll pay you back.
It's not worth it anymore.
We're smelling the beginning of the end.
You and all your posturing, shipping the kangaroo down the hill.
It's starting to feel dangerous.
You've even got a heavy on the payroll.
Ha!
I see what you did there.
-"Heavy."
-Not on purpose.
Fine, jump ship like rats.
And I'm not talking about the Disney-Pixar kind.
I was gonna fire one of you anyway, but I'm not gonna say which one.
Chew on that.
We're gonna take a walk on the track, you wanna join us, kahuna?
No, she does not.
She's got bad knees.
Enjoy sweating for free.
I expect all my undies still in your possession returned posthaste.
"Posthaste"?
That's nuts.
-Do you have something to say?
-Sure.
But I'll wait till I'm with my friends.
Off the backboard.
- Oh!
Short, black and bad at basketball.
-Subverting expectations since 1990.
-Oh, it's okay.
Litchfield's latest lesbos, in fun-size.
Look, how much longer do you think the world's longest game of Horse is gonna go on?
She ain't a lesbian.
I see.
Testing the waters before diving in face-first?
I'm attracted to people, not genders.
Well, aren't you special.
Tell you what, why don't you use some of that sexual fluidity to slide off the court so the real men can play?
Come on.
Even though I do think labeling is a total sham...
I see the power in reclaiming an epithet.
Like you guys have with "nigga."
Okay, maybe not that exactly.
But...
I really like you.
Like, really a lot.
And I just--
I wanna honor your feelings, you know, if you wanna call this something.
Like, we're girlfriend-girlfriend, or... lezzy togezzy.
I don't know.
How about we say we're happy, yeah?
Leave it at that?
Okay.
Oh, shit.
Hey!
Hi!
Hi...
Judy, I'm...
Hey, girl.
You're...
Fuck!
It is so cute how moony you get every time she's around.
By "cute" you mean, "lame as fuck."
Well, yeah.
You need to pull it together.
I mean, she's a person you admire, but she's still just a person.
A person.
Right.
You should be able to have a conversation with anyone.
Hi, I'm Brook.
I'm your neighbor.
I was wondering if you'd heard about the plans to build a Walmart at the corner of Exposition and Euclid?
Yeah, I heard about it.
Well, I'm one of a group of citizens trying to convince the city council to turn that lot into a park space instead.
I was wondering if you'd be willing to have a friendly discussion, or maybe even sign our petition?
- Sure... if you take your top off.
-Okay, that is inappropriate.
-Yes.
Inappropriate things do happen out there.
How would you handle it?
You really think a grown man is gonna ask me to take my top off?
Well, there's a sex offender at 3134 10th Street.
He might.
No, you do not have to go to the sex offender's house.
No one has to knock on any door that makes him or her feel uncomfortable.
But I do urge you all to be bold and stretch yourself.
By the way, has everyone signed their liability waivers?
Oh, shit.
I hear he likes little boys.
Little boy, Asian girl, are they really that far apart?
You said our break-up was going to be amicable.
Yeah, I said a lot of things.
So did you, like, "I love you.
I'll always love you.
This is not because of Oren."
Wait, what?
She dumped me to get with you.
I'm not sweet enough arm-candy.
Oh, my God!
Could you kids drop the soap opera for another time?
We're going out there this afternoon.
You need to feel like you're prepared.
Well, clearly, she's not.
She can't even handle "take your top off."
Okay, 50 bucks says I get more signatures than you, Ethan.
No bet.
People will sign just to shut you up.
But here's a bet.
Get the pedo to sign, I'll give you your 50 bucks.
And Oren will go on a date with you.
Cool?
-I'm not really in--
-Okay!
You are so on.
He will sign and you will give me cash, and I will spend it on a new hemp messenger bag and strawberry lube, because Oren seems like a strawberry kind of guy.
Well--
Great, now let's talk one more time about mirroring body language.
I'm just saying, if you bought me a watch, I'd be on the time better.
-There's a clock on the wall.
-Not in my office.
I'll put a clock in your office.
Or you could buy me a watch, so when we out of the office like now,
I could tell you things like, "Hey, Mr. Caputo, we're only a few minutes late to meet Piscatella, and you the boss anyhow, so relax."
I will consider your watch request.
Hey, I'm just trying to make your life better.
This ain't about me.
By the way, what you want me to do once we there?
-Take notes.
-Hold up, hold up.
"Take notes." Got you.
Mop it all around.
Damn!
This place is like Litchfield Edition.
And with, like, real addicts.
So, in a nutshell... electrical is still having Internet issues, plumbing works, but no hot water yet.
All beds and extraneous furniture are assembled and ready for move-in.
--Now, the interior paint--
Uh, inmate?
What are you possibly writing that will have any salience past this moment in time?
Well, Mr. Caputo wants notes.
Now, I don't know what salience is, but I think a checklist of what's completed and what's not is hella revalent.
You mean "rel." Relevant.
I mean, I'm trying to do my job, same as you, big man.
Are you...
suggesting that we are in any way, on any planet, in any universe, the same, inmate?
Why don't you go check on Luschek and the Internet situation?
-What?
-Let me watch you go.
Oh, you gonna "watch me" watch me?
I will watch... you.
- Go!
- I'm goin'.
It's clearly that...
time.
-Look at me go.
-Go.
-May I ask you a question, Mr. Caputo?
-Shoot.
How did you choose her to be your assistant, exactly?
-Between you and me?
-Yes, sir.
She's the only semi-intelligent one that I'm only... semi-attracted to.
Well, if you'll follow me, I'll show you the bathroom.
--What are you writing?
Man, why everybody act like they ain't never seen a black woman with a clipboard before?
No, it's your pen.
It's exorbitantly scratchy and it's giving me anxiety.
Damn, Word-A-Day.
I need to get me one of them calendars.
"Anxiety" wasn't from the calendar.
That's just me.
But... "exorbitant" was.
Check out these fat phone cords.
Shit, I could make so many bracelets out of the wires in one of these--
Uh-uh.
Those ain't phone cords.
They're for the Internet.
And believe me, you want some of them guards to be able to watch their porn and get it all out before they on duty, so you best leave it.
So, hey, how come you don't get to live here, Luschek?
-Because I have a home, inmate.
-Oh, yeah?
-An entire basement to myself.
-Hmm.
You gotta admit, though, it is kind of swanky... you know?
I mean, you could fit an entire family just right in here and still have room for a TV.
Couple of pictures of X-rays.
Home sweet home.
-Did you just say X-rays?
-I did say X-rays.
'Cause when my grandmammy broke her pelvis, all of us kids got X-rays.
'Cause the doctor was really nice, and my mom was doing him on the side.
--That's funny, huh?
He literally took an entire X-ray of my whole skeleton, and I hung it up on my wall like a fancy English guy.
But it was just pictures of bones instead of--
You know, it wasn't, like, real bones.
Your life is grotesque.
-Another big word.
-What are you even doing here?
Mr. Caputo wanted me to check up on the Internet issue.
Inmate...
Scar-neck, explain the problem.
It doesn't work.
There you go.
Hey, baby.
Yeah, I thought you were getting home an hour ago.
Oh, I know, the traffic was awful coming back from the store.
I think there was a wreck or something.
Anyway, how was work?
How are you?
-Vinnie?
-Look, I'm sorry.
I'm just in a mood.
Well, don't you worry.
You just sit right down.
I'm gonna give you such a nice backrub.
- Lorna...
-Lorna!
-Honey, you're so tense.
I'm reaching around and I'm feeling down your chiseled and bumpy abs.
Oh, my goodness.
I just found your cock-a-doodle-doo and it's so hard.
- Vinnie?
Hurry up!
- I'm busy!
All right?
Lorna, I can't really do this today, okay?
Well, can you at least try?
No, my roommates!
It's awkward.
Well, I'm talking about kissing crotches in front of 50 other women, but for you, it's awkward?
I don't know, I thought you were into that.
Well, uh...
Maybe you could feel that way about your roommates.
Don't say that.
Well, do you have a speaker?
Put me on speaker, baby.
I'll talk so nice for you and the boys.
Vinnie, are you gonna help him with his homework?
Lorna, my roommates are my parents and my kid brother.
What?
All right?
There, now you know.
Well, why didn't you say that before?
I mean, what kind of fantasy is that gonna be?
You thought you married a man, not a boy.
Look, I gotta go, all right?
Gino's back from school.
I gotta help him with his homework.
Okay.
I think he shares a room with his kid brother.
Does that mean no more phone-boning in front of everybody?
Because, legit, that shit was kind of gross.
But also hot.
I'm having mixed emotions right now.
Yeah, me, too.
She's taking all the green beans.
I asked her not to!
Nicely, even!
Ignored.
And her flunkeys, always lurking around now.
-Look!
-I'm looking.
In Russia, we have a saying...
"Don't open your mouth to eat other people's bread."
Or what?
Ask the Germans in wintertime.
-Uh, Miss Judy?
-Uh-huh.
Uh, I was wondering if you would sign my cookbook.
Of course.
That's so nice.
Um...
I'll buy one and bring it to you when we both get out.
All right, well, we have a date, then.
Now, thank you, ladies.
Bye-bye for now.
All right.
Mmm.
Hey, there, Judy King.
Oh, guilty as charged, in all respects.
That's a joke, darlin'.
Oh!
You know, a lot of people in here are funny without meaning to be.
I learned the hard way to hold my mirth.
Oh, well, let your mirth fly free.
I mean to be funny.
All right.
Um... actually, I was wondering if I could speak to you about my friend.
Oh, that little retarded girl?
She's actually not...
challenged at all, which is what we're supposed to say, not the R-word.
Oh, uh...
"R"s, "F"s, "L-M-N-O-P"s and "Q"s.
You know, I get in more trouble for expanding those single letter words, but never "N"s.
Despite this drawl, I'm brighter than that.
So, now, you were saying?
About your friend who is not challenged.
--Am I allowed to say "special"?
No, she's not special.
Well, she is to me.
-Mmm.
-But not euphemistically.
She's a fan and whenever she sees you, she freaks out.
You've gotta understand.
Institutional racism... traps the most vulnerable people in our society in this cycle of incarceration which, in turn, leads to a cycle of poverty.
It makes someone like you...
someone rich and powerful and white, virtually unapproachable.
All right, so now let me get this straight.
Your friend acts like a moron around me because she's black and poor?
-Is that right?
-Basically... yes.
I think her mother was a crack addict or something.
You might as well be an alien.
But you could bridge the divide.
- The way you did.
- Yeah, exactly!
All right, how about this?
Why don't you bring her over at lunch?
Okay.
It'll be like, uh...
the 1% sitting with the other 1%.
Oh, my God.
"The other 1%" is such a good hashtag.
The New Orleans police put out a call to...
-Hi!
My name is Brook...
-Look and I was wondering if--
Take your picture or smash an egg in my face, or whatever you need to do for you and your friends to get your jollies.
-But spare me the setup, all right?
-I don't have a setup.
You know who I am?
Yeah, I do, actually.
You're a member of the community who has as much right as any of your neighbors to be concerned about the big-box monstrosity that's being proposed for the corner of Exposition and Euclid.
I'd be happy to talk about it with you, if you have the time.
Look, I'm watching this Hurricane Katrina stuff.
It's really intense.
The world's gonna be lousy with Katrinas if we let mega-corporations like Walmart carbon-bomb our planet.
You wanna come in?
Sure.
Yeah, I'll give you the whole shpiel.
Spiel.
Sorry, I never know how to pronounce that.
Wait, um... how old are you?
Nineteen.
Okay.
Come in.
...aspect of this terrible hurricane that came on land with 145 mile-an-hour...
Okay.
I don't know if you realize, but the introduction of mega-retailers, like Walmart, almost invariably have a negative effect on property values--
-You're so nervous.
-I'm not nervous.
I'm passionate about saving local businesses.
Like Lola's Bloomers.
-May I?
-Sure.
Sure.
Conservative estimates are that there will be thousands of more cars in the neighborhood per day because of the construction--
It says you wanna put a park in instead.
I can't live within 2,500 feet of a park.
They would literally kick me out of my own home.
Sorry.
Can I talk about the elephant in the room for a second?
I wish you wouldn't.
I look across from me and I don't see a monster.
I see a human being fighting to control the animalistic parts of his brain, true grit overcoming impulse.
Not everybody judges you.
What if I told you it was kiddie porn?
I'd... say you need support, and I'd applaud your restraint for finding an outlet for your compulsions.
Wow!
You will really say whatever it takes.
Well, it was a lot worse than kiddie porn.
Wanna see?
No, I don't...
I don't need...
No.
No need.
Um...
Wait, all you did was have sex on the beach?
Consenting adults on an empty beach.
Well, except for the creeper that filmed it and turned us in to the cops.
-But you think that pervo got in trouble?
-That is insane.
I mean...
You are such a cautionary tale.
I would be, if people got the story right.
But once I had to go around door-to-door announcing my status, the rumors got started...
I don't know.
It's all so fucked.
Here.
It's not like Walmart's gonna lose.
Awesome.
- Oh...
Uh...
Warden Caputo's office.
This is Ms. Jefferson speaking, how may I assist you?
Is Warden Caputo available?
Let me place you on a brief hold while I go and check.
Fuck.
Oh, well, you gonna call back.
Hello?
I'm still here.
Damn, you are still there.
Then why the little light go out?
Anyway, don't matter, I ain't got him right now.
Will you please let him know I called?
All right, you take good care now.
- Yeah.
Shit.
What?
What happened?
I didn't quite get his name.
You don't know who it was?
Well, it was some brother, sounded like a salesman-type, if you ask me.
So I probably did you a favor there.
Oh!
And then some white lady, she called about a get-together.
Mmm-hmm.
It happened twice?
Jesus, Jefferson, what am I paying you for?
Are you sure she said "get-together"?
What does that even mean?
Like...
like, a meeting?
Like a meeting.
Or...
like a date, maybe.
You holding out on me?
You somebody's Ca-baby-boo-to?
You're on thin fucking ice, Jefferson.
Was it Linda?
Possibly.
It wasn't Natalie, was it?
Linda sounds more right.
Okay.
Get Linda from MCC on the line.
All right.
Press the button that says "Line one."
-One.
-Nine and the number.
Nine...
Got you.
--Uh, hello?
Yes, hello.
I have Director Caputo.
I will transfer you now.
Shit!
Warden Caputo's office.
Jefferson, I got it.
My bad!
My bad!
- Hello, uh, Joe?
- Linda, hi.
Uh...
Jefferson, hang up your line.
I don't wanna disconnect y'all.
Hang up the phone!
Uh, I'm still training her.
Uh, I got your message about a get-together.
Oh, uh...
wrong Linda, I think.
--But we do need to celebrate our victory.
All these veterans becoming guards.
Yes.
Yes, we absolutely do.
Any chance you're free tonight?
Tonight?
Yes, it's perfect.
Um...
We can celebrate and, uh, talk business.
- How about La Fontana's at 8:00?
- Yeah, great.
-Great.
I'll see you tonight.
-Okay, bye.
Ah!
Even the staff waits for the bathroom now, hmm?
What can I do for you, Red?
I want to talk to you about the King woman.
You two are hitting it off, right?
You gave her the run of my garden.
How did you think that would go?
You know, planting a flag on the Moon doesn't mean that you own it.
You're Russian.
I thought you'd appreciate that attitude.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm only concerned for her.
Respect in prison has to be earned.
I don't know about that.
You've received a lot of leeway from staff around here.
You seem to be doing all right.
Was that what this is about?
Are you punishing me?
Did you do something wrong?
I did the only reasonable thing I could.
There's no such thing as a consensual relationship between a prisoner and a guard.
Lorna's wedding was a bittersweet end to a relationship that never actually happened, Sam.
--You're reading something into this that isn't there, Reznikov.
And what goes on with Mrs. King is none of your business.
You're pampering her.
Oops!
She even gets a magazine?
What do you want, Ruiz?
I heard about your labor dispute.
I thought maybe my friends could fill in?
This is Pidge.
You know Ouija, or she knows you.
And that's Zirconia.
Zirconia?
I took out all my rocks before I come in, so nobody would think they was diamonds and rip 'em out.
Plus...
I don't think it's allowed.
They're all ready and willing to join your panty party.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Privately, please.
What are you doing?
This is not a publicly traded company.
Its very existence depends on keeping its existence hidden.
Chill the fuck out.
I was just trying to help you.
I don't need your help.
What I need is your discretion, and you bringing a bunch of thugs into my house is the opposite of that.
I decide who knows about Felonious Spunk.
I decide who gets hired.
I am the prison pussy panty business.
Somebody's getting a little big for her panties, I think.
I'm gonna choose to assume you're talking about yourself and take that as an apology.
You're talking shit out a paper asshole, Chapman.
But when an actual hard-ass bitch decides to call you on it... well...
Pretty sure she was talking about herself on that last one.
It's not fair.
It is the most unfair thing that's ever happened in this prison.
Mmm, what about when Carson went to SHU for sneezing too loud?
Or what's-her-face, the Puerto Rican girl, with the gimpy eye?
And when she got the wrong meds by accident in the med line and went nutso, and gimped her other eye with a spork.
Now, she double gimp-eyed.
Or how 'bout when Pornstache used to make the meth heads blow him for drugs in the mop closet?
Or the time Chapman got furlough?
I retract and redact.
New statement.
It's easily the top 138 most unfair things that has ever happened here.
What is?
Your new job.
My job is the bomb!
You sit at a desk all day when you were plucked from the most rewarding job.
I'm not saying it's on par with all the human rights abuses in here, but women fought for a long time to shake the role of desk-ridden secretary.
Are you for real?
- Hey!
Do you get the Internet?
-Do you have a mini-fridge?
-Ah!
Do you have a skeleton key made from real human bone that opens a door to a world of talking animals?
Man, I got me a clipboard and a personal relationship with Mr. Caputo.
Man, if George R. R. Martin wrote about prisons,
I'd be, like...
the Hand of the Warden.
Yo, don't the Hand always die in them books?
Man, whatever, okay?
Winter is coming, bitches.
And I'm getting me a watch.
-For real?
-Yes.
Hey.
Yo...
I feel like she's smiling and waving at me.
Maybe she can see dead people and there's one standing right... right in front of you.
Are the hairs standing up on the back of your neck?
I feel like I'm the dead person.
I... may have set you up on a blind friend date!
-Wait, you did what?
No!
-Surprise!
- What?
- I just talked you up.
-Go!
Be yourself.
-Yo...
-Go, P!
-Go, P!
Go, P!
-Let me fix your clothes.
-Get off me!
Hey.
You must be Poo-see.
She called her Poo-see!
No, I'm sorry.
Did I say that right?
Yeah, yeah.
Poussey, it's French.
Oh, French.
I was named after a great aunt who hid pearls from the Yankees under her pendulous breasts.
And she also brewed a famous home remedy that supposedly cured hookworm.
-Not quite so exotic.
-Listen.
-Hmm.
-I...
I feel...
I feel like I need to apologize...
-Uh-uh.
-...for just being all, like, weird and stuff, you know, I just...
- I dig your whole thing, you know.
And I just, I watch your show so much, so seeing you in person was just, you know, I got all tongue-tied, and fan-girly and stuff.
So I'd try to say words, but when they came out of my mouth, it just sound like...
All right, all right, all right.
Relax, darlin'.
Your friend has told me the whole story.
She has got you covered.
You gotta sink a hook in the keepers, especially in this place.
-Uh-huh.
-You know, it's funny.
Me and Brook, we never would've crossed paths.
I mean, growing up all over the world, bouncing culture to culture with a strict, conservative family, versus, you know, sleeping in tent cities with a bunch of dirty hippies, eating food out of dumpsters.
Oof!
You have been through a lot.
Nah, it was...
I mean, it was good.
Well, I mean, it was hard, you know?
Like, I guess being transient, and not really having any long-term friends, but I do know three languages.
Hmm!
Wait...
- you know three languages?
- Yeah.
How does the child of a crack whore learn three languages?
-That is remarkable.
-Excuse me?
What languages?
English, French and German.
Did you just call my mother a crack whore?
My mother had a masters in Art History and she could barely take an aspirin.
-Excuse me?
-My dad is a major in the army.
I was supposed to go to West Point.
I guess you were expecting just another ghetto prison rat.
At least one of us lives up to the stereotype.
What, no!
Sweetheart, no!
You have snatched the taste right out of my mouth.
I'm just parroting what your girlfriend told me about you.
You came out of a cycle of poverty, blah, blah, blah.
I mean, it seems to me that you two formed this relationship without talking much.
Did you know I am learning Italian?
So, did Chester the Molester sign?
You owe me 50 bucks.
-Whoa.
-And you better take me out.
I can't believe you had the balls to do it.
Whatever, he probably finger-banged his 15-year-old girlfriend when he was 17 or something else no big.
The sex offender lists are full of sob stories about people's lives being ruined by technicalities.
You know, as a matter of fact, he was a fucking horrible child-molester rapist.
Because I'm so sure he told you that.
Yeah, 'cause he...
He fucking tried to seduce me.
He invited me in for lemonade.
-And you went in?
-Yeah.
He told me I didn't look 19.
That's when I knew I was in trouble.
Shit.
He stroked my hair.
He wanted to brag, so he showed me the newspaper article about how he stalked this nine-year-old girl from his church, for, like, a year.
Earning her trust, gradually convincing her to...
Well, to...
To...
And then I was running down the street.
For your fucking bet, Ethan.
For 50 fucking dollars.
But also because I... because I wanted to go out with you.
I really appreciate you coming all the way down from Utica.
Sorry, again, I couldn't get a seat in one of the gondolas.
No, no, it's okay.
This is great.
I'm really glad that you thought I called.
These new guards, they're a... they're a big win for us.
Like, "us" us.
And the company, but especially "us" us.
Yeah.
We're not a bad team, Linda from Purchasing.
To us, Joe from Litchfield Human Activity, and our continued wins.
- And to the veterans, of course.
- Of course.
♪ Happy, happy birthday clappy ♪
♪ Join us as we celebrate ♪
♪ Clap your hands and dance around ♪
♪ Have a laugh and eat some cake ♪
♪ Happy birthday, happy birthday Happy birthday ♪
♪ You're so great!

What?
The bald guy... is, uh... one of our former guards.
A really good guy.
Donaldson.
A good guy...
who walked out in the middle of an inmate transfer/high-profile self-surrender?
Yeah, I get your point.
Don't beat yourself up, Joe.
You handled that situation like a total boss.
Meant both literally and in that hip-kid lingo way.
Jesus!
He's not even a fucking waiter.
- He's a busboy.
-What?
-No, just... you could've lost your job... or faced prosecution had inmates gone missing that day.
I mean, you're concerned about...
these jerks that hung you out to dry.
You're quite a guy, Joe Caputo.
There you go, sir.
Whenever you're ready.
- Uh, do me a favor, will you?
- Mmm-hmm.
-The change is yours.
-Okay.
Give a 20 to that busboy over there.
Wait till we're gone.
I don't want to make a thing of it, okay?
Okay.
Hey, Mr. Caputo!
-Look, Donaldson--
-I don't need your money, Mr. Caputo.
It's nothing, take it, it's--
Nah, this is not to help me.
This is to make you feel better about that... pardon my French, miss, bullshit you pulled.
-Okay, Joe, let's go.
-The bullshit I pulled?
I work three jobs.
This is the good one.
O'Neill?
I heard he had kidney stones.
But no health insurance.
So he thought he'd power through, wait for it to pass.
It didn't.
Now he's on dialysis.
He may lose a kidney.
-Jesus.
-Yeah.
So take your $20 and drown your conscience in a bottle of gin, because paying me to feel better about it ain't gonna work.
Donaldson.
You tell O'Neill I'm sorry about his stones.
I'm also sorry you gotta work here.
But I need you to understand something.
I'm sorry for you.
I don't regret firing any of you.
You walked out on the biggest day the prison's faced in 25 fuckin' years.
You put the prisoners at risk, you put your fellow cos at risk, you put this whole town in danger!
The shit hit and instead of moving the fan away, you plugged it in and you hit "oscillate."
I was gonna make you captain of the guard, Wade.
Really.
You keep the 20.
Least I could do for helping me dodge a bullet.
I'm sorry about this.
These houses are yours to live in, but they are prison property.
They will be treated with respect.
As long as they are treated with respect, you will be as well.
Okay, the warden has asked me to do a... icebreaker event.
I will demonstrate this activity with CO...
-McCullough, sir.
-Okay, McCullough.
Tell me two true things about you and one lie.
I will attempt to guess the lie.
Okay, um...
I came to say I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Okay, please don't lock me out.
You're right to be upset.
How would you know?
You don't know anything about me, Soso.
And, what, you think I'm upset about my mom's crack abuse or because I grew up poor, black and uneducated in the urban jungle?
Okay, I watched The Wire a lot.
I made assumptions.
But you spent time with me.
I mean, did you even listen when I talked?
Like, what the fuck about me, besides the color of my skin, would indicate that I'm some indigent hood rat?
- I don't know.
No, it's fine, it's cool.
I'm guilty, too.
I won't lie.
You know, I like the story of the rich, white, hippie girl in my bed.
I've been working that on my end.
I don't want this to end.
What good is coming up here and sitting in the lobby every weekend gonna do?
She wants to get Sophia out, she needs to get a lawyer or a non-profit involved or something.
Ms. Burset said that the prison has tons of lawyers, so at least coming up here and waiting for the warden to come out to get into his face is something...
Michael started a Kickstarter campaign.
Kickstarter?
What that mean?
Not much, usually.
There's nothing to be ashamed about.
Plenty of guys live with their parents.
Right, yeah, I mean, you know...
I'm just doing this to save money, you know?
'Cause I could live on my own, obviously.
Oof!
Obviously.
I mean, very, very obviously.
It just makes the most financial sense, you know?
For the both of us.
Oh!
That's my manicotti, always thinking of his little lasagna.
Hey...
I made you something.
Fresh baked.
Lorna...
No, no, no, don't say it.
You know, even though it took a lot of time, and I had to go to the store twice, you... are worth it.
Hmm.
Mmm!
-Mmm!
-It's still warm.
My favorite.
Peanut butter and MM's.
-Snickerdoodles.
-Oh!
-I love you.
-Oh!
And you should.
I am quite a catch.
Oh, my God, you are.
You so are.
Fuck.
I want you.
-Vinnie.
-I want you.
It's our living room.
The neighbors want to look in, that's their good luck.
I'm already unbuttoning my shirt.
My goodness, you know that I can't resist your muscular chest.
Oh, my God.
My hands, they're in your hair right now.
- I'm stroking it real soft.
Till I grab a handful of it and pull it back.
You're such a man.
Oh, God.
I'm licking your neck.
Kissing your ears.
My hand is on that big mountain in your pants, and I am unzipping you right now.
And I'm pulling your shirt off real slow.
No, no, no, it's a button-up.
-I unbutton it real slow.
-No, no, no, tear it off.
-Pulling it off.
It's off.
-Tear it off.
It's off, the buttons, they're everywhere.
They're everywhere.
Oh, my God, my mouth...
My mouth is on those big titties.
-My nipples are so hard right now.
-Oh, my God, my cock.
Oh, my God, my cock is really hard.
I know, baby.
No, it's really hard.
Like, right now, it's really hard.
-I know, Vinnie...
-Oh, God.
-Vinnie, put it inside me.
-Yeah?
Oh, my God, it's in you.
Oh, it's in you.
- Oh, my God, it's in you.
It feels so good.
You're so wet.
You are so wet.
I actually am.
-I'm super wet right now.
-I know.
Do it to me.
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
-Don't stop.
-I'm not stopping.
I'm not stopping.
I'm not gonna stop.
I'm not gonna stop.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, baby!
- Oh, my God!
He's humping the table.
--What the hell?
Hey!
Hey, stay right here.
Stay looking at me, all right?
Jesus Christ.
Don't think I don't see you.
Pleasure, as always.
Also, I want to talk to you about something.
If this is about last week, I don't get to control my flow.
I think it's all the stress of all these new bitches in here.
I know these last few weeks have had their challenges.
So...
I wanted to say thank you.
And keep up the good work.
Your morale is important to me.
Oh!
That's so sweet.
Ovaltine?
It's to make chocolate milk.
Pretty much only Chinese people drink it now, which is probably why it's at commissary, but it's really good.
So, it's chocolate powder for my powdered milk?
It's got vitamins.
Oh!
See?
New bitches.
Why are they always staring like they're waiting for a donkey show to start?
I don't think they're staring at you.
They were following us earlier.
And you didn't say anything?
People can stare.
-It's a free country.
-Not in prison.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
I bet your Bloody Mary gonna come early, too.
Hey.
Hey.
You okay?
- No.
You?
No.
Do you want to talk about it?
Not really.
You?
But have you ever heard the phrase "paper asshole"?
No.
Ruiz said it to me.
I think I pissed off the Dominicans.
Relax.
You run the Litchfield panty company...
not the Sinaloa drug cartel.
No one's stitching your face to a soccer ball.
See ya around, Pipes.
What's this?
It's for the eyes.
Takes the red out.
I know what it is, pendeja.
What's it doing out?
It's contraband.
Whoops!
I need to be more careful.
Yeah, you do.
A few drops of that falls into the food, and this whole prison will be shitting their brains out.
Really?
I had no idea.
She acts so tough, but to stress-eat this food?
The poor woman.
Oh, you evil, Russian bitch.
What can I say?
I do a lot with a little.
No!
No!
No!
What the fuck?
That's my toilet paper.
--Oh!
I talk a lot.
I babble... until I find something the person I'm with is interested in.
And I'll say anything I can to get them to like me.
But I... really... really like you.
The real you.
You don't know the real me.
But I want to.
So in, like, a minute, I'm gonna put down this radio, and I'm gonna listen to you tell me about yourself.
And I'm not gonna try to rewrite your story in my head.
And then, when you're done, I'd like to tell you about myself.
And some of it will be embarrassing and ugly... but mostly boring.
And then... maybe afterwards, we could, like...
quiz each other or something?
Eminem?
Yeah, it's not a presumption about you liking rap.
It's just...
AM 700 The OG is the only station that comes in clear.
Jackson, North Carolina.
Is that where you were born?
No, that's where my great-grandmother was born.
I mean, stuffed crust shoulda revolutionized pizza,
-but it was just a fad.
-Man, nah, it's the same thing.
-Man, it is not the same thing!
-All right.
'Cause that's Italian...
this is Mexican.
You got a stuffed tortilla, and you stuff that with more stuff.
--Man, it's my golden ticket, and I'm gonna do it right with that business savvy and shit.
--Hey, hey, hey!
Do you hear that?
What is that?
Wow, look at that.
That's a drone.
-It's a drone.
-Shit!
What's it doing here?
Like we some Iraqi wedding?
Man, come on.
We're gonna be late.
He was a bad man and we did good things.
He did bad things and we killed him good.
No, we did bad.
No!
We did well.
Hey.
Have you seen Whitehill?
Yeah, I forgot the garden needed turning.
If Rikerson comes back, just tell him where we went, okay?
Oh, fuck!
-No!
No!
-Lolly, Lolly.
--Listen, listen.
They know!
They know!
They found you!
We have to move the body!
Shut up.
We cannot move the body.
There's drones.
Stop it, Lolly.
We cannot move it.
If I told you I already moved it, would it calm you down?
Maybe for a minute.
Good, 'cause I did.
Now, scat.
You didn't actually move it.
Hell, no.
And I'm not about to.
We're gonna have to kill her.

[women speaking Spanish]
How are we supposed to clean the floors with nonstop bitches tracking they shit through?
We are like he whom the gods have condemned to push the boulder up the hill, only to watch it roll back down.
Oh, right, right, right, right.
And then he has to cut his arm off to get out from underneath it.
What is that guy's name?
Oh, James Franco.
Sisyphus.
I did hear that rumor.
You know those Hollywood types.
- They will stick it in any warm hole.
- You don't have to be from Hollywood to want to put it in a warm place.
It's called having a dick.
No.
My Vinny would never.
Well, maybe not a in a man-hole, but you away a long time.
He could be getting his MM meltin' in some ho's mouth and not in his hand.
- [snickers]
- No.
No.
That's never gonna happen, because we're talking sexy on the phone like 24/7, and I mean real sexy.
And I give very good phone.
Are we talking about peanut MM's or regular?
- Ooh!
- [laughter]
[Donuts] Inmate Jefferson, Tasha Jefferson, report to the warden's office.
Inmate Tasha Jefferson to the warden's office.
Who's Tasha Jefferson?
Oh, Taystee?
Taystee, go to the warden's office.
We have a warden?
Your name's Tasha?
What is this about?
The main thing is answering the phones and organizational... stuff.
General assisting.
I don't know.
I've never had an assistant before.
We will figure it out together.
And you swear this is legit?
'Cause I seen "Shawshank," and I don't want to go to seg because I did your taxes too good.
I guarantee you, you will never see anything with my social security number on it.
Never say never.
You work for MCC.
Maybe one day you realize you need food stamps and you don't know how to fill out the forms.
Well, I'm your girl.
I can walk you through it.
But I'ma need them digits.
However, I'm a vault.
I don't say nothing, and I ain't never crawling through a tunnel of piss and dookie, so rest easy.
Okay.
As of now, you're off janitorial and you're with me.
Praise Jesus.
Every day, when I'm working, you're working.
Is this 'cause I won at job fair?
Sure.
[scoffs] I told them bitches.
Take a clipboard.
Write things down.
Look busy.
Outside.
- Alert.
Alert.
Alert.
- What?
[grunts]
[Alex] What?
Healy's just showing her around.
Frieda's over there.
It's all good.
Why does she get some special garden tour like some fancy shiba inu?
[scoffs] She's a celebrity, okay?
Fucking relax.
[stammering] Uh, not okay.
Not... not.
Really?
Relax?
I think you are way too relaxed to be in this big brown shit-uation that we're in.
Lolly, believe me, my insides have completely liquefied, and I want to vomit all the time.
But I have chosen to keep my voice low and appear calm.
- You have to do the same.
- [sighs] I can't.
You have to.
Look at me.
You...
listen.
You have to.
Change the record in your head.
Play, "He was a bad man.
We did what we had to do, and we did it well.
So now it's through."
It's a mantra.
Say it.
We did what we had to do, and we did it well.
You forgot the "bad man" part and the end.
But that's the idea.
So, whenever you're feeling worried, whenever your thoughts start to... wander, just bring them back to the mantra.
And then come and find me, okay?
He was a bad man who did bad things well, and now he's gone.
Got it.
He was a bad man.
Now he's gone... [sighs]
Now, that is one happy tomato.
[chuckles]
I hope I do as well here.
- Hey, there's a good idea.
- Mm.
Maybe we should fertilize our women, too.
[chuckling] I do love your good intentions.
Hey, Judy.
Hey.
[giggling]
Oh.
You've got quite a following.
Yeah.
I was hoping the novelty would wear off soon.
I'll have to hide myself in that corn.
[laughs]
Oh!
Look how beautiful!
Help yourself.
Oh, all right.
[Red] Oh, really?
Free-for-all on the produce now, huh?
Regardless of who's in the club, who's worked the soil, pulled the weeds, tended the seedlings?
Is that the new policy?
This is Judy King.
Oh, I know who she is.
I've seen her daytime TV program.
But we haven't had the pleasure.
Mrs. King is going to be joining your club, Red, so I'll...
I'll leave you to it.
- Thank you.
- [mumbles incoherently]
I'm sure you'll find a lot in common.
- [laughs]
- Hair and... accents.
You know, my daddy used to call me Red.
[chuckles] [chuckles] Oh, really?
That's sweet.
[Red] My papa called me Solnyshko.
It means "Little Sun."
But I've grown bigger and hotter since then, and he's dead.
So, what are you going to do with that ear now that you've picked it?
Well, I guess that depends on what else I can find around here.
I could do a southern fried corn, a dilled corn shooter, Taiwanese-style street corn.
Listen to fancy pants.
I could shove it up your ass.
Mm.
I'm not so big on ass play.
What do you suggest I do, Miss Red?
I'm thinking.
[indistinct conversations] [crunching]
Can I have some seeds?
You bought Ovaltine.
Reap what you sow.
Ovaltine's got vitamins.
I'll trade you Ovaltine powder later for some seeds now.
- I'm good for it.
- No deal.
You'll regret it.
That's some malty goodness you're passing up.
Excuse me?
You knew going into this I had bad knees.
My feet are killing me.
We are putting out a vibe.
If you are sitting and or eating my seeds, no vibe.
Right now, there is no vibe.
See?
Look at this.
All of a sudden, I'm approachable.
Picking up or dropping off?
Neither.
We're out.
I gave you guys new ones yesterday.
We're hanging up our lacy intimates.
If this is because of the money Stella took, I'm good for it.
I'll pay you back.
It's not worth it anymore.
We're smelling the beginning of the end.
You and all your posturing, shipping the kangaroo down the hill.
[clicks tongue]
It's starting to feel dangerous.
You've even got a heavy on the payroll.
[chuckles] I see what you did there.
- Heavy.
- Not on purpose.
Fine.
Jump ship like rats.
And I'm not talking about the Disney/Pixar kind.
I was gonna fire one of you anyway, but I'm not gonna say which one.
Chew on that.
We're gonna take a walk on the track.
You want to join us, kahuna?
No, she does not.
She's got bad knees.
Enjoy sweating for free.
I expect all my undies still in your possession returned post-haste.
Post-haste?
[chuckles] Aznuts.
Do you have something to say?
Sure.
But I'll wait till I'm with my friends.
Off the backboard.
[clicks tongue]
- Oh.
- [laughs]
Aww, man!
Short, black, and bad at basketball.
Subverting expectations since 1990.
Aww, it's okay.
Litchfield's latest lesbos.
In fun-size.
Look, how much longer do you think the world's longest game of horse is gonna go on?
She ain't a lesbian.
I see.
Testing the waters before diving in face-first?
I'm attracted to people, not genders.
Well, aren't you special.
Tell you what.
Why don't you use some of that sexual fluidity to slide off the court so the real men can play?
[chuckles] Come on.
Even though I do think labeling is a total sham,
I see the power in reclaiming an epithet, like you guys have with "nigga."
Okay.
Maybe not that, exactly.
But I really like you.
Like, really, a lot, and I just...
I want to honor your feelings, you know?
If you want to call this something, like, we're girlfriend-girlfriend or...
lezzy togezzy.
[laughs] I don't know.
How about we say we're happy?
Yeah?
Leave it at that?
[chuckling] Okay.
Oh, shit.
Hey, hi!
Hi!
Judy.
I'm... hey, girl. [chuckles]
Ju... [chuckles]
You're... you're [stammers]
It is so cute how moony you get every time she's around.
And by cute, you mean lame as fuck?
Well, yeah.
You need to pull it together.
[chuckles] I mean, she's a person you admire,
- but she's still just a person.
- A person.
Right.
You should be able to have a conversation with anyone.
Hi.
I'm Brook.
I'm your neighbor.
I was wondering if you'd heard about the plans to build a Walmart at the corner of Exposition and Euclid.
Yeah, I heard about it.
Well, I'm one of a group of citizens trying to convince the city council to turn that lot into a park space instead.
I was wondering if you'd be willing to have a friendly discussion or maybe even sign our petition?
Sure.
If you take your top off.
- [scattered laughter]
- Okay, that is inappropriate.
Yes.
Inappropriate things do happen out there.
How would you handle it?
You really think a grown man is gonna ask me to take my top off?
Well, there's a sex offender at, uh, 3134 10th street.
He might.
No.
You do not have to go to the sex offender's house.
No one has to knock on any door that makes him or her feel uncomfortable, but I do urge you all to be bold and stretch yourself.
By the way, has everyone signed their liability waivers?
Oh, shit.
I hear he likes little boys.
Little boy, Asian girl.
Are they really that far apart?
You said our breakup was going to be amicable.
Yeah, I said a lot of things.
So did you, like, "I love you.
I'll always love you.
This is not because of Oren."
Wait.
What?
She dumped me to get with you.
- I'm not sweet enough arm candy.
- Oh, my god!
Uh, could you kids drop the soap opera for another time?
We're going out there this afternoon...
Need to feel like you're prepared.
Well, clearly she's not.
She can't even handle, "take your top off."
Okay.
Fifty bucks says I get more signatures than you, Ethan.
No bet.
People will sign just to shut you up.
But here's a bet.
Get the pedo to sign, I'll give you your 50 bucks.
Oren will go on a date with you.
- Cool?
- Uh, I'm not really in...
Okay.
You are so on.
He will sign and you will give me cash and I will spend it on a new hemp messenger bag and strawberry lube because Oren seems like a strawberry kind of guy.
- Well, um...
- [man] Great.
Now, let's talk one more time about mirroring body language.
I'm just saying...
if you bought me a watch,
I'd be on the time better.
- The clock on the wall.
- Not in my office.
I'll put a clock in your office.
Or you could buy me a watch so when we out of the office, like now, I could tell you things like, "Hey, Mr. Caputo, we only a few minutes late to meet Piscatella,
and you the boss, anyhow, so relax."
I will consider your watch request.
Hey, I'm just trying to make your life better.
This ain't about me.
By the way, what you want me to do once we there?
- Take notes.
- Hold up.
Hold up.
Take... notes.
Got you.
Damn.
This place is like "Rehab Addict, Litchfield Edition."
and with, like, real addicts.
So, in a nutshell, uh, electrical is still having internet issues.
Plumbing works, but no hot water yet.
All beds and extraneous furniture are assembled and ready for move-in.
[pen scratching] Now, the, uh, interior paint... uh, inmate, what are you possibly writing that will have any salience past this moment in time?
Well, Mr. Caputo wants notes.
Now, I don't know what salience is, but I think a checklist of what's completed and what's not is hella revelant.
You mean "rel"... relevant.
[scoffs] I mean I'm trying to do my job, same as you, big man.
Are you... suggesting that we are, in any way, on any planet, in any universe the same, inmate?
Why don't you go check on Luschek and the internet situation?
What?
Let me watch you go.
Oh, you gonna watch me, watch me?
I will watch you.
Go.
[chuckles] Oh, I'm going.
It's clearly that... time.
Look at me go.
Go.
- May I ask you a question, Mr. Caputo?
- Shoot.
How did you choose her to be your assistant, exactly?
- Between you and me...
- Yes, sir?
She's the only semi-intelligent one that I'm only semi-attracted to.
[chuckles]
Well, if you'll follow me, I'll show you the bathroom.
[pen scratching] What are you writing?
Man, why everybody acting like they ain't never seen a black woman with a clipboard before?
No.
It's your pen.
It's exorbitantly scratchy, and it's giving me anxiety.
Damn, word-a-day.
I need to get me one of them calendars.
Anxiety wasn't from the calendar.
That's just me.
But... exorbitant was.
Check out these fat phone cords.
Shit, I can make so many bracelets out the wires in one of these.
Unh-Unh.
Those ain't phone cords.
They're for the internet.
And believe me, you want some of them guards to be able to watch they porn and get it all out before they on duty, so you best leave it.
So, hey, how come you don't get to live here, Luschek?
- Because I have a home, inmate.
- Yeah?
- An entire basement to myself.
- Mm.
You got to admit, though, it is kind of swanky.
You know, I mean, you could fit an entire family just right in here and still have room for a TV, a couple pictures of X-Rays...
home, sweet home.
Did you just say X-rays?
I did say X-rays, 'cause when my grandmammy broke her pelvis, all of us kids got X-rays 'cause the doctor was really nice and my mom was doing him on the side.
- [chuckles]
- That's funny, huh?
He literally took an entire X-Ray of my whole skeleton.
And I hung it up on my wall like a fancy English guy.
But it was just pictures of bones instead of, you know, like, real bones.
Your life is grotesque.
- 'Nother big word.
- What are you even doing here?
Mr. Caputo wanted me to check up on the internet issue.
Inmate...
Scar-Neck, explain the problem.
It doesn't work.
There you go.
[Lorna] Hey, baby.
[Vince] Yeah.
I thought you were getting home an hour ago.
Oh, I know.
The traffic... it was awful coming back from the store.
I...
I think there was a wreck or something.
Anyway, how was work?
How are you?
Vinny?
Look.
I'm sorry.
I'm just in a mood.
Well, don't you worry.
You just sit right there, and I'm gonna give you such a nice back rub.
- Lorna...
- Mm.
Ooh.
- Lorna.
- Honey, you're so tense.
I'm reaching around and I'm feeling down your chiseled and bumpy abs.
Oh, my goodness. [gasps]
I just found your cock-a-doodle-doo, and it's so hard.
[Gino] Vinny!
Hurry up!
[knock on door]
I'm busy!
All right?
!
Lorna, I can't really do this today, okay?
Wh...
Can you at least try?
No.
My roommates... it's awkward.
Well, I'm talking about kissing crotches in front of 50 other women, but for you, it's awkward?
I don't know.
I thought you were into that.
Well, I... maybe you could feel that way about your roommates.
Don't say that.
Well, do you have a speaker?
Put me on speaker, baby.
I'll talk so nice for you and the boys.
[woman] Vinny, are you gonna help him with his homework?
Lorna, my roommates are my parents and my kid brother.
[gasps] What?
All right?
There.
Now you know.
Well, why didn't you say that before?
I mean, what kind of fantasy is that gonna be?
You thought... you thought you married a man, not a boy.
[indistinct conversations]
Look, I got to go, all right?
Gino's back from school, and I'm gonna help him with his homework.
[exhales sharply]
Okay.
I think he shares a room with his kid brother.
Does that mean no more phone-boning in front of everybody?
Because, legit, that shit was kind of gross.
But also hot.
I'm having mixed emotions right now.
Yeah.
Me, too.
[sniffs] [gasps]
[Red] She's talking all the green beans.
I asked her not to.
Nicely, even.
Ignored.
And her flunkies...
Always lurking around now.
Look!
I'm looking.
In Russia, we have a saying.
Na chuzhoy karavay rot ne razevay.
"Don't open your mouth to eat other people's bread."
Or what?
Ask the Germans in wintertime.
- Uh, Miss Judy?
- Uh-huh.
I...
I was wondering if you would sign my cookbook.
- Of course.
- [chuckles] That's so nice.
Um, I'll buy one and bring it to you when we both get out.
All right.
Well, we have a date, then.
Now, thank you, ladies.
Bye-bye for now.
Mmm.
Hey, there.
Judy King.
Oh, guilty as charged, in all respects.
That's a joke, darling.
Oh. [chuckles]
You know, a lot of people in here are funny without meaning to be.
I learned the hard way to hold my mirth.
Oh, well, let your mirth fly free.
I mean to be funny.
All right. [chuckles]
Um, actually, I was wondering if I could speak to you about my friend.
Oh, that little retarded girl.
She's actually not... challenged at all, which is what we're supposed to say, not the "r" word.
Oh, uh, "R's." "F's," "L-M-N-O-P's" and "Q's."
You know, I get in more trouble for expanding those single-letter words, but never "n's." Despite this drawl, I'm brighter than that.
So, now, you were saying
- about your friend who is not challenged.
- [chuckles]
Am I allowed to say "special?"
No, she's not special.
- Well, she is to me.
- Mm-Hmm.
But not euphemistically.
She's a fan, and whenever she sees you, she freaks out. [chuckles]
You've got to understand.
Institutional racism traps the most vulnerable people in our society in this cycle of incarceration, which, in turn, leads to a cycle of poverty.
It makes someone like you, someone rich and powerful and white, virtually unapproachable.
All right.
So, now, let me get this straight.
Your friend acts like a moron around me because she's black and poor?
- Is that right?
- Basically.
- Mm.
- Yes.
[sighs]
I think her mother was a crack addict or something.
You might as well be an alien.
But...
But you could bridge the divide.
The way you did.
Yeah.
Exactly. [chuckles]
How about this;
why don't you bring her over at lunch?
Okay. [chuckles]
It'll be like, um, the one percent sitting with the other one percent. [chuckles]
Oh, my god.
"The other one percent" is such a good hashtag.
[chuckles]
[man on TV] The New Orleans police put out a call to...
Hi.
My name is Brook.
- Look...
- And I was wondering if... take your picture or smash an egg in my face or whatever you need to do for you and your friends to get your jollies.
- But spare me the setup, all right?
- I don't have a setup.
You know who I am?
Yeah, I do, actually.
[man on TV]...we are flying... you're a member of the community who has as much right as any of your neighbors to be concerned about the big-box monstrosity that's being proposed for the corner of Exposition and Euclid.
I'd be happy to talk about it with you if you have the time.
Look, I'm watching this Hurricane Katrina stuff.
It's really intense.
The world's gonna be lousy with Katrinas if we let mega-corporations like Walmart carbon-bomb our planet.
You want to come in?
Sure.
Yeah, I'll give you the...
the whole shpiel.
Spiel.
Uh, sorry.
I never know how to pronounce that.
- [chuckles]
- Uh, wait.
Um...
How old are you?
Nineteen.
Okay.
Come in.
[man on TV]...this terrible hurricane that came on land with 145-mile-an-hour...
Okay.
I don't know if you realize, but the introduction of mega-retailers like Walmart almost invariably have a negative effect
- on property values...
- You're so nervous.
I'm not nervous.
I'm passionate about saving local businesses like Lola's Bloomers.
May I?
Sure.
Sure.
Conservative estimates are that there will be thousands of more cars in the neighborhood per day because of the construction...
It says you want to put a park in instead.
I can't live within 2,500 feet of a park.
They would literally kick me out of my own home.
Sorry.
Can I talk about the elephant in the room for a second?
I wish you wouldn't.
I look across from me, and I don't see a monster.
I see a human being fighting to control the animalistic parts of his brain, true grit overcoming impulse.
Not everybody judges you.
What if I told you it was kiddie porn?
I'd... say you need support, and I'd applaud your restraint for finding an outlet for your compulsions.
[scoffs] Wow.
You will really say whatever it takes.
Well, it was a lot worse than kiddie porn.
Want to see?
No, I don't...
I don't need... no.
No need.
Um...
Wait.
All you did was have sex on the beach?
Consenting adults on an empty beach.
Well, except for the creeper that filmed it and turned us in to the cops.
- But you think that pervo got in trouble?
- [Brook] That is insane.
I mean, you are such a cautionary tale.
I would be if people got the story right.
But once I had to go around, door-to-door, announcing my status, the rumors got started.
I don't know.
It's all so fucked.
Here.
It's not like Walmart's gonna lose.
Awesome.

Oh... um...
Uh [clears throat] Warden Caputo's office.
This is Ms. Jefferson speaking.
How may I assist you?
[man] Is Warden Caputo available?
Uh, let me place you on a brief hold while I go and check.
[beeping]
Fuck.
- Oh, well, you gonna call back.
- [man] Hello?
I'm still here.
Damn, you are still there.
Then why the little light go out?
Anyway, don't matter.
I ain't got him right now.
[man] Will you please let him know I called.
- All right.
You take good care now.
- [man] Yeah... [sighs]
Shit.
What?
What happened?
I didn't quite get his name.
[sighs] You don't know who it was?
Well, it was some brother.
Sounded like a salesman type, if you ask me, so I probably did you a favor there.
Oh, and then some white lady...
she called about a get-together.
Mm-hmm.
It happened twice?
Jesus, Jefferson, what am I paying you for?
Are you sure she said "get-together?"
what does that even mean?
Like...
like a meeting?
Like a meeting.
Or...
like a date, maybe.
You holding out on me?
You somebody's Ca-baby-boo-to?
You're on thin fucking ice, Jefferson.
Was it Linda?
Possibly.
It wasn't Natalie, was it?
Linda sounds more right.
Okay.
Get Linda from MCC on the line.
All right.
- Press the button that says "Line 1."
- One.
- "9" and the number.
- Got you.
[muttering] [line ringing] [Linda] Uh, hello?
Yes, hello.
I have Director Caputo.
I will transfer you now.
[sighs] Shit!
[sighs] [dialing] [telephone rings]
- Warden Caputo's office.
- Uh, Jefferson, I got it.
My bad!
My bad!
[Linda] Hello, uh, Joe?
[Caputo] Uh, Linda.
Hi.
Uh...
Jefferson, hang up your line.
- I don't want to disconnect y'all.
- Hang up the phone!
Uh, I'm still training her.
Uh, I...
I got your message about a get-together.
- Oh, uh, wrong Linda, I think.
- [sighs]
But we do need to celebrate our victory...
All these veterans becoming guards.
Yes.
Yes, we absolutely do.
Any chance you're free tonight?
Tonight?
Ye... yes.
It's perfect.
Um... we can celebrate and, uh, talk business?
Uh, how about... how about La Fontana's at 8:00?
Yeah.
Great. [chuckles]
Great.
I...
I'll see you tonight.
[Linda] Okay.
Bye.
[indistinct announcement over P.A.]
Huh.
Even the staff waits for the bathroom now, hmm?
What can I do for you, Red?
[sighs]
I want to talk to you about the King woman.
You two are hitting it off, right?
You gave her the run of my garden.
How did you think that would go?
You know, planting a flag on the moon doesn't mean that you own it.
You're Russian.
I thought you'd appreciate that attitude.
Oh.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm only concerned for her.
Respect in prison has to be earned.
I don't know about that.
You've received a lot of leeway from staff around here.
You seem to be doing all right.
Oh, is that what this is about?
Are you punishing me?
Did you do something wrong?
I did the only reasonable thing I could.
There's no such thing as a consensual relationship between a prisoner and a guard.
Lorna's wedding was a bittersweet end to a relationship that never actually happened, Sam.
[toilet flushes]
You're reading something into this that isn't there, Reznikov.
And what goes on with Mrs. King is none of your business.
You're pampering her.
[door opens]
Oops. [chuckles] [door closes]
She even gets a magazine?
!
What do you want, Ruiz?
I heard about your labor dispute.
I thought maybe my friends could fill in.
This is Pidge.
You know Ouija, or she knows you.
And that's Zirconia.
Zirconia?
I took out all my rocks before I come in so nobody would think they was diamonds and rip 'em out.
Plus...
I don't think it's allowed.
They're all ready and willing to join your panty party.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Privately, please.
What are you doing?
This is not a publicly traded company.
Its very existence depends on keeping its existence hidden.
Chill the fuck out.
I was just trying to help you.
I don't need your help.
What I need is your discretion, and you bringing a bunch of thugs into my house is the opposite of that.
I decide who knows about Felonious Spunk.
I decide who gets hired.
I am the prison pussy panty business.
Somebody's getting a little big for her panties, I think.
I'm gonna choose to assume you're talking about yourself and take that as an apology.
[chuckles]
You're talking shit out a paper asshole, Chapman.
But when an actual hard-ass bitch decides to call you on it,
Well... [clicks tongue]
Pretty sure she was talking about herself on that last one.
[Crazy Eyes] It's not fair.
It is the most unfair thing that's ever happened in this prison.
Mm, what about when Carson went to SHU for sneezing too loud?
Or what's-her-face, the Puerto Rican girl with the gimpy eye, and when she got the wrong meds by accident in the med line and went nutso and gimped her other eye with a spork, and now she double gimp-eyed.
Or how about when pornstache used to make the methheads blow him for drugs in the mop closet?
Or the time Chapman got furlough?
I retract and redact.
New statement.
It's easily the top 138 most unfair things that has ever happened here.
- What is?
- Your new job.
My job is the bomb.
You sit at a desk all day when you were plucked from the most rewarding job.
I'm not saying it's on par with all the human rights abuses in here, but women fought for a long time to shake the role of desk-ridden secretary.
Are you for real?
[laughter]
Do you get the internet?
- Do you have a mini-fridge?
- Ah!
Do you have a skeleton key made from real human bone that opens a door to a world of talking animals?
Man, I got me a clipboard.
And a personal relationship with Mr. Caputo.
[laughter] [mimics buzzer]
Man, if George R.R. Martin wrote about prisons,
I'd be, like, the Hand of the Warden.
Don't the hand always die in them books?
- Ooh.
- Man, whatever, okay?
Winter is coming, bitches, and I'm getting me a watch.
- For real?
- Yes!
[chuckles]
[Poussey] Look.
I feel like she's smiling and waving at me.
Maybe she can see dead people, and there's one standing right... right in front of you.
Are the hairs standing up on the back of your neck?
I feel like I'm the dead person.
I... may have set you up on a blind friend date.
- [babbling incoherently] - [squeals] Surprise!
[chuckles] I just talked you up.
Go.
Be yourself.
[chuckles]
- Go, P.
- Go, P.
- Let me fix your clothes. [chuckles]
- Get off me!
Hey. [chuckles]
You must be Poo-see.
She called her Poo-see.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
Did I say that wrong?
Yeah, yeah, uh, Poussey.
It's French.
Oh, French.
I was named after a great aunt who hid pearls from the yankees under her pendulous breasts.
- [laughs]
- Oh, and she also brewed a famous home remedy that supposedly cured hookworm.
Not quite so exotic.
Listen, I...
I...
I feel like I need to apologize
- for just being all, like, weird and stuff.
- Uh-uh.
You know, I just...
I dig your whole thing, you know?
And I just...
I watch your show so much, so seeing you in person was just... you know, I got all tongue-tied and fangirl-y and stuff.
So I'd try to say words, but when they came out my mouth, they just sound like blah, blah...
All right.
All right.
Relax, darling.
[chuckles] Your friend has told me the whole story.
She has got you covered.
You got to sink a hook in the keepers, especially in this place.
- Uh-huh.
- You know, it's funny.
Me and Brook... we never would have crossed paths.
I mean, growing up all over the world, bouncing culture to culture with a strict, conservative family versus, you know, sleeping in tent cities with a bunch of dirty hippies, eating food out of dumpsters.
Ooph.
You have been through a lot.
Uh, no, I was...
I mean, it was good.
Well, I mean, it was hard, you know, like, I guess being transient and, uh, you know, not really having any long-term friends, but I do know three languages.
Mm.
Wait.
- You know three languages?
- [chuckles]
How does the child of a crack whore learn three languages?
That is remarkable.
- Excuse me?
- What languages?
English, French, and German.
Did you just call my mother a crack whore?
My mother had a Masters in Art History, and she could barely take an aspirin.
- Excuse me?
- My dad is a major in the army.
I was supposed to go to West Point.
Guess you were expecting just another ghetto prison rat.
Well, at least one of us lives up to the stereotype.
What?
No.
Sweetheart, no.
You have snatched the taste right out of my mouth.
I'm just parroting what your girlfriend told me about you.
You came out of a cycle of poverty, blah, blah, blah.
I mean, it seems to me that you two have formed this relationship without talking much.
Did you know I am learning Italian?

I'm also sorry you got to work here, but I need you to understand something.
I'm sorry for you.

What good is coming up here and sitting in the lobby every weekend gonna do?
She wants to get Sophia out, she needs to get a lawyer or a non-profit involved or something.
Mrs. Burset said that the prison has tons of lawyers, so at least coming up here and waiting for the warden to come out to get into his face is something.
Michael started a Kickstarter campaign.
Kickstarter?
What that mean?
Not much, usually.
There's nothing to be ashamed about.
Plenty of guys live with their parents.
Well, yeah, I mean, you know,
I'm just doing this to save money, you know?
'Cause I could live on my own, obviously.
Obviously.
I mean, very, very obviously.
It just makes the most financial sense, you know, for the both of us.
Oh!
That's my manicotti... always thinking of his little lasagna.
[chuckles]
Hey...
I made you something.
Fresh baked.
Lorna...
No, no, no.
Don't say it.
You know, even though it took a lot of time and I had to go to the store twice, you are worth it.
[indistinct conversations]
[sighs] [sniffs] Mm.
- Mmm.
Still warm.
- Mmm.
My favorite.
- Peanut butter and MMs.
- Snickerdoodles.
- I love you.
- Oh.
And you should.
I'm quite a catch.
Oh, god, you are.
You so are. [sighs]
Fuck.
I want you.
- Vinny.
- I want you.
It's our living room.
The neighbors want to look in, that's their good luck.
I'm already unbuttoning my shirt.
My goodness.
You know that I can't resist your muscular chest.
Oh, god.
My hands.
They're in your hair right now.
I'm stroking it real soft.
Till I grab a handful and pull it back.
Oh.
You're such a man.
Oh, god.
I'm licking your neck.
- Oh.
- Kissing your ears.
My hand is on that big mountain in your pants, and I am unzipping you right now.
- I'm pulling your shirt off real slow.
- No, no, no.
It's a button-up.
- I'm unbuttoning it real slow.
- No, no, no, no.
Tear it off.
Pulling it off.
It's off.
The buttons are everywhere.
They're everywhere.
Oh, my god.
My mouth... my mouth is on those big titties.
My nipples are so hard right now.
Oh, my cock.
Oh, my god.
My cock is really hard.
- I know, baby.
- No, it's really hard, like, right now.
- It's really hard.
- I know.
- Oh.
- Vinny, Vinny.
Put it inside me.
Oh, my god.
It's in you.
Oh, it's in you.
- [Lorna] Ooh.
- [Vinny]Oh, my god.
It's in you.
[Lorna] It feels so good.
You're so wet.
You are so wet.
- I actually am.
I'm so wet right now.
- You are so wet.
I know.
- [moaning]
- Do it to me.
Oh, I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
- Don't stop.
- Don't stop.
Don't stop.
Don't stop.
Oh, my god.
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, my god.
[table creaking] Ah!
[clattering] Ah!
[man] He's humping the table.
[Vinny gasping]
- Oh.
- Oh.
[woman] What the hell?
Hey.
Hey.
Stay right here.
Stay looking at me, all right?
Jesus Christ.
[man] Don't think I don't see you.
Pleasure, as always.
Also, I want to talk to you about something.
If this is about last week, I don't get to control my flow.
I think it's all the stress of all these new bitches in here.
I know these last few weeks have had their challenges.
So...
I wanted to say thank you.
And keep up the good work.
Your morale is important to me.
Oh.
That's so sweet.
- Ovaltine?
- It's to make chocolate milk.
Pretty much only Chinese people drink it now, which is probably why it's at commissary, but it's really good.
So, it's chocolate powder for my powdered milk?
It's got vitamins.
Oh.
See?
New bitches.
Why are they always staring like they're waiting for a donkey show to start?
I don't think they're staring at you.
They were following us earlier.
And you didn't say anything?
People can stare.
It's a free country.
Not in prison.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
I bet your Bloody Mary gonna come early, too.
[indistinct chatter]
Hey.
Hey.
[sighs]
You okay?
No.
You?
[sighs] No.
You want to talk about it?
Not really.
You?
But have you ever heard the phrase "paper asshole"?
[chuckles] No.
Ruiz said it to me.
I think I pissed off the Dominicans.
Relax.
You run the Litchfield panty company, not the Sinaloa Drug Cartel.
No one's stitching your face to a soccer ball.
See you around, Pipes.
What's this?
I know what is is, pendeja.
What's it doing out?
It's contraband.
Whoops.
I need to be more careful.
Yeah, you do.
A few drops of that falls into the food, and this whole prison would be shitting their brains out.
Really?
I had no idea.
She acts so tough, but to stress-eat this food?
The poor woman.
[chuckles] Oh, you evil Russian bitch.
What can I say?
I do a lot with a little.
[chuckles]

No!
No!
No!
What the fuck?
That's my toilet paper.
[splashing]
Oh!
[music playing distantly]
[Eminem's "Bitch Please II" playing on radio]
I talk a lot.
I babble until I find something the person I'm with is interested in.
And I'll say anything I can to get them to like me.
But I really, really like you.
The real you.
You don't know the real me.
But I want to.
So in, like, a minute, I'm gonna put down this radio, and I'm gonna listen to you tell me about yourself.
And I'm not gonna try to rewrite your story in my head.
And then, when you're done, I'd like to tell you about myself.
[sighs]
And some of it will be embarrassing and ugly, but mostly boring.
And then, maybe afterwards, we could, like, quiz each other or something?
Eminem?
[chuckles]
Yeah, it... it's not a presumption about you liking rap.
It's just AM 700 "The O.G." Is the only station that comes in clear.
[music stops] [chuckles, clears throat]
Jackson, North Carolina.
Is that where you were born?
No.
That's where my great-grandmother was born.
Stuffed crust should have revolutionized pizza,
- but it was just a fad.
- Man, nah.
It's the same thing.
- Man, it is not the same thing!
- Okay.
'Cause that's Italian.
This is Mexican.
[whirring] You got a stuffed tortilla, and you stuff that with more stuff.
Man, it's my golden ticket, and I'm gonna do it right with that business savvy and shit.
- Ooh, ri-ki-ki-ki.
- Hey, hey, hey!
You hear that?
[whirring]
What is that?
[woman] Wow, look at that.
That's a drone.
- It's a drone.
- Oh, shit.
What's it doing here like we some Iraqi wedding.
Man, come on.
We're gonna be late.

Shh.
- Listen, listen.
They know.
They know.
They found you.
We have to move the body.
Shut up.
We cannot move the body.
There's drones.
Stop it, Lolly.
We cannot move it.
If I told you I already moved it, would it calm you down?
Maybe for a minute.
Good. 'Cause I did.
Now scat.

You didn't actually move it?
Hell, no.

How are we supposed to clean the floors with nonstop bitches tracking their shit through?
[Suzanne] We are like he whom the gods have condemned to push the boulder up the hill only to watch it roll back down.
Oh, right, right, right, right.
And then he has to cut his arm off to get out from underneath it.
What is that guy's name?
Oh, James Franco!
Sisyphus.
I did hear that rumor.
You know those Hollywood types, they will stick it in any warm hole.
Well, you don't have to be from Hollywood to wanna put it in a warm place.
It's called having a dick.
No, my Vinnie would never.
Well, maybe not in a man-hole, but you away a long time.
He could be getting his MM melting in some ho's mouth and not in his hand.
[chuckles]
No.
No, that's never gonna happen because we're talking sexy on the phone, like, 24/7, and I mean real sexy.
And I give very good phone.
Are we talking about peanut MM's or regular?
[both laughing] [man on PA] Inmate Jefferson, Tasha Jefferson, report to the warden's office.
Inmate Tasha Jefferson to the warden's office.
Who's Tasha Jefferson?
Oh, Taystee?
Taystee, go to the warden's office.
We have a warden?
-Your name's Tasha?
-What is this about?
The main thing is answering the phones and organizational stuff.
General assisting.
I don't know.
I've never had an assistant before.
We will figure it out together.
And you swear this is legit?
'Cause I seen Shawshank and I don't wanna go to Seg because I did your taxes too good.
I guarantee you, you will never see anything with my social security number on it.
Never say never.
You work for MCC.
Maybe one day you realize you need food stamps and you don't know how to fill out the forms.
Well, I'm your girl.
I can walk you through it, but I'm gonna need them digits.
However...
[whispers] I'm a vault.
I don't say nothing.
And I ain't never crawling through a tunnel of piss and dookie, so rest easy.
Okay.
As of now, you're off janitorial and you're with me.
Praise Jesus.
Every day.
When I'm working, you're working.
Is this 'cause I won at job fair?
-Sure.
-[scoffs] I told them bitches.
Take a clipboard, write things down, look busy.
Outside.
Alert!
Alert!
Alert!
-What?
-Mmm!
[Alex] What?
Healy's just showing her around.
Frieda's over there.
It's all good.
Why does she get some special garden tour like some fancy Shiba Inu?
[scoffs] She's a celebrity, okay?
Fucking relax.
Uh... [stammering]
Not okay.
Not...
Not really relaxed.
I think you are way too relaxed... to be in this big, brown shit-uation that we're in!
Lolly, believe me.
My insides have completely liquefied and I wanna vomit all the time... but I have chosen to keep my voice low and appear calm.
You have to do the same.
-[exhales deeply] I can't.
-You have to.
-Look at me.
You...
-[inhales sharply]
Listen.
You have to.
Change the record in your head.
Play, "He was a bad man.
We did what we had to do and we did it well.
So now it's through."
It's a mantra.
Say it.
"We did what we had to do and we did it well."
You forgot the bad man part.
And the end.
But that's the idea.
So whenever you're feeling worried, whenever your thoughts start to... wander, just bring them back to the mantra...
and then come and find me.
Okay?
"He was a bad man who did bad things well, and now he's gone."
Got it!
"He was a bad man, now he's gone from the well..."
[Judy] Now that is one happy tomato.
[chuckles]
I hope I do as well here.
-Hey, there's a good idea.
-Hmm.
Maybe we should fertilize our women, too.
-[both chuckle]
-I do love your good intentions.
-[Maureen] Hey, Judy.
-Hey.
Hi.
You've got quite a following.
Yeah, I was hoping the novelty would wear off soon.
Might have to hide myself in that corn.
[chuckles]
Oh, look, how beautiful!
Help yourself.
Oh!
All right.
[Red] Oh, really?
Free-for-all on the produce now, huh?
Regardless of who's in the club.
Who's worked the soil, pulled the weeds, tended the seedlings.
Is that the new policy?
-This is Judy King.
-Oh, I know who she is.
I've seen her... daytime TV program.
But we haven't had the pleasure.
Mrs. King is going to be joining your club, Red.
So I'll leave you to it.
-Thank you.
-Yeah.
I'm sure you'll find a lot in common.
Hair and... accents.
You know, my daddy used to call me "Red." [laughs]
Really?
That's sweet.
[chuckles]
My papa called me solnyshko.
It means little sun.
But I've grown bigger and hotter since then, and he's dead.
So what are you going to do with that ear, now that you've picked it?
Well, I guess that depends on what else I can find around here.
I could do a Southern fried corn, a dilled corn shooter,
Taiwanese-style street corn.
Listen to fancy pants.
I could shove it up your ass.
Hmm, I'm not so big on ass play.
What do you suggest I do, Miss Red?
I'm thinking.
-Can I have some seeds?
-[blowing]
You bought Ovaltine.
Reap what you sow.
Ovaltine's got vitamins.
I'll trade you Ovaltine powder later for some seeds now.
I'm good for it.
No deal.
You'll regret it.
That's some malty goodness you're passing up.
Excuse me?
You knew going into this I had bad knees.
My feet are killing me.
We are putting out a vibe.
If you are sitting and/or eating my seeds, no vibe.
Right now, there is no vibe.
See?
Look at this.
-All of a sudden, I'm approachable.
-Picking up or dropping off?
Neither.
We're out.
I gave you guys new ones yesterday.
We're hanging up our lacy intimates.
If this is because of the money Stella took, I'm good for it.
I'll pay you back.
It's not worth it anymore.
We're smelling the beginning of the end.
You and all your posturing, shipping the kangaroo down the hill.
[tutting]
It's starting to feel dangerous.
You've even got a heavy on the payroll.
Ha!
I see what you did there.
-"Heavy."
-Not on purpose.
Fine, jump ship like rats.
And I'm not talking about the Disney-Pixar kind.
I was gonna fire one of you anyway, but I'm not gonna say which one.
Chew on that.
We're gonna take a walk on the track, you wanna join us, kahuna?
No, she does not.
She's got bad knees.
[sighs]
Enjoy sweating for free.
I expect all my undies still in your possession returned posthaste.
[chuckling] "Posthaste"?
That's nuts.
-Do you have something to say?
-Sure.
But I'll wait till I'm with my friends.
Off the backboard.
[clicking and grunts]
-[Poussey] Oh!
-[Brook laughs]
Short, black and bad at basketball.
-Subverting expectations since 1990.
-Oh, it's okay.
Litchfield's latest lesbos, in fun-size.
Look, how much longer do you think the world's longest game of Horse is gonna go on?
[exhales deeply] She ain't a lesbian.
I see.
Testing the waters before diving in face-first?
I'm attracted to people, not genders.
Well, aren't you special.
Tell you what, why don't you use some of that sexual fluidity to slide off the court so the real men can play?
[scoffs] Come on.
Even though I do think labeling is a total sham...
I see the power in reclaiming an epithet.
Like you guys have with "nigga."
Okay, maybe not that exactly.
But...
I really like you.
Like, really a lot.
And I just--
I wanna honor your feelings, you know, if you wanna call this something.
Like, we're girlfriend-girlfriend, or... lezzy togezzy.
[laughing] I don't know.
How about we say we're happy, yeah?
Leave it at that?
Okay. [chuckles]
Oh, shit.
Hey!
Hi!
Hi...
Judy, I'm...
Hey, girl.
[chuckles]
[Poussey stammers]
You're...
Fuck!
[grumbling]
It is so cute how moony you get every time she's around.
By "cute" you mean, "lame as fuck."
Well, yeah.
You need to pull it together.
I mean, she's a person you admire, but she's still just a person.
A person.
Right.
You should be able to have a conversation with anyone.
Hi, I'm Brook.
I'm your neighbor.
I was wondering if you'd heard about the plans to build a Walmart at the corner of Exposition and Euclid?
Yeah, I heard about it.
Well, I'm one of a group of citizens trying to convince the city council to turn that lot into a park space instead.
I was wondering if you'd be willing to have a friendly discussion, or maybe even sign our petition?
-Sure... if you take your top off.
-[all snickering]
-Okay, that is inappropriate.
-Yes.
Inappropriate things do happen out there.
How would you handle it?
You really think a grown man is gonna ask me to take my top off?
Well, there's a sex offender at 3134 10th Street.
He might.
No, you do not have to go to the sex offender's house.
No one has to knock on any door that makes him or her feel uncomfortable.
But I do urge you all to be bold and stretch yourself.
By the way, has everyone signed their liability waivers?
Oh, shit.
I hear he likes little boys.
Little boy, Asian girl, are they really that far apart?
You said our break-up was going to be amicable.
Yeah, I said a lot of things.
So did you, like, "I love you.
I'll always love you.
This is not because of Oren."
Wait, what?
She dumped me to get with you.
I'm not sweet enough arm-candy.
Oh, my God!
Could you kids drop the soap opera for another time?
We're going out there this afternoon.
You need to feel like you're prepared.
Well, clearly, she's not.
She can't even handle "take your top off."
Okay, 50 bucks says I get more signatures than you, Ethan.
No bet.
People will sign just to shut you up.
But here's a bet.
Get the pedo to sign, I'll give you your 50 bucks.
And Oren will go on a date with you.
Cool?
-I'm not really in--
-Okay!
You are so on.
He will sign and you will give me cash, and I will spend it on a new hemp messenger bag and strawberry lube, because Oren seems like a strawberry kind of guy.
Well-- [man] Great, now let's talk one more time about mirroring body language.
I'm just saying, if you bought me a watch, I'd be on the time better.
-There's a clock on the wall.
-Not in my office.
I'll put a clock in your office.
Or you could buy me a watch, so when we out of the office like now,
I could tell you things like, "Hey, Mr. Caputo, we're only a few minutes late to meet Piscatella, and you the boss anyhow, so relax."
I will consider your watch request.
Hey, I'm just trying to make your life better.
This ain't about me.
By the way, what you want me to do once we there?
-Take notes.
-Hold up, hold up.
"Take notes." Got you.
[Piscatella] Mop it all around.
Damn!
This place is like Rehab Addict:
Litchfield Edition.
And with, like, real addicts.
[Piscatella] So, in a nutshell... electrical is still having Internet issues, plumbing works, but no hot water yet.
All beds and extraneous furniture are assembled and ready for move-in.
-[scribbling]
-Now, the interior paint--
Uh, inmate?
What are you possibly writing that will have any salience past this moment in time?
Well, Mr. Caputo wants notes.
Now, I don't know what salience is, but I think a checklist of what's completed and what's not is hella revalent.
You mean "rel." Relevant.
I mean, I'm trying to do my job, same as you, big man.
Are you...
suggesting that we are in any way, on any planet, in any universe, the same, inmate?
Why don't you go check on Luschek and the Internet situation?
-What?
-Let me watch you go.
Oh, you gonna "watch me" watch me?
I will watch... you.
-Go!
-[chuckles] I'm goin'.
It's clearly that...
[whispers] time.
-Look at me go.
-Go.
-May I ask you a question, Mr. Caputo?
-Shoot.
How did you choose her to be your assistant, exactly?
-Between you and me?
-Yes, sir.
She's the only semi-intelligent one that I'm only... semi-attracted to.
[laughs]
Well, if you'll follow me, I'll show you the bathroom.
-[scribbling]
-What are you writing?
Man, why everybody act like they ain't never seen a black woman with a clipboard before?
No, it's your pen.
It's exorbitantly scratchy and it's giving me anxiety.
Damn, Word-A-Day.
I need to get me one of them calendars.
"Anxiety" wasn't from the calendar.
That's just me.
But... "exorbitant" was.
Check out these fat phone cords.
Shit, I could make so many bracelets out of the wires in one of these--
Uh-uh.
Those ain't phone cords.
They're for the Internet.
And believe me, you want some of them guards to be able to watch their porn and get it all out before they on duty, so you best leave it.
So, hey, how come you don't get to live here, Luschek?
-Because I have a home, inmate.
-Oh, yeah?
-An entire basement to myself.
-Hmm.
You gotta admit, though, it is kind of swanky... you know?
I mean, you could fit an entire family just right in here and still have room for a TV.
Couple of pictures of X-rays.
Home sweet home.
-Did you just say X-rays?
-I did say X-rays.
'Cause when my grandmammy broke her pelvis, all of us kids got X-rays.
'Cause the doctor was really nice, and my mom was doing him on the side.
-[both laugh]
-That's funny, huh?
He literally took an entire X-ray of my whole skeleton, and I hung it up on my wall like a fancy English guy.
But it was just pictures of bones instead of--
You know, it wasn't, like, real bones.
Your life is grotesque.
-Another big word.
-What are you even doing here?
Mr. Caputo wanted me to check up on the Internet issue.
Inmate...
Scar-neck, explain the problem.
It doesn't work.
There you go.
[Lorna] Hey, baby.
[Vince] Yeah, I thought you were getting home an hour ago.
Oh, I know, the traffic was awful coming back from the store.
I think there was a wreck or something.
Anyway, how was work?
How are you?
-Vinnie?
-Look, I'm sorry.
I'm just in a mood.
Well, don't you worry.
You just sit right down.
I'm gonna give you such a nice backrub.
-Lorna...
-[Lorna moans]
-Lorna!
-Honey, you're so tense.
I'm reaching around and I'm feeling down your chiseled and bumpy abs.
Oh, my goodness.
I just found your cock-a-doodle-doo and it's so hard.
-[woman knocking] Vinnie?
Hurry up!
-I'm busy!
All right?
Lorna, I can't really do this today, okay?
Well, can you at least try?
No, my roommates!
It's awkward.
Well, I'm talking about kissing crotches in front of 50 other women, but for you, it's awkward?
I don't know, I thought you were into that.
Well, uh...
Maybe you could feel that way about your roommates.
Don't say that.
Well, do you have a speaker?
Put me on speaker, baby.
I'll talk so nice for you and the boys.
[woman] Vinnie, are you gonna help him with his homework?
Lorna, my roommates are my parents and my kid brother.
[scoffs] What?
All right?
There, now you know.
Well, why didn't you say that before?
I mean, what kind of fantasy is that gonna be?
[stammers] You thought you married a man, not a boy.
Look, I gotta go, all right?
Gino's back from school.
I gotta help him with his homework.
[scoffs]
Okay.
I think he shares a room with his kid brother.
Does that mean no more phone-boning in front of everybody?
Because, legit, that shit was kind of gross.
But also hot.
I'm having mixed emotions right now.
Yeah, me, too.
[gasps]
She's taking all the green beans.
I asked her not to!
Nicely, even!
Ignored.
And her flunkeys, always lurking around now.
-Look!
-I'm looking.
In Russia, we have a saying... [speaking Russian]
"Don't open your mouth to eat other people's bread."
Or what?
Ask the Germans in wintertime.
-Uh, Miss Judy?
-Uh-huh.
Uh, I was wondering if you would sign my cookbook.
Of course.
That's so nice.
Um...
I'll buy one and bring it to you when we both get out.
All right, well, we have a date, then.
Now, thank you, ladies.
Bye-bye for now.
All right.
Mmm.
Hey, there, Judy King.
Oh, guilty as charged, in all respects.
That's a joke, darlin'.
Oh!
[laughs]
You know, a lot of people in here are funny without meaning to be.
I learned the hard way to hold my mirth.
Oh, well, let your mirth fly free.
I mean to be funny.
All right. [laughs]
Um... actually, I was wondering if I could speak to you about my friend.
Oh, that little retarded girl?
She's actually not...
challenged at all, which is what we're supposed to say, not the R-word.
Oh, uh...
"R"s, "F"s, "L-M-N-O-P"s and "Q"s.
You know, I get in more trouble for expanding those single letter words, but never "N"s.
Despite this drawl, I'm brighter than that.
So, now, you were saying?
About your friend who is not challenged.
-[chuckles]
-Am I allowed to say "special"?
No, she's not special.
Well, she is to me.
-Mmm.
-But not euphemistically.
She's a fan and whenever she sees you, she freaks out.
You've gotta understand.
Institutional racism... traps the most vulnerable people in our society in this cycle of incarceration which, in turn, leads to a cycle of poverty.
It makes someone like you...
someone rich and powerful and white, virtually unapproachable.
All right, so now let me get this straight.
Your friend acts like a moron around me because she's black and poor?
-Is that right?
-Basically... yes.
[sighs] I think her mother was a crack addict or something.
You might as well be an alien.
But you could bridge the divide.
-The way you did.
-Yeah, exactly!
[chuckles]
All right, how about this?
Why don't you bring her over at lunch?
Okay. [chuckles]
It'll be like, uh...
the 1% sitting with the other 1%.
Oh, my God.
"The other 1%" is such a good hashtag.
[chuckles] [chuckles]
[man on TV] The New Orleans police put out a call to...
-Hi!
My name is Brook...
-Look and I was wondering if--
Take your picture or smash an egg in my face, or whatever you need to do for you and your friends to get your jollies.
-But spare me the setup, all right?
-I don't have a setup.
You know who I am?
Yeah, I do, actually.
You're a member of the community who has as much right as any of your neighbors to be concerned about the big-box monstrosity that's being proposed for the corner of Exposition and Euclid.
I'd be happy to talk about it with you, if you have the time.
Look, I'm watching this Hurricane Katrina stuff.
It's really intense.
The world's gonna be lousy with Katrinas if we let mega-corporations like Walmart carbon-bomb our planet.
You wanna come in?
Sure.
Yeah, I'll give you the whole shpiel.
Spiel.
Sorry, I never know how to pronounce that.
Wait, um... how old are you?
Nineteen.
Okay.
Come in.
[man on TV] ...aspect of this terrible hurricane that came on land with 145 mile-an-hour...
Okay.
I don't know if you realize, but the introduction of mega-retailers, like Walmart, almost invariably have a negative effect on property values--
-You're so nervous.
-I'm not nervous.
I'm passionate about saving local businesses.
Like Lola's Bloomers.
-May I?
-Sure.
Sure.
Conservative estimates are that there will be thousands of more cars in the neighborhood per day because of the construction--
It says you wanna put a park in instead.
I can't live within 2,500 feet of a park.
They would literally kick me out of my own home.
Sorry.
Can I talk about the elephant in the room for a second?
I wish you wouldn't.
I look across from me and I don't see a monster.
I see a human being fighting to control the animalistic parts of his brain, true grit overcoming impulse.
Not everybody judges you.
What if I told you it was kiddie porn?
I'd... say you need support, and I'd applaud your restraint for finding an outlet for your compulsions.
[scoffs] Wow!
You will really say whatever it takes.
Well, it was a lot worse than kiddie porn.
Wanna see?
No, I don't...
I don't need...
No.
No need.
Um...
Wait, all you did was have sex on the beach?
Consenting adults on an empty beach.
Well, except for the creeper that filmed it and turned us in to the cops.
-But you think that pervo got in trouble?
-That is insane.
I mean... [sighs] You are such a cautionary tale.
I would be, if people got the story right.
But once I had to go around door-to-door announcing my status, the rumors got started...
I don't know.
It's all so fucked.
Here.
It's not like Walmart's gonna lose.
Awesome.
[sharpener whirring]
[phone ringing]
-Oh...
-[continues ringing]
Uh... [clears throat]
Warden Caputo's office.
This is Ms. Jefferson speaking, how may I assist you?
[man] Is Warden Caputo available?
Let me place you on a brief hold while I go and check.
[beeping]
Fuck.
Oh, well, you gonna call back.
Hello?
I'm still here.
Damn, you are still there.
Then why the little light go out?
Anyway, don't matter, I ain't got him right now.
Will you please let him know I called?
All right, you take good care now.
-Yeah.
-[breathes deeply]
Shit.
What?
What happened?
I didn't quite get his name.
[sighs] You don't know who it was?
Well, it was some brother, sounded like a salesman-type, if you ask me.
So I probably did you a favor there.
Oh!
And then some white lady, she called about a get-together.
Mmm-hmm.
It happened twice?
Jesus, Jefferson, what am I paying you for?
Are you sure she said "get-together"?
What does that even mean?
Like...
like, a meeting?
Like a meeting.
Or...
like a date, maybe.
You holding out on me?
You somebody's Ca-baby-boo-to?
You're on thin fucking ice, Jefferson.
Was it Linda?
Possibly.
It wasn't Natalie, was it?
[clicks tongue] Linda sounds more right.
Okay.
Get Linda from MCC on the line.
All right.
Press the button that says "Line one."
-One.
-Nine and the number.
Nine...
Got you.
-[muttering] -[line ringing]
-[clears throat] -[Linda] Uh, hello?
Yes, hello.
I have Director Caputo.
I will transfer you now.
[beeps] [blows raspberries] Shit!
-[dialing] -[phone rings]
Warden Caputo's office.
[Caputo] Jefferson, I got it.
My bad!
My bad!
-[Linda] Hello, uh, Joe?
-Linda, hi.
Uh...
Jefferson, hang up your line.
I don't wanna disconnect y'all.
Hang up the phone!
Uh, I'm still training her.
Uh, I got your message about a get-together.
Oh, uh...
wrong Linda, I think.
-[sighs]
-But we do need to celebrate our victory.
All these veterans becoming guards.
Yes.
Yes, we absolutely do.
Any chance you're free tonight?
Tonight?
Yes, it's perfect.
Um...
We can celebrate and, uh, talk business.
-How about La Fontana's at 8:00?
-Yeah, great. [chuckles]
-Great.
I'll see you tonight.
-Okay, bye.
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]
Ah!
Even the staff waits for the bathroom now, hmm?
What can I do for you, Red?
[sighs]
I want to talk to you about the King woman.
You two are hitting it off, right?
You gave her the run of my garden.
How did you think that would go?
You know, planting a flag on the Moon doesn't mean that you own it.
You're Russian.
I thought you'd appreciate that attitude.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm only concerned for her.
Respect in prison has to be earned.
I don't know about that.
You've received a lot of leeway from staff around here.
You seem to be doing all right.
Was that what this is about?
Are you punishing me?
Did you do something wrong?
I did the only reasonable thing I could.
There's no such thing as a consensual relationship between a prisoner and a guard.
Lorna's wedding was a bittersweet end to a relationship that never actually happened, Sam.
-[toilet flushes]
-You're reading something into this that isn't there, Reznikov.
And what goes on with Mrs. King is none of your business.
You're pampering her.
Oops!
[sighs]
She even gets a magazine?
What do you want, Ruiz?
I heard about your labor dispute.
I thought maybe my friends could fill in?
This is Pidge.
You know Ouija, or she knows you.
And that's Zirconia.
Zirconia?
I took out all my rocks before I come in, so nobody would think they was diamonds and rip 'em out.
Plus...
I don't think it's allowed.
They're all ready and willing to join your panty party.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Privately, please.
What are you doing?
This is not a publicly traded company.
Its very existence depends on keeping its existence hidden.
Chill the fuck out.
I was just trying to help you.
I don't need your help.
What I need is your discretion, and you bringing a bunch of thugs into my house is the opposite of that.
I decide who knows about Felonious Spunk.
I decide who gets hired.
I am the prison pussy panty business.
Somebody's getting a little big for her panties, I think.
I'm gonna choose to assume you're talking about yourself and take that as an apology.
[snickers]
You're talking shit out a paper asshole, Chapman.
But when an actual hard-ass bitch decides to call you on it... well...
[tutting and inhales sharply]
Pretty sure she was talking about herself on that last one.
[Suzanne] It's not fair.
It is the most unfair thing that's ever happened in this prison.
Mmm, what about when Carson went to SHU for sneezing too loud?
Or what's-her-face, the Puerto Rican girl, with the gimpy eye?
And when she got the wrong meds by accident in the med line and went nutso, and gimped her other eye with a spork.
Now, she double gimp-eyed.
Or how 'bout when Pornstache used to make the meth heads blow him for drugs in the mop closet?
Or the time Chapman got furlough?
I retract and redact.
New statement.
It's easily the top 138 most unfair things that has ever happened here.
What is?
Your new job.
My job is the bomb!
You sit at a desk all day when you were plucked from the most rewarding job.
I'm not saying it's on par with all the human rights abuses in here, but women fought for a long time to shake the role of desk-ridden secretary.
Are you for real?
-Hey!
-[all laugh]
Do you get the Internet?
-Do you have a mini-fridge?
-Ah!
Do you have a skeleton key made from real human bone that opens a door to a world of talking animals?
Man, I got me a clipboard and a personal relationship with Mr. Caputo.
-[mimics buzzing] -[all laugh]
Man, if George R. R. Martin wrote about prisons,
I'd be, like...
the Hand of the Warden.
Yo, don't the Hand always die in them books?
Man, whatever, okay?
Winter is coming, bitches.
And I'm getting me a watch.
-For real?
-Yes.
Hey. [chuckles]
Yo...
I feel like she's smiling and waving at me.
[mouthing]
Maybe she can see dead people and there's one standing right... right in front of you.
Are the hairs standing up on the back of your neck?
I feel like I'm the dead person.
I... may have set you up on a blind friend date!
-Wait, you did what?
No!
-Surprise!
-What?
-[chuckling] I just talked you up.
-Go!
Be yourself.
-Yo... [both giggling]
-Go, P!
-Go, P!
Go, P!
-Let me fix your clothes.
-Get off me!
Hey. [chuckles]
You must be Poo-see.
She called her Poo-see!
No, I'm sorry.
Did I say that right?
Yeah, yeah.
Poussey, it's French.
Oh, French.
I was named after a great aunt who hid pearls from the Yankees under her pendulous breasts.
[laughs nervously]
And she also brewed a famous home remedy that supposedly cured hookworm.
-Not quite so exotic.
-Listen.
-Hmm.
-I...
I feel...
I feel like I need to apologize...
-Uh-uh.
-...for just being all, like, weird and stuff, you know, I just...
-I dig your whole thing, you know.
-[chuckles]
And I just, I watch your show so much, so seeing you in person was just, you know, I got all tongue-tied, and fan-girly and stuff.
So I'd try to say words, but when they came out of my mouth, it just sound like...
All right, all right, all right.
Relax, darlin'.
Your friend has told me the whole story.
She has got you covered.
You gotta sink a hook in the keepers, especially in this place.
-Uh-huh.
-You know, it's funny.
Me and Brook, we never would've crossed paths.
I mean, growing up all over the world, bouncing culture to culture with a strict, conservative family, versus, you know, sleeping in tent cities with a bunch of dirty hippies, eating food out of dumpsters.
Oof!
You have been through a lot.
[stammers] Nah, it was...
I mean, it was good.
Well, I mean, it was hard, you know?
Like, I guess being transient, and not really having any long-term friends, but I do know three languages.
Hmm!
Wait...
-you know three languages?
-[chuckles] Yeah.
How does the child of a crack whore learn three languages?
-That is remarkable.
-Excuse me?
What languages?
English, French and German.
Did you just call my mother a crack whore?
My mother had a masters in Art History and she could barely take an aspirin.
-Excuse me?
-My dad is a major in the army.
I was supposed to go to West Point.
I guess you were expecting just another ghetto prison rat.
At least one of us lives up to the stereotype.
What, no!
Sweetheart, no!
You have snatched the taste right out of my mouth.
I'm just parroting what your girlfriend told me about you.
You came out of a cycle of poverty, blah, blah, blah.
I mean, it seems to me that you two formed this relationship without talking much.
Did you know I am learning Italian?
[sighs]
[stammers] [sighs]
[indistinct chatter]
So, did Chester the Molester sign?
You owe me 50 bucks.
-Whoa.
-And you better take me out.
I can't believe you had the balls to do it.
Whatever, he probably finger-banged his 15-year-old girlfriend when he was 17 or something else no big.
The sex offender lists are full of sob stories about people's lives being ruined by technicalities.
[scoffs] You know, as a matter of fact, he was a fucking horrible child-molester rapist.
Because I'm so sure he told you that.
Yeah, 'cause he...
He fucking tried to seduce me.
He invited me in for lemonade.
-And you went in?
-Yeah.
He told me I didn't look 19.
[inhales deeply] That's when I knew I was in trouble.
Shit.
He stroked my hair.
[scoffs] He wanted to brag, so he showed me the newspaper article about how he stalked this nine-year-old girl from his church, for, like, a year.
Earning her trust, gradually convincing her to...
Well, to... [sighs] To... [exhales sharply] And then I was running down the street.
For your fucking bet, Ethan.
For 50 fucking dollars.
But also because I... because I wanted to go out with you.
[exhales deeply]
[Caputo] I really appreciate you coming all the way down from Utica.
Sorry, again, I couldn't get a seat in one of the gondolas.
No, no, it's okay.
This is great.
I'm really glad that you thought I called.
[chuckles]
These new guards, they're a... they're a big win for us.
Like, "us" us.
And the company, but especially "us" us.
Yeah.
We're not a bad team, Linda from Purchasing.
To us, Joe from Litchfield Human Activity, and our continued wins.
-And to the veterans, of course.
-Of course. [chuckles]
# Happy, happy birthday clappy #
# Join us as we celebrate #
# Clap your hands and dance around #
# Have a laugh and eat some cake #
# Happy birthday, happy birthday Happy birthday #
# You're so great!
# [all cheering]
What?
The bald guy... is, uh... one of our former guards.
A really good guy.
Donaldson.
A good guy...
who walked out in the middle of an inmate transfer/high-profile self-surrender?
Yeah, I get your point.
Don't beat yourself up, Joe.
You handled that situation like a total boss.
Meant both literally and in that hip-kid lingo way.
Jesus!
He's not even a fucking waiter.
-He's a busboy.
-[laughs]
-What?
-No, just... you could've lost your job... or faced prosecution had inmates gone missing that day.
I mean, you're concerned about...
these jerks that hung you out to dry.
You're quite a guy, Joe Caputo.
[waiter] There you go, sir.
Whenever you're ready.
-Uh, do me a favor, will you?
-[waiter] Mmm-hmm.
-The change is yours.
-Okay.
Give a 20 to that busboy over there.
Wait till we're gone.
I don't want to make a thing of it, okay?
[waiter] Okay.
Hey, Mr. Caputo!
-Look, Donaldson--
-I don't need your money, Mr. Caputo.
It's nothing, take it, it's--
Nah, this is not to help me.
This is to make you feel better about that... pardon my French, miss, bullshit you pulled.
-Okay, Joe, let's go.
-The bullshit I pulled?
I work three jobs.
This is the good one.
O'Neill?
I heard he had kidney stones.
But no health insurance.
So he thought he'd power through, wait for it to pass.
It didn't.
Now he's on dialysis.
He may lose a kidney.
-Jesus.
-Yeah.
So take your $20 and drown your conscience in a bottle of gin, because paying me to feel better about it ain't gonna work.
Donaldson.
You tell O'Neill I'm sorry about his stones.
I'm also sorry you gotta work here.
But I need you to understand something.
I'm sorry for you.
I don't regret firing any of you.
You walked out on the biggest day the prison's faced in 25 fuckin' years.
You put the prisoners at risk, you put your fellow cos at risk, you put this whole town in danger!
The shit hit and instead of moving the fan away, [stammers] you plugged it in and you hit "oscillate."
I was gonna make you captain of the guard, Wade.
Really.
You keep the 20.
Least I could do for helping me dodge a bullet.
I'm sorry about this.
These houses are yours to live in, but they are prison property.
They will be treated with respect.
As long as they are treated with respect, you will be as well.
Okay, the warden has asked me to do a... icebreaker event.
I will demonstrate this activity with CO...
-McCullough, sir.
-Okay, McCullough.
Tell me two true things about you and one lie.
I will attempt to guess the lie.
Okay, um... [woman speaking indistinctly on PA]
I came to say I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Okay, please don't lock me out.
You're right to be upset.
How would you know?
You don't know anything about me, Soso.
[scoffs]
And, what, you think I'm upset about my mom's crack abuse or because I grew up poor, black and uneducated in the urban jungle?
Okay, I watched The Wire a lot.
I made assumptions.
But you spent time with me.
I mean, did you even listen when I talked?
Like, what the fuck about me, besides the color of my skin, would indicate that I'm some indigent hood rat?
-I don't know.
-[scoffs]
No, it's fine, it's cool.
I'm guilty, too.
I won't lie.
You know, I like the story of the rich, white, hippie girl in my bed.
I've been working that on my end.
I don't want this to end.
[Gloria] What good is coming up here and sitting in the lobby every weekend gonna do?
She wants to get Sophia out, she needs to get a lawyer or a non-profit involved or something.
Ms. Burset said that the prison has tons of lawyers, so at least coming up here and waiting for the warden to come out to get into his face is something...
Michael started a Kickstarter campaign.
Kickstarter?
What that mean?
Not much, usually.
There's nothing to be ashamed about.
Plenty of guys live with their parents.
Right, yeah, I mean, you know...
I'm just doing this to save money, you know?
'Cause I could live on my own, obviously.
Oof!
Obviously.
I mean, very, very obviously.
It just makes the most financial sense, you know?
For the both of us.
Oh!
That's my manicotti, always thinking of his little lasagna.
[chuckles] Hey...
I made you something.
Fresh baked.
Lorna...
No, no, no, don't say it.
You know, even though it took a lot of time, and I had to go to the store twice, you... are worth it.
[exhales deeply] [sniffs]
Hmm.
Mmm!
-Mmm!
-It's still warm.
My favorite.
Peanut butter and MM's.
-Snickerdoodles.
-Oh!
-I love you.
-Oh!
And you should.
I am quite a catch.
Oh, my God, you are.
You so are.
[exhales deeply]
Fuck.
I want you.
-Vinnie.
-I want you.
It's our living room.
The neighbors want to look in, that's their good luck.
I'm already unbuttoning my shirt.
My goodness, you know that I can't resist your muscular chest.
Oh, my God.
My hands, they're in your hair right now.
-I'm stroking it real soft.
-[panting]
Till I grab a handful of it and pull it back.
[moans] You're such a man.
[Vince] Oh, God.
I'm licking your neck.
Kissing your ears.
My hand is on that big mountain in your pants, and I am unzipping you right now.
And I'm pulling your shirt off real slow.
No, no, no, it's a button-up.
-I unbutton it real slow.
-No, no, no, tear it off.
-Pulling it off.
It's off.
-Tear it off.
It's off, the buttons, they're everywhere.
They're everywhere.
Oh, my God, my mouth...
My mouth is on those big titties.
-My nipples are so hard right now.
-Oh, my God, my cock.
Oh, my God, my cock is really hard.
I know, baby.
No, it's really hard.
Like, right now, it's really hard.
-I know, Vinnie...
-Oh, God.
-Vinnie, put it inside me.
-Yeah?
Oh, my God, it's in you.
Oh, it's in you.
-Oh, my God, it's in you.
-[Lorna moaning]
It feels so good.
You're so wet.
You are so wet.
I actually am.
-I'm super wet right now.
-I know.
[both panting]
Do it to me.
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
-Don't stop.
-I'm not stopping.
I'm not stopping.
I'm not gonna stop.
I'm not gonna stop.
Oh, my God.
-Oh, baby!
-[strained] Oh, my God!
[yells] [man] He's humping the table.
[Vince sighs]
-[panting] -[woman] What the hell?
Hey!
Hey, stay right here.
Stay looking at me, all right?
Jesus Christ.
[man] Don't think I don't see you.
Pleasure, as always.
Also, I want to talk to you about something.
If this is about last week, I don't get to control my flow.
I think it's all the stress of all these new bitches in here.
I know these last few weeks have had their challenges.
So...
I wanted to say thank you.
And keep up the good work.
Your morale is important to me.
Oh!
That's so sweet.
Ovaltine?
It's to make chocolate milk.
Pretty much only Chinese people drink it now, which is probably why it's at commissary, but it's really good.
So, it's chocolate powder for my powdered milk?
It's got vitamins.
Oh!
See?
New bitches.
Why are they always staring like they're waiting for a donkey show to start?
I don't think they're staring at you.
They were following us earlier.
And you didn't say anything?
People can stare.
-It's a free country.
-Not in prison.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
I bet your Bloody Mary gonna come early, too.
[indistinct chatter]
Hey.
Hey.
[sighs]
You okay?
-No.
You?
-[exhales deeply]
No.
Do you want to talk about it?
Not really.
You?
But have you ever heard the phrase "paper asshole"?
[chuckles] No.
Ruiz said it to me.
I think I pissed off the Dominicans.
Relax.
You run the Litchfield panty company...
not the Sinaloa drug cartel.
No one's stitching your face to a soccer ball.
See ya around, Pipes.
[Gloria] What's this?
[in Spanish] It's for the eyes.
Takes the red out.
[in English] I know what it is, pendeja.
What's it doing out?
It's contraband.
Whoops!
I need to be more careful.
Yeah, you do.
A few drops of that falls into the food, and this whole prison will be shitting their brains out.
Really?
I had no idea.
She acts so tough, but to stress-eat this food?
The poor woman.
[laughs] Oh, you evil, Russian bitch.
What can I say?
I do a lot with a little.
[laughs]
No!
No!
No!
[inmate] What the fuck?
That's my toilet paper.
-[defecating]
-Oh!
[rap music playing in distance]
I talk a lot.
I babble... until I find something the person I'm with is interested in.
And I'll say anything I can to get them to like me.
But I... really... really like you.
The real you.
[scoffs] You don't know the real me.
But I want to.
So in, like, a minute, I'm gonna put down this radio, and I'm gonna listen to you tell me about yourself.
And I'm not gonna try to rewrite your story in my head.
And then, when you're done, I'd like to tell you about myself.
[sighs]
And some of it will be embarrassing and ugly... but mostly boring. [exhales]
And then... maybe afterwards, we could, like...
quiz each other or something?
Eminem?
[chuckles]
Yeah, it's not a presumption about you liking rap.
It's just...
AM 700 The OG is the only station that comes in clear.
[snickers and clears throat]
Jackson, North Carolina.
Is that where you were born?
No, that's where my great-grandmother was born.
I mean, stuffed crust shoulda revolutionized pizza,
-but it was just a fad.
-Man, nah, it's the same thing.
-Man, it is not the same thing!
-All right.
'Cause that's Italian...
this is Mexican.
You got a stuffed tortilla, and you stuff that with more stuff.
-[faint humming]
-Man, it's my golden ticket, and I'm gonna do it right with that business savvy and shit.
-[scatting]
-Hey, hey, hey!
Do you hear that?
[humming continues]
What is that?
[inmate] Wow, look at that.
[inmates chatting indistinctly]
That's a drone.
-It's a drone.
-Shit!
What's it doing here?
Like we some Iraqi wedding?
Man, come on.
We're gonna be late.
He was a bad man and we did good things.
He did bad things and we killed him good.
No, we did bad.
No!
We did well.
[whispering] Hey.
Have you seen Whitehill?
Yeah, I forgot the garden needed turning.
If Rikerson comes back, just tell him where we went, okay?
Oh, fuck!
[grunting]
-No!
No!
-Lolly, Lolly.
-[shushing]
-Listen, listen.
They know!
They know!
They found you!
We have to move the body!
[whispering] Shut up.
We cannot move the body.
There's drones.
Stop it, Lolly.
We cannot move it.
If I told you I already moved it, would it calm you down?
Maybe for a minute.
Good, 'cause I did.
Now, scat.
[fence opens and closes]
You didn't actually move it.
Hell, no.
And I'm not about to.
[sucks teeth] We're gonna have to kill her.

- Oh, cheers.
(CAR HORN BLARES)
Take one?
For you.
(DOOR WHIRS OPEN)
This way, please.
The doctor will be with you soon to explain the procedure.
Hi.
I'm Mark.
This is Laura.
Hi, I'm Bruce.
Are you nervous?
A little.
It's OK.
It's fine, I studied medicine at uni, they do these things all the time.
I asked when I got here.
This drug we're testing is actually made by a UK company.
I...
I wouldn't be surprised if there were British doctors overseeing things.
(DOOR WHIRS OPEN)
MAN:
How do?
Am I the last one in?
- Looks like it.
- I couldn't find the place!
And you haven't done this before?
You've got to be kidding!
I wouldn't be here if I hadn't spent all me cash.
I'm skint.
We get dinner, breakfast and 600 quid.
That's my ticket home.
Where's home?
Leeds.
Can't you tell?
(CHUCKLES)
LAURA:
I'm still not sure.
Most of us won't even get the real stuff, whatever it is.
They just give you an injection and then you lie down for a few hours.
- How do you know?
- I've done it loads of times.
Don't...tell them that.
LAURA:
What if it's dangerous?
It's not dangerous.
They wouldn't be allowed to do it if it was.
You'll be fine.
I'm Henry.
Some of you may feel a little drowsy.
That's nothing to worry about.
If you drift off to sleep, that's fine.
Wake me up when it's all over, will ya?
- When do we get out of here?
- Lunchtime tomorrow morning.
MAN FROM LEEDS:
Is lunch included?
If you want anything, you can just ring the bell.
Any other questions?
Yeah.
When do we get paid?
- (TAPPING ON KEYBOARD)
- How long have you been travelling?
Two weeks. just finished teacher training.
- (KNOCK AT DOOR)
- MAN:
Enter.
(CONVERSATION CONTINUES)
Well, to get home, really.
So, are we all set?
Yes, Dr Leese.
Excellent.
Then carry on.

I tell you, this'll be the easiest money I've ever earned... (SNORING)
(DOOR WHIRS OPEN)
(MUSIC PLAYS THROUGH HEADPHONES)
(SOUNDTRACK MUSIC CONTINUES THROUGH HEADPHONES)

What?
One of them just left.
Come on, we must find him before Dr Leese gets back.
(MUSIC PLAYS THROUGH HEADPHONES)
(GASPS)
Doctor!
Have you seen one of the patients...
from Greenfern?
No, sir.
I was just about to go home.
OK.

HEYWOOD:
Ah!
It's horrible weather!
I know, I've been standing in it for the last half-hour.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Here you are.
What's this?
It's an After Eight.
I was just having dinner.
- Very nice.
- What we got, then?
Suicide, by the look of it.
15 floors.
- Name?
- Flaxton Court.
No, the body, not the building.
Oh, er...
Mark Henson.
I've got his wallet.
Also, an electronic door pass from a secondary school.
Must have been a teacher.
Could've been a cook.
Mustn't jump to conclusions.
SANDS:
What, like he did?
- (PHONE RINGS)
- HEYWOOD:
Yeah, well, er... check his place out and then send uniform round to next of kin.
Heywood.
- Er...excuse me, sir.
- Who are you and what do you want?
- Er...
Sayyad, sir.
- Is that a greeting or is that your name?
- PC Sayyad.
- PC Sayyad.
That's right.
- Are you the first attending officer?
- Er...no, sir.
- So, why are you talking to me, then?
- I don't think he jumped, sir.
Oh, you've got some other theory about how he ended up splattered across the pavement, have you?
He was pushed.
No!
Please!
(SCREAMS)
What makes you think that?
Well, I was second on the scene and I took his pulse.
Had one, did he?
No, sir.
He was dead by the time I got here.
But there was something on his skin - some sort of adhesive.
What are you talking about?
I mean, it was like there had been adhesive tape around his wrists.
Like he was tied up?
So, where is this tape?
- Well, I don't know, I...
- So, you examined the body, you found traces of something on the wrists, so why have you left him there?
!
Why haven't the hands been bagged?
!
Well, I...
Call to Forensics, all right?
!
Do it now!
- What was that all about?
- Some bloody amateur.
- I need you to bag the hands.
- We'll bag them straightaway.
- Adhesive tape?
- Could've been anything.
Let's check the roof.

You all right, Derek?
You'd think they'd have a lift that worked.
You didn't come up here, then.
I did come here.
I didn't see anything.
Maybe you didn't look.
HEYWOOD:
Someone comes to his flat, ties up his hands, takes him up top.

Why, Guv?
What's the point?
He's nobody.
Well, someone thought he was worth killing.

Yeah, I know...
You're late.
And the Leech wants to see you.
- (POLISH ACCENT) When?
- Half an hour ago.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Enter!
- You were wanting to see me, Mr Leese.
- Yes.
Come in, Stefan.
Close the door.
- Stefan Kowolski - is that right?
- Yes, sir.
You haven't been here long.
- Er, two weeks.
- You're temporary.
From the agency?
Yes.
Agency sent me here.
How long have you been in this country?
I, er, came here two year ago.
- From Poland.
- Yes, sir.
And you're interested in a career in the NHS?
In, er, clinical pharmacy.
Well, there's always openings for bright, young people and you're doing very well.
You might want to take a look at your English, though.
Sir?
You typed up this report to the North London Cancer Network Board?
- Yes.
- There were quite a few errors.
I, erm...
I don't see.
Third line.
Cytotoxins.
That's "cyto" with a C, not an S.
Ah, yes.
There's a couple more.
Top of that paragraph.
There's only one S in "aseptic:
And there should be two T's in Dr Bennett.
I'm, er, sorry.
If you want a full-time job, you'll have to try a little harder.
If you're prescribing drugs, the smallest mistake can have serious consequences.
Yes, sir.
Of course, there's not many permanent contracts around at the moment.
It won't be easy, but I might be able to help you, as a friend.
Mr Leese...
I'd like to get to know you a bit better, Stefan.
- I think we can help each other...
- No!
Is not right.
- I'm sorry?
- I'm sorry, Mr Leese.
I'm not like that.
- I don't know what you mean.
- What you do with your hand.
I don't know what you're talking about.
This isn't good enough.
Do it again.
Now get out.
STEFAN:
(ENGLISH ACCENT) I'm not going back.
I didn't join the Serious Fraud Office to be a typist, Marcus.
MARCUS:
You are going back.
Why?
Because we've actually got someone inside.
That's you.
Leese has accepted you.
And you're close to him.
- Too bloody close!
- Listen to me...
Marcus, I've got that intel you wanted.
Capitax Enterprises?
Thank you, Alison.
You want to get Leese?
You want to bring him down?
Yeah.
Then don't say a word to Eleanor about what happened.
OK?
And thanks, Stefan.
We owe you one.
MAN:
Tell me something, Arrash.
Why did you want to be a policeman?
I don't want to be a policeman.
I want to be a detective.
OK.
Why do you want to be a detective?
It's what I've always wanted.
Did the detective course at Hendon.
Top of the class.
Commendations all round.
From there, you went straight to Bromley for three months.
That didn't work out too well.
- Ah, it was all right.
- They didn't want you.
They sent you back here.
Yeah, but it was a three-month fill-in, maternity leave.
That's right.
She went off and had a little baby detective.
But then she didn't go back to work.
They got someone else in.
I, um... didn't know that.
I'm telling you now.
Thank you.
I'm trying to help you, Arrash, although you probably don't see it that way.
There's a difference between smart... and smartarse.
From what I hear from Bromley, they couldn't wait to see the back of you.
If you're a TDC, you cannot step on people's toes.
How many interviews have you had?
Four.
That should tell you something.
Listen you're clever.
You're good at the job.
We both know that.
So what are you doing wrong?
Well seems that you conducted yourself pretty well last night.
The murder at Flaxton Court.
They're saying it's a murder now.
I've had a request in from a DI Heywood - offer of six months probationary.
Starting when?
They want to see you first thing Monday morning.
That soon enough for you?
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)
Thank you, Sergeant.
Arrash, don't screw it up.
OK.
This is going very well, isn't it?
The Serious Fraud Office supplying the NHS with free secretarial assistance.
But, to be honest with you, I've yet to be convinced that this man,
David Leese, is our best way into UK Remicon.
And let's not forget they're the ones we're after.
David Leese is a chief pharmacist for six London hospitals with a combined budget of almost 150 million a year, and yet he's managing to spend almost a third of it with the same company.
All with UK Remicon.
At prices way above the generic brands.
He's taking backhanders.
Well, he must be.
Isn't it obvious?
UK Remicon are bribing him to choose their products for the NHS.
They're making millions.
Shame we haven't got a shred of evidence.
You've, um... you've issued a Section 2 on his accounts?
- He has three bank accounts.
- Uh-huh?
Nothing.
And his lifestyle?
He drives a Porsche.
He eats in the best restaurants.
He has a second home in the country.
He can afford to.
He's earning £95,000 a year.
And has a wife who also earns.
He's married?
You sound surprised - why?
Cos...
What?
Because he's a bastard.
Eleanor, urn...
Can we have a word alone?
Do you mind?
ELEANOR:
Has something happened that I should know about?
No.
Meaning it hasn't happened or I shouldn't know about it?
OK.
Let's talk about UK Remicon.
A British company with a market capitalisation of 50 billion.
They employ 37,000 people in England, Ireland and Scotland.
They're criminals.
They're protected.
As you'd expect, they have some very powerful friends, in business and in government.
Right now, I have three teams, 30 people, working on this.
We've scanned over 10,000 documents, spent God knows how many man-hours, and you think I'm going to risk it all for your Batman and Robin antics?
My Batman and Robin antics are why you employed me.
You go after UK Remicon down the usual channels, you're going to get nowhere.
Even if you get them to court,
UK Remicon is too big, too smart.
But Dr David Leese isn't.
He's our way in.
Two more weeks.
Right.
You need to take a look at his private correspondence.
Contacts.
Find something, anything, that links Dr Leese to UK Remicon.
And how would I do that?
How do I get back into his office?
You'll find a way.
Oh, and, Stefan, be careful.
WOMAN, ON LAPTOP:
So tell me, Henry, how was your day?
Boring.
At the car wash?
Yeah.
What's it called again?
Squeegees.
That is a stupid name for a car wash.
I want to see you.
I know.
I drove all that way and you weren't even there.
If you start that again, I'm going to sign off.
Don't!
Don't...
We'll be together soon.
I wish I was with you now.
And what would you do?
If you were here, right now?
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
I don't know.
I bet I can guess.
Anyway, I might be coming to London.
When?
Quite soon.
Will I see you?
It depends.
Are you still on that stuff?
- Er, what?
- The medicine.
Are you still taking it?
No.
You shouldn't, Henry.
It does things to you.
You shouldn't trust it.
Henry?
Henry, are you still there?
Henry?
Are you there?
I have to go.
I heard.
HENRY:
I'll call you later.
CAROLINE:
I know you will.
I love you, Henry.
I really do.
(FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS)
Hello, love.
You have a good day?
Yeah.
It was all right.
Who was that
- you were talking to just now?
- It was no-one.
Right.
I'll make supper.
By the way, I've just noticed the car.
What about it?
It-It's got a...big dent in it.
What?
On the front bonnet.
Are you saying I did it?
I just wondered...
You think I'd have bashed the car and I wouldn't have told you?
No.
No...
I only just noticed it myself and I was wondering how it happened.
That's all.
- I'd have noticed if I'd hit something.
- It's just that...
Why do you have to make such a big deal out of it?
(SIGHS)
You're right.
I'll make supper.
STEFAN:
Alison...?
Can you get this for me?
I need a Section 2.
Who's Elizabeth Leese?
Er, David Leese works for the City of London Health Trust.
She's his wife.
And you think he might be running something through her accounts?
I'm looking for any connection to UK Remicon.
I'll get on to them.
Great.
Stefan...
What?
I haven't seen you around much the last two weeks.
What have you been doing?
Working for Marcus.
Why do you want to know?
I just wondered.
Do you fancy dinner next week?
Tuesday.
My brother and his girlfriend are coming round.
Tuesday?
Yeah.
- Yeah.
All right.
- Great.

Oh, Mum, I've got to do my bike.

I've got the race tomorrow.
Gerald used to like bicycling.
Didn't you, Gerald?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah...
All right.
Ten minutes.
I'll get you a beer.
STEFAN:
Mr Menakis... you can't do this!
We have a fixed-term agreement which runs for another three months!
I told you the rent would rise.
No.
No.
You never said that.
Anyway, you have to give us notice.
That's the law!
Don't tell me about the law.
I know the law.
We're already paying you enough.
We can't afford any more.

Well, if I was in front of you, I must have come second.

You know what?
It doesn't matter.
Doesn't make a difference.

I'll see you there.

Arrash Sayyad.
Where does that name come from?
Er, I was born here.
Um, my parents came from Tehran.
Your dad a policeman?
Urn, he was.
Bromley didn't like you very much, did they?
I didn't like them very much either.
What, you think you can pick and choose?
- I didn't ask to leave.
- No.
No, I can see that.
You'll be working with DS Sands, standing in for DC Westfield.
He's on sick leave.
Ah, thank you, guv.
I'm, er...
- I'm grateful.
- Yeah, well, don't be.
Some little bastard stuck a knife in him, and if you want the truth,
I'd rather Jack was standing here than you.
That was good work the other night.
The sticky tape.
I'm not saying we wouldn't have got there in the end, but you were quick off the mark.
I like that.
So I want you to work on the Henson investigation.
Got a problem with that, Derek?
No, guv.
Not at all.
That's going to be your spot there.
Right.
Witness statements.
House-to-house.
CCTV.
Pathology report.
Henson's medical records.
Go through them all.
I'm sorry about DC Westfield.
What do you know?
CAROLINE:
I've got good news.
What's that'?
I'm coming to London.
When?

Can I see you?
Of course you can.
Why do you think I'm telling you?
Where will you be?
Can you meet me off the train?
When?
6.30.
I can't.
I'm working.
It's a car wash, Henry.
They won't miss you.
They don't even know you're there.
Of course you can.

Which station?
Canary Wharf.
- Come down to the platform.
Eastbound.
- (CLICKING)

Half past six.
Why?
Because it's romantic, Henry!
You can get a bus to the station, come down the escalator and meet me on the platform.

And don't tell anyone.
It's just you and me.
Hm?
I've got to go.

(BIG BEN CHIMES THE HOUR)
The Serious Fraud Office is bad for business, and that's bad for government.
Which is why I'm here.
Have you got any news for me?
Have you heard from them yet?
The SFO?
Nothing.
I assume they're trawling through our banking records.
Mm, company and individual.
How are things at UK Remicon, William?
I want them off our back.
The trouble with the Serious Fraud Office is that once they get started, they don't stop.
Gemma, I'm off to Southwark, I probably won't be back today.
So can you leave that stuff on my desk?
Yes, Mr Leese.
I have a source within the SFO, and I hear they've moved into a new phase.
They may have gone undercover.
It's going to make it harder to protect you.
You're in government.
Can't you stop them?
They're a completely independent organisation, William.
They report to the Attorney General.
They do not work for him.
You know that.
Even so...
Well, if they do something stupid if they step out of line, we may be able to step in.
WILLIAM:
What exactly are they looking for?
OTHER MAN:
Financial fraud, business malpractice, bribing or coercing of doctors or NHS officials.
Nothing, I'm sure, that would concern anyone at UK Remicon.
Of course not.
Unless, of course, there was something you weren't telling me.
(RATTLES HANDLE)
Stefan'?
What do you want?
(POLISH ACCENT) I, um...
I leave this for Mr Leese.
He's gone for the day.
I'll take it.
(POLISH ACCENT) Oh.
Thank you...
Gemma.
Where are we going?
Flaxton Court?
That's right.
I...just wondered.
Do you mind if we keep the chit-chat down to a minimum?
I'll be honest with you, the last thing I need right now is a Trainee Detective Constable, especially one who thinks he knows everything.
Nothing personal.
Sounds pretty personal to me...
You might be right.
I spoke to Bromley.
I know all about you.
And if I want conversation, I've got the radio.
Er, have Forensics been here?
(SARCASTICALLY) No, they haven't.
I mean, why would they need fingerprints or luminol or a complete bleeding crime report?
Of course they've been in!
(QUIETLY) Pillock.
Er, what are we looking for?
We're looking for the reason he was killed.
Mark Henson.
Teaches French and German at a local secondary.
No girlfriend.
No boyfriend.
Nice little flat.
Big mortgage, though-
Must be getting some help from Mum and Dad.
What are you doing?
Er, just taking a photo.
What, as a souvenir?
just leave it!
Maybe we should talk to someone at his school.
(SARCASTICALLY) Do you think so?
Really?
Ah, why didn't I think of that?
Come on.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
Mark had been here for two years.
We were completely shocked.
This is his classroom?
Yes.
I'm going to need to see his locker, the quiet room, any personal possessions...
Of course.
And then, um...had he been behaving strangely in any way or, er, had anything upset him?
I wasn't aware of anything untoward.
He'd just agreed to direct Bugsy Malone.
I did Bugsy!
Oh, what part were you?
Dandy Dan.
Excuse me?
I don't think he was killed because of a school play.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Ah.
Laura.
Come in.
This is Laura Jones, she works in our maths department.
She knew Mark best.
This is Detective Sergeant Sands and...
How did you know Mark Henson?
Er, we did teacher training together.
After that, we spent the summer travelling.
Where were you?
What?
When you went travelling?
We were in India.
When was this?
Six years ago.
But we kept in touch.
We stayed friends.
So what can you tell us about him?
RASH:
Was he worried about anything?
Or did he have anything on his mind?
Three weeks ago, he got quite upset.
We both were.
Why?
Someone we knew got killed in an accident.
He was a friend.
Who was he?
His name was Steve Mullen.
(VOICE BREAKING) I can't believe it, both of them...
You don't have to say any more if you prefer not to.
Yes.
She does, actually.
What happened to Steve Mullen?
A car accident.
A hit-and-run.

I know it's not much, washing cars, but if you don't work, you're not going to have control over your life.
It's not just about the money!
It's important!
Why haven't you been taking your medication?
You've been in my room?
!
I'm trying to look after you.
It's all I ever do!
Why have you stopped?
It doesn't help me.
All these big pharma companies, they want to control me.
They just make things worse.
Who said that?
That's not you talking.
Who's been telling you that?
No-one.
It's that computer of yours.
You spend hours upstairs in your room.
You're talking to someone.
Why don't you leave me alone?
I didn't like the job.
I left.
I can get another one.
(KEYBOARD CLACKS)
(RINGING TONE)
Henry, I'll see you very soon.
Canary Wharf.
On the platform.
Remember.
Bit of a coincidence.
What?
That Mark Henson's pushed off a roof and just three weeks before, someone he knew, someone he was close to, is killed in a hit-and-run.
Get onto traffic command.
I want all the details about Mullen's death.
Witness statements, CCTV, the usual.
Right.
And in the meantime, keep your opinions to yourself.
All right, Dandy Dan?
(CHATTER)
(DRILLS WHIR, HAMMERING)

There you go.
Here's the Luton collision report you asked for.
Thanks.
(CAMERA CLICKS)
- (LIFT PINGS)
- I'm sorry.
I'm going to be late tonight.
Paperwork, yeah.
I'll be as quick as I can.
(CAMERA CLICKS)
LAURA:
I can't believe it.
Both of them...

(WORKMEN CHATTER IN POLISH)
(WORKMEN LAUGH)
Oh, sh...
Oh!
Er, Mrs Philips?
Oh, er...
I will deal with this in the morning.
I just need to have another word with Laura.
She has left.
You just missed her.
Er, where does she live?
- Well, I...
- It's really important, Mrs Philips.
Two people are dead.
Do you think she could be in danger?
I just need to speak to her.
Well, she has a flat in south London.
Here.
This her mobile?
Yes.
You might be lucky, you might just catch her.
Thank you.
Yes, Mum.
I'm just at the station.
I'll call round later.
All right?
VOICEMAIL: ...currently unavailable...
Voicemail.
She gets the DLR to Canary Wharf.
It's just two minutes up the road.
PA:
Move away from the edge of Platform 2.
This train is ready to leave.
The next train will be in two minutes.
(SIGHS)
(DISTORTED SOUND)
(DISTANT SCREAMS)
(SCREAMING)
Laura?
Laura!
Laura?
Laura!
Laura?
Laura?
Laura!
Has anyone called an ambulance?
I'm Arrash Sayyad.
Stefan Kowolski.
I work for the Serious Fraud Office.
- Name?
- David Leese.
It can't have been an accident.
She was killed.
She was murdered.
You used them in some sort of medical experiment.
That's what connects them.
There are two other people in this photograph.
Find out who they are.
(GASPS)
Yes!
- Want some, buddy?
- Cheers.
This way, please.
The doctor will be with you soon to explain the procedure.
Hi, I'm Mark.
This is Laura.
Hi, I'm Bruce.
- Are you nervous?
- A little.
It's OK.
It's fine.
I studied medicine at uni.
They do these things all the time.
I asked when I got here.
This drug we're testing is actually made by a UK company.
I wouldn't be surprised if British doctors were overseeing things.
How do?
Am I the last one in?
- Looks like it.
- I couldn't find the place.
- You haven't done this before?
- You've got to be kidding!
I wouldn't be here if I hadn't spent all my cash.
I'm skint.
We get dinner, breakfast and £600.
That's my ticket home.
- Where's home?
- Leeds.
Can't you tell?
Huh!
I'm still not sure.
Most of us won't even get the real stuff, whatever it is.
They just give you an injection and then you lie down for a few hours.
- How do you know?
- I've done it loads of times.
Don't tell them, though.
- What if it's dangerous?
- It's not dangerous.
They wouldn't be allowed to do it if it was.
- You'll be fine.
I'm Henry.
Some of you may feel a little drowsy.
That's nothing to worry about.
If you drift off to sleep, that's fine.
- Wake me up when it's all over, will you?
- When do we get out of here?
- Lunchtime tomorrow morning.
- Is lunch included?
If you want anything, you can just ring the bell.
Any other questions?
Yeah.
When do we get paid?
- 'How long have you been travelling?
- 'Two weeks.'
Enter!
So, are we all set?
- Yes, Dr Leese.
- Excellent.
Then carry on.
Did you see that?
- What?
- One of them just left.
Come on, we must find him before Dr Leese gets back.
Doctor!
- Have you seen one of the patients from Green Fern?
No, sir.
I was just about to go home.
OK.
Please, no!
I don't want to drown no more
I'm sick of the same old people
The kind that'll sell your soul
Trade it for a shining stone
Ain't nothing in this life for free
Running from the greatest evil
It finally dawned on me
A man's got to fight temptation
Keep the wolves from the door
I hear them scratching like I don't know better
Won't you keep the wolves from the door?
It won't be long before I cave in and open up the door.
Ah!
Horrible weather!
I know, I've been standing in it for the last half-hour.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Here you are.
What's this?
- It's an After Eight.
I was just having dinner.
- Very nice.
- What we got, then?
Suicide, by the look of it.
15 floors.
- Name?
- Flaxton Court.
No, the body, not the building.
Oh, er...
Mark Henson.
I got his wallet.
Also, an electronic door pass from a secondary school.
Must have been a teacher.
Could've been a cook.
Mustn't jump to conclusions.
What, like he did?
Yeah, well, er... check this place out and then send uniform round to next of kin.
Heywood.
- Er... excuse me, sir.
- Who are you and what do you want?
- Er...
Sayyad, sir.
- Is that a greeting, or is that your name?
- PC Sayyad.
- PC Sayyad.
That's right.
- Are you the first attending officer?
- Er... no, sir.
- So, why are you talking to me, then?
- I don't think he jumped, sir.
Oh, you've got some other theory about how he ended up splattered across the pavement, have you
He was pushed.
No!
Please!
What makes you think that?
I was second on the scene and I took his pulse.
- Had one, did he?
No, sir.
He was dead by the time I got here.
But there was something on his skin.
Some sort of adhesive.
What are you talking about?
I mean, it was like there had been adhesive tape around his wrists.
Like he was tied up?
So, where is this tape?
- Well, I don't know, I...
- So, you examined the body, you found traces of something on the wrists, so, why have you left him there?
!
Why haven't the hands been bagged?
!
Well, I...
- Call to Forensics, all right?
!
Do it now!
- What was that all about?
- Some bloody amateur.
- I need you to bag the hands.
- We'll bag them straightaway.
- Adhesive tape?
- Could've been anything.
Let's check the roof.
You all right, Derek?
You'd think they'd have a lift that worked.
You didn't come up here, then.
I did come here, I didn't see anything.
Maybe you didn't look.
Someone comes to his flat, ties up his hands, takes him up top.
Why, Guv?
What's the point?
He's nobody.
Well, someone thought he was worth killing.
That PC you were talking to, what was he called?
Light 'em up
We running London town
We'll raise the underground
We'll hit the ground
We're gonna burn the place down
Turn it up loud
You ain't messing with a rascal...
Read the sign, innit?
Look.
What?
Look, you can't leave the bike here, man.
You're late.
And the Leech wants to see you.
- When?
- Half an hour ago.
Enter!
You were wanting to see me, Mr Leese.
Yes.
Come in, Stefan.
Close the door.
Stefan Kowolski... is that right?
- Yes.
You haven't been here long.
Two weeks.
You're temporary.
From the agency?
Yes.
Agency sent me here.
How long have you been in this country?
I, erm, came here two year ago.
- From Poland.
- Yes, sir.
And you're interested in a career in the NHS?
In, erm, clinical pharmacy.
Well, there's always openings for bright, young people and you're doing very well.
You might want to take a look at your English, though.
- Sir?
You typed up this report to the North London Cancer Network Board?
- Yes.
- There were quite a few errors.
I, erm...
I don't see.
Third line.
Cytotoxins.
That's "cyto" with a C, not an S.
Ah, yes.
There's a couple more.
Top of that paragraph.
There's only one S in "aseptic".
And there should be two T's in Dr Bennett.
I'm, erm, sorry.
If you want a full-time job, you'll have to try a little harder.
If you're prescribing drugs, the smallest mistake can have serious consequences.
Yes, sir.
Of course, there's not many permanent contracts around at the moment.
It won't be easy, but I might be able to help you, as a friend.
Mr Leese...
I'd like to get to know you a bit better, Stefan.
I think we can help each other...
- No!
Is not right.
- I'm sorry?
- I'm sorry, Mr Leese.
I'm not like that.
- I don't know what you mean.
- What you do with your hand.
I don't know what you're talking about.
This isn't good enough.
Do it again.
Now get out.
'I'm not going back.'
I didn't join the Serious Fraud Office to be a typist, Marcus.
- You ARE going back.
- Why?
Because we've actually got someone inside.
That's you.
Leese has accepted you.
And you're close to him.
Too bloody close!
Marcus, I've got that intel you wanted.
Capitax Enterprises.
Thank you, Alison.
You want to get Leese?
You want to bring him down?
Yeah.
Then don't say a word to Eleanor about what happened.
OK?
And thanks, Stefan.
We owe you one.
'Tell me something, Arrash.
Why did you want to be a policeman?
'
I don't want to be a policeman.
I want to be a detective.
OK.
Why do you want to be a detective?
It's what I've always wanted.
You did the detective course at Hendon.
Top of the class.
Commendations all round.
From there, you went straight to Bromley for three months.
That didn't work out too well.
- Ah, it was all right.
- They didn't want you.
They sent you back here.
Yeah, but it was a three-month fill in, maternity leave.
- That's right.
She went off and had a little baby detective.
But then she didn't go back to work.
They got someone else in.
I, erm... didn't know that.
I'm telling you now.
Thank you.
I'm trying to help you, Arrash, although you probably don't see it that way.
There's a difference between smart and smartarse.
From what I hear from Bromley, they couldn't wait to see the back of you.
If you're a TDC, you cannot step on people's toes.
How many interviews have you had?
Four.
That should tell you something.
Listen... .. you're clever.
You're good at the job.
We both know that.
So, what are you doing wrong?
Well, it seems that you conducted yourself pretty well last night.
The murder at Flaxton Court.
They're saying it's a murder now.
I've had a request in from a DI Heywood... offer of six months probationary.
Starting when?
- They want to see you first thing Monday morning.
That soon enough for you?
Thank you, Sergeant.
Arrash, don't screw it up.
OK.
This is going very well, isn't it?
The Serious Fraud Office supplying the NHS with free secretarial assistance.
But to be honest with you, I've yet to be convinced that this man,
David Leese, is our best way into UK Remicon.
And let's not forget they're the ones we're after.
David Leese is a chief pharmacist for six London hospitals with a combined budget of almost 150 million a year, and yet he's managing to spend almost a third of it with the same company.
All with UK Remicon, at prices way above the generic brands.
He's taking backhanders.
Well, he must be.
Isn't it obvious?
UK Remicon are bribing him to choose their products for the NHS.
They're making millions.
Shame we haven't got a shred of evidence.
You've issued a Section 2 on his accounts?
- He has three bank accounts.
- Uh-huh.
- Nothing.
- And his lifestyle?
He drives a Porsche.
He eats in the best restaurants.
- He has a second home in the country.
- He can afford to.
He's earning 95,000 a year.
And he has a wife who also earns.
He's married?
- You sound surprised... why?
- Cos...
What?
Because he's a bastard.
Eleanor, um...
Can we have a word alone?
..
Do you mind?
Has something happened that I should know about?
- No.
Meaning it hasn't happened or I shouldn't know about it?
OK.
Let's talk about UK Remicon.
A British company with a market capitalisation of 50 billion.
They employ 37,000 people in England, Ireland and Scotland.
- They're criminals.
- They're protected.
As you'd expect, they have some very powerful friends, in business and in government.
Right now, I have three teams, 30 people, working on this.
We've scanned over 10,000 documents, spent God knows how many man-hours, and you think I'm going to risk it all for your Batman and Robin antics?
My Batman and Robin antics are why you employed me.
You go after UK Remicon down the usual channels, you're going to get nowhere.
Even if you get them to court,
UK Remicon is too big, too smart.
But Dr David Leese isn't.
He's our way in.
Two more weeks.
Right.
You need to take a look at his private correspondence.
Contacts.
Find something, anything, that links Dr Leese to UK Remicon.
But how would I do that?
How do I get back into his office?
You'll find a way.
Oh, and, Stefan, be careful.
So tell me, Henry, how was your day?
Boring.
- At the car wash?
- Yeah.
What's it called again?
Squeegees.
That is a stupid name for a car wash.
I want to see you.
I know.
I drove all that way and you weren't even there.
If you start that again, I'm going to sign off.
- Don't!
Don't...
We'll be together soon.
I wish I was with you now.
And what would you do?
If you were here, right now?
I don't know.
I bet I can guess.
Anyway, I might be coming to London.
When?
Quite soon.
Will I see you?
It depends.
Are you still on that stuff?
What?
- The medicine.
Are you still taking it?
No.
You shouldn't, Henry.
It does things to you.
You shouldn't trust it.
Henry?
Henry, are you still there?
Henry?
Are you there?
I have to go.
I heard.
I'll call you later.
I know you will.
I love you, Henry.
I really do.
Hello, love.
You have a good day?
Yeah.
It was all right.
- Who was that you were talking to just now?
- There was no-one.
Right.
I'll make supper.
By the way, I've just noticed the car.
What about it?
- It's got a big dent in it.
- What?
On the front bonnet.
- Are you saying I did it?
- I just wondered...
You think I'd have bashed the car and I wouldn't have told you?
- No.
I only just noticed it myself and I was wondering how it happened.
That's all.
- I'd have noticed if I'd hit something.
- It's just that...
Why do you have to make such a big deal out of it?
You're right.
I'll make supper.
'Alison...?
'
Can you get this for me?
I need a Section 2.
Who's Elizabeth Leese?
Erm, David Leese works for the City of London Health Trust.
- She's his wife.
- And you think he might be running something through her accounts?
I'm looking for any connection to UK Remicon.
- I'll get on to them.
- Great.
- Stefan...
- What?
I haven't seen you around much the last two weeks.
What have you been doing?
Working for Marcus.
Why do you want to know?
I just wondered.
Do you fancy dinner next week?
Tuesday.
My brother and his girlfriend are coming round.
- Tuesday?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
All right.
- Great.
Oh...
What are you doing?
Kamil, shut the door!
English, Jan. Remember?
We speak in English.
The landlord call.
He want to, erm, put up rent.
What did you tell him?
I tell him, erm, call back, speak to you.
Toilet broken.
This place stinks!
Who's here?
- Aunt Darya, Aunt Minoo and two people from Mum's work.
- Why?
- It's her birthday.
- Whose?
I don't know.
One of them.
Arrash!
There you are!
Come in.
Your aunts are here.
Aunt Darya.
Aunt Minoo.
And this is Mrs Clayton who works in my office.
Your mother's told me so much about you, Arrash.
- Dinner's nearly ready.
Are you going to get changed?
- Oh, Mum, I've got to do my bike.
- Now?
- I've got the race tomorrow.
Gerald used to like bicycling, didn't you, Gerald.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah...
All right.
Ten minutes.
I'll get you a beer.
'Mr Menakis,' you can't do this!
We have a fixed-term agreement which runs for another three months!
'I told you the rent would rise.'
No.
No.
You never said that.
Anyway, you have to give us notice.
That's the law!
'Don't tell me about the law.
I know the law.'
We're already paying you enough.
We can't afford any more.
Here.
Thanks.
I got some news today.
Oh, yeah, what's that?
I'm moving to CID.
What?
You've got another placement?
Six months as a TDC.
That's brilliant, Rash.
That's really great.
I can't believe you're sitting out here by yourself.
This time... .. I just want to get it right.
Come on, dinner will be ready.
'All competitors, all competitors, 'the 25 to 35 year category race will begin in five minutes.
'This is your five-minute warning.'
- Hey, Rash.
- Hey.
Just one moment.
Hi.
Hi.
- I haven't seen you at one of these before.
- I haven't been to one before.
- So, are you just supporting someone?
- Or are you here to have fun?
- She's with me.
Just here for fun, then.
Who are you?
I'm her brother.
Brother and sister?
That's nice.
I'll, er, see you later.
Yeah, if you can keep up.
I was talking to her.
Just chatting up the opposition?
I wasn't chatting him up.
He was chatting me up.
Good luck.
Come on, boys!
'On your marks!
'Get set!
'
Come on, Rash!
Come on, Rash!
See ya!
Come on, Rash!
Come on!
Come on, Rash!
- You were brilliant, Rash!
- Thanks.
Hold this.
Congratulations.
- What do you mean?
- You came third.
- I came second.
YOU came third.
- We'll see.
And I'd have come first if you hadn't got in my way.
- I didn't get in your way.
- You swerved in front of me!
Well, if I was in front of you, I must have come second.
You know what?
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't make a difference.
Are you going to be at East London?
- The triathlon?
- Yeah.
I'll see you there.
Yeah, you'll see my back!
Arrash Sayyad.
Where does that name come from?
Ah, I was born here.
Um, my parents came from Tehran.
Your dad a policeman?
Um, he was.
Bromley didn't like you very much, did they?
I didn't like them very much either.
What, you think you can pick and choose?
- I didn't ask to leave.
- No.
No, I can see that.
You'll be working with DS Sands, standing in for DC Westfield.
- He's on sick leave.
- Ah, thank you, Guv.
I'm grateful.
Yeah, well, don't be.
Some little bastard stuck a knife in him, and if you want the truth,
I'd rather Jack was standing here than you.
That was good work the other night.
The sticky tape.
I'm not saying we wouldn't have got there in the end, but you were quick off the mark.
I like that.
So, I want you to work on the Henson investigation.
You got a problem with that, Derek?
No, Guv.
Not at all.
That's going to be your spot there.
- Right.
Witness statements.
House-to-house.
CCTV.
Pathology report.
Henson's medical records.
Go through them all.
I'm sorry about DC Westfield.
What do you know?
'I've got good news.'
- What's that?
- 'I'm coming to London.'
When?
'This evening.'
Can I see you?
'Of course you can.
Why do you think I'm telling you?
'
Where will you be?
'Can you meet me off the train?
'
When?
'6.30.'
I can't.
I'm working.
'It's a car wash, Henry.
They won't miss you.
'They don't even know you're there.'
Of course you can.
- 'Which station?
'
- Canary Wharf.
Come down to the platform.
East-bound.
Remember. 6.30.
'Why?
'
Because it's romantic, Henry.
You can get a bus to the station, come down the escalator and meet me on the platform.
- 'All right.'
- And don't tell anyone!
It's just you and me.
Hm?
I've got to go.
Bye.
Sweet little Henry.
He'll be there.
The Serious Fraud Office is bad for business and that's bad for government.
Which is why I'm here.
Have you got any news for me?
Have you heard from them yet?
The SFO?
Nothing.
I assume they're trawling through our banking records.
Hmm, company AND individual.
How are things at UK Remicon, William?
I want them off our back.
The trouble with The Serious Fraud Office is that once they get started, they don't stop.
Gemma, I'm off to Southwark, I probably won't be back today.
- So, can you leave that stuff on my desk?
- Yes, Mr Leese.
'I have a source within the SFO 'and I hear they've moved into a new phase.
'They may have gone undercover.
'It's going to make it harder to protect you.'
You're in government.
Can't you stop them?
They're a completely independent organisation, William.
They report to the Attorney General.
They do not work for him.
- You know that.
- Even so...
Well, if they do something stupid.
'If they step out of line, we may be able to step in.
'What exactly are they looking for?
'Financial fraud, business malpractice, 'bribing or coercing of doctors or NHS officials.'
Nothing, I'm sure, that would concern anyone at UK Remicon.
- Of course not.
- Unless, of course, there was something you weren't telling me.
Stefan?
What do you want?
I, um...
I leave this for Mr Leese.
He's gone for the day.
I'll take it.
Oh.
Thank you...
Gemma.
Where are we going?
Flaxton Court?
That's right.
I... just wondered.
Do you mind if we keep the chit-chat down to a minimum?
I'll be honest with you.
The last thing I need right now is a Trainee Detective Constable, especially one who thinks he knows everything.
- Nothing personal.
- It sounds pretty personal to me...
You might be right.
I spoke to Bromley.
I know all about you.
And if I want conversation, I've got the radio.
Er, have forensics been in?
No, they haven't.
I mean, why would they need fingerprints or luminol or a complete bleeding crime report?
Of course they've been in
(Pillock.)
Er, what are we looking for?
We're looking for the reason he was killed.
Mark Henson.
Teaches French and German at a local secondary.
No girlfriend.
No boyfriend.
Nice little flat.
Big mortgage, though.
Must be getting some help from Mum and Dad.
What are you doing?
Er, just taking a photo.
What, as a souvenir?
Just leave it!
Maybe we should talk to someone at his school.
Do you think so?
Really
Ah, why didn't I think of that?
Come on!
Mark had been here for two years.
We were completely shocked.
- This is his classroom?
- Yes.
I'm going to need to see his locker.
The quiet room.
Any personal possessions.
- Of course.
Had he...?
Had he been behaving strangely in any way or, um...
- .. had anything upset him?
- I wasn't aware of anything untoward.
He'd just agreed to direct Bugsy Malone.
- I did Bugsy!
- Oh, what part were you?
- Dandy Dan.
Excuse me?
I don't think he was killed because of a school play.
Laura!
Come in.
This is Laura Jones, she works in our maths department.
She knew Mark best.
This is Detective Sergeant Sands and...
How did you know Mark Henson?
Er, we did teacher training together.
After that, we spent the summer travelling.
- Where were you?
- What?
- When you went travelling?
We were in India.
- When was this?
- Six years ago.
But we kept in touch.
We stayed friends.
- So, what can you tell us about him?
- Was he worried about anything?
Or did he have anything on his mind?
Three weeks ago, he got quite upset.
We both were.
Why?
Someone we knew got killed in an accident.
He was a friend.
- Who was he?
- His name was Steve Mullen.
I can't believe it, both of them...
You don't have to say any more if you prefer not to.
Yes.
She does, actually.
What happened to Steve Mullen?
A car accident.
A hit-and-run.
Henry, I want to talk to you.
Mr Robinson called me from the car wash.
What happened?
I didn't like working there.
You could have talked to me!
You don't listen.
That's not true!
I got you that job.
I know it's not much, washing cars, but if you don't work, you're not going to have control over your life.
It's not just about the money!
It's important!
Why haven't you been taking your medication?
You've been in my room?
!
I'm trying to look after you.
It's all I ever do!
Why have you stopped?
It doesn't help me.
All these big pharma companies, they want to control me.
They just make things worse.
Who said that?
That's not you talking.
- Who's been telling you that?
- No-one.
It's that computer of yours.
You spend hours upstairs in your room.
You're talking to someone.
Why don't you leave me alone?
I didn't like the job.
I left.
I can get another one.
'Henry, I'll see you very soon.
'Canary Wharf.
On the platform.
Remember.'
A bit of a coincidence.
What?
That Mark Henson's pushed off a roof and just three weeks before, someone he knew, someone he was close to, is killed in a hit-and-run.
Get onto traffic command.
I want all the details about Mullen's death.
- Witness statements, CCTV, the usual.
- All right.
And in the meantime, keep your opinions to yourself.
All right, Dandy Dan?
There you go.
Here's the Luton collision report you asked for.
- Thanks.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to be late tonight...
Paperwork, yeah.
I'll be as quick as I can.
'I can't believe it,' both of them...
Oh, sh...
Oh!
Er, Mrs Philips?
I will deal with this in the morning.
I just need to have another word with Laura.
- She has left.
You just missed her.
- Where does she live?
- Well, I...
- It's really important, Mrs Philips.
Two people are dead.
Do you think she could be in danger?
I just need to speak to her.
Well, she has a flat in South London.
Here.
- Is this her mobile?
- Yes.
You might be lucky, you might just catch her.
Thank you.
Yes, Mum.
I'm just at the station.
I'll call round later.
All right?
- '.. currently unavailable...'
- Voicemail.
She gets the DLR to Canary Wharf.
It's just two minutes up the road.
'Move away from the edge of Platform 2.
'This train is ready to leave.
'The next train will leave in two minutes.'
Laura?
Laura!
Laura?
Laura!
Laura!
Laura?
Laura?
Laura!
Has anyone called an ambulance?
I'm Arrash Sayyad.
Stefan Kowolski.
I work for the Serious Fraud Office.
- Name?
- David Leese.
It can't have been an accident.
She was killed.
She was murdered.
You used them in some sort of medical experiment.
That's what connects them.
There are two other people in this photograph.
Find out who they are.
(MAN SHOUTING IN DISTANCE)

- Earn some money?
- Oh, cheers.
(CAR HORN BLARES)
Take one?
For you.
(DOOR WHIRS OPEN)
This way, please.
The doctor will be with you soon to explain the procedure.
Hi.
I'm Mark.
This is Laura.
Hi, I'm Bruce.
Are you nervous?
A little.
It's OK.
It's fine, I studied medicine at uni, they do these things all the time.
I asked when I got here.
This drug we're testing is actually made by a UK company.
I...
I wouldn't be surprised if there were British doctors overseeing things.
(DOOR WHIRS OPEN)
MAN:
How do?
Am I the last one in?
- Looks like it.
- I couldn't find the place!
And you haven't done this before?
You've got to be kidding!
I wouldn't be here if I hadn't spent all me cash.
I'm skint.
We get dinner, breakfast and 600 quid.
That's my ticket home.
Where's home?
Leeds.
Can't you tell?
(CHUCKLES)
LAURA:
I'm still not sure.
Most of us won't even get the real stuff, whatever it is.
They just give you an injection and then you lie down for a few hours.
- How do you know?
- I've done it loads of times.
Don't...tell them that.
LAURA:
What if it's dangerous?
It's not dangerous.
They wouldn't be allowed to do it if it was.
You'lI be fine.
I'm Henry.
Some of you may feel a little drowsy.
That's nothing to worry about.
If you drift off to sleep, that's fine.
Wake me up when it's all over, will ya?
- When do we get out of here?
- Lunchtime tomorrow morning.
MAN FROM LEEDS:
Is lunch included?
If you want anything, you can just ring the bell.
Any other questions?
Yeah.
When do we get paid?
- (TAPPING ON KEYBOARD)

So, are we all set?
Yes, Dr Leese.
Excellent.

Ah!
It's horrible weather!
I know, I've been standing in it for the last half-hour.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Here you are.
What's this?
It's an After Eight.
I was just having dinner.
- Very nice.
- What we got, then?
Suicide, by the look of it.
15 floors.
- Name?
- Flaxton Court.
No, the body, not the building.
Oh, er...
Mark Henson.
I've got his wallet.
Also, an electronic door pass from a secondary school.
Must have been a teacher.
Could've been a cook.
Mustn't jump to conclusions.
SANDS:
What, like he did?
- (PHONE RINGS)
- HEYWOOD:
Yeah, well, er... check his place out and then send uniform round to next of kin.
Heywood.
- Er...excuse me, sir.
- Who are you and what do you want?
- Er...
Sayyad, sir.
- Is that a greeting or is that your name?
- PC Sayyad.
- PC Sayyad.
That's right.
- Are you the first attending officer?
- Er...no, sir.
- So, why are you talking to me, then?
- I don't think he jumped, sir.
Oh, you've got some other theory about how he ended up splattered across the pavement, have you?
He was pushed.
No!
Please!
(SCREAMS)
What makes you think that?
Well, I was second on the scene and I took his pulse.
Had one, did he?
No, sir.
He was dead by the time I got here.
But there was something on his skin - some sort of adhesive.
What are you talking about?
I mean, it was like there had been adhesive tape around his wrists.
Like he was tied up?
So, where is this tape?
- Well, I don't know, I...
- So, you examined the body, you found traces of something on the wrists, so why have you left him there?
!
Why haven't the hands been bagged?
!
Well, I...
call to Forensics, all right?
!
Do it now!
- What was that all about?
- Some bloody amateur.
- I need you to bag the hands.
- We'lI bag them straightaway.
- Adhesive tape?
- Could've been anything.
Let's check the roof.

Someone comes to his flat, ties up his hands, takes him up top.

Come in, Stefan.
Close the door.
- Stefan KowolskI - is that right?
- Yes, sir.
You haven't been here long.
- Er, two weeks.
- You're temporary.
From the agency?
Yes.
Agency sent me here.
How long have you been in this country?
I, er, came here two year ago.
- From Poland.
- Yes, sir.
And you're interested in a career in the NHS?
In, er, clinical pharmacy.
Well, there's always openings for bright, young people and you're doing very well.
You might want to take a look at your English, though.
Sir?
You typed up this report to the North London Cancer Network Board?
- Yes.
- There were quite a few errors.
I, erm...
I don't see.

That's "cyto" with a C, not an S.
Ah, yes.
There's a couple more.

If you want a full-time job, you'lI have to try a little harder.
If you're prescribing drugs, the smallest mistake can have serious consequences.
Yes, sir.
Of course, there's not many permanent contracts around at the moment.
It won't be easy, but I might be able to help you, as a friend.
Mr Leese...
I'd like to get to know you a bit better, Stefan.
- I think we can help each other...
- No!
Is not right.
- I'm sorry?
- I'm sorry, Mr Leese.
I'm not like that.
- I don't know what you mean.
- What you do with your hand.
I don't know what you're talking about.
This isn't good enough.
Do it again.
Now get out.
STEFAN:
(ENGLISH ACCENT) I'm not going back.
I didn't join the Serious Fraud Office to be a typist, Marcus.
MARCUS:
You are going back.
Why?
Because we've actually got someone inside.
That's you.
Leese has accepted you.
And you're close to him.
- Too bloody close!
- Listen to me...
Marcus, I've got that intel you wanted.
Capitax Enterprises?
Thank you, Alison.
You want to get Leese?
You want to bring him down?
Yeah.
Then don't say a word to Eleanor about what happened.
OK?
And thanks, Stefan.
We owe you one.
MAN:
tell me something, Arrash.
Why did you want to be a policeman?
I don't want to be a policeman.
I want to be a detective.
OK.
Why do you want to be a detective?
It's what I've always wanted.
Did the detective course at Hendon.
Top of the class.
Commendations all round.
From there, you went straight to Bromley for three months.
That didn't work out too well.
- Ah, it was all right.
- They didn't want you.
They sent you back here.
Yeah, but it was a three-month fill-in, maternity leave.
That's right.
She went off and had a little baby detective.
But then she didn't go back to work.
They got someone else in.
I, um... didn't know that.
I'm telling you now.
Thank you.
I'm trying to help you, Arrash, although you probably don't see it that way.
There's a difference between smart... and smartarse.
From what I hear from Bromley, they couldn't wait to see the back of you.
If you're a TDC, you cannot step on people's toes.
How many interviews have you had?
Four.
That should tell you something.
Listen you're clever.
You're good at the job.
We both know that.
So what are you doing wrong?
Well seems that you conducted yourself pretty well last night.
The murder at Flaxton Court.
They're saying it's a murder now.
I've had a request in from a DI Heywood - offer of six months probationary.
Starting when?
They want to see you first thing Monday morning.
That soon enough for you?
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)
Thank you, Sergeant.
Arrash, don't screw it up.
OK.
This is going very well, isn't it?
The Serious Fraud Office supplying the NHS with free secretarial assistance.
But, to be honest with you, I've yet to be convinced that this man,
David Leese, is our best way into UK Remicon.
And let's not forget they're the ones we're after.
David Leese is a chief pharmacist for six London hospitals with a combined budget of almost 150 million a year, and yet he's managing to spend almost a third of it with the same company.
all with UK Remicon.
At prices way above the generic brands.
He's taking backhanders.
Well, he must be.
Isn't it obvious?
UK Remicon are bribing him to choose their products for the NHS.
They're making millions.
Shame we haven't got a shred of evidence.
You've, um... you've issued a Section 2 on his accounts?
- He has three bank accounts.
- Uh-huh?
Nothing.
And his lifestyle?
He drives a Porsche.
He eats in the best restaurants.
He has a second home in the country.
He can afford to.
He's earning £95,000 a year.
And has a wife who also earns.
He's married?
You sound surprised - why?
Cos...
What?
Because he's a bastard.
Eleanor, um...
Can we have a word alone?
Do you mind?
ELEANOR:
Has something happened that I should know about?
No.
Meaning it hasn't happened or I shouldn't know about it?
OK.
Let's talk about UK Remicon.
A British company with a market capitalisation of 50 billion.
They employ 37,000 people in England, Ireland and Scotland.
They're criminals.
They're protected.
As you'd expect, they have some very powerful friends, in business and in government.
Right now, I have three teams, 30 people, working on this.
We've scanned over 10,000 documents, spent God knows how many man-hours, and you think I'm going to risk it all for your Batman and Robin antics?
My Batman and Robin antics are why you employed me.
You go after UK Remicon down the usual channels, you're going to get nowhere.
Even if you get them to court,
UK Remicon is too big, too smart.
But Dr David Leese isn't.
He's our way in.
Two more weeks.
Right.
You need to take a look at his private correspondence.
Contacts.
Find something, anything, that links Dr Leese to UK Remicon.
And how would I do that?
How do I get back into his office?
You'lI find a way.
Oh, and, Stefan, be careful.
WOMAN, ON LAPTOP:
So tell me, Henry, how was your clay?
Boring.
At the car wash?
Yeah.
What's it called again?
Squeegees.
That is a stupid name for a car wash.
I want to see you.
I know.
I drove all that way and you weren't even there.
If you start that again, I'm going to sign off.
Don't!
Don't...
We'lI be together soon.
I wish I was with you now.
And what would you do?
If you were here, right now?
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
I don't know.
I bet I can guess.
Anyway, I might be coming to London.
When?
Quite soon.
will I see you?
It depends.
Are you still on that stuff?
- Er, what?
- The medicine.
Are you still taking it?
No.
You shouldn't, Henry.
It does things to you.
You shouldn't trust it.
Henry?
Henry, are you still there?
Henry?
Are you there?
I have to go.
I heard.
HENRY:
I'lI call you later.

I know you will.
I love you, Henry.
I really do.

Hello, love.
You have a good day?
Yeah.
It was all right.
Who was that

- It was no-one.
Right.
I'lI make supper.
By the way, I've just noticed the car.
What about it?
It-It's got a...big dent in it.
What?
On the front bonnet.
Are you saying I did it?
I just wondered...
You think I'd have bashed the car and I wouldn't have told you?
No.
No...
I only just noticed it myself and I was wondering how it happened.
That's all.
- I'd have noticed if I'd hit something.
- It's just that...
Why do you have to make such a big deal out of it?
(SIGHS)
You're right.
I'lI make supper.
STEFAN:
Alison...?
Can you get this for me?
I need a Section 2.
Who's Elizabeth Leese?
Er, David Leese works for the City of London Health Trust.
She's his wife.
And you think he might be running something through her accounts?
I'm looking for any connection to UK Remicon.
I'lI get on to them.
Great.
Stefan...
What?
I haven't seen you around much the last two weeks.
What have you been doing?
Working for Marcus.
Why do you want to know?
I just wondered.
Do you fancy dinner next week?

My brother and his girlfriend are coming round.

Yeah.

The Serious Fraud Office is bad for business, and that's bad for government.
Which is why I'm here.
Have you got any news for me?
Have you heard from them yet?
The SFO?
Nothing.
I assume they're trawling through our banking records.
Mm, company and individual.
How are things at UK Remicon, William?
I want them off our back.
The trouble with the Serious Fraud Office is that once they get started, they don't stop.
Gemma, I'm off to Southwark, I probably won't be back today.
So can you leave that stuff on my desk?
Yes, Mr Leese.
I have a source within the SFO, and I hear they've moved into a new phase.
They may have gone undercover.
It's going to make it harder to protect you.
You're in government.
Can't you stop them?
They're a completely independent organisation, William.
They report to the Attorney General.
They do not work for him.
You know that.
Even so...
Well, if they do something stupid if they step out of line, we may be able to step in.
WILLIAM:
What exactly are they looking for?
OTHER MAN:
financial fraud, business malpractice, bribing or coercing of doctors or NHS officials.
Nothing, I'm sure, that would concern anyone at UK Remicon.
Of course not.
Unless, of course, there was something you weren't telling me.

What do you want?
(POLISH ACCENT) I, um...
I leave this for Mr Leese.

Thank you...
Gemma.
Where are we going?
Flaxton Court?
That's right.
I...just wondered.
Do you mind if we keep the chit-chat down to a minimum?
I'lI be honest with you, the last thing I need right now is a Trainee Detective Constable, especially one who thinks he knows everything.
Nothing personal.
Sounds pretty personal to me...
You might be right.
I spoke to Bromley.
I know all about you.
And if I want conversation, I've got the radio.
Er, have Forensics been here?
(SARCASTICALLY) No, they haven't.
I mean, why would they need fingerprints or luminol or a complete bleeding crime report?
Of course they've been in!
(QUIETLY) Pillock.
Er, what are we looking for?
We're looking for the reason he was killed.
Mark Henson.
Teaches French and German at a local secondary.
No girlfriend.
No boyfriend.
Nice little flat.
Big mortgage, though.
Must be getting some help from Mum and Dad.
What are you doing?
Er, just taking a photo.
What, as a souvenir?
just leave it!
Maybe we should talk to someone at his school.
(SARCASTICALLY) Do you think so?
Really?
Ah, why didn't I think of that?
Come on.
(SCHOOI BELI RINGS)
Mark had been here for two years.
We were completely shocked.
This is his classroom?
Yes.
I'm going to need to see his locker, the quiet room, any personal possessions...
Of course.
And then, um...had he been behaving strangely in any way or, er, had anything upset him?
I wasn't aware of anything untoward.
He'd just agreed to direct Bugsy Malone.
I did Bugsy!
Oh, what part were you?
Dandy Dan.
Excuse me?
I don't think he was killed because of a school play.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Ah.
Laura.
Come in.
This is Laura Jones, she works in our maths department.
She knew Mark best.
This is Detective Sergeant Sands and...
How did you know Mark Henson?
Er, we did teacher training together.
After that, we spent the summer travelling.
Where were you?
What?
When you went travelling?
We were in India.
When was this?
Six years ago.
But we kept in touch.
We stayed friends.
So what can you tell us about him?
RASH:
Was he worried about anything?
Or did he have anything on his mind?
Three weeks ago, he got quite upset.
We both were.
Why?
Someone we knew got killed in an accident.
He was a friend.
Who was he?
His name was Steve Mullen.
(VOICE BREAKING) I can't believe it, both of them...
You don't have to say any more if you prefer not to.

What happened to Steve Mullen?
A car accident.

Why have you stopped?
It doesn't help me.

They just make things worse.
Who said that?
That's not you talking.
Who's been telling you that?
No-one.
It's that computer of yours.

They won't be able to kill me because of my father.
They are after you, Your Highness.
No, you can't.
Let's go together.
I will follow you soon.
I promise you.
I'm trusting you.
Listen to your wife and run, Your Highness.
I can't do it.
I can't hide behind my wife in shame like this.
Your Highness!
What can I do?
I am her awesome person now.
I am all she has.
[EPISODE 16]
I heard you know where Eun is.
Where is he?
Court Lady Hae of the Damiwon has been hiding Eun and his wife.
How do you know that?
Did you see him yourself?
Eun used to make many things with towels when he was young.
Things such as dogs and birds.
He would make paper boats, as well.
Damiwon was full of these novelty items Eun likes to make.
I am sure of it.
What is going on here?
What is it?
Grand General.
Grand General, the 10th Prince and his wife are being attacked at the Damiwon.
Soon Deok.
Soon Deok!
Soon Deok...
You should go now.
Be quiet.
I will be the one to protect you.
Yo, please let us go!
Please!
If you let us go, I will never return to Goryeo again!
Think of our past bond from growing up together.
Yo...
My wife.
Deok...
It's all right, Deok.
It's all right.
Deok, it's all right.
Let's go together, okay?
Deok?
Deok!
Deok... no.
Deok, not yet.
Soon Deok.
Soon Deok.
Move.
Must you go this far?
The roots of treason must be pulled out in order to keep the nation peaceful.
Move.
Stop!
Eun!
Do you remember back on my birthday?
You said you would give me any present I wanted.
Do you recall that?
I was told there was a gift only you could give to me.
He manipulated me.
That girl...
I cannot let her go alone.
So.
I would prefer it if you just...
It is a gift only you can give me.
No, you can't.
No!
Eun, Eun.
Eun, Eun?
Eun?
Eun... wake up, would you?
Eun, open your eyes!
Eun.
Oh dear, were you waiting for me?
In all my time as a prince, no girl has ever treated me this way.
I can't believe this happened.
What?
Your Highness, you are awesome.
There is the king, so how can I be?
Maybe I could be this.
Let go!
Let me go.
Let go.
First love, you say?
I said to her...
The 13th Prince is handsome.
The 14th Prince is talented in martial arts.
I told her to marry one of the two.
Yet, this girl insisted on marrying the 10th Prince.
She said he was her first love.
If I knew this would happen, I would have stopped her.
I suppose she would have married him even if she knew this would happen.
My Soon Deok was that kind of girl.
She is true to herself and doesn't know how to change.
Let me ask you just one thing.
My Soon Deok...
Did my Soon Deok get lots of love from the prince?
A lot.
Very much.
They loved each other.
That's good enough, then.
That's good.
That's good.
I'm sorry, Soon Deok.
Now, your father...
Now, your father can't do anything for you anymore.
Soon Deok.
I'll kill him.
Wang So...
I'll kill him.
No... you can't.
I'll kill him.
Before he ends up killing everyone, I'll kill him first!
He wanted it.
Prince Eun wanted it.
It isn't his fault.
He is having a hard time too.
Ji Mong.
It seems...
I must become a dog that kills.
A dog that bites its owner and takes over its owner's home.
I will become a rabid wolf dog.
I, Wang So, will become King of Goryeo.
Eun is dead.
He and his wife both died.
With this, Wang Gyu's Revolt is not a fabrication, but a fact.
Congratulations.
This should get all the powerful families to act in their best interests.
We should hurry and move the capital city to Seokyeong.
That will satisfy Uncle Wang Shik Ryeom.
They will not hold a funeral since he has been labeled a traitor.
We are not to wear our mourning clothes.
They cannot be buried in the royal family cemetery.
They were thrown outside the castle into the forest to become crows' food.
We took care of it secretly and buried them.
We could not get the arrows out from Eun's body.
Jung broke off the arrows.
Eun... still remembered that birthday.
Even I had completely forgotten about it.
He said it was a gift that only I could give him.
Eun would be thankful for what you did for him today.
Your Highness.
I just found the letter that Court Lady Hae left for me.
She had told me that the 10th Prince was at the Damiwon.
Synced ripped by bozxphd Subtitles by DramaLove
I hear you want to become king.
I plan on it.
That quack over there has been saying it since long ago.
He says that he sees the star of a king for you, Your Highness.
That is what your father, the late King Taejo, said too.
So, he sent you to me.
That is why he wanted me to teach you the martial arts.
It was because of that.
Star of a king?
I don't believe in those things.
Still, I have to become king.
If I have to be forced to kill because of a seat...
I will become the owner of that seat and put a stop to it.
I won't give up unless I die.
Whether you will come with me... you should decide now.
I was born your younger brother, so my life was set.
I am in.
I should take responsibility for what I claimed.
Star of a king.
Do you remember what the late king said before?
For the sake of the nation and the royal family... the king must be willing to throw everyone away.
It is seat that makes you throw everything away.
I remember.
Well, then... who will you throw away?
I want to see that first.
Then I will decide.
Now I must look like a monster in your eyes, too.
I did kill Eun.
It was a hard choice to make.
I know that.
Why did you hide the fact that he was in the Damiwon?
You didn't trust me, did you?
You didn't say anything because you worried that I might kill Eun.
Yes.
I did.
I was worried about the 10th Prince.
However, I was worried that you might have to do something terrible.
I thought things would turn out all right as long as they escaped.
I didn't realize we could end up hurting one another... until it was too late.
That is why I left that letter.
I trusted you.
I know it took me some time, but I truly trusted you.
Enough that I would trust you in any situation.
I realized how much I like you.
But... now I don't feel that way.
When I look at you...
I will only remember what happened because of the lack of trust you had in me.
Eun died because of you.
I will remember how I had to kill him.
In order to save you...
I became the king's dog and my feelings for you remained unchanged.
Now they have changed.
Let's stop now.
Lies.
You are lying.
We promised not to lie to each other.
4th Prince Wang So.
The 10th Prince, a brother you favored, committed treason.
You worked hard in executing him along with his wife, Park Soon Deok.
Therefore, you will receive farming land and land for a home near Songak.
Also, your spirit seems to be in decline so leave for the new capital, Seokyeong.
Take charge of the construction of the new castle.
I am putting my confidence in you.
I will devote myself.
And repay you for your confidence, Your Majesty.
You will be in charge of building the new castle?
You've become very rich, too.
He got all of this for catching and killing my daughter and son-in-law.
I hope you live a long, long time.
Is he even a human being?
It was his younger brother.
After spilling all that blood... are you not afraid?
It is difficult to sit on the throne without spilling the blood of a few.
You should be careful.
There is only so much I will let you get away with.
I will be traveling the borders and will not be coming to the palace.
You do that.
However, think of Mother and avoid the front lines.
Stay within the safety of your troops.
I have lived like a coward many times, so I cannot do that.
I will see just how long my lifeline really is.
I ought to pay for some of your crimes.
These are from Eun.

I will wait for you.
[JEONGJONG, THIRD YEAR OF REIGN (YEAR 948)]
Court Lady!
Court Lady!
I told you not to run.
You're an upper court lady now.
You should be dignified.
Get going now.
Someone you'll be happy to see is here!
Happy to see?
It's been two years since he's been here, so you would be happy.
She told me not to run.
Synced ripped by bozxphd Subtitles by DramaLove
It's been a long time.
It has been a long time.
Sit down.
I came two days earlier on my own so that I could drink this tea.
But then I saw Eun's cemetery.
I had to drop by.
I'm glad you did.
I showed off to my sister-in-law, too.
I did a lot more than she had ever done.
You are a grand general now.
It feels a little low of you.
I worried that you might have left the palace while I was gone.
Where would I go?
What about marriage?
You're not getting married?
A girl from a good family can leave the palace if she gets married.
Should I get married and live my life taking care of someone?
I'm going to retire when I get older and go on a vacation somewhere far away.
I will go to the deserts to ride camels and go out to oceans far away.
I've saved up all my money that I've made from working.
I have a lot.
It's been a long time.
Wow!
How long has it been?
- I heard you beat the Khitan in Hwayi.
- Well, yes.
My name is Woo Hee.
She is the highest court lady of the Gyobang.
She has been coming by for tea and refreshments for the Buddhist mass.
The highest court lady of the Gyobang?
Ah, that former gisaeng?
As always, you keep bad company.
A murderer and now a gisaeng.
Watch your mouth.
Be careful of that person.
He may stab you someday.
Also, would you please stop sending that performer to the troops to spy?
A spy who plays the flute?
What is that?
I can't deal with you.
You must have suffered a lot because you've become paranoid.
That guy... how did he know?
He sure is quick.
He may be a grand general, but there is something cute about him.
Right?
He is cute, isn't he?
You really sent someone?
I was curious to see if he was doing all right.
What about So?
Which room is he in?
The 4th Prince... is here?
I assumed that he was here.
Yo.
Your Majesty.
Jung is back.
Make your decision.
Kyung Chun Won Keun's mother is from Hubaekje.
We cannot give Goryeo to someone with Hubaekje blood.
Make Jung the Crown Prince.
You need to have someone backing you, Your Majesty.
What do you see me as, Mother?
Am I a person or a pig?
You must not see me as a son... but a boar that you sacrifice in order to get the throne.
It is not as if I am going to die soon.
Yet, you've been nagging me for years.
Jung...
Does he want the throne?
His Highness, the 4th Prince, wishes to see Your Majesty.
If you are so afraid, I will make So the Crown Prince.
Jung or So, both are your sons.
What are you saying?
We will discuss this later.
Crazy...
You are useful in many ways.
What's so important about a few dead slaves that you would stop construction again?
The land in Songak is growing weaker.
The royal family line is in danger.
The priests and shamans have all confirmed it.
We are lacking in manpower.
We do not have enough supplies so people work one day and rest the next.
If you do not have enough manpower, do not let them sleep.
If you are lacking supplies, get them by stealing if you need to.
Squeeze, and squeeze, and squeeze them out if you must!
Get it done on schedule.
Synced ripped by bozxphd Subtitles by DramaLove
I have committed a deadly sin, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, let us talk more on our own.
You're not asleep yet?
I don't think I've seen you get proper sleep since I've been in the Damiwon.
I'll sleep soon.
Why is it that you write this so often?
You're illiterate, but you noticed.
I may be illiterate, but I can still see.
It looks the same.
I like the meaning.
"I came to sit by the water."
"However, the clouds had come."
He is foolish for going all the way to the water.
I'm all right because I'm not alone.
You are here, Your Highness.
Why am I alone?
Oh my!
You said you would ask for permission.
- Can I do it?
- No, you can't.
Next time, don't ever forget.
So is right over there.
Hae Soo is with him too.
Look at them.
I told you that you cannot trust that he will live as your dog, Your Majesty.
He will be useful if I pull on his collar just right.
"Those two no longer have feelings for each other, so it won't be effective."
Do you believe that?
I did confirm that they didn't send any letters to one another.
Still, you should confirm it.
Slaves only work hard if you give them a good whipping now and then.
Stop.
It would have been better not to see you at all.
Are you all right?
I felt like my arm was getting weak, so I was testing myself.
Are you hurt?
It only grazed me.
Oh, you two are still on very good terms.
It would not look good if rumors started that you killed a court lady for fun.
Yes, that would not be good.
It was my mistake.
You should be careful.
What did I do?
You asked to see me?
You can get a message to Baek Ah, right?
Can you... tell him that I have to see the 4th Prince?
It will be dangerous.
I'm prepared for that.
The borders have quieted down, thanks to you.
I'll give you whatever you want as an award before you leave.
Whatever I want?
As long as it's not the throne, tell me what you want.
If so... there is something I have wanted for a very long time.
Hello, Your Highness.
Where is Court Lady Hae?
Court Lady Hae is very ill and cannot meet anyone.
I must see her for a moment even if she is ill.
No, you cannot.
What if you were to get ill, Your Highness?
Wouldn't it spread to the entire army of Goryeo?
It is not something you should take lightly as you do important work.
Yes, you are right.
Then, make sure to give Soo this message.
You must do it.
He was on his way to Seokyeong.
His arm got worse, so he's receiving treatment.
I have already sent everyone away, so you don't need to worry.
Why are you here?
I needed to ask you something.
I asked Baek Ah for this favor.
Ask me quickly and go back.
You still... haven't forgotten me, have you?
- What?
- You said you no longer liked me.
You were lying, weren't you?
Go back home.
This isn't the palace and the king is not watching.
I wanted to ask you this.
I risked my life and left the palace.
There wasn't a day that I wasn't waiting for two years.
I wanted to go back to that time.
I wished for it again and again.
So...
I wanted to tell you...
I trust you.
I will ask you again.
Answer me, and don't lie.
Answer me.
Do you still... feel... that you love me?
Synced ripped by bozxphd Subtitles by DramaLove
It's cute, right?
Come over here.
Come over here.
That square thing over there is called Pegasus.
Peg... what?
- Pegasus.
- Peg...
Pegasus.
The king is very ill.
The monk was going to get some sacrificial rites.
We thought we would give the king a scare so we chose a day dry lightning would hit.
We had no idea that the monk would be hit by lightning and die in front of him.
The king saw him burned alive like that.
He passed out on the spot and he is very ill.
Heart attack.
He's always been quite sensitive.
That was too severe.
He may be having a harder time with Moo and Eun's deaths than we realized.
That is true.
He started practicing Buddhism and visiting the shaman often, as well.
I think the time has come.
Do you want the throne?
I want it.
The reason you left me... was it because of the throne?
The king used you to get to me.
He will use me to continue bothering you.
What if I asked you to give it up?
I will persuade you until you say it is all right to do it.
You said you didn't need to be king as long as we were together.
You're not saying it anymore.
We agreed not to lie to each other.
I started this so that I could stop us brothers from having to kill each other.
But... when I was building the castle...
I realized that the world can change if the king changes.
I won't be controlled by anyone.
And I can get rid of all this absurdity.
Being king... is something I definitely want.

I contend that the real killer was Levi Young, the man who would have benefited professionally from my client's conviction.
And when his scheme to discredit my client was exposed,
Mr. Young took his own life last night.
Both a tragedy and an obvious sign of guilt.
I'm here to demand that the district attorney release Oscar Keaton so he can finally grieve for his wife.

I'm nine months pregnant, and the parents are MIA, and I don't know what to do.
So, to be clear, you're the surrogate mother, but you've never met the intended parents, who are the biological parents?
That's right.
This surrogacy was set up by a fertility lawyer...
Maggie Sherman.
I wanted to meet the parents, but she said that they're very serious about keeping things confidential.
As a surrogate, you would have been paid.
$50,000... divided into weekly installments, and they stopped...

Maggie said that they disappeared on her and that she was looking for them, but...

I can't imagine.
But as a surrogate, your options are limited.
You don't have the right to give the baby up for adoption.
No, but I...

Why are you protecting these people?
Look, I'm not heartless.
I got into this business to help couples start families.
But if I violate their confidentiality, then I put all my other clients at risk.
Privacy is the cornerstone of my practice.

Good evening.
Tonight, for the first time since taking office,
"LHL" welcomes Los Angeles District Attorney Max Gilford.
Mr. Gilford, earlier today, Mr. Keaton's attorney demanded his release in light of Levi Young's suicide.
What are your thoughts?
Oscar Keaton is a cold-blooded murderer whose defense is quite good at playing the media.
We will not be releasing Mr. Keaton because we have both motive and evidence.
Is it true you still haven't found the murder weapon?
Even without a weapon, it's clear what happened.
Oscar Keaton is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
Don't the recent revelations in conjunction with Mr. Young's suicide point to him as a suspect?
Not at all.
Mr. Keaton's defense has propped up various unfounded allegations in an attempt to clear their client of any wrongdoing.
That man's a natural.
Not to mention he's hot.
He's good...
I'll give him that.
He's not letting Louise bait him.
You know what, Megan?
I changed my mind.
Cue up the Levi tape.
Are you sure?
I thought you said...
I know what I said.
Play the tape.
Let's get a reaction.
Louise, change of plans...
We're gonna run the Levi video.
We'd like to play a video Levi Young made for our executive producer shortly before his suicide.
You got the story all wrong.
You think I wanted to hurt Oscar?
I just wanted to protect him.
Sarah was bad for him.
And I was the only one who could see it.
- Cut.
- Well, sounds like Levi Young was intent on getting Sarah out of Oscar Keaton's life.
Has he really been ruled out as a suspect?
I've never seen this video before.
But I certainly look forward to reviewing an unedited version.
And when you do, we hope you'll come back on the show and share your thoughts.
We'll be back after a short break.
- Man:
And we're clear.
- [Bell rings]
Incoming.
And he looks angry.
I thought you said Levi didn't kill Sarah.
He didn't.
So I debrief you after the suicide.
You don't tell me about the video, then you play it live on air.
- Why would you do that?
- It's part of the story, and I wanted your honest reaction.
You realize I could charge you with obstruction of justice for hiding that video.
That's a stretch, and we both know it.
[Chuckles] So let me get this straight.
Your show accused a man of murder, then you saw that man take his own life, and your first instinct is to make a spectacle out of his suicide.
What the hell is wrong with you?

Good evening.
In the past, we've aired heartbreaking cases of missing children.
But tonight, we bring you a different kind of story...
A case of missing parents.
Joining us tonight is Jenna Polly, a woman who agreed to help a childless couple have a baby.
Now that couple, the biological parents, have disappeared, abandoning Jenna who is nine months pregnant with their child.
Also with us is Jenna's attorney, Jake Gregorian.
Jenna, what happens if you can't find the biological parents before their baby arrives?
I don't have the legal rights to put him up for adoption.
So my only options are to raise him by myself, which I'm not in a position to do, or to put him in the foster-care system, which I don't want to do.
Load the titles.
Jenna, what can you tell us about the parents?
They couldn't conceive on their own.
So they went to Maggie Sherman, a fertility lawyer, to help them find a surrogate... me.
Miss Sherman has withheld all information about the biological parents and refuses to help Jenna.
Jenna, I understand you have a letter from the biological parents.
You'd like to read a passage.
"Our house is filled with love and laughter.
The only thing we need is a baby to make our lives complete.
We've already built a swing set in our backyard and a tree house in the front.
There are no words to describe how grateful we are to you.
Because of you, we can be parents."
And now they're gone.
God, that poor girl.
I can't imagine.
...please contact my office.
We're not looking to punish them.
We just need to transfer the parental rights so the baby can go to a good home.
Is there anything else you'd like to add, Jenna?
It's okay.
You're doing great.

You do not have to do this.
The State will take custody of the child until the biological parents can be found.
Hold on.
This couple has a contract to adopt the baby.
Unfortunately, an adoption would be void without the biological parents' consent.
When the baby's ready to leave the hospital, he'll be placed in foster care until the biological parents can be found.
What happens if they never show up?
You will have to take that up with the family court.
We already did.
I wish I could do more.
I'm just following protocol.

Jenna signed the paperwork, and the judge expedited the filing.
Baby goes home with the Gowers tonight.
Happy ending.
I remember Pops talking about you even before he brought you home.
He and Mom were so pissed that your biological father refused to sign that paperwork.
A man I didn't know kept me from having a family for eight years, and the law... was on his side.
Well, it all worked out.
[Scoffs] ‭And you're a better lawyer today for it.
Yeah.
You know...
I don't know who I'd be if you weren't my brother.

Jake, Oscar's been calling.
He says he needs you, and it's urgent.

[Lock beeps]
Hey, got your messages, Oscar.
What's going on?
How can I help you?
You were sleeping with my wife.
[Sighs]
Oscar, look...
My wife?
The woman who I love?
Oscar, I...
I made a mistake.
Okay, I should have said something...
Shut your mouth!
You're fired.
Don't do this.
Think about the optics.
- It'll only hurt your case.
- The optics?
!
Don't you worry, Jake.
I can find another hack in a suit.
Okay, someone who won't stab me in the back.
Get out of here.
Get out.
Guard!
♪ ♪
Well, I guess we got our answer.
Oscar didn't know about the affair.
Until now.
You're sure we're allowed to watch this, boss?
We can't use it in court, but it helps us inform the investigation.
Now get me everything you can on Jake Gregorian.
We start with breaking news.
Previously on "Notorious"...
I have orders to arrest your client for the murder of Sarah Keaton.
Tonight, my guest is Levi Young,
Oscar Keaton's boyhood friend and an executive at Paraspot.
You've been texting with Levi Young.
He was pretending to be SweetVicki.
Now that I'm in jail, Levi has a lot to gain.
Are you suggesting
Levi killed Sarah and framed you?
I was in love with Sarah.
And the night before she was murdered, we slept together.
I sent those photos so Oscar would know the truth.
You have feelings for him.
You're in love with him.
Please put down the gun.
Tell Oscar I'm sorry.
An ambulance is on its way, ma'am.
Ma'am?
Are you okay?
Two weeks ago, my client, Oscar Keaton, was arrested for his wife's murder at her funeral without a shred of evidence.
I contend that the real killer was Levi Young, the man who would have benefited professionally from my client's conviction.
And when his scheme to discredit my client was exposed,
Mr. Young took his own life last night.
Both a tragedy and an obvious sign of guilt.
I'm here to demand that the district attorney release Oscar Keaton so he can finally grieve for his wife.
Thank you.
Uh, n-no questions at this time.
Hey, Julia.
I heard you were there last night.
Are you okay?
The cops wanted me to come down and give statement to the D.A.
Can we talk about what you're gonna say?
I'm already late.
Your assistant said I could come on back.
Julia George.
Please, come in.
I'm so sorry about last night.
How are you holding up?
Well, on one hand, I saw a man shoot himself, but on the other, there wasn't much traffic this morning, so...
It's okay not to be okay.
How can I help?
Please.
Alan, what can I do for you?
I just saw your press conference.
You really think Levi killed my sister?
Uh, the evidence is pointing in that direction, yeah.
You and I should meet.
There's something you should know.
- Okay.
- How about the Royal Junction?
It's a restaurant on Third.
Let's say 11:00 a.m.
I'll be there.
Jake Gregorian is saying that Levi killed Sarah.
What do you think?
I would never hurt Sarah.
I'm...
I'm not that kind of person.
I don't think Levi did it.
But this whole catfishing thing...
With Oscar out of the way, Levi had a lot to gain.
You have feelings for him.
You're in love with him.
I don't think the catfishing had anything to do with Sarah Keaton's murder.
Excuse me.
CSI is still processing Levi's home, but I thought you should see this right away.
It was found in his desk.
Thank you.
Miss George, how well do you know Jake Gregorian?
Mr. Gilford, how well do we know anyone?
Is there anything else?
I've been the D.A. for a month now.
I've been meaning to introduce myself.
I'm sorry it was under these circumstances.
You know, I've invited you on my show several times, and you always decline.
Why don't you come tell your side of the Sarah Keaton case?
Especially in light of Levi's suicide.
I'm not that great on TV.
Well, then you won't have your job for long.
Ever since O.J., media savviness is a requirement.
Why don't you let me take you to lunch and try and convince you?
- Sure.
- Good.
I'll have my office reach out with the details.
Why are we spying on Julia?
When's the last time she actually sat down in the kitchen?
- Never.
- Yeah, I'm worried about her.
Morning, boss.
You had quite night.
Do you need to talk?
Because we can talk.
Or I can give you happy pills.
Your call.
We're here for you.
We broke the story on Levi catfishing, and then he killed himself, so everyone's gonna be looking to us for answers.
We're going wall-to-wall.
I'm trying to get the D.A. for tonight's show, so let's get started on a full work-up.
Great.
Are we gonna open with the video Levi sent you?
No.
But that video's part of the story.
Julia, I watched it.
It's captivating.
The guy's unhinged.
I'd like to try and get through today without further incriminating a man who just killed himself.
Is that okay with you?
What'd you think of the press conference?
You killed it.
That new D.A.'s gonna feel the heat.
All right, well, let's hit him with the full-court press.
We're gonna be exercising our right to a speedy trial, so notify the clerk that we'll be withdrawing our 1050 motion.
Give two days notice that we'll be demanding a new bail hearing, and, uh, draft a motion to introduce evidence of third-party culpability.
I'll have it by this afternoon.
Levi's suicide's a tragedy, but might be just the break that Oscar needs.
Yeah, no doubt.
Uh, Bradley, I got to call you back.
There's a pregnant woman in my parking space.
Come again?
A pregnant woman.
Parking space.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Are you okay?
- Are you Jake Gregorian?
- ‭Yeah.
Uh, I've been waiting for you.
I was worried if I went into your office, they would turn me away.
I don't want this.
Oh, okay.
Um, why don't we go inside, and, uh, I can put you in touch with adoption services?
No, you don't understand.
I'm not the mother.
This isn't my baby.
I'm nine months pregnant, and the parents are MIA, and I don't know what to do.
So, to be clear, you're the surrogate mother, but you've never met the intended parents, who are the biological parents?
That's right.
This surrogacy was set up by a fertility lawyer...
Maggie Sherman.
I wanted to meet the parents, but she said that they're very serious about keeping things confidential.
As a surrogate, you would have been paid.
$50,000... divided into weekly installments, and they stopped...
last month.
Maggie said that they disappeared on her and that she was looking for them, but...
I mean, who would back out on their own baby?
I can't imagine.
But as a surrogate, your options are limited.
You don't have the right to give the baby up for adoption.
No, but I...
I can't afford to raise this baby.
And I didn't carry him for nine month just to dump him into the foster-care system.
Look, I know that this is crazy, but I am the only person who cares about this child, and he's not even mine.
Can you help me?
Of course.
Jake, can I talk to you for a minute?
Excuse me.
We're up to our eyeballs in Oscar Keaton.
I know this hits close to home, but we can give her a referral.
I'm taking the case, Brad, and you know I can't say no.
Jake, your time in foster care was tough.
Hm, that's one way to put it.
And I respect you trying to help.
But please, take a breath.
I don't have time to take a breath, Brad.
My client could deliver at any moment.
What do you think you're doing?
I thought we could go again if you're up for it.
Oh, I'm up.
Oh, God, Ryan.
What?
‭Stop.
It's 10:00.
I'm late for work.
We've been looking into some people from Levi's past to bring in for interviews.
His college roommate is now a banker in San Diego.
Is he worth pursuing for a segment?
Julia?
I got the story wrong, but you have the chance to set it right.
Tell Oscar I'm sorry.
Julia?
Julia.
Where'd everybody go?
I asked them to give us a second.
Where did you go?
I need some more coffee.
Stop.
I know what's going on here.
And you can't blame yourself.
You were just following the story.
Megan, I'm fine.
No, you're not.
You remember when I first started here and I brought in a staff intern who told us Senator Bailey was having an affair?
Then we learned the affair never happened.
Both my sources were lying.
I felt terrible.
But what did you tell me?
That it was news and we had to run it.
Yeah, and you also said that we do the best we can with the information that we have.
Maybe I was wrong.
Mr. Gregorian, you have no idea how much I want to help you.
Jenna is a sweet girl.
And no one should be in her situation.
You know, I agree.
I have been trying to find the biological parents.
My office can help.
We have resources.
I just need their names.
I'm sorry, but I can't share that with you.
It would breach confidentiality, given the nature of the surrogacy agreement.
You mean the agreement you have with Jenna?
No, with the biological parents.
Aren't they in violation of that very same agreement by...
I don't know...
Backing out on Jenna, leaving her nine months pregnant?
Sometimes couples change their minds, and the surrogate is put in an unfortunate predicament.
Why are you protecting these people?
Look, I'm not heartless.
I got into this business to help couples start families.
But if I violate their confidentiality, then I put all my other clients at risk.
Privacy is the cornerstone of my practice.
Jenna needs to find the parents before the baby is born, so either you give us the names, or I'll be taking this in front of a judge.
I hope it doesn't come to that.
This is Ella.
Are you up to speed on the Jenna Polly case?
Um... yeah.
Uh...
A pregnant woman looking for baby's parents.
Good.
I need you to go to the Count Clerk's Office and find the petition establishing parenthood.
Would have been filed at the time of conception.
Parents' names should be on it.
Records are sealed, so you might have to turn on the charm.
- Yep, you got it.
- I'll be right in.
Just making a quick stop.
Hey.
I appreciate you meeting me.
Yeah, you said it was about your sister.
I really thought Oscar killed Sarah.
Given the turn of events,
I admit I may have rushed to judgment.
So, now you think it was Levi?
At their wedding reception,
Levi got drunk and started ranting about how Sarah was wrong for him.
Levi said he'd do whatever he could to make Oscar see that.
Would you be willing to go public again?
- Maybe do an interview?
- No, I won't do that.
But I have a video of Levi's outburst, if you want it.
That'd be helpful.
I don't want Sarah's wedding video, Jake.
I don't want to run the story indicting Levi.
I thought you'd be excited, Julia.
I'm offering you the exclusive.
Honestly, I can't believe you want me to run a story smearing a man I saw kill himself yesterday.
We already dragged Levi through the mud, and look what happened.
You cannot possibly think that's on you.
I'm fine, by the way.
Thanks for asking.
I'm sorry, Julia.
I should have been more...
I have a lot of work to do.
I can't bury the wedding video.
I need the story to help Oscar.
Levi was not trying to take over the company.
He was not trying to commit corporate sabotage.
How do you know?
Shut the door.
Levi was in love with Oscar.
He pretended to be SweetVicki so that he could feel closer to Oscar.
If you go public with the wedding video,
I will go public with what I know, and that will not be good for your client.
He's been telling everyone that Levi wanted to destroy him, and that was not the case.
If I were you, I would bury that video and pray that I keep my mouth shut.
There you are.
Everything okay?
Oh, yeah, just kind of screwed up with Julia.
What's going on?
Uh, get this.
The D.A. is in the conference room.
Yeah, he wants to speak to you.
This ought to be interesting.
Max Gilford.
I assume you're here because you wanted to personally tell me you're dropping charges against Oscar Keaton.
I'm afraid not.
I wanted to make you an offer.
I, uh...
I know you and my predecessor liked to go head-to-head on TV.
But what do you say we stop the media circus and try our case in court the old-fashioned way?
You mean after you perp-walked my client at his wife's funeral when you knew everyone would be watching?
Now, what's this visit really about?
Despite what you've been saying about Levi,
Oscar remains our prime suspect.
But between you and me, we are investigating other people in Sarah's life.
I'm glad to hear it.
It's seems that Sarah was having an affair shortly before she was murdered.
Care to elaborate?
I've taken up enough of your time.
I'll see myself out.
Hi, Jake.
Jake?
Did you tell the D.A. about me and Sarah?
Excuse me?
He came to my office, looked me in the eye, and told me he knew she was having an affair.
And since you met with him earlier today...
You thought I told him you were sleeping with Sarah?
Are you kidding me?
What the hell is wrong with you?
I'm sorry.
I'm spinning.
Tell me about it.
I-I can't imagine what it must have been like to be there when he pulled that trigger.
I can't stop thinking about it.
Yeah.
Sorry to interrupt.
Mr. Gilford's in the lobby.
I'll be right down.
Gilford.
As in the D.A.?
- It's just lunch, Jake.
- Mm-hmm.
- You want him on the show, don't you?
- Of course I do.
Look, I'm sorry we're not on the same page on this, but I have a story to cover, and I have to go.
Half the pundits in town think the only reason the last D.A. made U.S. Attorney is because of her appearance on my show.
Hm.
I think she just liked to see herself on TV.
That and she increased the conviction rate by 15%.
My show is a platform for different voices.
Let your voice be heard.
That's a good line.
Okay, let's just say that I did come on your show.
How would it work?
Louise will recap the developments of the case, and then she'll tee you up.
And that's when we start yelling at each other
- about who really did it.
- This is your chance to tell people what you want them to hear, what you want them to believe.
Okay, I'll do it.
Under one condition.
We stop talking about work for five minutes.
Don't worry.
We'll take it slow.
Let's start with, where are you from?
Wait, wait, come on.
Let the show take care of it.
I have corporate card for a reason.
I was, uh... hoping that this wasn't just business.
Uh...
I don't want to argue.
Say you'll be in hair and makeup by 4:00.
Make it 4:15.
I'm no pushover.
What's so urgent we couldn't wait for a trial?
As you can see, Your Honor, my client is expecting.
We need Miss Sherman to reveal the names of the unborn child's biological parents.
That doesn't sound unreasonable.
It's not how my business operates, Your Honor.
Miss Polly, how did you find Miss Sherman?
I was drowning in college debt, and a friend of mine said that she paid off all her student loans with one pregnancy, so I listed myself on a surrogacy website.
A couple weeks later, Maggie got in touch.
Next thing you know,
I'm in Prague getting an embryo implanted.
Hold on.
Prague?
The Czech Republic has a streamlined IVF process.
It's less expensive than doing the procedure in the U.S.
This is just a glorified turkey-baster situation.
I'm inclined to serve the best interests of the child and compel you to disclose, Miss Sherman.
I'm sorry, but I can't do that, Your Honor.
My relationship with the biological parents is protected under attorney-client privilege.
What kind of family attorney places confidentiality over the well-being of a child?
Mr. Gregorian represents criminals.
I would appreciate that he not lecture me on legal ethics in family court.
That's enough.
Although I am sympathetic to Miss Polly,
I won't threaten privilege.
Thank you.
This is not over...
I promise you.
So nice to meet you, Mr. District Attorney.
And you, Louise.
We're live in five...
All right, Louise, let's see what Mr. Gilford is made of.
...three...
Good evening.
Tonight, for the first time since taking office,
"LHL" welcomes Los Angeles District Attorney Max Gilford.
Mr. Gilford, earlier today, Mr. Keaton's attorney demanded his release in light of Levi Young's suicide.
What are your thoughts?
Oscar Keaton is a cold-blooded murderer whose defense is quite good at playing the media.
We will not be releasing Mr. Keaton because we have both motive and evidence.
Is it true you still haven't found the murder weapon?
Even without a weapon, it's clear what happened.
Oscar Keaton is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
Don't the recent revelations in conjunction with Mr. Young's suicide point to him as a suspect?
Not at all.
Mr. Keaton's defense has propped up various unfounded allegations in an attempt to clear their client of any wrongdoing.
That man's a natural.
Not to mention he's hot.
He's good...
I'll give him that.
He's not letting Louise bait him.
You know what, Megan?
I changed my mind.
Cue up the Levi tape.
Are you sure?
I thought you said...
I know what I said.
Play the tape.
Let's get a reaction.
Louise, change of plans...
We're gonna run the Levi video.
We'd like to play a video Levi Young made for our executive producer shortly before his suicide.
You got the story all wrong.
You think I wanted to hurt Oscar?
I just wanted to protect him.
Sarah was bad for him.
And I was the only one who could see it.
- Cut.
- Well, sounds like Levi Young was intent on getting Sarah out of Oscar Keaton's life.
Has he really been ruled out as a suspect?
I've never seen this video before.
But I certainly look forward to reviewing an unedited version.
And when you do, we hope you'll come back on the show and share your thoughts.
We'll be back after a short break.
And we're clear.
Incoming.
And he looks angry.
I thought you said Levi didn't kill Sarah.
He didn't.
So I debrief you after the suicide.
You don't tell me about the video, then you play it live on air.
- Why would you do that?
- It's part of the story, and I wanted your honest reaction.
You realize I could charge you with obstruction of justice for hiding that video.
That's a stretch, and we both know it.
So let me get this straight.
Your show accused a man of murder, then you saw that man take his own life, and your first instinct is to make a spectacle out of his suicide.
What the hell is wrong with you?
!
I put up the video.
It's your job to knock it down.
You want my honest reaction?
I thought you were a news producer.
Turns out you're just a mouthpiece for Jake Gregorian.
Hey.
Can I sit?
How'd you find me?
Uh, I know you come here when you're stressed.
I saw the show last night.
What happened?
Why'd you run that tape?
I didn't plan on it.
I...
I didn't want to assassinate Levi's character.
I just...
I was watching the D.A., and it was like...
I couldn't help myself.
Because, uh, the segment was boring?
Thanks.
Remind me to come by court next week and critique your performance.
Ah.
I mean, look, you had a...
You had a charismatic guest.
Louise was in top form, and it was a solid show.
Solid's not good enough for you, Julia George.
You have a sixth sense about the exact moment when the show needs something extra.
Besides, the video's still news.
And, uh, admit it...
You wanted to see the D.A. squirm just a little bit.
What are you doing here?
I have something.
Someone I want to put on your show.
Chance for us both to do some good.
Maybe.
Here me out?
Good evening.
In the past, we've aired heartbreaking cases of missing children.
But tonight, we bring you a different kind of story...
A case of missing parents.
Joining us tonight is Jenna Polly, a woman who agreed to help a childless couple have a baby.
Now that couple, the biological parents, have disappeared, abandoning Jenna who is nine months pregnant with their child.
Also with us is Jenna's attorney, Jake Gregorian.
Jenna, what happens if you can't find the biological parents before their baby arrives?
I don't have the legal rights to put him up for adoption.
So my only options are to raise him by myself, which I'm not in a position to do, or to put him in the foster-care system, which I don't want to do.
Load the titles.
Jenna, what can you tell us about the parents?
They couldn't conceive on their own.
So they went to Maggie Sherman, a fertility lawyer, to help them find a surrogate... me.
Miss Sherman has withheld all information about the biological parents and refuses to help Jenna.
Jenna, I understand you have a letter from the biological parents.
You'd like to read a passage.
"Our house is filled with love and laughter.
The only thing we need is a baby to make our lives complete.
We've already built a swing set in our backyard and a tree house in the front.
There are no words to describe how grateful we are to you.
Because of you, we can be parents."
And now they're gone.
God, that poor girl.
I can't imagine.
...please contact my office.
We're not looking to punish them.
We just need to transfer the parental rights so the baby can go to a good home.
Is there anything else you'd like to add, Jenna?
It's okay.
You're doing great.
Guys, what's happening?
We're dead on air.
I-I-I think my water just broke.
Louise, walk her to the back exit.
And cheat her to camera.
- Oh, God - ‭We'll be right back.
Easy, easy.
How'd the delivery go?
Well, Jenna and the baby are doing fine.
Any updates around here?
I tried calling Maggie to see if she wanted to reconsider her position now that Jenna's gone public, but she's not returning my calls.
Mr. Gregorian.
We saw you and Jenna on TV.
That's our baby.
I mean, she has our baby.
I wrote the letter, the one she read.
Here's the picture of our home with the swing set and the tree house.
I'm happy you're here.
And I don't need to know why you abandoned Jenna or the baby, but I do need you to surrender your parental rights so that Jenna can find the baby a good home.
We...
No, please, we don't want to give up the baby.
We want the child.
More than anything in the world.
Then why stop paying Jenna?
We didn't, and we paid Maggie the full $200,000 up front, but she lied to us.
She told us Jenna had a miscarriage.
Hold on. $200,000?
Jenna was supposed to receive $50,000 for carrying your baby.
Well, you don't understand.
We're not the biological parents.
Our contract with Maggie Sherman is to adopt Jenna's baby.
We...
We brought our contract with us.
Okay, if that's true,
Maggie brokered an adoption with the surrogate and pocketed $150,000 in the process.
She's running a scam.
We don't care about that right now.
We just...
We want to see the baby.
Our baby.
Oh.
We begged Maggie to let us talk to you.
We're so sorry we couldn't reach you.
Oh, none of that matters now.
We'll sort it out.
The baby has a home.
Can I help you?
I'm from Child Protective Services.
What's going on?
Are you the child's biological parents?
Well, no, but...
I'm sorry, Miss Polly.
My office was alerted to your situation when you appeared on TV.
You do not have to do this.
The State will take custody of the child until the biological parents can be found.
Hold on.
This couple has a contract to adopt the baby.
Unfortunately, an adoption would be void without the biological parents' consent.
When the baby's ready to leave the hospital, he'll be placed in foster care until the biological parents can be found.
What happens if they never show up?
You will have to take that up with the family court.
We already did.
I wish I could do more.
I'm just following protocol.
To hell with protocol.
You have the chance to do the right thing.
Not just for my client, not just for this couple, but for that child.
That should be your job here.
The baby needs to come with me.
No.
No, you can't take him.
I-I-I won't let you take him.
Please don't.
Mary, I'm so sorry.
Hand me the baby, okay?
What?
That's it?
Hell no. ‭Jake, I think we...
We need to find those biological parents.
There's one person out there who knows who they are, and I am done playing nice.
Jake, where have you been?
Maggie fled town.
Her office is empty.
Hey.
What's so urgent you call us in at 6:00 a.m.?
I want to talk about Maggie Sherman, this, uh, fertility lawyer.
We're using every resource we have to find her.
I have a friend at a bureau tracking her credit cards, but it's like she's vanished.
I stayed up all night reading about surrogacy law.
And...
I came across another scam in Boston...
Perpetrated by a lawyer named Doris Goodbridge.
Listen to this.
"Miss Goodbridge described the embryo implantation procedure to prospective surrogates as a "glorified turkey-baster situation."
Sound like anyone we know?
That's what Maggie said in court.
Now, I searched the State Bar database.
There is no Maggie Sherman listed in California.
I think Maggie Sherman is Doris Goodbridge.
Ella, you think you can find Maggie using her real name?
Yeah, I'm on it.
What can I do for you, Miss George?
I'm sorry for blindsiding you on air.
It wasn't right.
It wasn't what we agreed upon, and, quite frankly, I went too far.
You doing okay?
I'm having a difficult time compartmentalizing.
Every day I decide... who should be charged and who should go free.
We both take our jobs home with us.
It's the only way to do them well.
Mr. Gilford?
The Deputy Mayor is on line 2.
Tell him to hold.
No problem.
I just wanted to apologize, and, um...
I hope I can make it up to you sometime.
Hi, Doris.
Still using credit card with your old name, huh?
Not too smart.
What do you want?
Uh, you're gonna come with us.
Oh, sweetie, that's not gonna happen.
You're coming with us, or we'll have the cops here in two minutes.
Your call, sweetie.
I don't understand why you stopped paying Jenna if the Gowers gave you $200,000 and you only had to give her $50,000.
I was expanding my business.
Would you believe I had unexpected costs and ran out of cash?
I'm gonna make this real simple for you, Doris.
I've convinced my client not to press charges if you tell us the identity of the baby's biological parents.
There are no parents.
Fine.
You want to be difficult?
No, I'm telling the truth.
I bought the egg and sperm from the clinic in Prague where the procedure was done.
And to be honest, this is partially your fault.
My fault?
If your law firm hadn't entered Jenna's name with the Clerk's office,
I could have found another couple to adopt her baby.
Wow.
That was the scam.
Now I understand why you told the Gowers that Jenna miscarried.
You were going to resell her baby.
You wanted to double-down and make another $200,000 off the same child.
Like I said, I was running low on cash.
We're done here, right?
Yeah.
We're done.
The cops are waiting for you in the lobby.
You said you wouldn't press charges.
My client, Jenna, she won't be pressing charges, but the couple trying to adopt her baby, yeah, I think they want to see you in prison.
I sure do.
Meal's up.
Hey.
I want to see my lawyer.
I want to see my damn lawyer!
And finally, last night's segment on Jenna Polly's surrogacy gone wrong went viral after her water broke live on air.
Thousands of you have reached out for updates on Jenna's delivery, and we're happy to report that Jenna gave birth...
I don't understand.
You're saying that the biological parents were egg and sperm donors?
- From Prague?
- That's right.
And the surrendered all parental rights when they made their donation.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
What's going on?
Mr. Gregorian, I have been instructed to return the baby to your client, Miss Polly.
Jake, I don't understand.
Under the law, because they surrendered their rights, you're the de facto parent, which means...
- I can give the baby to the Gowers.
- Yes, that's right.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
This...
This is really happening?
Hi, baby.
Hi, there.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
My office will prepare the paperwork, but with Jenna's consent, the baby's yours.
Absolutely.
Julia George inviting us to happy hour...
How civilized.
I wanted to apologize, and it's easier for me to say I'm sorry with a gin and tonic.
We're good.
No apology necessary.
Hold on.
I want to hear her out.
I'm listening.
I haven't been myself.
And I can usually find solace in my work.
But this time I...
Oh, honey, it's okay.
I know, I mean, of course, I just...
I shouldn't have taken it out on either of you.
You know what?
I need a drink.
Something festive with a tiny umbrella.
Great.
Oh, look who's here.
You didn't.
I didn't... what?
Call the D.A. and tell him we were meeting here for drinks?
Why would I do that for you when you've been such a pill?
Go, talk to him.
Hi.
Can I buy you a drink?
Only if it's not on your corporate card.
No, this one's on me.
Jenna signed the paperwork, and the judge expedited the filing.
Baby goes home with the Gowers tonight.
Happy ending.
I remember Pops talking about you even before he brought you home.
He and Mom were so pissed that your biological father refused to sign that paperwork.
A man I didn't know kept me from having a family for eight years, and the law... was on his side.
Well, it all worked out.
‭And you're a better lawyer today for it.
Yeah.
You know...
I don't know who I'd be if you weren't my brother.
Yeah?
Jake, Oscar's been calling.
He says he needs you, and it's urgent.
Hey, got your messages, Oscar.
What's going on?
How can I help you?
You were sleeping with my wife.
Oscar, look...
My wife?
The woman who I love?
Oscar, I...
I made a mistake.
Okay, I should have said something...
Shut your mouth!
You're fired.
Don't do this.
Think about the optics.
- It'll only hurt your case.
- The optics?
!
Don't you worry, Jake.
I can find another hack in a suit.
Okay, someone who won't stab me in the back.
Get out of here.
Get out.
Guard!
Well, I guess we got our answer.
Oscar didn't know about the affair.
Until now.
You're sure we're allowed to watch this, boss?
We can't use it in court, but it helps us inform the investigation.
Now get me everything you can on Jake Gregorian.

Stand back, defibrillator charged.
Discharge number 1 dispensed, the patient can now be touched.
This way, Don Pietro.
Don Pietro, please forgive me,
I have some bad news.
Genny's been shot.
His men too, they're in real bad shape.
Don Pietro, get a little rest.
I've rested way too long, Malamore.
What happened?
I wanted a dead man, you gave me an enemy for life.
He took three bullets, one right here.
If he's not dead, he will be soon.
Let's hope so.
Because his father busted out.
I heard it on the radio.
We need to works fast, Salvatore, we gotta take it all.
The ones against Gennaro have to stay with us and those on the fence gotta come to our side.
Let's call a meeting, all the families with dealing spots send a guy, even the ones working for Savastano, even friends and relatives of the ones Gennaro killed.
We overturn things, they'll all side with us and we do what we always promised:
you bring the stuff and we each handle a spot, but autonomously!
Salvatore, let's make an alliance.
What's in it for me?
You get back what was yours... what you had before Spain, your own home,
but you're back as master.
Okay.
The ones that bring cash get a spot, before a busted-out Savastano or a resurrected Savastano comes fucking around.
Got it.
No, sweetheart, stop crying, it's all over.
Where is she?
Stop crying, alright?
Can you wash you own hands?
Good.
Here's the soap.
Wash them, then dry them with this, okay?
Ciro...
- We have to talk.
- Not right now.
- They're coming to kill us.
- No one's coming.
You killed his wife and shot his son, you broke all the rules, now they'll kill me and Maria Rita.
He's hiding and can't move.
They'll find someone.
They've been kings for 30 years, think they can't find someone?
- 50, 60...
- Do you hear me?
We have to leave!
Don't worry, Debora.
- We have to leave.
- Don't worry!
You know how much I've put aside all these years?
60 thousand euros... peanuts!
I don't even have that!
We have to take a spot, Rosario.
We gotta find the money.
We gotta find it now.
Get out!
Get out!
I'll kill you, get out!
- Throw the gun on the ground.
- Put it down.
- We got nothing...
- I said: gun down.
Hands up.
We just left the depot, there's no money.
Strip.
- Why?
- I said: strip!
Move!
Look, I know where you live, where your kids go to school.
I know everything.
Don't fuck around.
- Good evening, Salvatore.
- Evening, guys.
Coffee, guys?
No, thanks, just be a minute.
Not even you, Luciano?
Luciano!
It's not Luciano, he's a new guy.
This new guy's got no voice?
- Why the fuck...?
- Shut up, asshole!
Move!
Out that way, move!
Don't hurt me!
Take those out of there, fast!
- Move!
- Right away!
Get out, make it fast.
Move it!
Maria Rita, take it up higher!
Go on, a little higher!
Good girl!
Don't let it fall.
The police called me.
I've been summoned with the other parents.
Do I go?
It's worse if I don't, isn't it?
But tell them I wasn't in Naples.
I didn't even see the recital, okay?
I'll deal with it.
Ciro, I can't take anymore.
Maria Rita can't even go to school!
Till when?
When does it end?
Do you see her?
See her?
Look how pretty she is!
She's already over it, all forgotten.
Why don't you do like her?
Just think it's all over, because it really is all over.
Now I'll get the cops off my back and then we can relax.
Someone saw a man leave the theater.
More or less like this.
Looks like your husband, don't you think?
Your husband was there.
- And who says so?
- I do.
Just because someone saw a bald man outside the theater.
They know him here at school, if he'd been there, some parent would have said so, get it?
Mrs. Di Marzio, you're defending yourself from the wrong people.
I hope you realize that in time.
Good day.
This is an advance.
Then I'll give you 6 thousand euros at the end of each month.
You can sort out everything.
Your wife, your kids, will have no more worries.
And when you get out, there'll be money to start over.
It's the chance to change your life.
Think about it.
Good day, ma'am.
What is it, brother?
Did I scare you?
I didn't recognize you.
Now do you?
Why are you shaking?
What is it?
We can't be seen together, if they find out I was in with you, I'm a dead man.
Don't worry, they won't find out.
But you have to do something else for me.
I saw who took the shot.
What took you so long to come?
I was afraid.
Let's hear it!
Don't worry.
Capiano, open up!
Police!
Capiano!
Open, police!
Capiano!
Open up!
- Antonio Capiano?
- It's me.
You're under arrest.
Thanks.
Wait out here.
It's okay, it's clean.
We each have a wound, a humiliation, a death to mourn.
The hand that's hurt us all is the same.
It's Savastano's.
Some of you lost a brother, or a father,
because of Gennaro and his guys.
But that's history.
The ones who treated us like slaves are now hiding in some fucking hole or hooked to a machine to stay alive.
They mustn't come back.
Me and Salvatore Conte made a promise and we're keeping it.
You are all the ones who count most at the dealing spots.
Today, anyone who puts money on this table, buys a share of the stuff that Salvatore's bringing in.
The spots you handled on Savastano's payroll, will be your own.
The money you make goes into your own pockets.
No master.
Here's mine.
400 thousand euros, to start.
We're ready, Don Pietro.
Guys,
I didn't pretend to be crazy all this time just to get caught or get shot.
I gotta leave here, but from this moment, here in Naples you're my eyes,
my hands, my heart
and my anger.
And I assure you of one thing:
we'll take back everything that's ours.
Debora!
Deb.
There's no more danger.
See how happy Maria Rita is?
She's got all her things again.
I'm happy too.
Our home...
Deb...
A great life's starting, you'll see, the greatest life ever.
How about a smile?
I gotta go.
- Where?
- Got things to do.
I'll be back later, Fernando's here.
Bye, Maria Rita!
Bye, Daddy!
Rita, be careful!
Mrs. Di Marzio!
Hello.
Hello.
Your husband got my son a job.
I want to thank you, we owe you and we're at your disposal.
Thank you so much!
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Maria!
Rita!
Lady Debora, she was right here, don't worry.
Maria Rita!
There she is!
I told you she was here.
Rita...
Get off the bike.
Get off.
Some guys came last night and took everything.
We couldn't do a thing.
Fuck, there's nothing left, not even here!
They took all the weapons, those bastards!
Let's take what's left.
Where's Mommy?
What the fuck's going on?
Why all those suitcases?
I'm not staying there, or here either.
We're not going anywhere!
Don't you see, I can't take it anymore.
Calm down!
- I'm scared.
- I said: calm down!
No, I can't calm down, this is no way to live!
- Take your hands off!
- Who's touching?
- Take your hands off me!
- Who's touching you?
Calm down!
Calm down!
I said: calm down.
Listen to me:
There's no reason to be scared.
We won, hear me?
It's all over.
The Savastanos won't be back.
Calm down.
Calm down.
Ciro... take us far away.
- Or I'll find someone who will.
- Shut up!
Shut up!
I have to go out, but I'll be right back.
Stay here, Daddy's men are right outside.
- What is it, Lady Debora?
- Take me to the old house.
- Now?
- Yes.
She ran off.
I thought it was good for her to come here.
She said: "Wait", went up and I never saw her again.
Idiot...
You're a piece of shit!
I left her with you and you...
Sorry, you're right.
No way that's fucking good!
- Should we worry about Debora?
- No, just the dealing spots!
Ciro...
I'm your brother.
If she fucks up, I'm not your problem.
We have to find her.
The stuff's here in a couple of days, it's good, you can cut it to 1.5, or 2, right?
Up to 3, no problem.
If a guy's smart like him, even 3.
I can give it to you for 30 thousand.
Excuse me a minute.
Ciro, I found her.
Where is she?
It's like you thought.
- You were talking about the price...
- 30 thousand.
- Okay for you?
- Yeah.
Things alright, Ciro?
What happened to your hand?
An accident at home, it's nothin'.
To 3...
Really?
Yeah.
Maria!
Maria Rita!
Maria!
Where's my daughter?
She went out with Rosaria, Teresa and Simonetta, they took her for a pizza.
She was at home all day.
I want to say I'm sorry,
I lost my head.
I can't stand seeing you like this.
How about doing something?
Let's go out, just us two.
How long since we had some fun?
We'll go out alone, just the two of us.
What do you say?
C'mon!
You know, Debora...
When me and Attilio were kids and doing our first heists, we'd come here,
and look at this place, but we couldn't go in, we stayed outside, we had just a few cents between us.
We'd daydream.
But now look...
The most beautiful woman in the world is by my side and a little girl who bursts my heart with joy.
Debora...
More than anyone, you know what I did to get us here.
So, where are we now?
We're on top.
(T)(U)(S)(U)(B)(T)(I)(T)(U)(L)(O).(C)(O)(M)
Debora!
Listen...
We're this close, understand?
We're almost there.
No one can stop us.
If you don't stop now, someone else will stop us.
No one's stopping me, understand?
- No one's stopping me.
- Or me either!
Hands off me!
Don't you know all I did to get this far?
I can't stop now!
I'll stop you!
Are you crazy?
You're crazy?
You're crazy!
You're crazy!
Calm down!
Calm down!
Calm down, Debora!
Calm down!
Calm down!
You gotta calm down!
Will you calm down?
Will you calm down?
Calm down!
Calm down!
You gotta trust me.
Will you calm down?
Will you calm down?
Calm down!
Calm down!
Today's a great day, we've baptized a new alliance, where we all decide together.
I buy the stuff for everyone, we're all kings in our own house.
We made the United States of Scampia-Secondigliano and may God bless us.
The Flori and Berlingieri neighborhoods are outside these United States.
A few assholes who still believe in the Savastanos.
But we can't make war now, we have to keep them locked up in there.
In a few months, they'll be groveling at our door.
Now let's make a toast.
- Bring a bottle.
- Come here!
Please, Don Salvatore.
Here's to all our enemies!
Here.
Are you ready?
Where's my glass?
- Here's to us!
- To us!
They're hers.
Your signature here.
Blood breeds blood, violence breeds violence, in a spiral of revenge that's transforming Naples into a city where a bloody Camorra war generates terror among the people.
The latest murder in the outskirts as usual...
Hello?
...and with the usual brutality.
The victim is a woman...
Yes, coming.
We're in a warehouse in Melito...
Physical conditions have decidedly improved, hemodynamics are stable and there's a valid diuresis.
Well, hey, there, sailor.
Where are you dropping anchor?
A group of us are joining the Fire Island invasion this year.
It's the annual drag parade from Cherry Grove.
Can I fix you some chow before the crossing?
No, no, no.
Actually, I've got to hustle.
I'm gonna miss the fairy ferry.
Muah!
Okay.
Ooh, your moustache tickles.
Nice.
I think I can work with that.
- Have fun.
- You too
And don't work too hard.
It's summer.
We need to finalize the media plan on the next Annabelle Bancroft book.
Oh, also, call Jackie Dunn's office and tell them
I need to reschedule lunch on Tuesday.
I can make the jitney if I leave at 1:00.
Can you pick me up in Bridgehampton across from Candy Kitchen?
What are you wearing?
It's summer Friday, lady.
Ceci got us a table at Navy Beach, but I'm not eating.
My God, I can smell her Banana Boat.
Why do they even bother coming in at all?
See if you can get on Charles's schedule before lunch.
He never signed off on my September budget.
Oh, he left for Pound Ridge last night.
Of course he did.
Hey, did you finish Colin's book?
I was up half the night but only got through the first 700 pages.
And what do you think?
I mean, I know it could use some editing, but am I just being blinded by lust?
Because I think it's pretty amazing.
I mean, it's overwritten, but I still...
I couldn't put it down.
I mean, it's like a dystopian "Bonfire of the Vanities."
Oh, my God.
That's exactly how I would sell it.
I'm just worried about the conflict of interest.
Like, I don't want people to think that I'm buying the book because I'm sleeping with him, and I don't want to lose the book because I'm sleeping with him.
Ah, the old Catch-69.
Ohh, what am I gonna I do?
Well, first, you need to own the fact that you're together.
And then you've got to get Colin a good agent.
I mean, you may be screwing the guy, but you don't want to screw him.
I do know just the person.
How dare you call me about work on a summer Friday?
I wouldn't unless it was something special.
A have the new writer I want to talk to you about.
Well, is he hot?
It's all about the jacket photo for a first-time novelist.
I'm dating him, Redmond, so what do you think?
Well, if you really want me to consider him, bring him to the Gansevoort rooftop.
Half the publishing biz will be there for cocktails this afternoon.
Oh, we'll be there.
And send me the manuscript.
Ugh.
Why do I need an agent?
I already want to make a deal for my book with you.
And you will.
But I've got to keep this above board.
And you need a someone on your side that has integrity, somebody with a great reputation, someone that people respect.
Kelsey, sweetheart.
- Really?
- Trust me.
Colin, this is Redmond, the best book agent in the business.
She flatters me, but she's not wrong.
Nice to meet you, Redmond.
Colin, I'll be honest with you.
If Kelsey hadn't slipped me your little Bildungsroman, it never would have made it out of my slush pile.
But lucky for all of us, she did.
You've put a fun house mirror up to this city and our culture that's both hilarious and depressing, at least in the chapter I read.
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.
Thank the gorgeous editrix who discovered you.
Thank you, gorgeous editrix.
Wait, does this mean you're going to represent the book?
Because you already have a buyer.
If you want to talk business, get in the pool.
Oh, see you in minute.
Um, we didn't bring swimsuits.
No problem.
They have them here.
Come on.
Hmm, what looks good?
I'm not sure.
I've never bought a bathing suit out of a vending machine before, let alone one that also sells condoms.
- What about that one?
- Seriously?
I've already got some dental floss in my purse.
Oh, right.
How's the, um, situation?
- It's under control.
- Okay.
Colin?
Can't I just swim in my boxers?
My treat.
How about the red one?
Mm, don't do Speedos.
It's amazing the things you'll do to live your dream.
Right, Liza?
Oh, absolutely.
Okay, I have never felt more naked in my entire life.
Okay, well, you look amazing.
But whatever you do, just don't bend over.
Wow, I...
I thought this was a work event.
Oh, we are definitely working it.
- Hey, Kels.
- Hey, Josh.
Oh, this is Colin.
Also working it.
Don't judge.
Judging, yeah.
Hey, we've got a deal to close.
- Okay.
- Meet you in the pool.
I mean, when I...
when I see you wearing this, it just... it just make me want to...
Okay.
All right, we can talk about that later.
Oh, we can, can we?
We can talk.
Vending machine's that way.
Okay.
All right, okay.
Whoo.
Ugh, I hate summer.
Everyone's in the Hamptons or the Vineyard, and here I am talking to you.
My entire weekend is like a desert, except with 90% humidity.
Mm.
Honestly, I just lie around in bed all weekend reading, bingeing "Frasier" reruns until it's time to go back to work on Monday.
I feel pathetic.
Well, you could rent a place in the Hamptons.
Have you consider that?
A single woman renting in the Hamptons?
Well, that may be the saddest thing I've ever heard.
You're alone out of choice, Diana.
Excuse me?
You've filtered so many men.
And you have so many rules.
You mean standards.
No, I mean barriers to intimacy.
Look, we can sit here, and we can talk and talk and talk, but the story doesn't change.
And whose fault is that?
Instead of pointing fingers, why don't we try pointing in the direction of a solution?
Oh, well, by all means.
Get out there.
Take a few swings.
The next attractive man you see, talk to him.
Ask him out for coffee.
Is this the Freudian approach?
Or did you just see this on "Millionaire Matchmaker"?
I hear that you're frustrated.
But your frustration has become your comfort zone.
Okay, think of this as an experiment.
Talk to the next interesting man you meet and observe what happens.
Oh.
We'll see.
I'm not letting you off the hook on this one.
Fine.
Nothing like starting the weekend after a good cry with your therapist, am I right?
Actually, I am a therapist.
Marriage and Family.
Office next door.
Oh, well,
I always heard that shrinks were the crazy ones.
Especially the ones on East 65th Street.
We're in a class of our own.
I hope you're sane enough to leave the city this weekend.
It's supposed to be almost 100.
Oof, my ex-wife got the house in Woodstock, so I've learned to love summer in the city.
I think it's kind of sexy, actually.
Especially at night.
I like your perspective.
Diana, by the way.
Richard.
Stop me if I'm being too forward, but would you care to join me for a coffee?
You're asking me for a coffee?
Are you serious?
I mean, in this heat?
How about a beer?
Sounds perfect.
To my newest client.
- Yay.
- Ow.
Redmond, I'm going to ask Liza to make the deal on this one.
Seriously?
Yeah, I'm gonna stay out of it due to extreme prejudice.
Get ready to bend over.
That's what I've keep telling her.
Hey.
Babe.
Emily, get over here and meet my genius new client.
You ladies know Emily Burns from EW?
Liza, it's me.
Jackie Dunn's old assistant.
I work at EW now.
Emily, that's fantastic.
This is Kelsey Peters.
She runs Millennial Print.
- Hey.
- Oh, my God, respect.
I have heard such great things about your imprint.
Oh, thank you.
Also, I heard about what happened to your fiancé.
You must have been crushed.
I apologize.
Terrible choice of words.
Wow, Emily, meet Colin McNichol,
Kelsey's hottest new author.
And his book's not bad either.
EW should totally do something about Millennial.
You guys should come to the office Monday and meet my boss, Jess Cagle.
- Absolutely.
- Oh, we'd love to.
Liza, I'll email you.
Are you still Dianatroutassistant@empirical?
- Yeah.
- Oh, and Lmiller@millennial.
Awesome.
- EW.
- Oh, my God.
Ahh.
Kiss each other.
What?
I've prepared Millennial's offer for Colin's book.
You want to take a look before I send it to Redmond?
Yes.
We're offering a $75,000 advance with a standard royalty rate, plus bonuses if the book hits
"The New York Times" best seller list or earns out its advance within a year of publication.
It's all pretty great for a first-time writer but nothing that crosses the line.
Perfect.
Thank you for looking out for me.
Always.
Hey do you think that you can slip away for that EW meeting?
Yeah, Diana's seeing her therapist.
I have 50 minutes.
Hi, Kelsey Peters and Liza Miller from Millennial.
We have an appointment with Jess Cagle.
- Hey, what's up?
- I slipped the manuscript to a producer friend of mine at Paramount.
And he thinks it's perfect for Scott Rudin.
How fast can you get me your offer?
Liza can send it over now.
Okay.
We are just at EW about to meet with Jess Cagle.
Go, girl, and tell Jess I'm available if He needs a date for the Oscars.
Hi guys.
Jess will see you now.
- Thanks.
- Okay.
We are a baby imprint, less than year old, targeting millennials.
That's why they're called Millennial.
But the main story is that Kelsey is the youngest woman in the business to be running her own imprint.
- That's interesting.
- Really interesting.
- Really interesting.
- Any big books coming out?
Actually, we just bought a book from this incredible young
"New Yorker" writer, Colin McNichol.
It's this brilliant dystopian epic about New York.
Cool.
It's, um, like "Bonfire of the Vanities"
meets "The Walking Dead."
Are there zombies?
Yes.
And they occupy Wall Street.
I shouldn't say anything else, but Scott Rudin loves it, and Paramount's already talking a three-picture deal.
Send us the manuscript.
Maybe we can do something online about the book and Millennial.
- We really should.
- Wonderful.
Get the press kit and bios and galleys, and we'll see what we can do.
Thank you.
It was so nice to meet you.
Thank you so much.
Oh, my God.
Zombies?
A three-picture deal?
I don't...
I know I just blurted it out.
It's like a got EW-titis or something.
Well, sometimes you need to stretch the truth a little to get what you want.
So I took your advice, left the office, and struck up a conversation with an attractive man.
Wonderful.
Wonderful.
How did it go?
Surprisingly well.
We went out for drinks, and he introduced me to the Moscow Mule.
It's a delightful cocktail.
Sounds like you had a nice time.
Yes, I did.
I think you may actually know him.
Do I?
Yes, it's Richard Caldwell, the therapist in the office next door.
You went out for a drink with Dr. Caldwell?

Don't knock it till you try it.
You know, it can be mind-blowing for both of us.
Actually, you know what?
I have tried it.
- What?
- With my ex-husband.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
You know, when you've been married long enough, you try everything out of pure boredom.
Do you know what I'm talking about here?
Josh, your generation didn't invent anal sex.
You just invented talking about it all the time.
- Forget it.
- Oh, sorry.
It's just not my thing.
Is it really that big of a deal?
No, I...
I just feel like I can't compete with all the years you were married.
You know, nothing we do is ever gonna be new for you.
That's not true.
Come on.
I think it is.
I'm never gonna be your first time for anything.
Good morning.
Coffee's ready.
Scrambled okay?
Yes, that would be nice.
I can't believe I slept so late, but then I remembered that we had quite a workout.
Yes, we did.
So I just heard from the landlord of my building.
- They're evicting me.
- What?
Yes, that passive-aggressive prick also known as your therapist blew the whistle on me about sleeping in my office.
Richard, I'm so sorry.
I feel so responsible.
You have absolutely zero culpability.
- These were my choices.
- Thank you.
I was wondering though if you wouldn't mind if I stayed here for a few days, just until I find another place.
Uh, well, I don't know.
We just met, so...
I completely understand.
I'll be out of your hair this morning.
Thank you.
You know what I love to do over breakfast?
Talk about dreams, while they're still fresh.
You want me to tell you my dreams?
Indulge me?
All right, let's see.
Oh, I was on a stage shopping for a couch...
oh, but for my old apartment...
And somehow it was raining.
Oh, oh, and I was also in the audience watching myself.
Wow, so much to unpack here.

Hey, how was your weekend in Fire Island?
Well, I missed the ferry to Cherry Grove.
So I had to get off at the Pines.
What a nightmare.
Why?
Well, Cherry Grove is the girls' side of the island.
The Pines is the boys' side.
Oh, so you got off at the Pines dressed as a man.
That must have been interesting.
You have no idea.
I had to trek through the meat rack to get home.
- The meat rack?
- Use your imagination.
Anyway, this a horny guy started to follow me, so I had to rip my shirt off to scare him away.
Oh, yeah, I guess the last thing anybody wants to see is a rack in the rack.
So how was your night with Josh?
Well, it started with a massage and ended with me leaving.
What happened?
Did you have a fight?
Yeah.
I mean, on the surface, it was about sex, but really it was about Josh having a hard time with the idea that I've had this whole life before him.
Mm, I mean, the sex I can work with, but the fact that you've had a life before you met him is just something that he's gonna have to deal with.
Yeah, I think I know what I need to do.
Hey, you are not going to believe this, but EW online just ran an article on Millennial, and included a big excerpt from Colin's book.

You created this monster, Kels.

For any gladiator who steps onto the battleground, there is no greater achievement than the Rodarus.
This wooden sword... is given only to gladiators whose abilities transcend the battleground.
Whose victories defy description.
Those who have proven themselves superior to all others... in the eyes of the people, their Emperor, and the Gods.
Narcissus is such a gladiator.
Undefeated on the battleground.
Both feared and revered by his opponents.
He has more than earned this sword.
And with it, his freedom.
Commodus has honored the man who trained him in the arena, marking the opening of the greatest celebration of games since the dedication of the Coliseum.
Commodus!
Commodus!
12 years after claiming the throne,
Commodus is prepared to put his life on the line, to restore glory to his city,
and win the respect of his people.
I think if we'd attended the games, we would be amazed at the glamour of the event.
We would be overwhelmed by the noise of the crowd.
We'd have been stunned by the gladiators and their shiny armor.
And we'd have been horrorstruck at the ferocity of the fighting itself that goes on in the arena.
Spanning 14 days, the Emperor's games feature hundreds of exotic animals for live hunting,
prisoners and slaves for executions, with lavish gifts and prizes for those in attendance.
With a full coliseum, the games will be unlike any celebration in the history of Rome.
Emperor Commodus!
Senators... welcome to the games.
Please, honor your host.
For a crowd of more than 50,000 people...
May the Gods be with you.
May the Gods be with you.
...the Emperor will fight as a gladiator.
May the Gods be with you.
Senator.
May the Gods be with you.
Precious jewels and fine robes won't save him now.
May the Gods be with you.
May the Gods be with you.
Senator Dio.
May the Gods protect you, Commodus.
People of Rome!
Let the games begin!
But while the Roman people hail their ruler, members of the Senate fear the Emperor's bold move would be his last.
For Commodus, fighting as a gladiator will solidify his popularity and secure his legacy as Emperor.
But becoming a gladiator is just the first step in a much bigger plan, one that will make him a legend.
In Roman society,
Hercules is celebrated for slaying a mythical lion and wearing the animal's hide for protection.
For his games,
Commodus is certain if he can embody the Roman god, he too will be invincible... and be forever honored by the Roman people.
The Emperor Commodus portrays himself as the god Hercules, a great fighter and a great hunter.
What he's trying to do when he appears in the games dressed as Hercules, is underline to people that when he fights as a gladiator, he is as skilled a fighter as the god Hercules was.
All hail Commodus, Emperor of Rome!
For the first time, an emperor has claimed victory as a gladiator in the Roman Coliseum.
And in front of thousands,
Commodus wins the recognition and validation he's always wanted.
Commodus!
Commodus!
Commodus!
Commodus!
After his triumph in the arena,
Commodus believes he's proven himself the supreme ruler of the Roman people.
And with a new vision for the Empire, he orders a meeting of the Senate.
Senators...
I called you here tonight to share some important news with you.
That I am... in fact... alive.
When I first declared my intention to step on to the battleground and prove my worth as a gladiator,
many of you thought, "He must be mad."
While most of you assumed...
"He'll surely be killed."
But as all of you witnessed today, and the blood on my sword confirms,
it is my opponent who no longer walks among us.
And now,
I stand here before you, not only victor in the Coliseum, but right here in this building.
Because when 50,000 voices unite as one, everyone can hear it.
Even a body as old, and outdated, as the Senate.
The people's voice is strong.
Oh, and it is true.
Theirs is the voice that guides me, not those of bickering, backstabbing, self-serving parasites.
Men whose day was done when Caesar took the throne.
Clinging to power that died with the Republic, and praying for... or plotting... my death.
But the only thing that's dead is the lie that Rome needs you.
So on the first day of the new year,
I proclaim there will be a new Rome.
A Rome cast in my image.
- This is outrageous!
- I am the Emperor!
If you doubt me, then you weren't listening.
The people's voice was clear.
They have made their choice... and it is...
Commodus.
Commodus.
Commodus.
Commodus!
Commodus!
Commodus!
Commodus!
Commodus!
Commodus!
Great day to be alive, Senator.
Commodus seems to have acted increasingly dictatorially.
He seems to ignore those around him, and he himself becomes more and more a megalomaniac.
Was he alone in this?
Had no other Emperors done that?
Well, sadly, no.
Other Emperors, whether it was Caligula or Nero, had similar character traits.
By rejecting the authority of the Senate,
Commodus has established total control of the Empire, and begins to transform the city in his image.
With imperial orders, the Emperor commissions massive golden statues
and renames the months of the year after himself.
And in a show of ultimate authority, nearly 1,000 years after the founding of Rome,
Commodus gives the city a new name:
Colonia Commodiana.
Being Emperor wasn't just simply about fulfilling duties, it wasn't just simply about going to work on a day-to-day basis.
An emperor was who you were at the absolute root of your person.
And everyone and everything in Roman society is aimed at expressing how great the Emperor is.
Of course, that's going to affect you.
It'd be impossible that that wouldn't, in some way, begin to affect the way that you saw yourself.
As the games continue, the Emperor's show of strength begins to escalate.
Commodus wanted to appear as a gladiator.
He was... taken by the notion of his own strength and power.
And he may actually have believed that he was displaying... superhuman, extra-human power and skill.
Commodus!
Commodus!
Commodus!
Hard to watch.
But while the Roman people cheer for their Emperor, what they don't realize, is that before stepping into the arena,
Commodus has made certain that his victories are guaranteed.
When Commodus appears as a gladiator, he makes sure that he's not going to come to any harm.
He made sure that his opponents fought with dulled blades.
And after a few exchanges of blows, the other gladiator quickly fell to the floor understanding what was best for him.
I will endure to be burned, to be bound, to be beaten,
to be killed by the sword.
No more worry in your eyes.
Now that this is done.
Commodus!
Commodus!
Listen to them.
They're still calling your name.
If I could give them 14 more days, I would.
And you wouldn't have to worry, because I cannot be defeated.
So it would seem.
Narcissus.
Sorry, Emperor, I didn't mean to startle you.
You of all people should know better than to sneak up on a gladiator, especially one with the blood of his vanquished opponent still fresh on his blade.
It was a good battle.
Attilius fought valiantly.
Indeed he did.
They all did.
It seems you trained me too well, my friend.
Did I train you to do this?
You have something to say, Narcissus, you should say it.
I just watched you kill... my brothers.
Men who stepped onto the battlefield and fought with honor.
And they died with it.
Holding dulled blades.
Is that not a good enough reason to spare their lives?
I gave the people what they want.
They want to see defenseless men slaughtered--
Slaves!
They were slaves.
Slaves I gave the honor of dying by my sword.
The honor to sacrifice themselves for the glory of my Empire.
The honor to achieve immortality.
So it's only because I stand before you a freedman that you are not bringing your sword down upon me?
With only my dulled blade to protect myself?
My friend?
Pick it up.
-I said pick it up.
-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Emperor.
-Get it out of my sight.
-I'm sorry.
Commodus...
Silence!
Don't you look at me that way.
Get out.
Now!
All of you!
Out, now!
Out!
Commodus knows that if his deceit is revealed, he'll lose the trust of the people and the recognition he believes he's earned.
So he marks anyone who knows of his plan for banishment or execution in an official royal document known as a proscription list.
Paranoia was not entirely uncharacteristic of the Roman Emperors, and Commodus lived in his own little world of paranoia.
He supposed everybody was plotting against him and they were.
All of them.
I did as the Emperor ordered.
And now that it has been revealed, he cannot risk that the people find out.
What can we do?
You were wise to come here first.
But you cannot stay here.
You must return to the palace.
No.
You must return to the palace.
Tell him that you don't care what he did, that you love him no matter what, and that's why you've come back.
To prove your love.
- Poison?
- For his wine.
-There has to be another way.
-This is your only hope.
Or would you rather wait here for the Praetorian Guards?
The people closest to him that ran his life lost confidence in their own physical security, and thought the only solution is going to be to get rid of Commodus.
Because what else could they do in order to avoid being put to death themselves?
For centuries, poison has been used as a lethal weapon in the ancient world.
As toxic elements found in common plants and venom from insects and snakes can be easily disguised,
effectively killing the victim without a trace.
Throughout Roman history, poison does seem to be a more insidious form of assassination plot.
You know, it's not that you're being, you know, killed in this martial way, or threatened in this martial way it's that perhaps the people that are most intimately involved in your life,
can you really trust them?
Commodus.
What are you doing here?
Get out.
You get out!
Commodus.
I need some water.
Marcia.
What happened?
-What happened?
-He's throwing it up.
I found this.
Well, then...
We must go to Dio.
You go.
Of course.
A proscription list.
It includes her name, mine, Narcissus...
And me.
It's almost the entire Senate.
As madness gives way to vengeance.
Come with me.
-Senator, what am I--
-Listen to me very closely.
You must take this sword to Narcissus.
We have no time to lose.
Marcia...
I spare your life... and you sentence me to death.
The only way out... is through me.
The only way you live... is to kill me... with your dulled blade.
I...
I gave you your freedom.
I earned my freedom!
You...
-You had everything just handed to you.
-I have--
You have nothing!
Nothing!
You have no compassion, you have no courage.
And you have no honor.
The assassination of Commodus marks the end of an era, and the dawn of widespread turmoil throughout the Empire.
For the next year, Rome is consumed by civil war and those who plotted against the Emperor are soon punished.
Responsible for the Emperor's death, Narcissus, a celebrated gladiator and the man who trained Commodus to fight in the arena is executed.
And within a year, Marcia, one of the most powerful women in the Empire, and the one person Commodus truly trusted,
is sentenced to death by the new reigning Emperor.
But Cassius Dio survives.
The ambitious Senator, who once fought to protect Commodus, will go on to write one of the only surviving accounts of this time in the Roman Empire.
In the 13 years of his reign,
Commodus brought peace to Rome.
But he will come to be known... as the man responsible for an unprecedented age of chaos,
betrayal, and the beginning of the fall of the greatest empire ever known.
Narcissus!
Narcissus!
Narcissus!
Narcissus!
Narcissus!
Narcissus!
Narcissus!
People of Rome!
For any gladiator who steps onto the battleground, there is no greater achievement than the Rodarus.
This wooden sword... is given only to gladiators whose abilities transcend the battleground.
Whose victories defy description.
Those who have proven themselves superior to all others... in the eyes of the people, their Emperor, and the Gods.
Narcissus is such a gladiator.
Undefeated on the battleground.
Both feared and revered by his opponents.
He has more than earned this sword.
And with it, his freedom.
Commodus has honored the man who trained him in the arena, marking the opening of the greatest celebration of games since the dedication of the Coliseum.
Commodus!
Commodus! 12 years after claiming the throne,
Commodus is prepared to put his life on the line, to restore glory to his city,
and win the respect of his people.
I think if we'd attended the games, we would be amazed at the glamour of the event.
We would be overwhelmed by the noise of the crowd.
We'd have been stunned by the gladiators and their shiny armor.
And we'd have been horrorstruck at the ferocity of the fighting itself that goes on in the arena.
Spanning 14 days, the Emperor's games feature hundreds of exotic animals for live hunting,
prisoners and slaves for executions, with lavish gifts and prizes for those in attendance.
With a full coliseum, the games will be unlike any celebration in the history of Rome.
Emperor Commodus! Senators... welcome to the games.
Please, honor your host.
For a crowd of more than 50,000 people...
May the Gods be with you.
May the Gods be with you.
...the Emperor will fight as a gladiator.
May the Gods be with you.
Senator.
May the Gods be with you.
Precious jewels and fine robes won't save him now.
May the Gods be with you.
May the Gods be with you.
Senator Dio.
May the Gods protect you, Commodus.

He seems to ignore those around him, and he himself becomes more and more a megalomaniac.

The pleasure gardens of Milliarcha V made it the Jewel of the inner rim for over five centuries.
It took nearly 48 hours for everything to change.
A great alien evil had enslaved the once peaceful planet.
For the high council, there was only one option.
Vanguard, the infamous mercenary was dispatched to face the entity responsible, the Kragon, the Duke of Raggidi, the butcher of Barsa, destroyer of worlds.
Vanguard's orders were simple.
Eliminate.
Time for school.
I know.
He crashed hard.
Vanguard nearly broke the slave girl's fall.
She was straddling him now.
Face to face.
Seems I didn't leave this world early enough.
The air is still breathable.
Just the same.
Neither gained much ground.
They were almost evenly matched.
We are almost evenly matched.
Almost?
I was weaned on the psychedelic gasses of Raggidi prime.
I see their effect on humans is not unusual.
It would be a shame to waste so worthy an adversary.
The Raggidi also find the gas to have a pleasing effect.
Vanguard peered into the evil lord's eyes, then back to the slave girl.
Then those eyes.
Then the girl.
Then the eyes.
And then the girl.
Then the...
It all happened so fast.
A flash of bodies, limbs, flesh pressing together.
Their hunger knew no bounds.
Suddenly all the atrocities, the murderous tyrant had ever committed were nothing more than an afterthought.
Lust was the only thing on vanguard's mind.
Lust was all that mattered now.
- A toast.
It's my good fortune to have a good fortune.
And I bring it all to you, most honorable heads of houses, Prentiss and Hollycotton.
And of course, your highly eligible daughters, one of whom I soon intend to wed.
- He knew it was wrong.
-
-Cheers.
But why did it feel so right?
In the throes of passion, vanguard was quickly reminded of the debacle at the high council.
And with it, his previous conquest.
- What's that?
- Nothing.
If it's nothing, why do you care?
It wouldn't even make sense.
Really?
Are you saying I'm dumb?
No, there's just...
There's no context.
Neil, is that a diary?
I don't know.
Neil won't let me see it.
- Let me see that.
- Hey!
Senator Zaxa approached vanguard, his eyes set on the soldier of fortune's engorged...
Pelvic region?
Mother of fuck!
We should burn it.
We don't burn books, Jessie.
Fucking disgusting.
Many taxonomic groups don't actually have separate sexes, so hermaphroditism is a normal thing.
Now what Edward is handing out represents the sequential hermaphrodite.
In this case, the slipper snail.
It begins its life as a male.
But if the female population dwindles, then the largest male in the group will spontaneously switch genders.
I will pull your face off.
Oh, I'm shaking.
All right.
Stand.
- You wrote this?
- Fuck no.
Julia, out.
Now.
Okay, who's the budding d.H. Lawrence here?
Mr. Shafer.
Let's chat after class.
Where's mom?
She's at her book club thingy.
What book are they reading?
- What?
-At mom's book club, what book?
Are you autistic?
Who cares?
Dad doesn't want to think about her stupid book club.
- She's exploring interests.
- Fuck that.
Maybe she's with an attorney.
Your mother is not with an attorney.
We're just figuring stuff out, okay?
- Like how to get divorced?
-
-Uh!
What do you even know about divorce in the first place?
You wanna start some shit?
- Whoa, what is that?
- Neil got caught with porno and now he has to see a counselor.
Porno?
Like porno porno?
I didn't have porno, idiot.
Really?
Because, oh, it says right here...
Lemme...
lemme see that.
Oh, Jesus.
I knew it was a bad idea to go there alone.
But my tire was low, and I couldn't make it back.
The gas station was closed and the lights were off, but the air compressor still took my change.
As I pumped new life into the flaccid tire,
I heard a voice behind me.
He was older, probably in his 40s, by the sound of him.
But I didn't dare turn around to check.
He pressed the pistol hard against my lower back.
Pushing, pushing it through my sweater until it bruised my flesh.
He told me to get down on all fours,
- like a dog.
-Thank you, Julia, that is enough.
- I'm not finished.
- Oh, you're finished.
- Have a seat.
- I have three pages left.
This wasn't the assignment.
Well, you assigned a confessional.
This didn't happen to you.
- How do you know?
- Come on.
What?
It could have.
- Not likely.
Mr. snow, this is a narrative writing class and I wrote a narrative.
It is not your place to condemn my subject.
But it absolutely is my place to condemn inappropriate material.
How the hell can you call this inappropriate?
You're not even qualified to judge.
You're a man.
So are you.
All right, okay, we're done here.
I need to see the principal.
Are you going to get him?
Sign in and sit down.
Eww.
Pohl?
Is that "starchild?"
Yeah.
Pohl's only halfway okay when he collaborates with other writers.
Did you ever read "the space merchants?"
Mm-hmm.
It's pretty good.
I think this one kinda sucks though.
I have something for you.
I didn't know you wrote.
Oh, i... this...
- I didn't mean for...
- I liked it.
Are you in trouble?
Yeah, I have to see a counselor.
Yeah, well, I'm here for enacting my first amendment rights.
I wrote an erotic fable.
Well, it was more of a parable.
It's a bit more grounded than yours, but...
You get the idea.
What?
Do you write other stories, like, um...
Like erotic literature?
Mm-hmm.
All the time.
- It's all online.
- Really?
Where?
A riddle.
Eat me, drink me.
Well, good luck, young JUVIE.
Wait, you're leaving?
Where are they?
I don't think you're supposed to smoke.
My mom smoked when she was pregnant with me.
I don't think that's...
It's not like a myth.
It's a circulation thing.
No, it's fine.
We get it, shit ass!
All right, where to?
The mall!
His was the way of the warrior.
Crass.
Uneducated.
But strong.
His abilities would prove useless in the enchanted forest.
Where the ancient inhabitants dwelled and recesses of one's own mind.
The hunter pushed forth unaware fain had been watching him from the moment he entered.
Neil!
It's Neil, right?
Are you watching me?
No.
Well, yeah.
No, i...
I was just curious.
- About?
-What we talked about the other day.
We talked the other day?
Sorry.
Neil.
God, come back.
I'm fucking with you.
- Um.
- It's cool.
I write slash, too.
Yeah, I know.
I read your stuff.
All of it.
Your fan fic is amazing.
I see you got my code.
I do like what you did with the forest guard in "midnight come lately."
They're really under utilized in canon.
Yeah, they're conceptually awesome, but I feel like nobody gets it.
It's like they're begging us to fix 'em.
You're doing what they wished they could do if they didn't have to answer to the publisher.
Yeah, exactly.
Mainstream success is for chumps.
You know, like, the wood spirit, and pagan gods and ritual magic?
It's really...
Sexual?
Yeah.
It's so rich.
Organized religion just totally nut clipped everything that was great about traditional fertility rituals.
I mean, that's the only part about fame that I even give a shit about.
It's just a jumping off point.
It's funny that they think it's kid's stuff, but, like, there's all this subtext.
I know.
I bet we're the only two kids in this entire joint that know about what we know about.
It's kind of special.
You wanna ditch?
School?
No, I mean, you wanna dig a ditch?
- Let's go.
- Oh, i...
I can't
I have a test in social studies next period.
It's on the Incas.
Well, it's not like a midterm or anything, so um yeah.
I let Martine take my car to work, so we have to walk.
But it's just the mall.
Martine's crazy.
I mean, she's pretty much best friend, she's just sort of a bitch.
Is that... is that the pregnant girl?
"At frontier's rim?"
I hate these things.
They never get the book right.
Well, I guess I'm lucky that fain hasn't made the leap to the big screen yet.
Just it pisses me off that whenever I see vanguard in my head
- that guy...
-Well, he's not your character.
I mean, that's why it's called fan fic.
- Yeah, but.
- You seen it yet?
Like five times.
God damn it.
She's not getting off work until like 6.
Okay, I don't have anything better to do.
Will it be...
Smell like...
Will my parents be able to tell?
You don't have to.
It's cool.
No, I mean, I want to, but...
Thank you.
Uh!
Shut your door.
- Put your seat down.
- Why?
What, are you ashamed to be seen with me?
I don't know.
I just...
I don't want to get into it.
There's too much backstory.
Mike Holloway drove his truck through my mom's marigolds when I was ten.
Then he gave her the finger.
I am so stoned.
Heads up, knob-goblin!
Uh!
Hey, wake up!
Let's go.
Move.
Move to the back.
Move it!
- Go to the back.
- Okay.
Ow!
I'm pregnant, bitch!
You know, your arm's not pregnant, moron.
Jesus, I thought that was Mike.
You're really tearing through them these days.
Are you kidding me?
Hi.
I just don't get what you guys are doing for an hour and a half in the parking lot.
Were you like blowing each other?
We were talking about writing.
Whoa!
Wait, you write that shit, too?
I should have known.
Who do you have fucking?
Harry Potter?
Thomas the train engine?
I just gotta know whose fictional dick is going in whose made-up mouth.
You can't even read.
Yeah, I can read.
I read all the time.
I read actual books for adults.
- Not baby books.
- Okay, name one.
"Wuthering heights," ass blood.
- The Bronte sisters wrote fan fic.
- What?
The Bronte sisters.
Emily Bronte, of "Wuthering heights," wrote erotic fan fiction.
They're like pioneers.
Wow.
It's really good Mike isn't here to find out that you're still such a fucking geeeeeek!
Dude, you know weed stays in your system for like two weeks.
On your clothes, on your jacket.
Leave him alone.
Hey, tomorrow, 2:00.
Let's meet in the courtyard.
We can drive around.
Bye.
Belzac and Deron Zaxa had been fighting for hours.
Sweat tinged the air of the war chamber.
That was the first thing vanguard noticed as he entered.
The bulge in his leather pants jumped to attention...
Erect member out of...
Suddenly, Belzac reentered...
His mouth, usually only engaged in ordering soldiers to their deaths, now found its true purpose.
We will not stand for this.
If the trade union continues to block us at every turn...
Block you?
Block you.
Your armada destroyed the last...
- twelve.
-Twelve shipments of illinium
- sent to Parak Menom.
- Only 12?
Now 13.
It's an embargo.
A legal embargo.
Odd definition of the word legal.
- Actually... -oh, so that's why you brought your...
Muscle?
You have nothing to fear from us, Deron Zaxa.
You or your muscle.
I will not be mocked aboard my own ship.
Hired ship.
It's his freighter.
What do I pay you for?
Move!
Whatever he pays you, we'll double it.
Allow us to show you what we'll pay you for.
I don't have all day.
Yes, sir, very busy.
You have a lunch at... 1300.
Christ!
God!
Zaxa's hand reached down...
Down to his zipper.
The ambient humidity in the room reached a level that set off the climate klaxon.
But Zaxa couldn't...
Or wouldn't... stop.
Hey, Neil.
God I sucked today.
You were really good.
That accent is, it's out of control.
I think it's funny when you do it like that.
It's supposed to be a comedy, right?
Yeah, I suppose you're right.
See, that's why I like you, man.
You always make me feel better.
So you get like touched inappropriately by the doctor?
No, he just puts goo all over your belly.
- It's not a big deal.
- Yeah.
You have no clue how big a speculum is.
It's like three adult dicks glued together.
Sounds like me though.
Hey, snoop dog!
Come here!
- Well, who's this?
- Julia's new boyfriend.
- Jealous?
- For real?
What's up, bro?
I'm Mike.
Ow.
I'm Neil.
- Well, I guess I owe you one, Neil.
- You do?
Yeah, for taking little miss elf quest off my hands.
She has been up my hole like 24-7.
Hey, fetus.
So long, kiddies, let's ride around.
Better not leak on my seats, Martine.
I don't leak.
It all stays in me.
For like another two months.
Gross.
Hey, I wanna tell you about something.
There's a con in Houston coming up.
Like a comic con?
Yes, like a comic con.
A big one.
The rabbit's hole is hosting a private mixer.
- It's invite only.
- Oh, yeah.
- I think I heard of that.
- Well, I got invited.
Really?
Cool.
Yeah, there's a live read, too.
I mean, that's only for rock stars, so, I don't wanna be presumptuous or whatever, but I think they might ask me.
You can still get invited.
You just need to upload your damn work.
Yeah, but... don't you have to be 18?
You're joking, right?
I don't even know if my stuff is...
- I don't know!
- Come on, it's good.
You barely even read any.
Well, it's gotta be good.
I mean, you're so repressed.
That shit has gotta come out somehow.
Drop us off at Neil's house!
Oh, man, I thought you were joking.
Exactly how I imagined it.
I guess it's pretty drab.
My mom's been kind of away.
Moment of truth.
Crack her open.
Julia, I didn't really mean for these to be seen by anybody.
Yes, you did.
Otherwise you wouldn't have written them.
I can't watch.
- I thought you couldn't watch.
- Sorry.
Oh, my god.
Do these girls actually wear space bikinis?
It's ceremonial.
They were given...
It's not my idea.
Well, I just like that there's actual girls in here.
Wow, you are one twisted fuck.
I love it.
- Ooh, prepare to be analized!
- It's not a toy.
It's not a toy.
That's so weird.
- It looks like a toy.
- You're gonna break it.
- That's crazy.
- Whoa!
Say your space prayers, sucka.
Am I interrupting?
Don't you knock?
Um, dad is working late.
There's food in the fridge.
Where are you going?
Oh, my band has a show.
What's your band?
Dance or die.
It sounds awesome.
Yeah, well, it's pretty stupid.
I bet you're really good.
- Just get out!
- All right.
I'm off.
I have to pick up Tim.
It smells like sweat in here.
What was that?
I'm bisexual, just so you know.
Eww, she's not even gay.
All women are bisexual.
All of them.
My first blog, clitora majora, is all about it.
- So, you ready?
- No.
For what?
It's time to upload.
I don't think I'm ready.
Dude, they only send invites to writers who post.
And besides, writers, real writers, let people read their shit.
And your shit is good.
I mean, it's not as good as mine, but traditionally boys don't write very good erotica.
- So, by those standards...
- Okay, fine.
Just, stop talking.
Really?
Oh, my god.
What are you like the one person on the entire Internet that doesn't lie about their age?
- Are you a Mennonite?
- No.
I just, I don't want to misrepresent myself.
Okay.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that this is not about misrepresenting yourself.
You don't want to do this because once you do, you're one of us.
It's the final line.
The last taboo.
Well, there's no turning back, Van fan.
It's in god's hands now.
What?
Can we just turn comments off?
No, dude, it's part of the public record now.
You're killing me.
Let's talk about something else.
Literally anything else.
I like the way you eat.
Neil, when we were horsing around, did you get a boner?
- Like a little bit of a boner?
- No!
Okay.
It's cool if you did.
I thought that you were...
What?
Nothing.
It's cool if you popped a chub.
God, shut up.
- Yo.
- Where's Martine?
I don't know.
At the abortion clinic with her mom.
Wanna grab some food?
We can go to footlongers and get some subs.
Watch "celebrity apprentice" at my place.
And by your place you mean your mom's basement?
Yeah, whatever.
I got weed.
You wanna come?
Whoa!
What the fuck do you think I look like?
A fucking full service food court?
No, that's okay.
I've got math homework.
See, he's got math homework.
He's got a future.
Fuck you.
Neil, really great work today.
I have you nymph.
The hot breath is his voice in her elongated, elfin ear.
The ear that to nymph kind, seconded as a highly erogenous zone.
Fain was lost unto herself.
His name now known to her.
Michael.
Sir Michael.
My sweet Michael.
All right, so nicklepenny comes through the door minus his pants.
Hollycotton is surprised and crosses to l-6.
Mr. nicklepenny!
- I thought you were...
- Across the hall?
This mansion is still quite a mystery to me.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
That's too much.
Reverse.
No, no, that's not right either.
Look, I have a test in 30 minutes, and I'm not going to fail because of your slow ass.
And how long did we wait for you to get off-book?
Fuck you!
I have dyslexia.
Miss Lewis, this is a tech rehearsal and I can't put up with her anymore.
I take dyslexia medication.
Jessie, take a break.
Neil, hey.
Neil!
Huh?
Could you be so kind as to relieve miss hunt for a moment?
I can't put up with her...
Can you imagine having to deal with her parents?
So, Jessie tells me you're a writer.
You really freaked her out.
- Oh, I didn't mean to.
- Dude, that needed to happen.
This place could use some subversion.
Yeah, um, in AP English, we got to read Oscar Wilde...
- so you gonna let me read it?
- Oh.
Okay, let's take it from the double entendre.
It seems that Horace has mistakenly taken my clothes.
Thankfully not all of them.
Yes, thankfully.
Oh... it's cotton.
Cotton's a very versatile fabric, don't you think?
Extremely pliable to a man's touch.
What appears course, now in my hands is so very, very soft.
Oh, my god.
Oh, listen to this, "Deron Zaxa, ever the orator, put his mouth to quite a different purpose now."
Dude, this Deron Zaxa guy is you straight up.
- Neil.
-You do know he's straight, right?
Thanks.
You're gonna have to drive my car.
Are you crying?
No.
I'm pretty sure you're crying.
Never drink vodka from a plastic jug with a handle.
Okay.
Mike Holloway is pure dick cheese.
Neil, I have something important to tell you.
Something I've been thinking about for a while.
I think you use too much flowery prose.
What?
You say things like, "he stroked his velvet rod,"
when you should be like, "he pumped his stone cock."
Readers respond better to direct language.
Thanks.
I can impart the wisdom of our one year age difference, you know?
Um, your mom has a lot of religious stuff.
Yeah, I think that's why my dad killed himself.
He was gay, you know.
My dad, he kept it to himself.
I guess he preferred death to coming out.
Man, do you really think being gay killed him?
I don't wanna be here when my mom gets home.
What?
Mom's home.
Stay here.
I...
I had to print something for work.
You know we've always supported your interests.
And the Internet is, wow, an incredible tool.
- We don't have to do this.
-I think what we're trying to say is just 'cause information is out there, doesn't mean it's accurate.
We just don't want you getting particular information, you know,
- from the wrong sources.
- I'm 15.
Hey, you can read whatever you want.
We're fine with that.
As long as you're reading.
Uh-huh, as long as it's not "mein Kampf."
But actually, well, "mein Kampf" is actually a pretty interesting read.
Honey, I don't want you to feel awkward about this.
If you want to read intelligent prose on human sexuality
I can make you a reading list.
Eww!
No!
What do you mean intelligent?
Well, it's just whoever wrote that story on your computer, they obviously don't have the first clue about actual human relationships.
It's demented.
I don't think your mother's talking about
- the homosexual content, not particularly.
- Please stop.
It's just more of a basic plotting problem.
You're absorbing material that has some rudimentary grammatical errors in it.
You've got sentence fragments, you've got dangling participles.
I actually have been helping Neil with his writing.
- Huh.
-He's got a lot of innate talent.
He just uses too much flowery prose.
There's no flowery prose!
Neil tells me you two are considering a split?
- What?
- I'm sorry.
I just thought I could provide some insight, since my parents are divorced.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Open and honest dialog is key to maintaining a stable relationship.
- Is it now?
- Totally.
I write about it all the time.
That and be honest about one's own sexual desires.
- It's rare that anyone ever is.
- Huh.
I edit a lit journal on women's studies.
I plan to pursue that in college.
- Women's studies?
- Yeah, female sexuality in literature, specifically.
Reverse gender roles in pop culture, sexual submissive hierarchy, rape paradigms.
I actually wrote a 22 page thesis on the concept of venereal disease as a female guilt trigger.
It's no big deal.
I did a paper on monotremes, remember?
Are monotremes a form of VD?
Don't be embarrassed, Neil.
It's natural.
Yeah, Neil, don't be embarrassed.
It's natural.
- Do you ever read any online...
- dad!
- I actually write online - poetry.
Online poetry.
Lady poetry.
- About strong women.
- Lady poetry?
You really need to bring friend around more often.
Did Neil tell you guys about the convention?
- The comic con?
- It's also for writers.
Neil, you didn't mention that.
It's for regular writers!
- Is that true?
- Define regular.
I think she means non-erotic.
Are you guys crazy?
What makes you think
I would go to an erotic writing convention?
I don't know!
Why would you have it on your computer?
I mean, do they have that...
What was the name?
- Uh...
Vang...
- Vanguard erotica.
- Please stop saying "erotica" at the dinner table.
-No, please don't.
I just need to know if you're going to a place for adults.
Yeah, mom has a strict no sex dungeon policy.
I'm not.
We're not!
You don't have to lie to me, you know.
Your mom is not as square as you think.
I even went to a key party once.
When did you go to a key party?
I'm not lying.
Good.
Good.
So speaking of writing, how much do you guys know about the Bronte sisters?
I'm sorry about that.
You know what, no, Neil, you have to get past this repression.
Yeah, well, why don't I come by and give a lecture on the sexual fantasies of Emily Bronte to your mom.
Your parents are cool.
You're lucky.
Our situations are so different.
- You told me that your dad killed himself.
-He did.
"Oh, hey, Neil's parents, why don't you let me give you some insight because my parents are divorced."
- You don't get it.
- Yeah, I don't.
What?
Well, I'm picking you up tomorrow at 9 am, so be ready.
- Some dinner, huh?
- Sorry.
Hey, I like her.
She's a character.
Well, lemme guess.
I can't go now?
Dad.
I'm good.
Take it.
Take it.
Do you remember when I used to take you to those autograph conventions?
Yeah.
Remember when you stood in line for two hours to try to get butch Patrick to sign your munsters lunch box?
And then he wouldn't.
Butch Patrick was a dick.
All right, as far as your mom knows, you're staying at your cousin's, all right?
And I'm counting on you to do the right thing.
At least not to do, not to do the wrong thing.
She's more mature than you.
Huh?
In some ways?
I mean, maybe mature is not the right word.
Dad.
You really like this girl, don't you?
I liked the same type.
When I was your age I did.
But be careful, huh?
These arty girls...
I don't wanna see you get hurt, okay?
All right, good talk, right?
All right, I'll see you later.
Hola!
Neil, your friends are multiplying.
Is that a pregnant joke?
This shit is getting super old.
We're not letting her do this again.
You can say whatever you want about me, but I'm not a fucking flake.
- What happened?
- Mike happened.
Fucking douchebag.
It's a good thing I went by there.
- She's not gonna go?
- Oh, she's going.
I mean, look at you.
Look at what you do to yourself for her, dumb ass.
That's fine.
I feel kind of responsible for you.
I mean, you're just like her when we first met.
I liked her 'cause she was all smart and funny, and she tried so hard to be my friend.
And she would, like, offer to do my homework and shit.
And I would just make fun of her costumes and stuff.
You know she used to dress like an elf, right?
I don't know.
I didn't think I tried to change her.
I mean I took her out with Mike, and that was it.
I guess he was like the first normal guy to ever take interest in her.
He's normal?
Don't change for her, dude.
Don't let her be your Mike.
- Please be quiet, okay?
My mom's sleeping.
-She here?
- Yes.
- Then what the fuck, dude,
- what is she doing here?
- I don't...
She told Neil she would take him to comic con.
Holy shit.
That's amazing.
Dude.
Oh, ho, dude, please get out.
I need a better look at this.
This coming from a guy in his pajamas.
I'm listen...
I'm not busting your balls.
I promise you.
Just come on.
- I need a fucking picture.
-
-You're such a dick.
I'm not the one making a scene, okay, Martine?
You're the one making a scene right now.
Come on, get up.
Give me a little, give me a little twirly twirl.
Oh, man, I'm not nearly stoned enough for this right now.
Oh!
What the fuck!
Jesus!
- I only wanted a picture, freak.
- You are the freak.
You and your stupid fucking mustache.
Ow.
Yo, bro.
You ever see those um...
You ever see those pictures
I took of her wearing that elf shit?
Well, sometimes all she wore were those little ears.
Yeah, those were my special pics.
Neil!
Get the fuck off!
Oh, Galadriel.
Babe, I knew you were a nerd.
I didn't know you were a fucking retard.
Whoa!
Oh, shit!
Oh!
This is funny.
You're fucking crazy.
You can't be all stoic in that costume.
It looks ridiculous.
Don't worry about me.
I am worried about driving for three hours with a guilt-bot programmed to guilt me to death.
How can you hang out with that guy?
He's like everything you pretend to hate.
What do you mean "pretend?"
Nothing.
Just forget it.
You are acting like a really jealous boyfriend right now.
Well, I'm not your boyfriend.
Yeah, you're not.
Hey, I'm sorry.
Okay, I know...
I know that Mike brings out the worst in me.
You have to admit, it was, like, really cool when you knocked him down.
Fucker.
I have to tell you something.
About the live read.
I know already.
I saw.
It was posted on the forum.
Congrats.
I told you it was good.
- Did they write you?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
They said something about the number of slots.
Politics again.
Politics.
I'm really glad that you transcended all of that.
Yeah.
Welcome to comic con.
What name is your reservation under?
How do you know we're here for comic con?
Emily Bronte.
All right, miss Bronte,
I have you down for a single king?
Oh, can we get two beds?
Unfortunately, we're at capacity.
That's okay.
We'll sleep together.
Swanky.
It's big.
Come here.
Try this out!
I don't wanna mess up my costume.
Did you talk to them yet?
No, do I need to?
You're reading tomorrow.
If it were me, I would be checking up on like the order of the lineup and how much time I have, and how I'm gonna be taped and shit.
Taped?
Why would they tape it?
I don't want to be on tape.
That's normal, okay?
You need to relax.
You're so fucking nuts.
Jesus.
What's with you?
You look like how I look when I'm trying to avoid someone.
Okay, so we have the opening night party tonight.
And then tomorrow we have writer Evals 'til five, then the slash mixer, and then the live read.
Hello!
Person talking to you I.R.L.
Sorry.
Um... i have to go to the bathroom.
You're just going to gawk at your phone somewhere where I can't give you shit about it.
- Fine, I'll leave it.
-No, don't do it for me, dude.
I'm just trying to bust you out of your self-induced social media prison.
You've really opened my eyes.
Throw off the shackles!
Throw 'em off!
Wizards man.
Wand-on-wand action.
That's what the readers want.
It's casting a spell on my wand,
- I'll tell you that.
- Yeah.
But that Harry-Draco genre, that's getting old.
Now what I'm into is that Snape-Dumbledore fic.
Wow, that is literally old.
I didn't realize you were into octogenarians?
Yeah, well, uh, vanguard is no spring chicken.
Easy.
Well, usually.
Hey.
Oh, did you read that story I sent you,
"panty raid at Slytherin"?
Oh, yeah, dude.
I called my mom.
I read it out loud.
Finally.
Come on.
We got business to conduct.
I think I'd rather go look at comics.
Neil, this is toho.
What are you drinking?
I dunno.
Toho?
Uh, hmmm... is blue.
It's blue.
Works for me.
That is a sick vanguard costume you've got there, bro.
Is that from "Kragon's war?"
Anyways, so...
My name is Hagoff Paul and this is a little greeting.
Is that?
Is that LSD?
For the party tonight, playboy.
It's Molly.
Mdma?
- No, no.
- It looks like acid.
It's ecstasy.
Have you ever done that before?
No, but I want to.
That stuff stays in your system forever.
Have you ever heard of an acid flashback?
Look, I don't want to wake up in a year and stab my parents to death with a kitchen knife, okay?
Well, that makes one of us.
What if it ruins the whole weekend?
What if we miss the live reading because we're in the hospital getting our stomach's pumped?
We are going to a party with all sorts of lights and costumes, okay?
- Do you normally go to parties, Neil?
-No.
- Do you like to mingle?
- No.
- Open your mouth, playboy.
- No...
Julia.
There we go.
Oh, whatever you do, don't swallow.
What will happen if I swallow it?
I'm hallucinating!
It's not acid!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold her there.
Off, off, off, off.
- I'm sick.
- Okay.
I'm so stoned.
Stoned on acid.
I mean, Molly...
This must be like every day for Madonna.
Here.
Drink some water.
Oh, okay.
Oh.
You're safe now.
You're in a totally safe place.
What?
I don't know if I've uh...
Ever been attracted to anyone before you.
You mean any girl.
Any human being.
What are you attracted to about me?
I'm not ashamed of myself with you.
Should I have done that?
I don't know if I should have done that.
Pants.
- Are you doing your homework?
- No.
"Julia tugged at his pants, sliding them down ever so slowly."
Okay, if you're gonna write about us, you need to use some modifiers.
"Julia tugged at his tight pants, sliding them off painfully slow.
Savoring the moment the heightened pleasure involved."
I'm glad you decided to branch out.
You're a tough one to figure out.
No, I'm not.
Hi, you've reached Julia's voicemail.
I probably don't want to talk to you.
Hi, you've reached Julia's voicemail.
I probably...
The alliteration is good, but you use it way too much.
Yeah, it's sort of my crutch.
And the allegory is a bit on-the-nose.
Oh, I actually thought it was more of a metaphor than an allegory.
Uh, do you know what an allegory is?
Look, you're okay.
Uh, and you're female.
We need more women in our field.
Most of them are pretty ugly.
Unlike you.
You can have a career.
Writing is more than just writing.
There are other factors.
Dude, I want to show you something.
It's a...
It's a Tijuana Bible.
It's quite the important artifact.
Mexicans are far more sexually liberated.
What's with the look?
You just left this morning.
Yeah, I was getting a critique.
I mean, that's why we're here.
To meet the pros.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
I have to go meet someone.
Who?
Denis?
Sorry, I looked through your phone.
I didn't think that you would care.
Hey... don't!
Don't do that.
- What's your deal?
- Nothing.
Don't get all weird on me just because we messed around.
Why did you rip up our pages?
I don't know.
We were zonked.
We wrote some crazy shit, okay?
I didn't want it just floating around.
So last night was just the drugs?
You have been hiding this Denis guy from me.
I didn't even think that you were straight.
Can you hear me now?
How about now?
I'll check my bars.
That's better.
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is age restricted.
Hi.
Oh, my god, Neil.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I uh...
I didn't expect you to look uh, so young.
- Uh, do you wanna see my ID?
- No, no, no, no.
No, I'm sorry, believe me, I looked young when I was your age, too.
Uh, when I was 18.
- You still look young.
- Oh, well, thank you.
Oh, my god, it's just so great to uh, finally meet you, in the flesh, so to speak, um...
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Oh, yes, of course.
Shall we?
-Yeah.
You're staring.
Virgins stare.
- They do?
-Yeah, well, con virgins.
Yeah, it's just so weird now that it's all in 3-d.
Yeah, I know.
Internet rule 34.
If it exists there's porn of it.
Just when you think you've seen it all.
I just discovered what a curtain fic is.
- Curtain fic?
- Mm-hmm.
I mean, okay, so, this is aimed at older gays.
Of course they're like post-sex, proto-nesting, domestic fetishists.
And so normally where you'd have like kirk and Spock, you know, making love, uh, in this case, it's couples having these like lavish shopping sprees at pottery barn.
For curtains.
They sell curtains at pottery barn?
They sell everything at pottery barn.
I mean, you know, it's mostly harmless I guess, but not all of it is...
And you really need to watch out for creeps, especially at your age.
- But you're not a creep.
- No, I'm not a creep, but isn't that exactly what a creep would say?
Oh, I thought you came alone.
Oh, Jesus, speaking of creepy.
I came with a friend.
Oh, and does he write slash?
She.
And yeah.
You know, actually, I think she's in regular writing today.
Oh, regular writing.
- Denis.
-Oh, Ronnie, hey, um, this is Neil.
- He's one of our new writers.
- Oh, yeah, I bet.
Ronnie Harwood.
I'm senior writer at the rabbit's hole.
So some of the inner circle are gonna go out for an early dinner before the reading.
- Are you game?
- Yeah.
You can bring your new little friend.
Everybody agrees that Batman blowing Robin and Robin blowing Batman is totally played out, but now I'm seeing Christian bale's Batman blowing Ben Affleck as Batman.
Blowing Val Kilmer.
Oh, that's really hot.
I got a cease and desist from Warner's last week, so obviously I'm doing something right.
Yeah, you're moving up in the world.
What kind of slash do you write?
You've been to our website, it's easy enough to find.
Right.
I'm guessing this is your first con, since you're what, he's 18?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, 18.
Hmm.
I was editing the R.P.F. Board today.
I'll never get all the Bieber fic.
Neil, are you into Justin Bieber?
What's R.P.F.?
R.P.F. Is real people fiction or celebrity slash.
Slash about, you know, celebs.
Oh, oh, like the Bronte sisters.
They wrote stories about Napoleon and the Duke of Wellington.
Yeah, I mean, it's pretty old school, but now it's mostly just like pointless boy band orgies.
Yeah, and juvenile regressives are popping up all over.
Speaking of...
How long have you slashed vanguard?
Oh, vanguard is juvenile, but trek and Tolkien, that's...
It's all about audience and intent, Denis.
This is first year stuff.
Vanguard doesn't play to the 40-plus crowd, our base.
Besides, it's not our mission to indoctrinate children.
It's not our mission to indoctrinate anyone.
I read Tolkien when I was eight.
Yes, and Denis loves his vanguard.
Ronnie prefers her masturbation material to stem from bad '60s television.
You ever see "the Brady bunch," dude?
Really, Freddie?
He's a child.
Mainstream success has no bearing on our field.
Never has.
What we do know is juvenile fiction begets juvenile erotica.
Let me be frank.
You write sex like a 12-year-old and I think you know it.
It's like you found all these provocative words and just tossed them into a text editor.
Have you ever even had sex?
I doubt half our writers have had sex.
- Let me see your ID.
- Ronnie.
Well, I don't know about you, Denis, but I don't want to go to jail.
Nobody's going to jail.
Jesus!
Neil, come on.
It's fine.
Sit down.
Yeah, it's fine if he ponies up an ID.
I remember now.
You wrote all that really gross Mike and Greg Brady fic.
What's your point?
I thought you liked sex with 12-year-olds.
If it's written maturely.
Nice.
Are you really 18?
Neil, Neil, come on, stop.
Stop, stop, stop.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Look, Ronnie, I mean, you know, she's like that with everybody.
It's not you.
Oh, um.
Let's go someplace else.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait.
It just...
This doesn't feel right.
Why?
Look, I'm not gonna be mad, I'm not be upset or anything.
I need you to tell me how old you are.
- I already told you.
- I know, I know.
Tell me again.
- 15.
- 15?
Oh, fuck!
I'll be 16 in November.
- Please don't reject me.
- Dude, this is wrong.
I know it is.
This is just the second time today.
- I could go to jail.
- I won't tell anyone.
Did you just tell me you were 18 so you could get into the live reading?
- No!
-What do you even want from me?
I just thought it'd be different.
Here with you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You actually remind me a lot of myself.
- You turned out okay.
- Did I?
I shot off a series of insane messages to somebody I didn't know the first thing about.
I said things I would never say to somebody face to face.
Ever.
You know, outside of like cons,
I have practically zero social skills.
My mother always said it's going to get me in trouble, and now here I am.
And yes, incidentally, I live with my mother, in the house where I grew up, in Saginaw.
So, you know, don't be too sure about things.
You live with your mom?
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
You said this was the second time.
It it someone in our group?
Was it that girl you came here with?
Yeah, well.
I thought you might be straight.
- I might not be.
-Well, this isn't the way to find out.
You have time.
You're writing.
Focus on that.
How can I focus on something
I'm not even old enough to do?
Well, what do you want to do?
You want to be a writer?
A real writer, not fan fic?
You're good.
Keep writing and let the rest of the stuff sort itself out naturally.
I wish somebody had told me that when I was your age.
Well, you better go.
It's about time.
I don't know what the right thing to do here is.
I wanna make sure you're okay.
Well, I know you have to go.
I am the moderator.
I mean, you don't have to worry, I'm not coming.
I can't, not now.
Not right now.
I wish it wasn't this way.
You know, for what it's worth,
I think you want to be queer.
Why would anyone want that?
To fit in, even some place small.
I'll see you around.
You came back?
The live read's about to start.
You should be there.
I came back for you.
You don't get it.
You submitted once and they're like,
"hey, come read it on stage."
I have like 500 things posted up there.
I know.
I've read every one of them.
It's hard caring about someone.
Letting them care about you.
It doesn't have to be hard.
I love you.
I kissed him.
That Denis guy?
I'm not going to the live read.
- You have to.
- I can't.
Neil, please, for both of us.
Fuck those crusty old assholes.
I followed you into the restaurant when you weren't answering my calls.
I'm sorry that lady is such an asshole.
Look, they only win if you let them.
You are a featured fucking story, dude.
You made it!
We're doing this.
You and me together.
I am your goddamn coach.
Okay?
As they entered the nexiverse,
Gandalf, his penis now longer than his staff, tuned... turned to Dumbledore,
"Dumbledore," he said to Dumbledore,
"only the energy of our mutual orgasm, combined with unbroken eye contact can close the door to the nexiverse, thus stopping the combined armies of Sauron and Voldemort.
Without a moment's thought, Dumbledore selflessly gave of his own manhood, placing the head of his pounding penis against that of the wise old wizard from alt middle earth, like in Ghostbusters.
- End of chapter seven.
Okay, that was gan-dum 69 with "hole pluggers of the nexiverse."
And who doesn't like some good old-fashioned wizard-on-wizard action?
One more time for her, gan-dum 69.
Um...
So-uh, I think everybody knows my feelings about what we do and the purpose it serves.
Often we're treated like freaks.
Especially those of us who are a little bit older.
- And uh, still doing this.
Um... and when we're away from this little community that we've created for ourselves, you know, we're outsiders, and we're weirdoes, and we're sexual deviants, but not here.
Our next reader is a young man that I have been following with much interest.
And not just because he writes vanguard.
Please welcome to the stage, Van fan 42.
Um, this is called...
"Shore leave on dreenan four."
"The balmy tropic weather patterns of dreenan four gave cause for the indigenous proxans to wear very little in the way of attire.
This year with the elliptical orbit pulling them closer than ever to dreenan prime, clothing was more a hardship than an option.
Vanguard found himself unarmored on the beaches of the Zaraug during what seemed to be a religious mating ritual.
'Do you happen to know where they keep the towels?
' a lean, naked proxon inquired.
His supple manhood stood proud against the harsh light of dreenan prime.
The proxon boy repeated himself, 'well, do you?
' vanguard's hand now pumped his stone cock."
He's 15.
You're outsiders.
You were supposed to support other outsiders.
I mean, you guys write ninja turtle bondage porn and you're judging?
He just poured out his sad, pathetic heart to you philistines!
And I think it's beautiful.
Let him read.
No.
I may be 15, but you're an asshole.
I'll be 16 in a few months.
All right, everybody, that is my fault.
I'm the one who broke the rules.
Don't blame him.
So you're not...
Mad at me anymore, right?
I'd only be mad if you stopped writing because of this.
Me?
No.
I've got my body armor on.
Hey, I love you, too.
Well, duh.
I gotta tell you something.
I think I may be a lesbian.
The way I figure it...
If I'm lesbian and you're gay, then we can be a gay couple, and it sort of cancels each other out.
Cause I'm more mannish and you're like a girl.
Wait, what...
I'm like a girl?
I'm sorry, Neil.
I'm sorry I said you were gay.
I don't know why I said that.
I don't care what you are.
That's the only thing that I don't care about.
I told them you were 16.
What?
I'm the reason you didn't get into the live read.
It was my fault.
It was down to you and me, and I told them that I was 18, and you were 16.
That editor, Ronnie, loves your writing.
It's not about that.
It never was, so you have to keep writing.
I thought you didn't care about the reading.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
I really do love you.
It's not so crazy they believed you were 18.
You do look older now.
Jesus!
Mom knows you stayed with her.
What?
- Mom's around?
- Mm-hmm.
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.
Dad took a bullet for you.
That girl's mom called.
Did you guys steal her credit card?
I hope you lost your cherry, Neily Bopper.
'Cause from the sound of it, you might not be seeing much of her for a while.
Let me see that.
What, do you think I'm too dumb?
Don't worry, man, she'll come around.
Seasons end, even on Milliarcha v, where nuclear winter was slowly giving way to bright spring.
Vanguard felt it.
And he knew his own season was now at a close.
Be it burial in the cold vacuum of space, or a quaint domestic cabin on the frontier's rim, everyone retires.
Things, people...
Come into your life suddenly, and then are just as suddenly gone.
But their season shapes you.
Makes you dare things you hadn't previously even dreamt.
And for that, and for my friend, this author is happy.
The pleasure gardens of Milliarcha V made it the Jewel of the inner rim for over five centuries.
It took nearly 48 hours for everything to change.
A great alien evil had enslaved the once peaceful planet.
For the high council, there was only one option.
Vanguard, the infamous mercenary was dispatched to face the entity responsible, the Kragon, the Duke of Raggidi, the butcher of Barsa, destroyer of worlds.
Vanguard's orders were simple.
Eliminate.
Time for school.
I know.
He crashed hard.
Vanguard nearly broke the slave girl's fall.
She was straddling him now.
Face to face.
Seems I didn't leave this world early enough.
The air is still breathable.
Just the same.
Neither gained much ground.
They were almost evenly matched.
We are almost evenly matched.
Almost?
I was weaned on the psychedelic gasses of Raggidi prime.
I see their effect on humans is not unusual.
It would be a shame to waste so worthy an adversary.
The Raggidi also find the gas to have a pleasing effect.
Vanguard peered into the evil lord's eyes, then back to the slave girl.
Then those eyes.
Then the girl.
Then the eyes.
And then the girl.
Then the...
It all happened so fast.
A flash of bodies, limbs, flesh pressing together.
Their hunger knew no bounds.
Suddenly all the atrocities, the murderous tyrant had ever committed were nothing more than an afterthought.
Lust was the only thing on vanguard's mind.
Lust was all that mattered now.
- A toast.
It's my good fortune to have a good fortune.
And I bring it all to you, most honorable heads of houses, Prentiss and Hollycotton.
And of course, your highly eligible daughters, one of whom I soon intend to wed.
- He knew it was wrong.
-
-Cheers.
But why did it feel so right?
In the throes of passion, vanguard was quickly reminded of the debacle at the high council.
And with it, his previous conquest.
- What's that?
- Nothing.
If it's nothing, why do you care?
It wouldn't even make sense.
Really?
Are you saying I'm dumb?
No, there's just...
There's no context.
Neil, is that a diary?
I don't know.
Neil won't let me see it.
- Let me see that.
- Hey!
Senator Zaxa approached vanguard, his eyes set on the soldier of fortune's engorged...
Pelvic region?
Mother of fuck!
We should burn it.
We don't burn books, Jessie.
Fucking disgusting.
Many taxonomic groups don't actually have separate sexes, so hermaphroditism is a normal thing.
Now what Edward is handing out represents the sequential hermaphrodite.
In this case, the slipper snail.
It begins its life as a male.
But if the female population dwindles, then the largest male in the group will spontaneously switch genders.
I will pull your face off.
Oh, I'm shaking.
All right.
Stand.
- You wrote this?
- Fuck no.
Julia, out.
Now.
Okay, who's the budding d.H. Lawrence here?
Mr. Shafer.
Let's chat after class.
Where's mom?
She's at her book club thingy.
What book are they reading?
- What?
-At mom's book club, what book?
Are you autistic?
Who cares?
Dad doesn't want to think about her stupid book club.
- She's exploring interests.
- Fuck that.
Maybe she's with an attorney.
Your mother is not with an attorney.
We're just figuring stuff out, okay?
- Like how to get divorced?
-
-Uh!
What do you even know about divorce in the first place?
You wanna start some shit?
- Whoa, what is that?
- Neil got caught with porno and now he has to see a counselor.
Porno?
Like porno porno?
I didn't have porno, idiot.
Really?
Because, oh, it says right here...
Lemme...
lemme see that.
Oh, Jesus.
I knew it was a bad idea to go there alone.
But my tire was low, and I couldn't make it back.
The gas station was closed and the lights were off, but the air compressor still took my change.
As I pumped new life into the flaccid tire,
I heard a voice behind me.
He was older, probably in his 40s, by the sound of him.
But I didn't dare turn around to check.
He pressed the pistol hard against my lower back.
Pushing, pushing it through my sweater until it bruised my flesh.
He told me to get down on all fours,
- like a dog.
-Thank you, Julia, that is enough.
- I'm not finished.
- Oh, you're finished.
- Have a seat.
- I have three pages left.
This wasn't the assignment.
Well, you assigned a confessional.
This didn't happen to you.
- How do you know?
- Come on.
What?
It could have.
- Not likely.
Mr. snow, this is a narrative writing class and I wrote a narrative.
It is not your place to condemn my subject.
But it absolutely is my place to condemn inappropriate material.
How the hell can you call this inappropriate?
You're not even qualified to judge.
You're a man.
So are you.
All right, okay, we're done here.
I need to see the principal.
Are you going to get him?
Sign in and sit down.
Eww.
Pohl?
Is that "starchild?"
Yeah.
Pohl's only halfway okay when he collaborates with other writers.
Did you ever read "the space merchants?"
Mm-hmm.
It's pretty good.
I think this one kinda sucks though.
I have something for you.
I didn't know you wrote.
Oh, i... this...
- I didn't mean for...
- I liked it.
Are you in trouble?
Yeah, I have to see a counselor.
Yeah, well, I'm here for enacting my first amendment rights.
I wrote an erotic fable.
Well, it was more of a parable.
It's a bit more grounded than yours, but...
You get the idea.
What?
Do you write other stories, like, um...
Like erotic literature?
Mm-hmm.
All the time.
- It's all online.
- Really?
Where?
A riddle.
Eat me, drink me.
Well, good luck, young JUVIE.
Wait, you're leaving?
Where are they?
I don't think you're supposed to smoke.
My mom smoked when she was pregnant with me.
I don't think that's...
It's not like a myth.
It's a circulation thing.
No, it's fine.
We get it, shit ass!
All right, where to?
The mall!
His was the way of the warrior.
Crass.
Uneducated.
But strong.
His abilities would prove useless in the enchanted forest.
Where the ancient inhabitants dwelled and recesses of one's own mind.
The hunter pushed forth unaware fain had been watching him from the moment he entered.
Neil!
It's Neil, right?
Are you watching me?
No.
Well, yeah.
No, i...
I was just curious.
- About?
-What we talked about the other day.
We talked the other day?
Sorry.
Neil.
God, come back.
I'm fucking with you.
- Um.
- It's cool.
I write slash, too.
Yeah, I know.
I read your stuff.
All of it.
Your fan fic is amazing.
I see you got my code.
I do like what you did with the forest guard in "midnight come lately."
They're really under utilized in canon.
Yeah, they're conceptually awesome, but I feel like nobody gets it.
It's like they're begging us to fix 'em.
You're doing what they wished they could do if they didn't have to answer to the publisher.
Yeah, exactly.
Mainstream success is for chumps.
You know, like, the wood spirit, and pagan gods and ritual magic?
It's really...
Sexual?
Yeah.
It's so rich.
Organized religion just totally nut clipped everything that was great about traditional fertility rituals.
I mean, that's the only part about fame that I even give a shit about.
It's just a jumping off point.
It's funny that they think it's kid's stuff, but, like, there's all this subtext.
I know.
I bet we're the only two kids in this entire joint that know about what we know about.
It's kind of special.
You wanna ditch?
School?
No, I mean, you wanna dig a ditch?
- Let's go.
- Oh, i...
I can't
I have a test in social studies next period.
It's on the Incas.
Well, it's not like a midterm or anything, so um yeah.
I let Martine take my car to work, so we have to walk.
But it's just the mall.
Martine's crazy.
I mean, she's pretty much best friend, she's just sort of a bitch.
Is that... is that the pregnant girl?
"At frontier's rim?"
I hate these things.
They never get the book right.
Well, I guess I'm lucky that fain hasn't made the leap to the big screen yet.
Just it pisses me off that whenever I see vanguard in my head
- that guy...
-Well, he's not your character.
I mean, that's why it's called fan fic.
- Yeah, but.
- You seen it yet?
Like five times.
God damn it.
She's not getting off work until like 6.
Okay, I don't have anything better to do.
Will it be...
Smell like...
Will my parents be able to tell?
You don't have to.
It's cool.
No, I mean, I want to, but...
Thank you.
Uh!
Shut your door.
- Put your seat down.
- Why?
What, are you ashamed to be seen with me?
I don't know.
I just...
I don't want to get into it.
There's too much backstory.
Mike Holloway drove his truck through my mom's marigolds when I was ten.
Then he gave her the finger.
I am so stoned.
Heads up, knob-goblin!
Uh!
Hey, wake up!
Let's go.
Move.
Move to the back.
Move it!
- Go to the back.
- Okay.
Ow!
I'm pregnant, bitch!
You know, your arm's not pregnant, moron.
Jesus, I thought that was Mike.
You're really tearing through them these days.
Are you kidding me?
Hi.
I just don't get what you guys are doing for an hour and a half in the parking lot.
Were you like blowing each other?
We were talking about writing.
Whoa!
Wait, you write that shit, too?
I should have known.
Who do you have fucking?
Harry Potter?
Thomas the train engine?
I just gotta know whose fictional dick is going in whose made-up mouth.
You can't even read.
Yeah, I can read.
I read all the time.
I read actual books for adults.
- Not baby books.
- Okay, name one.
"Wuthering heights," ass blood.
- The Bronte sisters wrote fan fic.
- What?
The Bronte sisters.
Emily Bronte, of "Wuthering heights," wrote erotic fan fiction.
They're like pioneers.
Wow.
It's really good Mike isn't here to find out that you're still such a fucking geeeeeek!
Dude, you know weed stays in your system for like two weeks.
On your clothes, on your jacket.
Leave him alone.
Hey, tomorrow, 2:00.
Let's meet in the courtyard.
We can drive around.
Bye.
Belzac and Deron Zaxa had been fighting for hours.
Sweat tinged the air of the war chamber.
That was the first thing vanguard noticed as he entered.
The bulge in his leather pants jumped to attention...
Erect member out of...
Suddenly, Belzac reentered...
His mouth, usually only engaged in ordering soldiers to their deaths, now found its true purpose.
We will not stand for this.
If the trade union continues to block us at every turn...
Block you?
Block you.
Your armada destroyed the last...
- twelve.
-Twelve shipments of illinium
- sent to Parak Menom.
- Only 12?
Now 13.
It's an embargo.
A legal embargo.
Odd definition of the word legal.
- Actually... -oh, so that's why you brought your...
Muscle?
You have nothing to fear from us, Deron Zaxa.
You or your muscle.
I will not be mocked aboard my own ship.
Hired ship.
It's his freighter.
What do I pay you for?
Move!
Whatever he pays you, we'll double it.
Allow us to show you what we'll pay you for.
I don't have all day.
Yes, sir, very busy.
You have a lunch at... 1300.
Christ!
God!
Zaxa's hand reached down...
Down to his zipper.
The ambient humidity in the room reached a level that set off the climate klaxon.
But Zaxa couldn't...
Or wouldn't... stop.
Hey, Neil.
God I sucked today.
You were really good.
That accent is, it's out of control.
I think it's funny when you do it like that.
It's supposed to be a comedy, right?
Yeah, I suppose you're right.
See, that's why I like you, man.
You always make me feel better.
So you get like touched inappropriately by the doctor?
No, he just puts goo all over your belly.
- It's not a big deal.
- Yeah.
You have no clue how big a speculum is.
It's like three adult dicks glued together.
Sounds like me though.
Hey, snoop dog!
Come here!
- Well, who's this?
- Julia's new boyfriend.
- Jealous?
- For real?
What's up, bro?
I'm Mike.
Ow.
I'm Neil.
- Well, I guess I owe you one, Neil.
- You do?
Yeah, for taking little miss elf quest off my hands.
She has been up my hole like 24-7.
Hey, fetus.
So long, kiddies, let's ride around.
Better not leak on my seats, Martine.
I don't leak.
It all stays in me.
For like another two months.
Gross.
Hey, I wanna tell you about something.
There's a con in Houston coming up.
Like a comic con?
Yes, like a comic con.
A big one.
The rabbit's hole is hosting a private mixer.
- It's invite only.
- Oh, yeah.
- I think I heard of that.
- Well, I got invited.
Really?
Cool.
Yeah, there's a live read, too.
I mean, that's only for rock stars, so, I don't wanna be presumptuous or whatever, but I think they might ask me.
You can still get invited.
You just need to upload your damn work.
Yeah, but... don't you have to be 18?
You're joking, right?
I don't even know if my stuff is...
- I don't know!
- Come on, it's good.
You barely even read any.
Well, it's gotta be good.
I mean, you're so repressed.
That shit has gotta come out somehow.
Drop us off at Neil's house!
Oh, man, I thought you were joking.
Exactly how I imagined it.
I guess it's pretty drab.
My mom's been kind of away.
Moment of truth.
Crack her open.
Julia, I didn't really mean for these to be seen by anybody.
Yes, you did.
Otherwise you wouldn't have written them.
I can't watch.
- I thought you couldn't watch.
- Sorry.
Oh, my god.
Do these girls actually wear space bikinis?
It's ceremonial.
They were given...
It's not my idea.
Well, I just like that there's actual girls in here.
Wow, you are one twisted fuck.
I love it.
- Ooh, prepare to be analized!
- It's not a toy.
It's not a toy.
That's so weird.
- It looks like a toy.
- You're gonna break it.
- That's crazy.
- Whoa!
Say your space prayers, sucka.
Am I interrupting?
Don't you knock?
Um, dad is working late.
There's food in the fridge.
Where are you going?
Oh, my band has a show.
What's your band?
Dance or die.
It sounds awesome.
Yeah, well, it's pretty stupid.
I bet you're really good.
- Just get out!
- All right.
I'm off.
I have to pick up Tim.
It smells like sweat in here.
What was that?
I'm bisexual, just so you know.
Eww, she's not even gay.
All women are bisexual.
All of them.
My first blog, clitora majora, is all about it.
- So, you ready?
- No.
For what?
It's time to upload.
I don't think I'm ready.
Dude, they only send invites to writers who post.
And besides, writers, real writers, let people read their shit.
And your shit is good.
I mean, it's not as good as mine, but traditionally boys don't write very good erotica.
- So, by those standards...
- Okay, fine.
Just, stop talking.
Really?
Oh, my god.
What are you like the one person on the entire Internet that doesn't lie about their age?
- Are you a Mennonite?
- No.
I just, I don't want to misrepresent myself.
Okay.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that this is not about misrepresenting yourself.
You don't want to do this because once you do, you're one of us.
It's the final line.
The last taboo.
Well, there's no turning back, Van fan.
It's in god's hands now.
What?
Can we just turn comments off?
No, dude, it's part of the public record now.
You're killing me.
Let's talk about something else.
Literally anything else.
I like the way you eat.
Neil, when we were horsing around, did you get a boner?
- Like a little bit of a boner?
- No!
Okay.
It's cool if you did.
I thought that you were...
What?
Nothing.
It's cool if you popped a chub.
God, shut up.
- Yo.
- Where's Martine?
I don't know.
At the abortion clinic with her mom.
Wanna grab some food?
We can go to footlongers and get some subs.
Watch "celebrity apprentice" at my place.
And by your place you mean your mom's basement?
Yeah, whatever.
I got weed.
You wanna come?
Whoa!
What the fuck do you think I look like?
A fucking full service food court?
No, that's okay.
I've got math homework.
See, he's got math homework.
He's got a future.
Fuck you.
Neil, really great work today.
I have you nymph.
The hot breath is his voice in her elongated, elfin ear.
The ear that to nymph kind, seconded as a highly erogenous zone.
Fain was lost unto herself.
His name now known to her.
Michael.
Sir Michael.
My sweet Michael.
All right, so nicklepenny comes through the door minus his pants.
Hollycotton is surprised and crosses to l-6.
Mr. nicklepenny!
- I thought you were...
- Across the hall?
This mansion is still quite a mystery to me.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
That's too much.
Reverse.
No, no, that's not right either.
Look, I have a test in 30 minutes, and I'm not going to fail because of your slow ass.
And how long did we wait for you to get off-book?
Fuck you!
I have dyslexia.
Miss Lewis, this is a tech rehearsal and I can't put up with her anymore.
I take dyslexia medication.
Jessie, take a break.
Neil, hey.
Neil!
Huh?
Could you be so kind as to relieve miss hunt for a moment?
I can't put up with her...
Can you imagine having to deal with her parents?
So, Jessie tells me you're a writer.
You really freaked her out.
- Oh, I didn't mean to.
- Dude, that needed to happen.
This place could use some subversion.
Yeah, um, in AP English, we got to read Oscar Wilde...
- so you gonna let me read it?
- Oh.
Okay, let's take it from the double entendre.
It seems that Horace has mistakenly taken my clothes.
Thankfully not all of them.
Yes, thankfully.
Oh... it's cotton.
Cotton's a very versatile fabric, don't you think?
Extremely pliable to a man's touch.
What appears course, now in my hands is so very, very soft.
Oh, my god.
Oh, listen to this, "Deron Zaxa, ever the orator, put his mouth to quite a different purpose now."
Dude, this Deron Zaxa guy is you straight up.
- Neil.
-You do know he's straight, right?
Thanks.
You're gonna have to drive my car.
Are you crying?
No.
I'm pretty sure you're crying.
Never drink vodka from a plastic jug with a handle.
Okay.
Mike Holloway is pure dick cheese.
Neil, I have something important to tell you.
Something I've been thinking about for a while.
I think you use too much flowery prose.
What?
You say things like, "he stroked his velvet rod,"
when you should be like, "he pumped his stone cock."
Readers respond better to direct language.
Thanks.
I can impart the wisdom of our one year age difference, you know?
Um, your mom has a lot of religious stuff.
Yeah, I think that's why my dad killed himself.
He was gay, you know.
My dad, he kept it to himself.
I guess he preferred death to coming out.
Man, do you really think being gay killed him?
I don't wanna be here when my mom gets home.
What?
Mom's home.
Stay here.
I...
I had to print something for work.
You know we've always supported your interests.
And the Internet is, wow, an incredible tool.
- We don't have to do this.
-I think what we're trying to say is just 'cause information is out there, doesn't mean it's accurate.
We just don't want you getting particular information, you know,
- from the wrong sources.
- I'm 15.
Hey, you can read whatever you want.
We're fine with that.
As long as you're reading.
Uh-huh, as long as it's not "mein Kampf."
But actually, well, "mein Kampf" is actually a pretty interesting read.
Honey, I don't want you to feel awkward about this.
If you want to read intelligent prose on human sexuality
I can make you a reading list.
Eww!
No!
What do you mean intelligent?
Well, it's just whoever wrote that story on your computer, they obviously don't have the first clue about actual human relationships.
It's demented.
I don't think your mother's talking about
- the homosexual content, not particularly.
- Please stop.
It's just more of a basic plotting problem.
You're absorbing material that has some rudimentary grammatical errors in it.
You've got sentence fragments, you've got dangling participles.
I actually have been helping Neil with his writing.
- Huh.
-He's got a lot of innate talent.
He just uses too much flowery prose.
There's no flowery prose!
Neil tells me you two are considering a split?
- What?
- I'm sorry.
I just thought I could provide some insight, since my parents are divorced.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Open and honest dialog is key to maintaining a stable relationship.
- Is it now?
- Totally.
I write about it all the time.
That and be honest about one's own sexual desires.
- It's rare that anyone ever is.
- Huh.
I edit a lit journal on women's studies.
I plan to pursue that in college.
- Women's studies?
- Yeah, female sexuality in literature, specifically.
Reverse gender roles in pop culture, sexual submissive hierarchy, rape paradigms.
I actually wrote a 22 page thesis on the concept of venereal disease as a female guilt trigger.
It's no big deal.
I did a paper on monotremes, remember?
Are monotremes a form of VD?
Don't be embarrassed, Neil.
It's natural.
Yeah, Neil, don't be embarrassed.
It's natural.
- Do you ever read any online...
- dad!
- I actually write online - poetry.
Online poetry.
Lady poetry.
- About strong women.
- Lady poetry?
You really need to bring friend around more often.
Did Neil tell you guys about the convention?
- The comic con?
- It's also for writers.
Neil, you didn't mention that.
It's for regular writers!
- Is that true?
- Define regular.
I think she means non-erotic.
Are you guys crazy?
What makes you think
I would go to an erotic writing convention?
I don't know!
Why would you have it on your computer?
I mean, do they have that...
What was the name?
- Uh...
Vang...
- Vanguard erotica.
- Please stop saying "erotica" at the dinner table.
-No, please don't.
I just need to know if you're going to a place for adults.
Yeah, mom has a strict no sex dungeon policy.
I'm not.
We're not!
You don't have to lie to me, you know.
Your mom is not as square as you think.
I even went to a key party once.
When did you go to a key party?
I'm not lying.
Good.
Good.
So speaking of writing, how much do you guys know about the Bronte sisters?
I'm sorry about that.
You know what, no, Neil, you have to get past this repression.
Yeah, well, why don't I come by and give a lecture on the sexual fantasies of Emily Bronte to your mom.
Your parents are cool.
You're lucky.
Our situations are so different.
- You told me that your dad killed himself.
-He did.
"Oh, hey, Neil's parents, why don't you let me give you some insight because my parents are divorced."
- You don't get it.
- Yeah, I don't.
What?
Well, I'm picking you up tomorrow at 9 am, so be ready.
- Some dinner, huh?
- Sorry.
Hey, I like her.
She's a character.
Well, lemme guess.
I can't go now?
Dad.
I'm good.
Take it.
Take it.
Do you remember when I used to take you to those autograph conventions?
Yeah.
Remember when you stood in line for two hours to try to get butch Patrick to sign your munsters lunch box?
And then he wouldn't.
Butch Patrick was a dick.
All right, as far as your mom knows, you're staying at your cousin's, all right?
And I'm counting on you to do the right thing.
At least not to do, not to do the wrong thing.
She's more mature than you.
Huh?
In some ways?
I mean, maybe mature is not the right word.
Dad.
You really like this girl, don't you?
I liked the same type.
When I was your age I did.
But be careful, huh?
These arty girls...
I don't wanna see you get hurt, okay?
All right, good talk, right?
All right, I'll see you later.
Hola!
Neil, your friends are multiplying.
Is that a pregnant joke?
This shit is getting super old.
We're not letting her do this again.
You can say whatever you want about me, but I'm not a fucking flake.
- What happened?
- Mike happened.
Fucking douchebag.
It's a good thing I went by there.
- She's not gonna go?
- Oh, she's going.
I mean, look at you.
Look at what you do to yourself for her, dumb ass.
That's fine.
I feel kind of responsible for you.
I mean, you're just like her when we first met.
I liked her 'cause she was all smart and funny, and she tried so hard to be my friend.
And she would, like, offer to do my homework and shit.
And I would just make fun of her costumes and stuff.
You know she used to dress like an elf, right?
I don't know.
I didn't think I tried to change her.
I mean I took her out with Mike, and that was it.
I guess he was like the first normal guy to ever take interest in her.
He's normal?
Don't change for her, dude.
Don't let her be your Mike.
- Please be quiet, okay?
My mom's sleeping.
-She here?
- Yes.
- Then what the fuck, dude,
- what is she doing here?
- I don't...
She told Neil she would take him to comic con.
Holy shit.
That's amazing.
Dude.
Oh, ho, dude, please get out.
I need a better look at this.
This coming from a guy in his pajamas.
I'm listen...
I'm not busting your balls.
I promise you.
Just come on.
- I need a fucking picture.
-
-You're such a dick.
I'm not the one making a scene, okay, Martine?
You're the one making a scene right now.
Come on, get up.
Give me a little, give me a little twirly twirl.
Oh, man, I'm not nearly stoned enough for this right now.
Oh!
What the fuck!
Jesus!
- I only wanted a picture, freak.
- You are the freak.
You and your stupid fucking mustache.
Ow.
Yo, bro.
You ever see those um...
You ever see those pictures
I took of her wearing that elf shit?
Well, sometimes all she wore were those little ears.
Yeah, those were my special pics.
Neil!
Get the fuck off!
Oh, Galadriel.
Babe, I knew you were a nerd.
I didn't know you were a fucking retard.
Whoa!
Oh, shit!
Oh!
This is funny.
You're fucking crazy.
You can't be all stoic in that costume.
It looks ridiculous.
Don't worry about me.
I am worried about driving for three hours with a guilt-bot programmed to guilt me to death.
How can you hang out with that guy?
He's like everything you pretend to hate.
What do you mean "pretend?"
Nothing.
Just forget it.
You are acting like a really jealous boyfriend right now.
Well, I'm not your boyfriend.
Yeah, you're not.
Hey, I'm sorry.
Okay, I know...
I know that Mike brings out the worst in me.
You have to admit, it was, like, really cool when you knocked him down.
Fucker.
I have to tell you something.
About the live read.
I know already.
I saw.
It was posted on the forum.
Congrats.
I told you it was good.
- Did they write you?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
They said something about the number of slots.
Politics again.
Politics.
I'm really glad that you transcended all of that.
Yeah.
Welcome to comic con.
What name is your reservation under?
How do you know we're here for comic con?
Emily Bronte.
All right, miss Bronte,
I have you down for a single king?
Oh, can we get two beds?
Unfortunately, we're at capacity.
That's okay.
We'll sleep together.
Swanky.
It's big.
Come here.
Try this out!
I don't wanna mess up my costume.
Did you talk to them yet?
No, do I need to?
You're reading tomorrow.
If it were me, I would be checking up on like the order of the lineup and how much time I have, and how I'm gonna be taped and shit.
Taped?
Why would they tape it?
I don't want to be on tape.
That's normal, okay?
You need to relax.
You're so fucking nuts.
Jesus.
What's with you?
You look like how I look when I'm trying to avoid someone.
Okay, so we have the opening night party tonight.
And then tomorrow we have writer Evals 'til five, then the slash mixer, and then the live read.
Hello!
Person talking to you I.R.L.
Sorry.
Um... i have to go to the bathroom.
You're just going to gawk at your phone somewhere where I can't give you shit about it.
- Fine, I'll leave it.
-No, don't do it for me, dude.
I'm just trying to bust you out of your self-induced social media prison.
You've really opened my eyes.
Throw off the shackles!
Throw 'em off!
Wizards man.
Wand-on-wand action.
That's what the readers want.
It's casting a spell on my wand,
- I'll tell you that.
- Yeah.
But that Harry-Draco genre, that's getting old.
Now what I'm into is that Snape-Dumbledore fic.
Wow, that is literally old.
I didn't realize you were into octogenarians?
Yeah, well, uh, vanguard is no spring chicken.
Easy.
Well, usually.
Hey.
Oh, did you read that story I sent you,
"panty raid at Slytherin"?
Oh, yeah, dude.
I called my mom.
I read it out loud.
Finally.
Come on.
We got business to conduct.
I think I'd rather go look at comics.
Neil, this is toho.
What are you drinking?
I dunno.
Toho?
Uh, hmmm... is blue.
It's blue.
Works for me.
That is a sick vanguard costume you've got there, bro.
Is that from "Kragon's war?"
Anyways, so...
My name is Hagoff Paul and this is a little greeting.
Is that?
Is that LSD?
For the party tonight, playboy.
It's Molly.
Mdma?
- No, no.
- It looks like acid.
It's ecstasy.
Have you ever done that before?
No, but I want to.
That stuff stays in your system forever.
Have you ever heard of an acid flashback?
Look, I don't want to wake up in a year and stab my parents to death with a kitchen knife, okay?
Well, that makes one of us.
What if it ruins the whole weekend?
What if we miss the live reading because we're in the hospital getting our stomach's pumped?
We are going to a party with all sorts of lights and costumes, okay?
- Do you normally go to parties, Neil?
-No.
- Do you like to mingle?
- No.
- Open your mouth, playboy.
- No...
Julia.
There we go.
Oh, whatever you do, don't swallow.
What will happen if I swallow it?
I'm hallucinating!
It's not acid!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold her there.
Off, off, off, off.
- I'm sick.
- Okay.
I'm so stoned.
Stoned on acid.
I mean, Molly...
This must be like every day for Madonna.
Here.
Drink some water.
Oh, okay.
Oh.
You're safe now.
You're in a totally safe place.
What?
I don't know if I've uh...
Ever been attracted to anyone before you.
You mean any girl.
Any human being.
What are you attracted to about me?
I'm not ashamed of myself with you.
Should I have done that?
I don't know if I should have done that.
Pants.
- Are you doing your homework?
- No.
"Julia tugged at his pants, sliding them down ever so slowly."
Okay, if you're gonna write about us, you need to use some modifiers.
"Julia tugged at his tight pants, sliding them off painfully slow.
Savoring the moment the heightened pleasure involved."
I'm glad you decided to branch out.
You're a tough one to figure out.
No, I'm not.
Hi, you've reached Julia's voicemail.
I probably don't want to talk to you.
Hi, you've reached Julia's voicemail.
I probably...
The alliteration is good, but you use it way too much.
Yeah, it's sort of my crutch.
And the allegory is a bit on-the-nose.
Oh, I actually thought it was more of a metaphor than an allegory.
Uh, do you know what an allegory is?
Look, you're okay.
Uh, and you're female.
We need more women in our field.
Most of them are pretty ugly.
Unlike you.
You can have a career.
Writing is more than just writing.
There are other factors.
Dude, I want to show you something.
It's a...
It's a Tijuana Bible.
It's quite the important artifact.
Mexicans are far more sexually liberated.
What's with the look?
You just left this morning.
Yeah, I was getting a critique.
I mean, that's why we're here.
To meet the pros.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
I have to go meet someone.
Who?
Denis?
Sorry, I looked through your phone.
I didn't think that you would care.
Hey... don't!
Don't do that.
- What's your deal?
- Nothing.
Don't get all weird on me just because we messed around.
Why did you rip up our pages?
I don't know.
We were zonked.
We wrote some crazy shit, okay?
I didn't want it just floating around.
So last night was just the drugs?
You have been hiding this Denis guy from me.
I didn't even think that you were straight.
Can you hear me now?
How about now?
I'll check my bars.
That's better.
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is age restricted.
Hi.
Oh, my god, Neil.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I uh...
I didn't expect you to look uh, so young.
- Uh, do you wanna see my ID?
- No, no, no, no.
No, I'm sorry, believe me, I looked young when I was your age, too.
Uh, when I was 18.
- You still look young.
- Oh, well, thank you.
Oh, my god, it's just so great to uh, finally meet you, in the flesh, so to speak, um...
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Oh, yes, of course.
Shall we?
-Yeah.
You're staring.
Virgins stare.
- They do?
-Yeah, well, con virgins.
Yeah, it's just so weird now that it's all in 3-d.
Yeah, I know.
Internet rule 34.
If it exists there's porn of it.
Just when you think you've seen it all.
I just discovered what a curtain fic is.
- Curtain fic?
- Mm-hmm.
I mean, okay, so, this is aimed at older gays.
Of course they're like post-sex, proto-nesting, domestic fetishists.
And so normally where you'd have like kirk and Spock, you know, making love, uh, in this case, it's couples having these like lavish shopping sprees at pottery barn.
For curtains.
They sell curtains at pottery barn?
They sell everything at pottery barn.
I mean, you know, it's mostly harmless I guess, but not all of it is...
And you really need to watch out for creeps, especially at your age.
- But you're not a creep.
- No, I'm not a creep, but isn't that exactly what a creep would say?
Oh, I thought you came alone.
Oh, Jesus, speaking of creepy.
I came with a friend.
Oh, and does he write slash?
She.
And yeah.
You know, actually, I think she's in regular writing today.
Oh, regular writing.
- Denis.
-Oh, Ronnie, hey, um, this is Neil.
- He's one of our new writers.
- Oh, yeah, I bet.
Ronnie Harwood.
I'm senior writer at the rabbit's hole.
So some of the inner circle are gonna go out for an early dinner before the reading.
- Are you game?
- Yeah.
You can bring your new little friend.
Everybody agrees that Batman blowing Robin and Robin blowing Batman is totally played out, but now I'm seeing Christian bale's Batman blowing Ben Affleck as Batman.
Blowing Val Kilmer.
Oh, that's really hot.
I got a cease and desist from Warner's last week, so obviously I'm doing something right.
Yeah, you're moving up in the world.
What kind of slash do you write?
You've been to our website, it's easy enough to find.
Right.
I'm guessing this is your first con, since you're what, he's 18?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, 18.
Hmm.
I was editing the R.P.F. Board today.
I'll never get all the Bieber fic.
Neil, are you into Justin Bieber?
What's R.P.F.?
R.P.F. Is real people fiction or celebrity slash.
Slash about, you know, celebs.
Oh, oh, like the Bronte sisters.
They wrote stories about Napoleon and the Duke of Wellington.
Yeah, I mean, it's pretty old school, but now it's mostly just like pointless boy band orgies.
Yeah, and juvenile regressives are popping up all over.
Speaking of...
How long have you slashed vanguard?
Oh, vanguard is juvenile, but trek and Tolkien, that's...
It's all about audience and intent, Denis.
This is first year stuff.
Vanguard doesn't play to the 40-plus crowd, our base.
Besides, it's not our mission to indoctrinate children.
It's not our mission to indoctrinate anyone.
I read Tolkien when I was eight.
Yes, and Denis loves his vanguard.
Ronnie prefers her masturbation material to stem from bad '60s television.
You ever see "the Brady bunch," dude?
Really, Freddie?
He's a child.
Mainstream success has no bearing on our field.
Never has.
What we do know is juvenile fiction begets juvenile erotica.
Let me be frank.
You write sex like a 12-year-old and I think you know it.
It's like you found all these provocative words and just tossed them into a text editor.
Have you ever even had sex?
I doubt half our writers have had sex.
- Let me see your ID.
- Ronnie.
Well, I don't know about you, Denis, but I don't want to go to jail.
Nobody's going to jail.
Jesus!
Neil, come on.
It's fine.
Sit down.
Yeah, it's fine if he ponies up an ID.
I remember now.
You wrote all that really gross Mike and Greg Brady fic.
What's your point?
I thought you liked sex with 12-year-olds.
If it's written maturely.
Nice.
Are you really 18?
Neil, Neil, come on, stop.
Stop, stop, stop.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Look, Ronnie, I mean, you know, she's like that with everybody.
It's not you.
Oh, um.
Let's go someplace else.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait.
It just...
This doesn't feel right.
Why?
Look, I'm not gonna be mad, I'm not be upset or anything.
I need you to tell me how old you are.
- I already told you.
- I know, I know.
Tell me again.
- 15.
- 15?
Oh, fuck!
I'll be 16 in November.
- Please don't reject me.
- Dude, this is wrong.
I know it is.
This is just the second time today.
- I could go to jail.
- I won't tell anyone.
Did you just tell me you were 18 so you could get into the live reading?
- No!
-What do you even want from me?
I just thought it'd be different.
Here with you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You actually remind me a lot of myself.
- You turned out okay.
- Did I?
I shot off a series of insane messages to somebody I didn't know the first thing about.
I said things I would never say to somebody face to face.
Ever.
You know, outside of like cons,
I have practically zero social skills.
My mother always said it's going to get me in trouble, and now here I am.
And yes, incidentally, I live with my mother, in the house where I grew up, in Saginaw.
So, you know, don't be too sure about things.
You live with your mom?
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
You said this was the second time.
It it someone in our group?
Was it that girl you came here with?
Yeah, well.
I thought you might be straight.
- I might not be.
-Well, this isn't the way to find out.
You have time.
You're writing.
Focus on that.
How can I focus on something
I'm not even old enough to do?
Well, what do you want to do?
You want to be a writer?
A real writer, not fan fic?
You're good.
Keep writing and let the rest of the stuff sort itself out naturally.
I wish somebody had told me that when I was your age.
Well, you better go.
It's about time.
I don't know what the right thing to do here is.
I wanna make sure you're okay.
Well, I know you have to go.
I am the moderator.
I mean, you don't have to worry, I'm not coming.
I can't, not now.
Not right now.
I wish it wasn't this way.
You know, for what it's worth,
I think you want to be queer.
Why would anyone want that?
To fit in, even some place small.
I'll see you around.
You came back?
The live read's about to start.
You should be there.
I came back for you.
You don't get it.
You submitted once and they're like,
"hey, come read it on stage."
I have like 500 things posted up there.
I know.
I've read every one of them.
It's hard caring about someone.
Letting them care about you.
It doesn't have to be hard.
I love you.
I kissed him.
That Denis guy?
I'm not going to the live read.
- You have to.
- I can't.
Neil, please, for both of us.
Fuck those crusty old assholes.
I followed you into the restaurant when you weren't answering my calls.
I'm sorry that lady is such an asshole.
Look, they only win if you let them.
You are a featured fucking story, dude.
You made it!
We're doing this.
You and me together.
I am your goddamn coach.
Okay?
As they entered the nexiverse,
Gandalf, his penis now longer than his staff, tuned... turned to Dumbledore,
"Dumbledore," he said to Dumbledore,
"only the energy of our mutual orgasm, combined with unbroken eye contact can close the door to the nexiverse, thus stopping the combined armies of Sauron and Voldemort.
Without a moment's thought, Dumbledore selflessly gave of his own manhood, placing the head of his pounding penis against that of the wise old wizard from alt middle earth, like in Ghostbusters.
- End of chapter seven.
Okay, that was gan-dum 69 with "hole pluggers of the nexiverse."
And who doesn't like some good old-fashioned wizard-on-wizard action?
One more time for her, gan-dum 69.
Um...
So-uh, I think everybody knows my feelings about what we do and the purpose it serves.
Often we're treated like freaks.
Especially those of us who are a little bit older.
- And uh, still doing this.
Um... and when we're away from this little community that we've created for ourselves, you know, we're outsiders, and we're weirdoes, and we're sexual deviants, but not here.
Our next reader is a young man that I have been following with much interest.
And not just because he writes vanguard.
Please welcome to the stage, Van fan 42.
Um, this is called...
"Shore leave on dreenan four."
"The balmy tropic weather patterns of dreenan four gave cause for the indigenous proxans to wear very little in the way of attire.
This year with the elliptical orbit pulling them closer than ever to dreenan prime, clothing was more a hardship than an option.
Vanguard found himself unarmored on the beaches of the Zaraug during what seemed to be a religious mating ritual.
'Do you happen to know where they keep the towels?
' a lean, naked proxon inquired.
His supple manhood stood proud against the harsh light of dreenan prime.
The proxon boy repeated himself, 'well, do you?
' vanguard's hand now pumped his stone cock."
He's 15.
You're outsiders.
You were supposed to support other outsiders.
I mean, you guys write ninja turtle bondage porn and you're judging?
He just poured out his sad, pathetic heart to you philistines!
And I think it's beautiful.
Let him read.
No.
I may be 15, but you're an asshole.
I'll be 16 in a few months.
All right, everybody, that is my fault.
I'm the one who broke the rules.
Don't blame him.
So you're not...
Mad at me anymore, right?
I'd only be mad if you stopped writing because of this.
Me?
No.
I've got my body armor on.
Hey, I love you, too.
Well, duh.
I gotta tell you something.
I think I may be a lesbian.
The way I figure it...
If I'm lesbian and you're gay, then we can be a gay couple, and it sort of cancels each other out.
Cause I'm more mannish and you're like a girl.
Wait, what...
I'm like a girl?
I'm sorry, Neil.
I'm sorry I said you were gay.
I don't know why I said that.
I don't care what you are.
That's the only thing that I don't care about.
I told them you were 16.
What?
I'm the reason you didn't get into the live read.
It was my fault.
It was down to you and me, and I told them that I was 18, and you were 16.
That editor, Ronnie, loves your writing.
It's not about that.
It never was, so you have to keep writing.
I thought you didn't care about the reading.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
I really do love you.
It's not so crazy they believed you were 18.
You do look older now.
Jesus!
Mom knows you stayed with her.
What?
- Mom's around?
- Mm-hmm.
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.
Dad took a bullet for you.
That girl's mom called.
Did you guys steal her credit card?
I hope you lost your cherry, Neily Bopper.
'Cause from the sound of it, you might not be seeing much of her for a while.
Let me see that.
What, do you think I'm too dumb?
Don't worry, man, she'll come around.
Seasons end, even on Milliarcha v, where nuclear winter was slowly giving way to bright spring.
Vanguard felt it.
And he knew his own season was now at a close.
Be it burial in the cold vacuum of space, or a quaint domestic cabin on the frontier's rim, everyone retires.
Things, people...
Come into your life suddenly, and then are just as suddenly gone.
But their season shapes you.
Makes you dare things you hadn't previously even dreamt.
And for that, and for my friend, this author is happy.
[BOY] THE PLEASURE GARDENS OF MILLIARCHA V
MADE IT THE JEWEL OF THE INNER RIM FOR OVER FIVE CENTURIES.
IT TOOK NEARLY 48 HOURS FOR EVERYTHING TO CHANGE.
A GREAT ALIEN EVIL HAD ENSLAVED THE ONCE PEACEFUL PLANET.
FOR THE HIGH COUNCIL, THERE WAS ONLY ONE OPTION.
VANGUARD, THE INFAMOUS MERCENARY WAS DISPATCHED
TO FACE THE ENTITY RESPONSIBLE,
THE KRAGON, THE DUKE OF RAGGIDI,
THE BUTCHER OF BARSA,
DESTROYER OF WORLDS.
VANGUARD'S ORDERS WERE SIMPLE.
ELIMINATE.
[GROANS]
[GRUNTING]
[MOANING]
[MAN] TIME FOR SCHOOL.
I KNOW.
[BOY] HE CRASHED HARD.
VANGUARD NEARLY BROKE THE SLAVE GIRL'S FALL.
SHE WAS STRADDLING HIM NOW.
FACE TO FACE.
-[WOMAN PANTING] -[GRUNTING]
SEEMS I DIDN'T LEAVE THIS WORLD EARLY ENOUGH.
THE AIR IS STILL BREATHABLE.
JUST THE SAME.
-[GRUNTS] -[MOANS]
[BOY] NEITHER GAINED MUCH GROUND.
THEY WERE ALMOST EVENLY MATCHED.
WE ARE ALMOST EVENLY MATCHED.
ALMOST?
[GRUNTS]
[MOANS]
I WAS WEANED ON THE PSYCHEDELIC GASSES OF RAGGIDI PRIME.
I SEE THEIR EFFECT ON HUMANS IS NOT UNUSUAL.
IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO WASTE
SO WORTHY AN ADVERSARY.
THE RAGGIDI ALSO FIND THE GAS TO HAVE A PLEASING EFFECT.
[BOY] VANGUARD PEERED INTO THE EVIL LORD'S EYES,
THEN BACK TO THE SLAVE GIRL.
THEN THOSE EYES.
THEN THE GIRL.
THEN THE EYES.
AND THEN THE GIRL.
THEN THE...
IT ALL HAPPENED SO FAST.
A FLASH OF BODIES, LIMBS, FLESH
PRESSING TOGETHER.
THEIR HUNGER KNEW NO BOUNDS.
SUDDENLY ALL THE ATROCITIES,
THE MURDEROUS TYRANT HAD EVER COMMITTED
WERE NOTHING MORE THAN AN AFTERTHOUGHT.
LUST WAS THE ONLY THING ON VANGUARD'S MIND.
LUST WAS ALL THAT MATTERED NOW.
-[MAN] A TOAST.
-[GLASSES CLINKING]
IT'S MY GOOD FORTUNE
TO HAVE A GOOD FORTUNE.
[LAUGHING]
AND I BRING IT ALL TO YOU,
MOST HONORABLE HEADS OF HOUSES, PRENTISS AND HOLLYCOTTON.
AND OF COURSE, YOUR HIGHLY ELIGIBLE DAUGHTERS,
ONE OF WHOM I SOON INTEND TO WED.
[WOMAN GASPS]
-[BOY] HE KNEW IT WAS WRONG.
-[MAN] CHEERS.
[BOY] BUT WHY DID IT FEEL SO RIGHT?
IN THE THROES OF PASSION, VANGUARD WAS QUICKLY REMINDED
OF THE DEBACLE AT THE HIGH COUNCIL.
AND WITH IT, HIS PREVIOUS CONQUEST.
-WHAT'S THAT?
-NOTHING.
IF IT'S NOTHING, WHY DO YOU CARE?
IT WOULDN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE.
REALLY?
ARE YOU SAYING I'M DUMB?
NO, THERE'S JUST-- THERE'S NO CONTEXT.
NEIL, IS THAT A DIARY?
I DON'T KNOW.
NEIL WON'T LET ME SEE IT.
-LET ME SEE THAT.
-HEY!
SENATOR ZAXA APPROACHED VANGUARD,
HIS EYES SET ON THE SOLDIER OF FORTUNE'S ENGORGED...
PELVIC REGION?
MOTHER OF FUCK!
WE SHOULD BURN IT.
WE DON'T BURN BOOKS, JESSIE.
[JESSIE] FUCKING DISGUSTING.
MANY TAXONOMIC GROUPS DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE SEPARATE SEXES,
SO HERMAPHRODITISM IS A NORMAL THING.
NOW WHAT EDWARD IS HANDING OUT
REPRESENTS THE SEQUENTIAL HERMAPHRODITE.
IN THIS CASE, THE SLIPPER SNAIL.
IT BEGINS ITS LIFE AS A MALE.
BUT IF THE FEMALE POPULATION DWINDLES,
THEN THE LARGEST MALE IN THE GROUP
WILL SPONTANEOUSLY SWITCH GENDERS.
I WILL PULL YOUR FACE OFF.
OH, I'M SHAKING.
ALL RIGHT.
STAND.
-YOU WROTE THIS?
-FUCK NO.
[CLASS OOHS]
JULIA, OUT.
NOW.
OKAY, WHO'S THE BUDDING D.H. LAWRENCE HERE?
MR. SHAFER.
LET'S CHAT AFTER CLASS.
[CLASS OOHS]
WHERE'S MOM?
SHE'S AT HER BOOK CLUB THINGY.
WHAT BOOK ARE THEY READING?
-WHAT?
-AT MOM'S BOOK CLUB, WHAT BOOK?
ARE YOU AUTISTIC?
WHO CARES?
DAD DOESN'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT HER STUPID BOOK CLUB.
-SHE'S EXPLORING INTERESTS.
-FUCK THAT.
MAYBE SHE'S WITH AN ATTORNEY.
YOUR MOTHER IS NOT WITH AN ATTORNEY.
WE'RE JUST FIGURING STUFF OUT, OKAY?
-LIKE HOW TO GET DIVORCED?
-[GIRL] UH!
WHAT DO YOU EVEN KNOW ABOUT DIVORCE
IN THE FIRST PLACE?
YOU WANNA START SOME SHIT?
-WHOA, WHAT IS THAT?
-NEIL GOT CAUGHT WITH PORNO
AND NOW HE HAS TO SEE A COUNSELOR.
PORNO?
LIKE PORNO PORNO?
I DIDN'T HAVE PORNO, IDIOT.
[CHUCKLES] REALLY?
BECAUSE, OH, IT SAYS RIGHT HERE--
LEMME-
- LEMME SEE THAT.
OH, JESUS.
[WOMAN] I KNEW IT WAS A BAD IDEA TO GO THERE ALONE.
BUT MY TIRE WAS LOW, AND I COULDN'T MAKE IT BACK.
THE GAS STATION WAS CLOSED AND THE LIGHTS WERE OFF,
BUT THE AIR COMPRESSOR STILL TOOK MY CHANGE.
AS I PUMPED NEW LIFE INTO THE FLACCID TIRE,
I HEARD A VOICE BEHIND ME.
HE WAS OLDER, PROBABLY IN HIS 40S, BY THE SOUND OF HIM.
BUT I DIDN'T DARE TURN AROUND TO CHECK.
HE PRESSED THE PISTOL HARD AGAINST MY LOWER BACK.
PUSHING, PUSHING IT THROUGH MY SWEATER
UNTIL IT BRUISED MY FLESH.
HE TOLD ME TO GET DOWN ON ALL FOURS,
-LIKE A DOG.
-THANK YOU, JULIA, THAT IS ENOUGH.
-I'M NOT FINISHED.
-OH, YOU'RE FINISHED.
-HAVE A SEAT.
-I HAVE THREE PAGES LEFT.
THIS WASN'T THE ASSIGNMENT.
WELL, YOU ASSIGNED A CONFESSIONAL.
THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN TO YOU.
-HOW DO YOU KNOW?
-COME ON.
WHAT?
IT COULD HAVE.
-[GIRL] NOT LIKELY.
-[STUDENTS CHUCKLE]
MR. SNOW, THIS IS A NARRATIVE WRITING CLASS
AND I WROTE A NARRATIVE.
IT IS NOT YOUR PLACE TO CONDEMN MY SUBJECT.
BUT IT ABSOLUTELY IS MY PLACE TO CONDEMN INAPPROPRIATE MATERIAL.
HOW THE HELL CAN YOU CALL THIS INAPPROPRIATE?
YOU'RE NOT EVEN QUALIFIED TO JUDGE.
YOU'RE A MAN.
[FEMALE STUDENT] SO ARE YOU.
[STUDENTS LAUGH]
ALL RIGHT, OKAY, WE'RE DONE HERE.
I NEED TO SEE THE PRINCIPAL.
ARE YOU GOING TO GET HIM?
[RECEPTIONIST] SIGN IN AND SIT DOWN.
EWW.
POHL?
IS THAT "STARCHILD?"
YEAH.
POHL'S ONLY HALFWAY OKAY WHEN HE COLLABORATES
WITH OTHER WRITERS.
DID YOU EVER READ "THE SPACE MERCHANTS?"
MM-HMM.
IT'S PRETTY GOOD.
I THINK THIS ONE KINDA SUCKS THOUGH.
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WROTE.
OH, I-
- THIS--
-I DIDN'T MEAN FOR--
-I LIKED IT.
ARE YOU IN TROUBLE?
YEAH, I HAVE TO SEE A COUNSELOR.
YEAH, WELL, I'M HERE FOR ENACTING MY FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS.
I WROTE AN EROTIC FABLE.
WELL, IT WAS MORE OF A PARABLE.
IT'S A BIT MORE GROUNDED THAN YOURS, BUT--
YOU GET THE IDEA.
WHAT?
DO YOU WRITE OTHER STORIES, LIKE, UM--
LIKE EROTIC LITERATURE?
MM-HMM.
ALL THE TIME.
-IT'S ALL ONLINE.
-REALLY?
WHERE?
A RIDDLE.
EAT ME, DRINK ME.
WELL, GOOD LUCK, YOUNG JUVIE.
WAIT, YOU'RE LEAVING?
WHERE ARE THEY?
[GIRL] I DON'T THINK YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SMOKE.
[GIRL #2] MY MOM SMOKED WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH ME.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S-- IT'S NOT LIKE A MYTH.
IT'S A CIRCULATION THING.
NO, IT'S FINE.
[HORN HONKING]
WE GET IT, SHIT ASS!
ALL RIGHT, WHERE TO?
[BOTH GIRLS] THE MALL!
[GIRL NARRATING] HIS WAS THE WAY OF THE WARRIOR.
CRASS.
UNEDUCATED.
BUT STRONG.
HIS ABILITIES WOULD PROVE USELESS
IN THE ENCHANTED FOREST.
[NEIL NARRATING] WHERE THE ANCIENT INHABITANTS DWELLED
AND RECESSES OF ONE'S OWN MIND.
THE HUNTER PUSHED FORTH UNAWARE
FAIN HAD BEEN WATCHING HIM FROM THE MOMENT HE ENTERED.
NEIL!
IT'S NEIL, RIGHT?
ARE YOU WATCHING ME?
NO.
WELL, YEAH.
NO, I-
- I WAS JUST CURIOUS.
-ABOUT?
-WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE OTHER DAY.
WE TALKED THE OTHER DAY?
SORRY.
[LAUGHING] NEIL.
GOD, COME BACK.
I'M FUCKING WITH YOU.
-UM.
-IT'S COOL.
I WRITE SLASH, TOO.
YEAH, I KNOW.
I READ YOUR STUFF.
ALL OF IT.
YOUR FAN FIC IS AMAZING.
I SEE YOU GOT MY CODE.
[KNOCKS TWICE]
I DO LIKE WHAT YOU DID WITH THE FOREST GUARD
IN "MIDNIGHT COME LATELY."
THEY'RE REALLY UNDER UTILIZED IN CANON.
YEAH, THEY'RE CONCEPTUALLY AWESOME,
BUT I FEEL LIKE NOBODY GETS IT.
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE BEGGING US TO FIX 'EM.
YOU'RE DOING WHAT THEY WISHED THEY COULD DO
IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO ANSWER TO THE PUBLISHER.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
MAINSTREAM SUCCESS IS FOR CHUMPS.
YOU KNOW, LIKE, THE WOOD SPIRIT,
AND PAGAN GODS AND RITUAL MAGIC?
IT'S REALLY...
SEXUAL?
YEAH.
IT'S SO RICH.
ORGANIZED RELIGION JUST TOTALLY NUT CLIPPED
EVERYTHING THAT WAS GREAT ABOUT TRADITIONAL
FERTILITY RITUALS.
I MEAN, THAT'S THE ONLY PART ABOUT FAME
THAT I EVEN GIVE A SHIT ABOUT.
IT'S JUST A JUMPING OFF POINT.
IT'S FUNNY THAT THEY THINK IT'S KID'S STUFF,
BUT, LIKE, THERE'S ALL THIS SUBTEXT.
I KNOW.
I BET WE'RE THE ONLY TWO KIDS IN THIS ENTIRE JOINT
THAT KNOW ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT.
IT'S KIND OF SPECIAL.
YOU WANNA DITCH?
SCHOOL?
NO, I MEAN, YOU WANNA DIG A DITCH?
-LET'S GO.
-OH, I-
- I CAN'T
I HAVE A TEST IN SOCIAL STUDIES NEXT PERIOD.
IT'S ON THE INCAS.
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE A MIDTERM OR ANYTHING,
SO UM YEAH.
I LET MARTINE TAKE MY CAR TO WORK,
SO WE HAVE TO WALK.
BUT IT'S JUST THE MALL.
MARTINE'S CRAZY.
I MEAN, SHE'S PRETTY MUCH BEST FRIEND,
SHE'S JUST SORT OF A BITCH.
IS THAT-
- IS THAT THE PREGNANT GIRL?
[JULIA] "AT FRONTIER'S RIM?"
I HATE THESE THINGS.
THEY NEVER GET THE BOOK RIGHT.
WELL, I GUESS I'M LUCKY THAT FAIN HASN'T MADE
THE LEAP TO THE BIG SCREEN YET.
JUST IT PISSES ME OFF THAT WHENEVER I SEE VANGUARD IN MY HEAD
-THAT GUY...
-WELL, HE'S NOT YOUR CHARACTER.
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED FAN FIC.
-YEAH, BUT.
-YOU SEEN IT YET?
LIKE FIVE TIMES.
GOD DAMN IT.
SHE'S NOT GETTING OFF WORK UNTIL LIKE 6.
OKAY, I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO.
WILL IT BE-- SMELL LIKE...
WILL MY PARENTS BE ABLE TO TELL?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
IT'S COOL.
NO, I MEAN, I WANT TO, BUT...
[COUGHS]
THANK YOU.
[JULIA] UH!
SHUT YOUR DOOR.
-PUT YOUR SEAT DOWN.
-WHY?
WHAT, ARE YOU ASHAMED TO BE SEEN WITH ME?
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST-
- I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO IT.
THERE'S TOO MUCH BACKSTORY.
MIKE HOLLOWAY DROVE HIS TRUCK
THROUGH MY MOM'S MARIGOLDS WHEN I WAS TEN.
THEN HE GAVE HER THE FINGER.
I AM SO STONED.
HEADS UP, KNOB-GOBLIN!
UH!
HEY, WAKE UP!
LET'S GO.
MOVE.
MOVE TO THE BACK.
MOVE IT!
-GO TO THE BACK.
-OKAY.
OW!
I'M PREGNANT, BITCH!
YOU KNOW, YOUR ARM'S NOT PREGNANT, MORON.
JESUS, I THOUGHT THAT WAS MIKE.
YOU'RE REALLY TEARING THROUGH THEM THESE DAYS.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
HI.
I JUST DON'T GET WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING
FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF IN THE PARKING LOT.
WERE YOU LIKE BLOWING EACH OTHER?
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WRITING.
WHOA!
WAIT, YOU WRITE THAT SHIT, TOO?
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
WHO DO YOU HAVE FUCKING?
HARRY POTTER?
THOMAS THE TRAIN ENGINE?
I JUST GOTTA KNOW WHOSE FICTIONAL DICK
IS GOING IN WHOSE MADE-UP MOUTH.
YOU CAN'T EVEN READ.
YEAH, I CAN READ.
I READ ALL THE TIME.
I READ ACTUAL BOOKS FOR ADULTS.
-NOT BABY BOOKS.
-OKAY, NAME ONE.
"WUTHERING HEIGHTS," ASS BLOOD.
-THE BRONTE SISTERS WROTE FAN FIC.
-WHAT?
THE BRONTE SISTERS.
EMILY BRONTE,
OF "WUTHERING HEIGHTS," WROTE EROTIC FAN FICTION.
THEY'RE LIKE PIONEERS.
WOW.
IT'S REALLY GOOD MIKE ISN'T HERE TO FIND OUT
THAT YOU'RE STILL SUCH A FUCKING GEEEEEEK!
DUDE, YOU KNOW WEED STAYS IN YOUR SYSTEM
FOR LIKE TWO WEEKS.
ON YOUR CLOTHES, ON YOUR JACKET.
LEAVE HIM ALONE.
HEY, TOMORROW, 2:00.
LET'S MEET IN THE COURTYARD.
WE CAN DRIVE AROUND.
BYE.
[NEIL NARRATING] BELZAC AND DERON ZAXA HAD BEEN FIGHTING FOR HOURS.
SWEAT TINGED THE AIR OF THE WAR CHAMBER.
THAT WAS THE FIRST THING VANGUARD NOTICED AS HE ENTERED.
THE BULGE IN HIS LEATHER PANTS JUMPED TO ATTENTION--
ERECT MEMBER OUT OF-- SUDDENLY, BELZAC REENTERED--
HIS MOUTH, USUALLY ONLY ENGAGED IN ORDERING
SOLDIERS TO THEIR DEATHS, NOW FOUND ITS TRUE PURPOSE.
[WOMAN] WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS.
IF THE TRADE UNION CONTINUES TO BLOCK US AT EVERY TURN...
[MAN] BLOCK YOU?
BLOCK YOU.
YOUR ARMADA DESTROYED THE LAST--
-TWELVE.
-TWELVE SHIPMENTS OF ILLINIUM
-SENT TO PARAK MENOM.
-ONLY 12?
NOW 13.
IT'S AN EMBARGO.
A LEGAL EMBARGO.
ODD DEFINITION OF THE WORD LEGAL.
-ACTUALLY--
-OH, SO THAT'S WHY YOU BROUGHT YOUR...
MUSCLE?
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM US, DERON ZAXA.
YOU OR YOUR MUSCLE.
I WILL NOT BE MOCKED ABOARD MY OWN SHIP.
HIRED SHIP.
IT'S HIS FREIGHTER.
WHAT DO I PAY YOU FOR?
MOVE!
WHATEVER HE PAYS YOU, WE'LL DOUBLE IT.
ALLOW US TO SHOW YOU WHAT WE'LL PAY YOU FOR.
I DON'T HAVE ALL DAY.
[MAN] YES, SIR, VERY BUSY.
YOU HAVE A LUNCH AT... 1300.
CHRIST!
GOD!
[NEIL NARRATING] ZAXA'S HAND REACHED DOWN-- DOWN TO HIS ZIPPER.
THE AMBIENT HUMIDITY IN THE ROOM
REACHED A LEVEL THAT SET OFF THE CLIMATE KLAXON.
BUT ZAXA COULDN'T...
OR WOULDN'T...
STOP.
HEY, NEIL.
GOD I SUCKED TODAY.
YOU WERE REALLY GOOD.
THAT ACCENT IS, IT'S OUT OF CONTROL.
I THINK IT'S FUNNY WHEN YOU DO IT LIKE THAT.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A COMEDY, RIGHT?
YEAH, I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT.
SEE, THAT'S WHY I LIKE YOU, MAN.
YOU ALWAYS MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.
SO YOU GET LIKE TOUCHED INAPPROPRIATELY BY THE DOCTOR?
NO, HE JUST PUTS GOO ALL OVER YOUR BELLY.
-IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
-YEAH.
YOU HAVE NO CLUE HOW BIG A SPECULUM IS.
IT'S LIKE THREE ADULT DICKS GLUED TOGETHER.
SOUNDS LIKE ME THOUGH.
HEY, SNOOP DOG!
COME HERE!
-WELL, WHO'S THIS?
-JULIA'S NEW BOYFRIEND.
-JEALOUS?
-FOR REAL?
WHAT'S UP, BRO?
I'M MIKE.
OW.
I'M NEIL.
-WELL, I GUESS I OWE YOU ONE, NEIL.
-YOU DO?
YEAH, FOR TAKING LITTLE MISS ELF QUEST OFF MY HANDS.
SHE HAS BEEN UP MY HOLE LIKE 24-7.
HEY, FETUS.
SO LONG, KIDDIES, LET'S RIDE AROUND.
[MIKE] BETTER NOT LEAK ON MY SEATS, MARTINE.
[MARTINE] I DON'T LEAK.
IT ALL STAYS IN ME.
FOR LIKE ANOTHER TWO MONTHS.
[MIKE] GROSS.
HEY, I WANNA TELL YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.
THERE'S A CON IN HOUSTON COMING UP.
LIKE A COMIC CON?
YES, LIKE A COMIC CON.
A BIG ONE.
THE RABBIT'S HOLE IS HOSTING A PRIVATE MIXER.
-IT'S INVITE ONLY.
-OH, YEAH.
-I THINK I HEARD OF THAT.
-WELL, I GOT INVITED.
REALLY?
COOL.
YEAH, THERE'S A LIVE READ, TOO.
I MEAN, THAT'S ONLY FOR ROCK STARS,
SO, I DON'T WANNA BE PRESUMPTUOUS OR WHATEVER,
BUT I THINK THEY MIGHT ASK ME.
YOU CAN STILL GET INVITED.
YOU JUST NEED TO UPLOAD YOUR DAMN WORK.
YEAH, BUT...
DON'T YOU HAVE TO BE 18?
YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF MY STUFF IS...
-I DON'T KNOW!
-COME ON, IT'S GOOD.
YOU BARELY EVEN READ ANY.
WELL, IT'S GOTTA BE GOOD.
I MEAN, YOU'RE SO REPRESSED.
THAT SHIT HAS GOTTA COME OUT SOMEHOW.
DROP US OFF AT NEIL'S HOUSE!
OH, MAN, I THOUGHT YOU WERE JOKING.
EXACTLY HOW I IMAGINED IT.
I GUESS IT'S PRETTY DRAB.
MY MOM'S BEEN KIND OF AWAY.
MOMENT OF TRUTH.
CRACK HER OPEN.
JULIA, I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN FOR THESE TO BE SEEN BY ANYBODY.
YES, YOU DID.
OTHERWISE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE WRITTEN THEM.
I CAN'T WATCH.
-I THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T WATCH.
-SORRY.
OH, MY GOD.
DO THESE GIRLS ACTUALLY WEAR SPACE BIKINIS?
IT'S CEREMONIAL.
THEY WERE GIVEN--
IT'S NOT MY IDEA.
WELL, I JUST LIKE THAT THERE'S ACTUAL GIRLS IN HERE.
WOW, YOU ARE ONE TWISTED FUCK.
I LOVE IT.
-OOH, PREPARE TO BE ANALIZED!
-IT'S NOT A TOY.
IT'S NOT A TOY.
THAT'S SO WEIRD.
-IT LOOKS LIKE A TOY.
-YOU'RE GONNA BREAK IT.
-THAT'S CRAZY.
-WHOA!
SAY YOUR SPACE PRAYERS, SUCKA.
AM I INTERRUPTING?
DON'T YOU KNOCK?
UM, DAD IS WORKING LATE.
THERE'S FOOD IN THE FRIDGE.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
OH, MY BAND HAS A SHOW.
WHAT'S YOUR BAND?
DANCE OR DIE.
IT SOUNDS AWESOME.
YEAH, WELL, IT'S PRETTY STUPID.
I BET YOU'RE REALLY GOOD.
-JUST GET OUT!
-ALL RIGHT.
I'M OFF.
I HAVE TO PICK UP TIM.
IT SMELLS LIKE SWEAT IN HERE.
WHAT WAS THAT?
I'M BISEXUAL, JUST SO YOU KNOW.
EWW, SHE'S NOT EVEN GAY.
ALL WOMEN ARE BISEXUAL.
ALL OF THEM.
MY FIRST BLOG, CLITORA MAJORA,
IS ALL ABOUT IT.
-SO, YOU READY?
-NO.
FOR WHAT?
IT'S TIME TO UPLOAD.
I DON'T THINK I'M READY.
DUDE, THEY ONLY SEND INVITES TO WRITERS WHO POST.
AND BESIDES, WRITERS, REAL WRITERS,
LET PEOPLE READ THEIR SHIT.
AND YOUR SHIT IS GOOD.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS MINE,
BUT TRADITIONALLY BOYS DON'T WRITE VERY GOOD EROTICA.
-SO, BY THOSE STANDARDS--
-OKAY, FINE.
JUST, STOP TALKING.
[SIGHS]
REALLY?
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT ARE YOU LIKE THE ONE PERSON
ON THE ENTIRE INTERNET THAT DOESN'T LIE ABOUT THEIR AGE?
-ARE YOU A MENNONITE?
-NO.
I JUST, I DON'T WANT TO MISREPRESENT MYSELF.
OKAY.
I'M GONNA GO OUT ON A LIMB HERE
AND SAY THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT MISREPRESENTING YOURSELF.
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS BECAUSE ONCE YOU DO,
YOU'RE ONE OF US.
IT'S THE FINAL LINE.
THE LAST TABOO.
[SIGH]
WELL, THERE'S NO TURNING BACK, VAN FAN.
IT'S IN GOD'S HANDS NOW.
WHAT?
CAN WE JUST TURN COMMENTS OFF?
NO, DUDE, IT'S PART OF THE PUBLIC RECORD NOW.
YOU'RE KILLING ME.
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE.
I LIKE THE WAY YOU EAT.
NEIL, WHEN WE WERE HORSING AROUND,
DID YOU GET A BONER?
-LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF A BONER?
-NO!
OKAY.
IT'S COOL IF YOU DID.
I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE--
WHAT?
NOTHING.
IT'S COOL IF YOU POPPED A CHUB.
GOD, SHUT UP.
[HORN HONKING]
-YO.
-WHERE'S MARTINE?
I DON'T KNOW.
AT THE ABORTION CLINIC WITH HER MOM.
WANNA GRAB SOME FOOD?
WE CAN GO TO FOOTLONGERS AND GET SOME SUBS.
WATCH "CELEBRITY APPRENTICE" AT MY PLACE.
AND BY YOUR PLACE YOU MEAN YOUR MOM'S BASEMENT?
YEAH, WHATEVER.
I GOT WEED.
YOU WANNA COME?
WHOA!
WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I LOOK LIKE?
A FUCKING FULL SERVICE FOOD COURT?
NO, THAT'S OKAY.
I'VE GOT MATH HOMEWORK.
SEE, HE'S GOT MATH HOMEWORK.
HE'S GOT A FUTURE.
FUCK YOU.
NEIL, REALLY GREAT WORK TODAY.
[JULIA NARRATING] I HAVE YOU NYMPH.
THE HOT BREATH IS HIS VOICE IN HER ELONGATED, ELFIN EAR.
THE EAR THAT TO NYMPH KIND,
SECONDED AS A HIGHLY EROGENOUS ZONE.
FAIN WAS LOST UNTO HERSELF.
HIS NAME NOW KNOWN TO HER.
MICHAEL.
SIR MICHAEL.
MY SWEET MICHAEL.
ALL RIGHT, SO NICKLEPENNY COMES THROUGH THE DOOR
MINUS HIS PANTS.
HOLLYCOTTON IS SURPRISED
AND CROSSES TO L-6.
[GASPS] MR. NICKLEPENNY!
-I THOUGHT YOU WERE--
-ACROSS THE HALL?
THIS MANSION IS STILL QUITE A MYSTERY TO ME.
OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
THAT'S TOO MUCH.
REVERSE.
NO, NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT EITHER.
LOOK, I HAVE A TEST IN 30 MINUTES,
AND I'M NOT GOING TO FAIL BECAUSE OF YOUR SLOW ASS.
AND HOW LONG DID WE WAIT FOR YOU TO GET OFF-BOOK?
FUCK YOU!
I HAVE DYSLEXIA.
MISS LEWIS, THIS IS A TECH REHEARSAL
AND I CAN'T PUT UP WITH HER ANYMORE.
I TAKE DYSLEXIA MEDICATION.
[MISS LEWIS] JESSIE, TAKE A BREAK.
NEIL, HEY.
NEIL!
HUH?
COULD YOU BE SO KIND AS TO RELIEVE MISS HUNT FOR A MOMENT?
I CAN'T PUT UP WITH HER--
CAN YOU IMAGINE HAVING TO DEAL WITH HER PARENTS?
SO, JESSIE TELLS ME YOU'RE A WRITER.
YOU REALLY FREAKED HER OUT.
-OH, I DIDN'T MEAN TO.
-DUDE, THAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN.
THIS PLACE COULD USE SOME SUBVERSION.
YEAH, UM, IN AP ENGLISH, WE GOT TO READ OSCAR WILDE--
-SO YOU GONNA LET ME READ IT?
-OH.
OKAY, LET'S TAKE IT FROM THE DOUBLE ENTENDRE.
IT SEEMS THAT HORACE HAS MISTAKENLY
TAKEN MY CLOTHES.
THANKFULLY NOT ALL OF THEM.
YES, THANKFULLY.
OH-
- IT'S COTTON.
COTTON'S A VERY VERSATILE FABRIC,
DON'T YOU THINK?
EXTREMELY PLIABLE TO A MAN'S TOUCH.
WHAT APPEARS COURSE,
NOW IN MY HANDS IS SO VERY, VERY SOFT.
[LAUGHING] OH, MY GOD.
OH, LISTEN TO THIS, "DERON ZAXA,
EVER THE ORATOR, PUT HIS MOUTH TO QUITE A DIFFERENT PURPOSE NOW."
DUDE, THIS DERON ZAXA GUY IS YOU STRAIGHT UP.
-NEIL.
-YOU DO KNOW HE'S STRAIGHT, RIGHT?
THANKS.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DRIVE MY CAR.
ARE YOU CRYING?
NO.
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'RE CRYING.
NEVER DRINK VODKA FROM A PLASTIC JUG WITH A HANDLE.
OKAY.
MIKE HOLLOWAY IS PURE DICK CHEESE.
NEIL, I HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU.
SOMETHING I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT FOR A WHILE.
I THINK YOU USE TOO MUCH FLOWERY PROSE.
WHAT?
YOU SAY THINGS LIKE, "HE STROKED HIS VELVET ROD,"
WHEN YOU SHOULD BE LIKE, "HE PUMPED HIS STONE COCK."
READERS RESPOND BETTER TO DIRECT LANGUAGE.
THANKS.
I CAN IMPART THE WISDOM OF OUR ONE YEAR
AGE DIFFERENCE, YOU KNOW?
UM, YOUR MOM HAS A LOT OF RELIGIOUS STUFF.
YEAH, I THINK THAT'S WHY MY DAD KILLED HIMSELF.
HE WAS GAY, YOU KNOW.
MY DAD, HE KEPT IT TO HIMSELF.
I GUESS HE PREFERRED DEATH TO COMING OUT.
MAN, DO YOU REALLY THINK BEING GAY KILLED HIM?
I DON'T WANNA BE HERE WHEN MY MOM GETS HOME.
WHAT?
MOM'S HOME.
STAY HERE.
I-
- I HAD TO PRINT SOMETHING FOR WORK.
YOU KNOW WE'VE ALWAYS SUPPORTED YOUR INTERESTS.
AND THE INTERNET IS, WOW, AN INCREDIBLE TOOL.
-WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.
-I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS JUST 'CAUSE
INFORMATION IS OUT THERE, DOESN'T MEAN IT'S ACCURATE.
WE JUST DON'T WANT YOU GETTING PARTICULAR INFORMATION, YOU KNOW,
-FROM THE WRONG SOURCES.
-I'M 15.
HEY, YOU CAN READ WHATEVER YOU WANT.
WE'RE FINE WITH THAT.
AS LONG AS YOU'RE READING.
UH-HUH, AS LONG AS IT'S NOT "MEIN KAMPF."
BUT ACTUALLY, WELL, "MEIN KAMPF" IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY INTERESTING READ.
HONEY, I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL AWKWARD ABOUT THIS.
IF YOU WANT TO READ INTELLIGENT PROSE ON HUMAN SEXUALITY
I CAN MAKE YOU A READING LIST.
EWW!
NO!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN INTELLIGENT?
WELL, IT'S JUST WHOEVER WROTE THAT STORY ON YOUR COMPUTER,
THEY OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE THE FIRST CLUE
ABOUT ACTUAL HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS.
[MOTHER] IT'S DEMENTED.
I DON'T THINK YOUR MOTHER'S TALKING ABOUT
-THE HOMOSEXUAL CONTENT, NOT PARTICULARLY.
-PLEASE STOP.
IT'S JUST MORE OF A BASIC PLOTTING PROBLEM.
YOU'RE ABSORBING MATERIAL THAT HAS SOME RUDIMENTARY
GRAMMATICAL ERRORS IN IT.
YOU'VE GOT SENTENCE FRAGMENTS,
YOU'VE GOT DANGLING PARTICIPLES.
I ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN HELPING NEIL WITH HIS WRITING.
-HUH.
-HE'S GOT A LOT OF INNATE TALENT.
HE JUST USES TOO MUCH FLOWERY PROSE.
THERE'S NO FLOWERY PROSE!
NEIL TELLS ME YOU TWO ARE CONSIDERING A SPLIT?
-[FATHER] WHAT?
-I'M SORRY.
I JUST THOUGHT I COULD PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT,
SINCE MY PARENTS ARE DIVORCED.
[FATHER] I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
OPEN AND HONEST DIALOG IS KEY
TO MAINTAINING A STABLE RELATIONSHIP.
-IS IT NOW?
-TOTALLY.
I WRITE ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.
THAT AND BE HONEST ABOUT ONE'S OWN SEXUAL DESIRES.
-IT'S RARE THAT ANYONE EVER IS.
-HUH.
I EDIT A LIT JOURNAL ON WOMEN'S STUDIES.
I PLAN TO PURSUE THAT IN COLLEGE.
-WOMEN'S STUDIES?
-YEAH, FEMALE SEXUALITY
IN LITERATURE, SPECIFICALLY.
REVERSE GENDER ROLES IN POP CULTURE,
SEXUAL SUBMISSIVE HIERARCHY,
RAPE PARADIGMS.
I ACTUALLY WROTE A 22 PAGE THESIS ON THE CONCEPT
OF VENEREAL DISEASE AS A FEMALE GUILT TRIGGER.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
I DID A PAPER ON MONOTREMES, REMEMBER?
ARE MONOTREMES A FORM OF VD?
DON'T BE EMBARRASSED, NEIL.
IT'S NATURAL.
YEAH, NEIL, DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.
IT'S NATURAL.
-DO YOU EVER READ ANY ONLINE--
-DAD!
-I ACTUALLY WRITE ONLINE
-POETRY.
[NEIL] ONLINE POETRY.
LADY POETRY.
-ABOUT STRONG WOMEN.
-LADY POETRY?
YOU REALLY NEED TO BRING FRIEND AROUND MORE OFTEN.
DID NEIL TELL YOU GUYS ABOUT THE CONVENTION?
-[FATHER] THE COMIC CON?
-IT'S ALSO FOR WRITERS.
NEIL, YOU DIDN'T MENTION THAT.
IT'S FOR REGULAR WRITERS!
-[MOTHER] IS THAT TRUE?
-DEFINE REGULAR.
I THINK SHE MEANS NON-EROTIC.
ARE YOU GUYS CRAZY?
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I WOULD GO TO AN EROTIC WRITING CONVENTION?
I DON'T KNOW!
WHY WOULD YOU HAVE IT ON YOUR COMPUTER?
I MEAN, DO THEY HAVE THAT-- WHAT WAS THE NAME?
-UH-- VANG--
-VANGUARD EROTICA.
-PLEASE STOP SAYING "EROTICA" AT THE DINNER TABLE.
-NO, PLEASE DON'T.
I JUST NEED TO KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO A PLACE FOR ADULTS.
YEAH, MOM HAS A STRICT NO SEX DUNGEON POLICY.
I'M NOT.
WE'RE NOT!
[MOTHER] YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIE TO ME, YOU KNOW.
YOUR MOM IS NOT AS SQUARE AS YOU THINK.
I EVEN WENT TO A KEY PARTY ONCE.
WHEN DID YOU GO TO A KEY PARTY?
I'M NOT LYING.
GOOD.
GOOD.
SO SPEAKING OF WRITING, HOW MUCH DO YOU GUYS KNOW
ABOUT THE BRONTE SISTERS?
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, NO, NEIL, YOU HAVE TO GET PAST THIS REPRESSION.
YEAH, WELL, WHY DON'T I COME BY
AND GIVE A LECTURE ON THE SEXUAL FANTASIES
OF EMILY BRONTE TO YOUR MOM.
YOUR PARENTS ARE COOL.
YOU'RE LUCKY.
OUR SITUATIONS ARE SO DIFFERENT.
-YOU TOLD ME THAT YOUR DAD KILLED HIMSELF.
-HE DID.
"OH, HEY, NEIL'S PARENTS, WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
GIVE YOU SOME INSIGHT BECAUSE MY PARENTS ARE DIVORCED."
-YOU DON'T GET IT.
-YEAH, I DON'T.
WHAT?
WELL, I'M PICKING YOU UP TOMORROW AT 9 AM,
SO BE READY.
-SOME DINNER, HUH?
-SORRY.
HEY, I LIKE HER.
SHE'S A CHARACTER.
WELL, LEMME GUESS.
I CAN'T GO NOW?
DAD.
I'M GOOD.
TAKE IT.
TAKE IT.
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN I USED TO TAKE YOU
TO THOSE AUTOGRAPH CONVENTIONS?
YEAH.
REMEMBER WHEN YOU STOOD IN LINE FOR TWO HOURS
TO TRY TO GET BUTCH PATRICK TO SIGN
YOUR MUNSTERS LUNCH BOX?
AND THEN HE WOULDN'T.
[LAUGHING] BUTCH PATRICK WAS A DICK.
[LAUGHING]
ALL RIGHT, AS FAR AS YOUR MOM KNOWS,
YOU'RE STAYING AT YOUR COUSIN'S, ALL RIGHT?
AND I'M COUNTING ON YOU TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
AT LEAST NOT TO DO, NOT TO DO THE WRONG THING.
SHE'S MORE MATURE THAN YOU.
HUH?
IN SOME WAYS?
I MEAN, MAYBE MATURE IS NOT THE RIGHT WORD.
DAD.
YOU REALLY LIKE THIS GIRL, DON'T YOU?
I LIKED THE SAME TYPE.
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE I DID.
BUT BE CAREFUL, HUH?
THESE ARTY GIRLS--
I DON'T WANNA SEE YOU GET HURT, OKAY?
ALL RIGHT, GOOD TALK, RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
HOLA!
NEIL, YOUR FRIENDS ARE MULTIPLYING.
IS THAT A PREGNANT JOKE?
THIS SHIT IS GETTING SUPER OLD.
WE'RE NOT LETTING HER DO THIS AGAIN.
YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT ABOUT ME, BUT I'M NOT A FUCKING FLAKE.
-WHAT HAPPENED?
-MIKE HAPPENED.
FUCKING DOUCHEBAG.
IT'S A GOOD THING I WENT BY THERE.
-SHE'S NOT GONNA GO?
-OH, SHE'S GOING.
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU.
LOOK AT WHAT YOU DO TO YOURSELF FOR HER, DUMB ASS.
THAT'S FINE.
I FEEL KIND OF RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU.
I MEAN, YOU'RE JUST LIKE HER WHEN WE FIRST MET.
I LIKED HER 'CAUSE SHE WAS ALL SMART AND FUNNY,
AND SHE TRIED SO HARD TO BE MY FRIEND.
AND SHE WOULD, LIKE, OFFER TO DO MY HOMEWORK AND SHIT.
AND I WOULD JUST MAKE FUN OF HER COSTUMES AND STUFF.
YOU KNOW SHE USED TO DRESS LIKE AN ELF, RIGHT?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DIDN'T THINK I TRIED TO CHANGE HER.
I MEAN I TOOK HER OUT WITH MIKE, AND THAT WAS IT.
I GUESS HE WAS LIKE THE FIRST NORMAL GUY
TO EVER TAKE INTEREST IN HER.
HE'S NORMAL?
DON'T CHANGE FOR HER, DUDE.
DON'T LET HER BE YOUR MIKE.
[HORN HONKING]
-PLEASE BE QUIET, OKAY?
MY MOM'S SLEEPING.
-SHE HERE?
-YES.
-THEN WHAT THE FUCK, DUDE,
-WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?
-I DON'T--
SHE TOLD NEIL SHE WOULD TAKE HIM TO COMIC CON.
HOLY SHIT.
THAT'S AMAZING.
DUDE.
OH, HO, DUDE, PLEASE GET OUT.
I NEED A BETTER LOOK AT THIS.
THIS COMING FROM A GUY IN HIS PAJAMAS.
I'M LISTEN-
- I'M NOT BUSTING YOUR BALLS.
I PROMISE YOU.
JUST COME ON.
-I NEED A FUCKING PICTURE.
-[MARTINE] YOU'RE SUCH A DICK.
I'M NOT THE ONE MAKING A SCENE, OKAY, MARTINE?
YOU'RE THE ONE MAKING A SCENE RIGHT NOW.
COME ON, GET UP.
GIVE ME A LITTLE, GIVE ME A LITTLE TWIRLY TWIRL.
OH, MAN, I'M NOT NEARLY STONED ENOUGH FOR THIS RIGHT NOW.
OH!
WHAT THE FUCK!
JESUS!
-I ONLY WANTED A PICTURE, FREAK.
-YOU ARE THE FREAK.
YOU AND YOUR STUPID FUCKING MUSTACHE.
OW.
YO, BRO.
YOU EVER SEE THOSE UM-- YOU EVER SEE THOSE PICTURES
I TOOK OF HER WEARING THAT ELF SHIT?
WELL, SOMETIMES ALL SHE WORE WERE THOSE LITTLE EARS.
YEAH, THOSE WERE MY SPECIAL PICS.
NEIL!
GET THE FUCK OFF!
OH, GALADRIEL.
BABE, I KNEW YOU WERE A NERD.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A FUCKING RETARD.
WHOA!
OH, SHIT!
OH!
THIS IS FUNNY.
YOU'RE FUCKING CRAZY.
YOU CAN'T BE ALL STOIC IN THAT COSTUME.
IT LOOKS RIDICULOUS.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
I AM WORRIED ABOUT DRIVING FOR THREE HOURS
WITH A GUILT-BOT PROGRAMMED TO GUILT ME TO DEATH.
HOW CAN YOU HANG OUT WITH THAT GUY?
HE'S LIKE EVERYTHING YOU PRETEND TO HATE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "PRETEND?"
NOTHING.
JUST FORGET IT.
YOU ARE ACTING LIKE A REALLY JEALOUS BOYFRIEND RIGHT NOW.
WELL, I'M NOT YOUR BOYFRIEND.
YEAH, YOU'RE NOT.
HEY, I'M SORRY.
OKAY, I KNOW-- I KNOW THAT MIKE
BRINGS OUT THE WORST IN ME.
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, IT WAS, LIKE, REALLY COOL
WHEN YOU KNOCKED HIM DOWN.
FUCKER.
[LAUGHS]
I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
ABOUT THE LIVE READ.
I KNOW ALREADY.
I SAW.
IT WAS POSTED ON THE FORUM.
CONGRATS.
I TOLD YOU IT WAS GOOD.
-DID THEY WRITE YOU?
-MM-HMM, YEAH.
THEY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THE NUMBER OF SLOTS.
POLITICS AGAIN.
POLITICS.
I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU TRANSCENDED ALL OF THAT.
YEAH.
WELCOME TO COMIC CON.
WHAT NAME IS YOUR RESERVATION UNDER?
HOW DO YOU KNOW WE'RE HERE FOR COMIC CON?
EMILY BRONTE.
ALL RIGHT, MISS BRONTE,
I HAVE YOU DOWN FOR A SINGLE KING?
OH, CAN WE GET TWO BEDS?
UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE AT CAPACITY.
THAT'S OKAY.
WE'LL SLEEP TOGETHER.
SWANKY.
IT'S BIG.
COME HERE.
TRY THIS OUT!
I DON'T WANNA MESS UP MY COSTUME.
DID YOU TALK TO THEM YET?
NO, DO I NEED TO?
YOU'RE READING TOMORROW.
IF IT WERE ME, I WOULD BE CHECKING UP ON LIKE
THE ORDER OF THE LINEUP AND HOW MUCH TIME I HAVE,
AND HOW I'M GONNA BE TAPED AND SHIT.
TAPED?
WHY WOULD THEY TAPE IT?
I DON'T WANT TO BE ON TAPE.
THAT'S NORMAL, OKAY?
YOU NEED TO RELAX.
YOU'RE SO FUCKING NUTS.
JESUS.
WHAT'S WITH YOU?
YOU LOOK LIKE HOW I LOOK
WHEN I'M TRYING TO AVOID SOMEONE.
OKAY, SO WE HAVE THE OPENING NIGHT PARTY TONIGHT.
AND THEN TOMORROW WE HAVE WRITER EVALS 'TIL FIVE,
THEN THE SLASH MIXER, AND THEN THE LIVE READ.
HELLO!
PERSON TALKING TO YOU I.R.L.
SORRY.
UM-- I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GAWK AT YOUR PHONE SOMEWHERE
WHERE I CAN'T GIVE YOU SHIT ABOUT IT.
-FINE, I'LL LEAVE IT.
-NO, DON'T DO IT FOR ME, DUDE.
I'M JUST TRYING TO BUST YOU OUT
OF YOUR SELF-INDUCED SOCIAL MEDIA PRISON.
YOU'VE REALLY OPENED MY EYES.
THROW OFF THE SHACKLES!
THROW 'EM OFF!
[MAN] WIZARDS MAN.
WAND-ON-WAND ACTION.
THAT'S WHAT THE READERS WANT.
IT'S CASTING A SPELL ON MY WAND,
-I'LL TELL YOU THAT.
-YEAH.
BUT THAT HARRY-DRACO GENRE, THAT'S GETTING OLD.
NOW WHAT I'M INTO IS THAT SNAPE-DUMBLEDORE FIC.
WOW, THAT IS LITERALLY OLD.
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE INTO OCTOGENARIANS?
YEAH, WELL, UH, VANGUARD IS NO SPRING CHICKEN.
EASY.
WELL, USUALLY.
HEY.
OH, DID YOU READ THAT STORY I SENT YOU,
"PANTY RAID AT SLYTHERIN"?
OH, YEAH, DUDE.
I CALLED MY MOM.
I READ IT OUT LOUD.
FINALLY.
COME ON.
WE GOT BUSINESS TO CONDUCT.
I THINK I'D RATHER GO LOOK AT COMICS.
NEIL, THIS IS TOHO.
[SPEAKING IN JAPANESE]
WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING?
I DUNNO.
TOHO?
UH, HMMM...
IS BLUE.
IT'S BLUE.
WORKS FOR ME.
THAT IS A SICK VANGUARD COSTUME
YOU'VE GOT THERE, BRO.
IS THAT FROM "KRAGON'S WAR?"
ANYWAYS, SO-- MY NAME IS HAGOFF PAUL
AND THIS IS A LITTLE GREETING.
IS THAT?
IS THAT LSD?
FOR THE PARTY TONIGHT, PLAYBOY.
IT'S MOLLY.
MDMA?
-NO, NO.
-IT LOOKS LIKE ACID.
IT'S ECSTASY.
HAVE YOU EVER DONE THAT BEFORE?
NO, BUT I WANT TO.
THAT STUFF STAYS IN YOUR SYSTEM FOREVER.
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF AN ACID FLASHBACK?
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP IN A YEAR
AND STAB MY PARENTS TO DEATH WITH A KITCHEN KNIFE, OKAY?
WELL, THAT MAKES ONE OF US.
WHAT IF IT RUINS THE WHOLE WEEKEND?
WHAT IF WE MISS THE LIVE READING
BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE HOSPITAL GETTING OUR STOMACH'S PUMPED?
WE ARE GOING TO A PARTY
WITH ALL SORTS OF LIGHTS AND COSTUMES, OKAY?
-DO YOU NORMALLY GO TO PARTIES, NEIL?
-NO.
-DO YOU LIKE TO MINGLE?
-NO.
-OPEN YOUR MOUTH, PLAYBOY.
-NO...
JULIA.
THERE WE GO.
OH, WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T SWALLOW.
[GARBLED] WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I SWALLOW IT?
[MUSIC PLAYING]
♪ WE'RE GOING BACK AND FORTH WE'RE GOING BACK AND FORTH ♪
I'M HALLUCINATING!
IT'S NOT ACID!
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
HOLD HER THERE.
OFF, OFF, OFF, OFF.
-I'M SICK.
-OKAY.
[GROANS]
I'M SO STONED.
STONED ON ACID.
I MEAN, MOLLY--
THIS MUST BE LIKE EVERY DAY FOR MADONNA.
HERE.
DRINK SOME WATER.
OH, OKAY.
OH.
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.
YOU'RE IN A TOTALLY SAFE PLACE.
WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE UH...
EVER BEEN ATTRACTED TO ANYONE BEFORE YOU.
YOU MEAN ANY GIRL.
ANY HUMAN BEING.
WHAT ARE YOU ATTRACTED TO ABOUT ME?
I'M NOT ASHAMED OF MYSELF WITH YOU.
SHOULD I HAVE DONE THAT?
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT.
PANTS.
-ARE YOU DOING YOUR HOMEWORK?
-NO.
"JULIA TUGGED AT HIS PANTS,
SLIDING THEM DOWN EVER SO SLOWLY."
OKAY, IF YOU'RE GONNA WRITE ABOUT US,
YOU NEED TO USE SOME MODIFIERS.
"JULIA TUGGED AT HIS TIGHT PANTS,
SLIDING THEM OFF PAINFULLY SLOW.
SAVORING THE MOMENT THE HEIGHTENED
PLEASURE INVOLVED."
I'M GLAD YOU DECIDED TO BRANCH OUT.
YOU'RE A TOUGH ONE TO FIGURE OUT.
NO, I'M NOT.
[PHONE RINGING]
HI, YOU'VE REACHED JULIA'S VOICEMAIL.
I PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
[PHONE RINGING]
HI, YOU'VE REACHED JULIA'S VOICEMAIL.
I PROBABLY--
THE ALLITERATION IS GOOD, BUT YOU USE IT WAY TOO MUCH.
YEAH, IT'S SORT OF MY CRUTCH.
AND THE ALLEGORY IS A BIT ON-THE-NOSE.
OH, I ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WAS MORE OF A METAPHOR THAN AN ALLEGORY.
UH, DO YOU KNOW WHAT AN ALLEGORY IS?
LOOK, YOU'RE OKAY.
UH, AND YOU'RE FEMALE.
WE NEED MORE WOMEN IN OUR FIELD.
MOST OF THEM ARE PRETTY UGLY.
UNLIKE YOU.
YOU CAN HAVE A CAREER.
WRITING IS MORE THAN JUST WRITING.
THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS.
DUDE, I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
IT'S A-- IT'S A TIJUANA BIBLE.
IT'S QUITE THE IMPORTANT ARTIFACT.
MEXICANS ARE FAR MORE SEXUALLY LIBERATED.
WHAT'S WITH THE LOOK?
YOU JUST LEFT THIS MORNING.
YEAH, I WAS GETTING A CRITIQUE.
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.
TO MEET THE PROS.
I'M SORRY.
HEY.
I HAVE TO GO MEET SOMEONE.
WHO?
DENIS?
SORRY, I LOOKED THROUGH YOUR PHONE.
I DIDN'T THINK THAT YOU WOULD CARE.
HEY-
- DON'T!
DON'T DO THAT.
-WHAT'S YOUR DEAL?
-NOTHING.
DON'T GET ALL WEIRD ON ME JUST BECAUSE WE MESSED AROUND.
WHY DID YOU RIP UP OUR PAGES?
I DON'T KNOW.
WE WERE ZONKED.
WE WROTE SOME CRAZY SHIT, OKAY?
I DIDN'T WANT IT JUST FLOATING AROUND.
SO LAST NIGHT WAS JUST THE DRUGS?
YOU HAVE BEEN HIDING THIS DENIS GUY FROM ME.
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK THAT YOU WERE STRAIGHT.
CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
HOW ABOUT NOW?
I'LL CHECK MY BARS.
THAT'S BETTER.
OH, I'M SORRY.
THIS IS AGE RESTRICTED.
HI.
OH, MY GOD, NEIL.
OH, I'M SO SORRY.
I UH-
- I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO LOOK UH, SO YOUNG.
-UH, DO YOU WANNA SEE MY ID?
-NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, I'M SORRY, BELIEVE ME, I LOOKED YOUNG
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE, TOO.
UH, WHEN I WAS 18.
-YOU STILL LOOK YOUNG.
-OH, WELL, THANK YOU.
OH, MY GOD, IT'S JUST SO GREAT TO UH, FINALLY MEET YOU,
IN THE FLESH, SO TO SPEAK, UM...
-YEAH.
-YEAH.
-OH, YES, OF COURSE.
SHALL WE?
-YEAH.
YOU'RE STARING.
VIRGINS STARE.
-THEY DO?
-YEAH, WELL, CON VIRGINS.
YEAH, IT'S JUST SO WEIRD NOW THAT IT'S ALL IN 3-D.
YEAH, I KNOW.
INTERNET RULE 34.
IF IT EXISTS THERE'S PORN OF IT.
JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL.
I JUST DISCOVERED WHAT A CURTAIN FIC IS.
-CURTAIN FIC?
-MM-HMM.
I MEAN, OKAY, SO, THIS IS AIMED AT OLDER GAYS.
OF COURSE THEY'RE LIKE POST-SEX,
PROTO-NESTING, DOMESTIC FETISHISTS.
AND SO NORMALLY WHERE YOU'D HAVE LIKE KIRK AND SPOCK,
YOU KNOW, [CLICKING HIS TONGUE] MAKING LOVE,
UH, IN THIS CASE, IT'S COUPLES HAVING THESE LIKE LAVISH SHOPPING SPREES
AT POTTERY BARN.
FOR CURTAINS.
THEY SELL CURTAINS AT POTTERY BARN?
THEY SELL EVERYTHING AT POTTERY BARN.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT'S MOSTLY HARMLESS I GUESS,
BUT NOT ALL OF IT IS...
AND YOU REALLY NEED TO WATCH OUT FOR CREEPS,
ESPECIALLY AT YOUR AGE.
-BUT YOU'RE NOT A CREEP.
-NO, I'M NOT A CREEP,
BUT ISN'T THAT EXACTLY WHAT A CREEP WOULD SAY?
[PHONE RINGS]
OH, I THOUGHT YOU CAME ALONE.
OH, JESUS, SPEAKING OF CREEPY.
I CAME WITH A FRIEND.
OH, AND DOES HE WRITE SLASH?
SHE.
AND YEAH.
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, I THINK SHE'S IN REGULAR WRITING TODAY.
OH, REGULAR WRITING.
-DENIS.
-OH, RONNIE, HEY, UM, THIS IS NEIL.
-HE'S ONE OF OUR NEW WRITERS.
-OH, YEAH, I BET.
RONNIE HARWOOD.
I'M SENIOR WRITER AT THE RABBIT'S HOLE.
SO SOME OF THE INNER CIRCLE ARE GONNA GO OUT
FOR AN EARLY DINNER BEFORE THE READING.
-ARE YOU GAME?
-YEAH.
YOU CAN BRING YOUR NEW LITTLE FRIEND.
[SIGHS]
EVERYBODY AGREES THAT BATMAN BLOWING ROBIN
AND ROBIN BLOWING BATMAN IS TOTALLY PLAYED OUT,
BUT NOW I'M SEEING CHRISTIAN BALE'S BATMAN
BLOWING BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN.
BLOWING VAL KILMER.
OH, THAT'S REALLY HOT.
[PHONE RINGS]
I GOT A CEASE AND DESIST FROM WARNER'S LAST WEEK,
SO OBVIOUSLY I'M DOING SOMETHING RIGHT.
YEAH, YOU'RE MOVING UP IN THE WORLD.
WHAT KIND OF SLASH DO YOU WRITE?
YOU'VE BEEN TO OUR WEBSITE, IT'S EASY ENOUGH TO FIND.
RIGHT.
I'M GUESSING THIS IS YOUR FIRST CON,
SINCE YOU'RE WHAT, HE'S 18?
-MM-HMM.
-YEAH, 18.
HMM.
I WAS EDITING THE R.P.F. BOARD TODAY.
I'LL NEVER GET ALL THE BIEBER FIC.
NEIL, ARE YOU INTO JUSTIN BIEBER?
WHAT'S R.P.F.?
R.P.F. IS REAL PEOPLE FICTION OR CELEBRITY SLASH.
SLASH ABOUT, YOU KNOW, CELEBS.
OH, OH, LIKE THE BRONTE SISTERS.
THEY WROTE STORIES ABOUT NAPOLEON
AND THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON.
YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY OLD SCHOOL,
BUT NOW IT'S MOSTLY JUST LIKE POINTLESS BOY BAND ORGIES.
YEAH, AND JUVENILE REGRESSIVES ARE POPPING UP ALL OVER.
SPEAKING OF...
HOW LONG HAVE YOU SLASHED VANGUARD?
OH, VANGUARD IS JUVENILE, BUT TREK AND TOLKIEN, THAT'S--
IT'S ALL ABOUT AUDIENCE AND INTENT, DENIS.
THIS IS FIRST YEAR STUFF.
VANGUARD DOESN'T PLAY TO THE 40-PLUS CROWD, OUR BASE.
BESIDES, IT'S NOT OUR MISSION TO INDOCTRINATE CHILDREN.
IT'S NOT OUR MISSION TO INDOCTRINATE ANYONE.
I READ TOLKIEN WHEN I WAS EIGHT.
YES, AND DENIS LOVES HIS VANGUARD.
RONNIE PREFERS HER MASTURBATION MATERIAL
TO STEM FROM BAD '60S TELEVISION.
YOU EVER SEE "THE BRADY BUNCH," DUDE?
REALLY, FREDDIE?
HE'S A CHILD.
MAINSTREAM SUCCESS HAS NO BEARING ON OUR FIELD.
NEVER HAS.
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS JUVENILE FICTION
BEGETS JUVENILE EROTICA.
LET ME BE FRANK.
YOU WRITE SEX LIKE A 12-YEAR-OLD
AND I THINK YOU KNOW IT.
IT'S LIKE YOU FOUND ALL THESE PROVOCATIVE WORDS
AND JUST TOSSED THEM INTO A TEXT EDITOR.
HAVE YOU EVER EVEN HAD SEX?
I DOUBT HALF OUR WRITERS HAVE HAD SEX.
-LET ME SEE YOUR ID.
-RONNIE.
WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, DENIS,
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO TO JAIL.
NOBODY'S GOING TO JAIL.
JESUS!
NEIL, COME ON.
IT'S FINE.
SIT DOWN.
YEAH, IT'S FINE IF HE PONIES UP AN ID.
I REMEMBER NOW.
YOU WROTE ALL THAT REALLY GROSS MIKE AND GREG BRADY FIC.
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED SEX WITH 12-YEAR-OLDS.
IF IT'S WRITTEN MATURELY.
NICE.
ARE YOU REALLY 18?
NEIL, NEIL, COME ON, STOP.
STOP, STOP, STOP.
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
[SIGHS] LOOK, RONNIE, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, SHE'S LIKE THAT WITH EVERYBODY.
IT'S NOT YOU.
OH, UM.
LET'S GO SOMEPLACE ELSE.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WAIT.
IT JUST-- THIS DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.
WHY?
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA BE MAD, I'M NOT BE UPSET OR ANYTHING.
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME HOW OLD YOU ARE.
-I ALREADY TOLD YOU.
-I KNOW, I KNOW.
TELL ME AGAIN.
-15.
-15?
OH, FUCK!
I'LL BE 16 IN NOVEMBER.
-PLEASE DON'T REJECT ME.
-DUDE, THIS IS WRONG.
I KNOW IT IS.
THIS IS JUST THE SECOND TIME TODAY.
-I COULD GO TO JAIL.
-I WON'T TELL ANYONE.
DID YOU JUST TELL ME YOU WERE 18 SO YOU COULD GET INTO THE LIVE READING?
-NO!
-WHAT DO YOU EVEN WANT FROM ME?
I JUST THOUGHT IT'D BE DIFFERENT.
HERE WITH YOU.
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
YOU ACTUALLY REMIND ME A LOT OF MYSELF.
-YOU TURNED OUT OKAY.
-DID I?
I SHOT OFF A SERIES OF INSANE MESSAGES
TO SOMEBODY I DIDN'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT.
I SAID THINGS I WOULD NEVER SAY TO SOMEBODY FACE TO FACE.
EVER.
YOU KNOW, OUTSIDE OF LIKE CONS,
I HAVE PRACTICALLY ZERO SOCIAL SKILLS.
MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID IT'S GOING TO GET ME IN TROUBLE,
AND NOW HERE I AM.
AND YES, INCIDENTALLY, I LIVE WITH MY MOTHER,
IN THE HOUSE WHERE I GREW UP, IN SAGINAW.
SO, YOU KNOW, DON'T BE TOO SURE ABOUT THINGS.
YOU LIVE WITH YOUR MOM?
[CHUCKLES]
[SIGHS]
STOP.
STOP.
STOP.
STOP.
[DENIS SIGHS]
[NEIL SIGHS]
YOU SAID THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME.
IT IT SOMEONE IN OUR GROUP?
WAS IT THAT GIRL YOU CAME HERE WITH?
YEAH, WELL.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE STRAIGHT.
-I MIGHT NOT BE.
-WELL, THIS ISN'T THE WAY TO FIND OUT.
YOU HAVE TIME.
YOU'RE WRITING.
FOCUS ON THAT.
[SIGHS] HOW CAN I FOCUS ON SOMETHING
I'M NOT EVEN OLD ENOUGH TO DO?
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
YOU WANT TO BE A WRITER?
A REAL WRITER, NOT FAN FIC?
YOU'RE GOOD.
KEEP WRITING AND LET THE REST OF THE STUFF
SORT ITSELF OUT NATURALLY.
I WISH SOMEBODY HAD TOLD ME THAT WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.
[SIGHS]
WELL, YOU BETTER GO.
IT'S ABOUT TIME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO HERE IS.
I WANNA MAKE SURE YOU'RE OKAY.
WELL, I KNOW YOU HAVE TO GO.
I AM THE MODERATOR.
I MEAN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY, I'M NOT COMING.
I CAN'T, NOT NOW.
NOT RIGHT NOW.
I WISH IT WASN'T THIS WAY.
YOU KNOW, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I THINK YOU WANT TO BE QUEER.
WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT THAT?
TO FIT IN,
EVEN SOME PLACE SMALL.
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.
YOU CAME BACK?
THE LIVE READ'S ABOUT TO START.
YOU SHOULD BE THERE.
I CAME BACK FOR YOU.
YOU DON'T GET IT.
YOU SUBMITTED ONCE AND THEY'RE LIKE,
"HEY, COME READ IT ON STAGE."
I HAVE LIKE 500 THINGS POSTED UP THERE.
I KNOW.
I'VE READ EVERY ONE OF THEM.
IT'S HARD CARING ABOUT SOMEONE.
LETTING THEM CARE ABOUT YOU.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE HARD.
I LOVE YOU.
I KISSED HIM.
THAT DENIS GUY?
I'M NOT GOING TO THE LIVE READ.
-YOU HAVE TO.
-I CAN'T.
NEIL, PLEASE, FOR BOTH OF US.
FUCK THOSE CRUSTY OLD ASSHOLES.
I FOLLOWED YOU INTO THE RESTAURANT
WHEN YOU WEREN'T ANSWERING MY CALLS.
I'M SORRY THAT LADY IS SUCH AN ASSHOLE.
LOOK, THEY ONLY WIN IF YOU LET THEM.
YOU ARE A FEATURED FUCKING STORY, DUDE.
YOU MADE IT!
WE'RE DOING THIS.
YOU AND ME TOGETHER.
I AM YOUR GODDAMN COACH.
OKAY?
AS THEY ENTERED THE NEXIVERSE,
GANDALF, HIS PENIS NOW LONGER THAN HIS STAFF,
TUNED-
- TURNED TO DUMBLEDORE,
"DUMBLEDORE," HE SAID TO DUMBLEDORE,
"ONLY THE ENERGY OF OUR MUTUAL ORGASM,
COMBINED WITH UNBROKEN EYE CONTACT
CAN CLOSE THE DOOR TO THE NEXIVERSE,
THUS STOPPING THE COMBINED ARMIES OF SAURON AND VOLDEMORT.
WITHOUT A MOMENT'S THOUGHT, DUMBLEDORE SELFLESSLY
GAVE OF HIS OWN MANHOOD,
PLACING THE HEAD OF HIS POUNDING PENIS
AGAINST THAT OF THE WISE OLD WIZARD FROM ALT MIDDLE EARTH,
LIKE IN GHOSTBUSTERS.
-END OF CHAPTER SEVEN.
-[APPLAUSE]
OKAY, THAT WAS GAN-DUM 69
WITH "HOLE PLUGGERS OF THE NEXIVERSE."
AND WHO DOESN'T LIKE SOME GOOD OLD-FASHIONED WIZARD-ON-WIZARD ACTION?
ONE MORE TIME FOR HER, GAN-DUM 69.
UM...
SO-UH, I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS MY FEELINGS
ABOUT WHAT WE DO AND THE PURPOSE IT SERVES.
OFTEN WE'RE TREATED LIKE FREAKS.
ESPECIALLY THOSE OF US WHO ARE A LITTLE BIT OLDER.
-AND UH, STILL DOING THIS.
-[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]
UM...
AND WHEN WE'RE AWAY FROM THIS LITTLE COMMUNITY
THAT WE'VE CREATED FOR OURSELVES,
YOU KNOW, WE'RE OUTSIDERS, AND WE'RE WEIRDOES,
AND WE'RE SEXUAL DEVIANTS,
BUT NOT HERE.
OUR NEXT READER IS A YOUNG MAN
THAT I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING WITH MUCH INTEREST.
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE HE WRITES VANGUARD.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE STAGE, VAN FAN 42.
UM, THIS IS CALLED...
"SHORE LEAVE ON DREENAN FOUR."
"THE BALMY TROPIC WEATHER PATTERNS
OF DREENAN FOUR GAVE CAUSE FOR THE INDIGENOUS PROXANS
TO WEAR VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY OF ATTIRE.
THIS YEAR WITH THE ELLIPTICAL ORBIT PULLING THEM CLOSER
THAN EVER TO DREENAN PRIME,
CLOTHING WAS MORE A HARDSHIP THAN AN OPTION.
VANGUARD FOUND HIMSELF UNARMORED
ON THE BEACHES OF THE ZARAUG
DURING WHAT SEEMED TO BE A RELIGIOUS MATING RITUAL.
'DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHERE THEY KEEP THE TOWELS?
'
A LEAN, NAKED PROXON INQUIRED.
HIS SUPPLE MANHOOD STOOD PROUD
AGAINST THE HARSH LIGHT OF DREENAN PRIME.
THE PROXON BOY REPEATED HIMSELF,
'WELL, DO YOU?
'
VANGUARD'S HAND NOW PUMPED HIS STONE COCK."
HE'S 15.
[AUDIENCE MURMURS]
YOU'RE OUTSIDERS.
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SUPPORT OTHER OUTSIDERS.
I MEAN, YOU GUYS WRITE NINJA TURTLE BONDAGE PORN
AND YOU'RE JUDGING?
HE JUST POURED OUT HIS SAD, PATHETIC HEART
TO YOU PHILISTINES!
AND I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
LET HIM READ.
[MAN] NO.
[AUDIENCE MURMURS]
I MAY BE 15,
BUT YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE.
I'LL BE 16 IN A FEW MONTHS.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, THAT IS MY FAULT.
I'M THE ONE WHO BROKE THE RULES.
DON'T BLAME HIM.
SO YOU'RE NOT-- MAD AT ME ANYMORE, RIGHT?
I'D ONLY BE MAD IF YOU STOPPED WRITING BECAUSE OF THIS.
ME?
NO.
I'VE GOT MY BODY ARMOR ON.
HEY, I LOVE YOU, TOO.
WELL, DUH.
I GOTTA TELL YOU SOMETHING.
I THINK I MAY BE A LESBIAN.
THE WAY I FIGURE IT...
IF I'M LESBIAN AND YOU'RE GAY,
THEN WE CAN BE A GAY COUPLE,
AND IT SORT OF CANCELS EACH OTHER OUT.
CAUSE I'M MORE MANNISH AND YOU'RE LIKE A GIRL.
WAIT, WHAT...
I'M LIKE A GIRL?
I'M SORRY, NEIL.
I'M SORRY I SAID YOU WERE GAY.
I DON'T KNOW WHY I SAID THAT.
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU ARE.
THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT.
I TOLD THEM YOU WERE 16.
WHAT?
I'M THE REASON YOU DIDN'T GET INTO THE LIVE READ.
IT WAS MY FAULT.
IT WAS DOWN TO YOU AND ME,
AND I TOLD THEM THAT I WAS 18,
AND YOU WERE 16.
THAT EDITOR, RONNIE, LOVES YOUR WRITING.
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.
IT NEVER WAS,
SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP WRITING.
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE READING.
I'M SORRY.
YEAH.
[JULIA SIGHS]
I REALLY DO LOVE YOU.
IT'S NOT SO CRAZY THEY BELIEVED YOU WERE 18.
YOU DO LOOK OLDER NOW.
JESUS!
MOM KNOWS YOU STAYED WITH HER.
WHAT?
-MOM'S AROUND?
-MM-HMM.
-HOW BAD IS IT?
-IT'S BAD.
DAD TOOK A BULLET FOR YOU.
THAT GIRL'S MOM CALLED.
DID YOU GUYS STEAL HER CREDIT CARD?
I HOPE YOU LOST YOUR CHERRY, NEILY BOPPER.
'CAUSE FROM THE SOUND OF IT,
YOU MIGHT NOT BE SEEING MUCH OF HER FOR A WHILE.
LET ME SEE THAT.
WHAT, DO YOU THINK I'M TOO DUMB?
DON'T WORRY, MAN, SHE'LL COME AROUND.
[NEIL NARRATING] SEASONS END,
EVEN ON MILLIARCHA V, WHERE NUCLEAR WINTER
WAS SLOWLY GIVING WAY TO BRIGHT SPRING.
VANGUARD FELT IT.
AND HE KNEW HIS OWN SEASON WAS NOW AT A CLOSE.
BE IT BURIAL IN THE COLD VACUUM OF SPACE,
OR A QUAINT DOMESTIC CABIN ON THE FRONTIER'S RIM,
EVERYONE RETIRES.
THINGS, PEOPLE...
COME INTO YOUR LIFE SUDDENLY,
AND THEN ARE JUST AS SUDDENLY GONE.
BUT THEIR SEASON SHAPES YOU.
MAKES YOU DARE THINGS YOU HADN'T PREVIOUSLY EVEN DREAMT.
AND FOR THAT, AND FOR MY FRIEND, THIS AUTHOR IS HAPPY.

THE PLEASURE GARDENS OF MILLIARCHA V
MADE IT THE JEWEL OF THE INNER RIM FOR OVER FIVE CENTURIES.
IT TOOK NEARLY 48 HOURS FOR EVERYTHING TO CHANGE.
A GREAT ALIEN EVIL HAD ENSLAVED THE ONCE PEACEFUL PLANET.
FOR THE HIGH COUNCIL, THERE WAS ONLY ONE OPTION.
VANGUARD, THE INFAMOUS MERCENARY WAS DISPATCHED
TO FACE THE ENTITY RESPONSIBLE,
THE KRAGON, THE DUKE OF RAGGIDI,
THE BUTCHER OF BARSA,
DESTROYER OF WORLDS.
VANGUARD'S ORDERS WERE SIMPLE.
ELIMINATE.
TIME FOR SCHOOL.
I KNOW.
HE CRASHED HARD.
VANGUARD NEARLY BROKE THE SLAVE GIRL'S FALL.
SHE WAS STRADDLING HIM NOW.
FACE TO FACE.
SEEMS I DIDN'T LEAVE THIS WORLD EARLY ENOUGH.
THE AIR IS STILL BREATHABLE.
JUST THE SAME.
NEITHER GAINED MUCH GROUND.
THEY WERE ALMOST EVENLY MATCHED.
WE ARE ALMOST EVENLY MATCHED.
ALMOST?
I WAS WEANED ON THE PSYCHEDELIC GASSES OF RAGGIDI PRIME.
I SEE THEIR EFFECT ON HUMANS IS NOT UNUSUAL.
IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO WASTE
SO WORTHY AN ADVERSARY.
THE RAGGIDI ALSO FIND THE GAS TO HAVE A PLEASING EFFECT.
VANGUARD PEERED INTO THE EVIL LORD'S EYES,
THEN BACK TO THE SLAVE GIRL.
THEN THOSE EYES.
THEN THE GIRL.
THEN THE EYES.
AND THEN THE GIRL.
THEN THE...
IT ALL HAPPENED SO FAST.
A FLASH OF BODIES, LIMBS, FLESH
PRESSING TOGETHER.
THEIR HUNGER KNEW NO BOUNDS.
SUDDENLY ALL THE ATROCITIES,
THE MURDEROUS TYRANT HAD EVER COMMITTED
WERE NOTHING MORE THAN AN AFTERTHOUGHT.
LUST WAS THE ONLY THING ON VANGUARD'S MIND.
LUST WAS ALL THAT MATTERED NOW.
A TOAST.
IT'S MY GOOD FORTUNE
TO HAVE A GOOD FORTUNE.
AND I BRING IT ALL TO YOU,
MOST HONORABLE HEADS OF HOUSES, PRENTISS AND HOLLYCOTTON.
AND OF COURSE, YOUR HIGHLY ELIGIBLE DAUGHTERS,
ONE OF WHOM I SOON INTEND TO WED.
- HE KNEW IT WAS WRONG.
- CHEERS.
BUT WHY DID IT FEEL SO RIGHT?
IN THE THROES OF PASSION, VANGUARD WAS QUICKLY REMINDED
OF THE DEBACLE AT THE HIGH COUNCIL.
AND WITH IT, HIS PREVIOUS CONQUEST.
-WHAT'S THAT?
-NOTHING.
IF IT'S NOTHING, WHY DO YOU CARE?
IT WOULDN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE.
REALLY?
ARE YOU SAYING I'M DUMB?
NO, THERE'S JUST-- THERE'S NO CONTEXT.
NEIL, IS THAT A DIARY?
I DON'T KNOW.
NEIL WON'T LET ME SEE IT.
-LET ME SEE THAT.
-HEY!
SENATOR ZAXA APPROACHED VANGUARD,
HIS EYES SET ON THE SOLDIER OF FORTUNE'S ENGORGED...
PELVIC REGION?
MOTHER OF FUCK!
WE SHOULD BURN IT.
WE DON'T BURN BOOKS, JESSIE.
FUCKING DISGUSTING.
MANY TAXONOMIC GROUPS DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE SEPARATE SEXES,
SO HERMAPHRODITISM IS A NORMAL THING.
NOW WHAT EDWARD IS HANDING OUT
REPRESENTS THE SEQUENTIAL HERMAPHRODITE.
IN THIS CASE, THE SLIPPER SNAIL.
IT BEGINS ITS LIFE AS A MALE.
BUT IF THE FEMALE POPULATION DWINDLES,
THEN THE LARGEST MALE IN THE GROUP
WILL SPONTANEOUSLY SWITCH GENDERS.
I WILL PULL YOUR FACE OFF.
OH, I'M SHAKING.
ALL RIGHT.
STAND.
-YOU WROTE THIS?
-FUCK NO.
JULIA, OUT.
NOW.
OKAY, WHO'S THE BUDDING D.H. LAWRENCE HERE?
MR. SHAFER.
LET'S CHAT AFTER CLASS.
WHERE'S MOM?
SHE'S AT HER BOOK CLUB THINGY.
WHAT BOOK ARE THEY READING?
-WHAT?
-AT MOM'S BOOK CLUB, WHAT BOOK?
ARE YOU AUTISTIC?
WHO CARES?
DAD DOESN'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT HER STUPID BOOK CLUB.
-SHE'S EXPLORING INTERESTS.
-FUCK THAT.
MAYBE SHE'S WITH AN ATTORNEY.
YOUR MOTHER IS NOT WITH AN ATTORNEY.
WE'RE JUST FIGURING STUFF OUT, OKAY?
- LIKE HOW TO GET DIVORCED?
- UH!
WHAT DO YOU EVEN KNOW ABOUT DIVORCE
IN THE FIRST PLACE?
YOU WANNA START SOME SHIT?
-WHOA, WHAT IS THAT?
-NEIL GOT CAUGHT WITH PORNO
AND NOW HE HAS TO SEE A COUNSELOR.
PORNO?
LIKE PORNO PORNO?
I DIDN'T HAVE PORNO, IDIOT.
REALLY?
BECAUSE, OH, IT SAYS RIGHT HERE--
LEMME-
- LEMME SEE THAT.
OH, JESUS.
I KNEW IT WAS A BAD IDEA TO GO THERE ALONE.
BUT MY TIRE WAS LOW, AND I COULDN'T MAKE IT BACK.
THE GAS STATION WAS CLOSED AND THE LIGHTS WERE OFF,
BUT THE AIR COMPRESSOR STILL TOOK MY CHANGE.
AS I PUMPED NEW LIFE INTO THE FLACCID TIRE,
I HEARD A VOICE BEHIND ME.
HE WAS OLDER, PROBABLY IN HIS 40S, BY THE SOUND OF HIM.
BUT I DIDN'T DARE TURN AROUND TO CHECK.
HE PRESSED THE PISTOL HARD AGAINST MY LOWER BACK.
PUSHING, PUSHING IT THROUGH MY SWEATER
UNTIL IT BRUISED MY FLESH.
HE TOLD ME TO GET DOWN ON ALL FOURS,
-LIKE A DOG.
-THANK YOU, JULIA, THAT IS ENOUGH.
-I'M NOT FINISHED.
-OH, YOU'RE FINISHED.
-HAVE A SEAT.
-I HAVE THREE PAGES LEFT.
THIS WASN'T THE ASSIGNMENT.
WELL, YOU ASSIGNED A CONFESSIONAL.
THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN TO YOU.
-HOW DO YOU KNOW?
-COME ON.
WHAT?
IT COULD HAVE.
NOT LIKELY.
MR. SNOW, THIS IS A NARRATIVE WRITING CLASS
AND I WROTE A NARRATIVE.
IT IS NOT YOUR PLACE TO CONDEMN MY SUBJECT.
BUT IT ABSOLUTELY IS MY PLACE TO CONDEMN INAPPROPRIATE MATERIAL.
HOW THE HELL CAN YOU CALL THIS INAPPROPRIATE?
YOU'RE NOT EVEN QUALIFIED TO JUDGE.
YOU'RE A MAN.
SO ARE YOU.
ALL RIGHT, OKAY, WE'RE DONE HERE.
I NEED TO SEE THE PRINCIPAL.
ARE YOU GOING TO GET HIM?
SIGN IN AND SIT DOWN.
EWW.
POHL?
IS THAT "STARCHILD?"
YEAH.
POHL'S ONLY HALFWAY OKAY WHEN HE COLLABORATES
WITH OTHER WRITERS.
DID YOU EVER READ "THE SPACE MERCHANTS?"
MM-HMM.
IT'S PRETTY GOOD.
I THINK THIS ONE KINDA SUCKS THOUGH.
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WROTE.
OH, I-
- THIS--
-I DIDN'T MEAN FOR--
-I LIKED IT.
ARE YOU IN TROUBLE?
YEAH, I HAVE TO SEE A COUNSELOR.
YEAH, WELL, I'M HERE FOR ENACTING MY FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS.
I WROTE AN EROTIC FABLE.
WELL, IT WAS MORE OF A PARABLE.
IT'S A BIT MORE GROUNDED THAN YOURS, BUT--
YOU GET THE IDEA.
WHAT?
DO YOU WRITE OTHER STORIES, LIKE, UM--
LIKE EROTIC LITERATURE?
MM-HMM.
ALL THE TIME.
-IT'S ALL ONLINE.
-REALLY?
WHERE?
A RIDDLE.
EAT ME, DRINK ME.
WELL, GOOD LUCK, YOUNG JUVIE.
WAIT, YOU'RE LEAVING?
WHERE ARE THEY?
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SMOKE.
MY MOM SMOKED WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH ME.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S-- IT'S NOT LIKE A MYTH.
IT'S A CIRCULATION THING.
NO, IT'S FINE.
WE GET IT, SHIT ASS!
ALL RIGHT, WHERE TO?
THE MALL!
HIS WAS THE WAY OF THE WARRIOR.
CRASS.
UNEDUCATED.
BUT STRONG.
HIS ABILITIES WOULD PROVE USELESS
IN THE ENCHANTED FOREST.
WHERE THE ANCIENT INHABITANTS DWELLED
AND RECESSES OF ONE'S OWN MIND.
THE HUNTER PUSHED FORTH UNAWARE
FAIN HAD BEEN WATCHING HIM FROM THE MOMENT HE ENTERED.
NEIL!
IT'S NEIL, RIGHT?
ARE YOU WATCHING ME?
NO.
WELL, YEAH.
NO, I-
- I WAS JUST CURIOUS.
-ABOUT?
-WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE OTHER DAY.
WE TALKED THE OTHER DAY?
SORRY.
NEIL.
GOD, COME BACK.
I'M FUCKING WITH YOU.
-UM.
-IT'S COOL.
I WRITE SLASH, TOO.
YEAH, I KNOW.
I READ YOUR STUFF.
ALL OF IT.
YOUR FAN FIC IS AMAZING.
I SEE YOU GOT MY CODE.
I DO LIKE WHAT YOU DID WITH THE FOREST GUARD
IN "MIDNIGHT COME LATELY."
THEY'RE REALLY UNDER UTILIZED IN CANON.
YEAH, THEY'RE CONCEPTUALLY AWESOME,
BUT I FEEL LIKE NOBODY GETS IT.
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE BEGGING US TO FIX 'EM.
YOU'RE DOING WHAT THEY WISHED THEY COULD DO
IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO ANSWER TO THE PUBLISHER.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
MAINSTREAM SUCCESS IS FOR CHUMPS.
YOU KNOW, LIKE, THE WOOD SPIRIT,
AND PAGAN GODS AND RITUAL MAGIC?
IT'S REALLY...
SEXUAL?
YEAH.
IT'S SO RICH.
ORGANIZED RELIGION JUST TOTALLY NUT CLIPPED
EVERYTHING THAT WAS GREAT ABOUT TRADITIONAL
FERTILITY RITUALS.
I MEAN, THAT'S THE ONLY PART ABOUT FAME
THAT I EVEN GIVE A SHIT ABOUT.
IT'S JUST A JUMPING OFF POINT.
IT'S FUNNY THAT THEY THINK IT'S KID'S STUFF,
BUT, LIKE, THERE'S ALL THIS SUBTEXT.
I KNOW.
I BET WE'RE THE ONLY TWO KIDS IN THIS ENTIRE JOINT
THAT KNOW ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT.
IT'S KIND OF SPECIAL.
YOU WANNA DITCH?
SCHOOL?
NO, I MEAN, YOU WANNA DIG A DITCH?
-LET'S GO.
-OH, I-
- I CAN'T
I HAVE A TEST IN SOCIAL STUDIES NEXT PERIOD.
IT'S ON THE INCAS.
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE A MIDTERM OR ANYTHING,
SO UM YEAH.
I LET MARTINE TAKE MY CAR TO WORK,
SO WE HAVE TO WALK.
BUT IT'S JUST THE MALL.
MARTINE'S CRAZY.
I MEAN, SHE'S PRETTY MUCH BEST FRIEND,
SHE'S JUST SORT OF A BITCH.
IS THAT-
- IS THAT THE PREGNANT GIRL?
"AT FRONTIER'S RIM?"
I HATE THESE THINGS.
THEY NEVER GET THE BOOK RIGHT.
WELL, I GUESS I'M LUCKY THAT FAIN HASN'T MADE
THE LEAP TO THE BIG SCREEN YET.
JUST IT PISSES ME OFF THAT WHENEVER I SEE VANGUARD IN MY HEAD
-THAT GUY...
-WELL, HE'S NOT YOUR CHARACTER.
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED FAN FIC.
-YEAH, BUT.
-YOU SEEN IT YET?
LIKE FIVE TIMES.
GOD DAMN IT.
SHE'S NOT GETTING OFF WORK UNTIL LIKE 6.
OKAY, I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO.
WILL IT BE-- SMELL LIKE...
WILL MY PARENTS BE ABLE TO TELL?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
IT'S COOL.
NO, I MEAN, I WANT TO, BUT...
THANK YOU.
UH!
SHUT YOUR DOOR.
-PUT YOUR SEAT DOWN.
-WHY?
WHAT, ARE YOU ASHAMED TO BE SEEN WITH ME?
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST-
- I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO IT.
THERE'S TOO MUCH BACKSTORY.
MIKE HOLLOWAY DROVE HIS TRUCK
THROUGH MY MOM'S MARIGOLDS WHEN I WAS TEN.
THEN HE GAVE HER THE FINGER.
I AM SO STONED.
HEADS UP, KNOB-GOBLIN!
UH!
HEY, WAKE UP!
LET'S GO.
MOVE.
MOVE TO THE BACK.
MOVE IT!
-GO TO THE BACK.
-OKAY.
OW!
I'M PREGNANT, BITCH!
YOU KNOW, YOUR ARM'S NOT PREGNANT, MORON.
JESUS, I THOUGHT THAT WAS MIKE.
YOU'RE REALLY TEARING THROUGH THEM THESE DAYS.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
HI.
I JUST DON'T GET WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING
FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF IN THE PARKING LOT.
WERE YOU LIKE BLOWING EACH OTHER?
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WRITING.
WHOA!
WAIT, YOU WRITE THAT SHIT, TOO?
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
WHO DO YOU HAVE FUCKING?
HARRY POTTER?
THOMAS THE TRAIN ENGINE?
I JUST GOTTA KNOW WHOSE FICTIONAL DICK
IS GOING IN WHOSE MADE-UP MOUTH.
YOU CAN'T EVEN READ.
YEAH, I CAN READ.
I READ ALL THE TIME.
I READ ACTUAL BOOKS FOR ADULTS.
-NOT BABY BOOKS.
-OKAY, NAME ONE.
"WUTHERING HEIGHTS," ASS BLOOD.
-THE BRONTE SISTERS WROTE FAN FIC.
-WHAT?
THE BRONTE SISTERS.
EMILY BRONTE,
OF "WUTHERING HEIGHTS," WROTE EROTIC FAN FICTION.
THEY'RE LIKE PIONEERS.
WOW.
IT'S REALLY GOOD MIKE ISN'T HERE TO FIND OUT
THAT YOU'RE STILL SUCH A FUCKING GEEEEEEK!
DUDE, YOU KNOW WEED STAYS IN YOUR SYSTEM
FOR LIKE TWO WEEKS.
ON YOUR CLOTHES, ON YOUR JACKET.
LEAVE HIM ALONE.
HEY, TOMORROW, 2:00.
LET'S MEET IN THE COURTYARD.
WE CAN DRIVE AROUND.
BYE.
BELZAC AND DERON ZAXA HAD BEEN FIGHTING FOR HOURS.
SWEAT TINGED THE AIR OF THE WAR CHAMBER.
THAT WAS THE FIRST THING VANGUARD NOTICED AS HE ENTERED.
THE BULGE IN HIS LEATHER PANTS JUMPED TO ATTENTION--
ERECT MEMBER OUT OF-- SUDDENLY, BELZAC REENTERED--
HIS MOUTH, USUALLY ONLY ENGAGED IN ORDERING
SOLDIERS TO THEIR DEATHS, NOW FOUND ITS TRUE PURPOSE.
WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS.
IF THE TRADE UNION CONTINUES TO BLOCK US AT EVERY TURN...
BLOCK YOU?
BLOCK YOU.
YOUR ARMADA DESTROYED THE LAST--
-TWELVE.
-TWELVE SHIPMENTS OF ILLINIUM
-SENT TO PARAK MENOM.
-ONLY 12?
NOW 13.
IT'S AN EMBARGO.
A LEGAL EMBARGO.
ODD DEFINITION OF THE WORD LEGAL.
-ACTUALLY--
-OH, SO THAT'S WHY YOU BROUGHT YOUR...
MUSCLE?
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM US, DERON ZAXA.
YOU OR YOUR MUSCLE.
I WILL NOT BE MOCKED ABOARD MY OWN SHIP.
HIRED SHIP.
IT'S HIS FREIGHTER.
WHAT DO I PAY YOU FOR?
MOVE!
WHATEVER HE PAYS YOU, WE'LL DOUBLE IT.
ALLOW US TO SHOW YOU WHAT WE'LL PAY YOU FOR.
I DON'T HAVE ALL DAY.
YES, SIR, VERY BUSY.
YOU HAVE A LUNCH AT... 1300.
CHRIST!
GOD!
ZAXA'S HAND REACHED DOWN-- DOWN TO HIS ZIPPER.
THE AMBIENT HUMIDITY IN THE ROOM
REACHED A LEVEL THAT SET OFF THE CLIMATE KLAXON.
BUT ZAXA COULDN'T...
OR WOULDN'T...
STOP.
HEY, NEIL.
GOD I SUCKED TODAY.
YOU WERE REALLY GOOD.
THAT ACCENT IS, IT'S OUT OF CONTROL.
I THINK IT'S FUNNY WHEN YOU DO IT LIKE THAT.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A COMEDY, RIGHT?
YEAH, I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT.
SEE, THAT'S WHY I LIKE YOU, MAN.
YOU ALWAYS MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.
SO YOU GET LIKE TOUCHED INAPPROPRIATELY BY THE DOCTOR?
NO, HE JUST PUTS GOO ALL OVER YOUR BELLY.
-IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
-YEAH.
YOU HAVE NO CLUE HOW BIG A SPECULUM IS.
IT'S LIKE THREE ADULT DICKS GLUED TOGETHER.
SOUNDS LIKE ME THOUGH.
HEY, SNOOP DOG!
COME HERE!
-WELL, WHO'S THIS?
-JULIA'S NEW BOYFRIEND.
-JEALOUS?
-FOR REAL?
WHAT'S UP, BRO?
I'M MIKE.
OW.
I'M NEIL.
-WELL, I GUESS I OWE YOU ONE, NEIL.
-YOU DO?
YEAH, FOR TAKING LITTLE MISS ELF QUEST OFF MY HANDS.
SHE HAS BEEN UP MY HOLE LIKE 24-7.
HEY, FETUS.
SO LONG, KIDDIES, LET'S RIDE AROUND.
BETTER NOT LEAK ON MY SEATS, MARTINE.
I DON'T LEAK.
IT ALL STAYS IN ME.
FOR LIKE ANOTHER TWO MONTHS.
GROSS.
HEY, I WANNA TELL YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.
THERE'S A CON IN HOUSTON COMING UP.
LIKE A COMIC CON?
YES, LIKE A COMIC CON.
A BIG ONE.
THE RABBIT'S HOLE IS HOSTING A PRIVATE MIXER.
-IT'S INVITE ONLY.
-OH, YEAH.
-I THINK I HEARD OF THAT.
-WELL, I GOT INVITED.
REALLY?
COOL.
YEAH, THERE'S A LIVE READ, TOO.
I MEAN, THAT'S ONLY FOR ROCK STARS,
SO, I DON'T WANNA BE PRESUMPTUOUS OR WHATEVER,
BUT I THINK THEY MIGHT ASK ME.
YOU CAN STILL GET INVITED.
YOU JUST NEED TO UPLOAD YOUR DAMN WORK.
YEAH, BUT...
DON'T YOU HAVE TO BE 18?
YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF MY STUFF IS...
-I DON'T KNOW!
-COME ON, IT'S GOOD.
YOU BARELY EVEN READ ANY.
WELL, IT'S GOTTA BE GOOD.
I MEAN, YOU'RE SO REPRESSED.
THAT SHIT HAS GOTTA COME OUT SOMEHOW.
DROP US OFF AT NEIL'S HOUSE!
OH, MAN, I THOUGHT YOU WERE JOKING.
EXACTLY HOW I IMAGINED IT.
I GUESS IT'S PRETTY DRAB.
MY MOM'S BEEN KIND OF AWAY.
MOMENT OF TRUTH.
CRACK HER OPEN.
JULIA, I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN FOR THESE TO BE SEEN BY ANYBODY.
YES, YOU DID.
OTHERWISE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE WRITTEN THEM.
I CAN'T WATCH.
-I THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T WATCH.
-SORRY.
OH, MY GOD.
DO THESE GIRLS ACTUALLY WEAR SPACE BIKINIS?
IT'S CEREMONIAL.
THEY WERE GIVEN--
IT'S NOT MY IDEA.
WELL, I JUST LIKE THAT THERE'S ACTUAL GIRLS IN HERE.
WOW, YOU ARE ONE TWISTED FUCK.
I LOVE IT.
-OOH, PREPARE TO BE ANALIZED!
-IT'S NOT A TOY.
IT'S NOT A TOY.
THAT'S SO WEIRD.
-IT LOOKS LIKE A TOY.
-YOU'RE GONNA BREAK IT.
-THAT'S CRAZY.
-WHOA!
SAY YOUR SPACE PRAYERS, SUCKA.
AM I INTERRUPTING?
DON'T YOU KNOCK?
UM, DAD IS WORKING LATE.
THERE'S FOOD IN THE FRIDGE.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
OH, MY BAND HAS A SHOW.
WHAT'S YOUR BAND?
DANCE OR DIE.
IT SOUNDS AWESOME.
YEAH, WELL, IT'S PRETTY STUPID.
I BET YOU'RE REALLY GOOD.
-JUST GET OUT!
-ALL RIGHT.
I'M OFF.
I HAVE TO PICK UP TIM.
IT SMELLS LIKE SWEAT IN HERE.
WHAT WAS THAT?
I'M BISEXUAL, JUST SO YOU KNOW.
EWW, SHE'S NOT EVEN GAY.
ALL WOMEN ARE BISEXUAL.
ALL OF THEM.
MY FIRST BLOG, CLITORA MAJORA,
IS ALL ABOUT IT.
-SO, YOU READY?
-NO.
FOR WHAT?
IT'S TIME TO UPLOAD.
I DON'T THINK I'M READY.
DUDE, THEY ONLY SEND INVITES TO WRITERS WHO POST.
AND BESIDES, WRITERS, REAL WRITERS,
LET PEOPLE READ THEIR SHIT.
AND YOUR SHIT IS GOOD.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS MINE,
BUT TRADITIONALLY BOYS DON'T WRITE VERY GOOD EROTICA.
-SO, BY THOSE STANDARDS--
-OKAY, FINE.
JUST, STOP TALKING.
REALLY?
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT ARE YOU LIKE THE ONE PERSON
ON THE ENTIRE INTERNET THAT DOESN'T LIE ABOUT THEIR AGE?
-ARE YOU A MENNONITE?
-NO.
I JUST, I DON'T WANT TO MISREPRESENT MYSELF.
OKAY.
I'M GONNA GO OUT ON A LIMB HERE
AND SAY THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT MISREPRESENTING YOURSELF.
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS BECAUSE ONCE YOU DO,
YOU'RE ONE OF US.
IT'S THE FINAL LINE.
THE LAST TABOO.
WELL, THERE'S NO TURNING BACK, VAN FAN.
IT'S IN GOD'S HANDS NOW.
WHAT?
CAN WE JUST TURN COMMENTS OFF?
NO, DUDE, IT'S PART OF THE PUBLIC RECORD NOW.
YOU'RE KILLING ME.
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE.
I LIKE THE WAY YOU EAT.
NEIL, WHEN WE WERE HORSING AROUND,
DID YOU GET A BONER?
-LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF A BONER?
-NO!
OKAY.
IT'S COOL IF YOU DID.
I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE--
WHAT?
NOTHING.
IT'S COOL IF YOU POPPED A CHUB.
GOD, SHUT UP.
-YO.
-WHERE'S MARTINE?
I DON'T KNOW.
AT THE ABORTION CLINIC WITH HER MOM.
WANNA GRAB SOME FOOD?
WE CAN GO TO FOOTLONGERS AND GET SOME SUBS.
WATCH "CELEBRITY APPRENTICE" AT MY PLACE.
AND BY YOUR PLACE YOU MEAN YOUR MOM'S BASEMENT?
YEAH, WHATEVER.
I GOT WEED.
YOU WANNA COME?
WHOA!
WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I LOOK LIKE?
A FUCKING FULL SERVICE FOOD COURT?
NO, THAT'S OKAY.
I'VE GOT MATH HOMEWORK.
SEE, HE'S GOT MATH HOMEWORK.
HE'S GOT A FUTURE.
FUCK YOU.
NEIL, REALLY GREAT WORK TODAY.
I HAVE YOU NYMPH.
THE HOT BREATH IS HIS VOICE IN HER ELONGATED, ELFIN EAR.
THE EAR THAT TO NYMPH KIND,
SECONDED AS A HIGHLY EROGENOUS ZONE.
FAIN WAS LOST UNTO HERSELF.
HIS NAME NOW KNOWN TO HER.
MICHAEL.
SIR MICHAEL.
MY SWEET MICHAEL.
ALL RIGHT, SO NICKLEPENNY COMES THROUGH THE DOOR
MINUS HIS PANTS.
HOLLYCOTTON IS SURPRISED
AND CROSSES TO L-6.
MR. NICKLEPENNY!
-I THOUGHT YOU WERE--
-ACROSS THE HALL?
THIS MANSION IS STILL QUITE A MYSTERY TO ME.
OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
THAT'S TOO MUCH.
REVERSE.
NO, NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT EITHER.
LOOK, I HAVE A TEST IN 30 MINUTES,
AND I'M NOT GOING TO FAIL BECAUSE OF YOUR SLOW ASS.
AND HOW LONG DID WE WAIT FOR YOU TO GET OFF-BOOK?
FUCK YOU!
I HAVE DYSLEXIA.
MISS LEWIS, THIS IS A TECH REHEARSAL
AND I CAN'T PUT UP WITH HER ANYMORE.
I TAKE DYSLEXIA MEDICATION.
JESSIE, TAKE A BREAK.
NEIL, HEY.
NEIL!
HUH?
COULD YOU BE SO KIND AS TO RELIEVE MISS HUNT FOR A MOMENT?
I CAN'T PUT UP WITH HER--
CAN YOU IMAGINE HAVING TO DEAL WITH HER PARENTS?
SO, JESSIE TELLS ME YOU'RE A WRITER.
YOU REALLY FREAKED HER OUT.
-OH, I DIDN'T MEAN TO.
-DUDE, THAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN.
THIS PLACE COULD USE SOME SUBVERSION.
YEAH, UM, IN AP ENGLISH, WE GOT TO READ OSCAR WILDE--
-SO YOU GONNA LET ME READ IT?
-OH.
OKAY, LET'S TAKE IT FROM THE DOUBLE ENTENDRE.
IT SEEMS THAT HORACE HAS MISTAKENLY
TAKEN MY CLOTHES.
THANKFULLY NOT ALL OF THEM.
YES, THANKFULLY.
OH-
- IT'S COTTON.
COTTON'S A VERY VERSATILE FABRIC,
DON'T YOU THINK?
EXTREMELY PLIABLE TO A MAN'S TOUCH.
WHAT APPEARS COURSE,
NOW IN MY HANDS IS SO VERY, VERY SOFT.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, LISTEN TO THIS, "DERON ZAXA,
EVER THE ORATOR, PUT HIS MOUTH TO QUITE A DIFFERENT PURPOSE NOW."
DUDE, THIS DERON ZAXA GUY IS YOU STRAIGHT UP.
-NEIL.
-YOU DO KNOW HE'S STRAIGHT, RIGHT?
THANKS.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DRIVE MY CAR.
ARE YOU CRYING?
NO.
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'RE CRYING.
NEVER DRINK VODKA FROM A PLASTIC JUG WITH A HANDLE.
OKAY.
MIKE HOLLOWAY IS PURE DICK CHEESE.
NEIL, I HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU.
SOMETHING I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT FOR A WHILE.
I THINK YOU USE TOO MUCH FLOWERY PROSE.
WHAT?
YOU SAY THINGS LIKE, "HE STROKED HIS VELVET ROD,"
WHEN YOU SHOULD BE LIKE, "HE PUMPED HIS STONE COCK."
READERS RESPOND BETTER TO DIRECT LANGUAGE.
THANKS.
I CAN IMPART THE WISDOM OF OUR ONE YEAR
AGE DIFFERENCE, YOU KNOW?
UM, YOUR MOM HAS A LOT OF RELIGIOUS STUFF.
YEAH, I THINK THAT'S WHY MY DAD KILLED HIMSELF.
HE WAS GAY, YOU KNOW.
MY DAD, HE KEPT IT TO HIMSELF.
I GUESS HE PREFERRED DEATH TO COMING OUT.
MAN, DO YOU REALLY THINK BEING GAY KILLED HIM?
I DON'T WANNA BE HERE WHEN MY MOM GETS HOME.
WHAT?
MOM'S HOME.
STAY HERE.
I-
- I HAD TO PRINT SOMETHING FOR WORK.
YOU KNOW WE'VE ALWAYS SUPPORTED YOUR INTERESTS.
AND THE INTERNET IS, WOW, AN INCREDIBLE TOOL.
-WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.
-I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS JUST 'CAUSE
INFORMATION IS OUT THERE, DOESN'T MEAN IT'S ACCURATE.
WE JUST DON'T WANT YOU GETTING PARTICULAR INFORMATION, YOU KNOW,
-FROM THE WRONG SOURCES.
-I'M 15.
HEY, YOU CAN READ WHATEVER YOU WANT.
WE'RE FINE WITH THAT.
AS LONG AS YOU'RE READING.
UH-HUH, AS LONG AS IT'S NOT "MEIN KAMPF."
BUT ACTUALLY, WELL, "MEIN KAMPF" IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY INTERESTING READ.
HONEY, I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL AWKWARD ABOUT THIS.
IF YOU WANT TO READ INTELLIGENT PROSE ON HUMAN SEXUALITY
I CAN MAKE YOU A READING LIST.
EWW!
NO!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN INTELLIGENT?
WELL, IT'S JUST WHOEVER WROTE THAT STORY ON YOUR COMPUTER,
THEY OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE THE FIRST CLUE
ABOUT ACTUAL HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS.
IT'S DEMENTED.
I DON'T THINK YOUR MOTHER'S TALKING ABOUT
-THE HOMOSEXUAL CONTENT, NOT PARTICULARLY.
-PLEASE STOP.
IT'S JUST MORE OF A BASIC PLOTTING PROBLEM.
YOU'RE ABSORBING MATERIAL THAT HAS SOME RUDIMENTARY
GRAMMATICAL ERRORS IN IT.
YOU'VE GOT SENTENCE FRAGMENTS,
YOU'VE GOT DANGLING PARTICIPLES.
I ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN HELPING NEIL WITH HIS WRITING.
-HUH.
-HE'S GOT A LOT OF INNATE TALENT.
HE JUST USES TOO MUCH FLOWERY PROSE.
THERE'S NO FLOWERY PROSE!
NEIL TELLS ME YOU TWO ARE CONSIDERING A SPLIT?
- WHAT?
- I'M SORRY.
I JUST THOUGHT I COULD PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT,
SINCE MY PARENTS ARE DIVORCED.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
OPEN AND HONEST DIALOG IS KEY
TO MAINTAINING A STABLE RELATIONSHIP.
-IS IT NOW?
-TOTALLY.
I WRITE ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.
THAT AND BE HONEST ABOUT ONE'S OWN SEXUAL DESIRES.
-IT'S RARE THAT ANYONE EVER IS.
-HUH.
I EDIT A LIT JOURNAL ON WOMEN'S STUDIES.
I PLAN TO PURSUE THAT IN COLLEGE.
-WOMEN'S STUDIES?
-YEAH, FEMALE SEXUALITY
IN LITERATURE, SPECIFICALLY.
REVERSE GENDER ROLES IN POP CULTURE,
SEXUAL SUBMISSIVE HIERARCHY,
RAPE PARADIGMS.
I ACTUALLY WROTE A 22 PAGE THESIS ON THE CONCEPT
OF VENEREAL DISEASE AS A FEMALE GUILT TRIGGER.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
I DID A PAPER ON MONOTREMES, REMEMBER?
ARE MONOTREMES A FORM OF VD?
DON'T BE EMBARRASSED, NEIL.
IT'S NATURAL.
YEAH, NEIL, DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.
IT'S NATURAL.
-DO YOU EVER READ ANY ONLINE--
-DAD!
-I ACTUALLY WRITE ONLINE
-POETRY.
ONLINE POETRY.
LADY POETRY.
-ABOUT STRONG WOMEN.
-LADY POETRY?
YOU REALLY NEED TO BRING FRIEND AROUND MORE OFTEN.
DID NEIL TELL YOU GUYS ABOUT THE CONVENTION?
THE COMIC CON?
- IT'S ALSO FOR WRITERS.
NEIL, YOU DIDN'T MENTION THAT.
IT'S FOR REGULAR WRITERS!
- IS THAT TRUE?
- DEFINE REGULAR.
I THINK SHE MEANS NON-EROTIC.
ARE YOU GUYS CRAZY?
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I WOULD GO TO AN EROTIC WRITING CONVENTION?
I DON'T KNOW!
WHY WOULD YOU HAVE IT ON YOUR COMPUTER?
I MEAN, DO THEY HAVE THAT-- WHAT WAS THE NAME?
-UH-- VANG--
-VANGUARD EROTICA.
-PLEASE STOP SAYING "EROTICA" AT THE DINNER TABLE.
-NO, PLEASE DON'T.
I JUST NEED TO KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO A PLACE FOR ADULTS.
YEAH, MOM HAS A STRICT NO SEX DUNGEON POLICY.
I'M NOT.
WE'RE NOT!
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIE TO ME, YOU KNOW.
YOUR MOM IS NOT AS SQUARE AS YOU THINK.
I EVEN WENT TO A KEY PARTY ONCE.
WHEN DID YOU GO TO A KEY PARTY?
I'M NOT LYING.
GOOD.
GOOD.
SO SPEAKING OF WRITING, HOW MUCH DO YOU GUYS KNOW
ABOUT THE BRONTE SISTERS?
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, NO, NEIL, YOU HAVE TO GET PAST THIS REPRESSION.
YEAH, WELL, WHY DON'T I COME BY
AND GIVE A LECTURE ON THE SEXUAL FANTASIES
OF EMILY BRONTE TO YOUR MOM.
YOUR PARENTS ARE COOL.
YOU'RE LUCKY.
OUR SITUATIONS ARE SO DIFFERENT.
-YOU TOLD ME THAT YOUR DAD KILLED HIMSELF.
-HE DID.
"OH, HEY, NEIL'S PARENTS, WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
GIVE YOU SOME INSIGHT BECAUSE MY PARENTS ARE DIVORCED."
-YOU DON'T GET IT.
-YEAH, I DON'T.
WHAT?
WELL, I'M PICKING YOU UP TOMORROW AT 9 AM,
SO BE READY.
-SOME DINNER, HUH?
-SORRY.
HEY, I LIKE HER.
SHE'S A CHARACTER.
WELL, LEMME GUESS.
I CAN'T GO NOW?
DAD.
I'M GOOD.
TAKE IT.
TAKE IT.
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN I USED TO TAKE YOU
TO THOSE AUTOGRAPH CONVENTIONS?
YEAH.
REMEMBER WHEN YOU STOOD IN LINE FOR TWO HOURS
TO TRY TO GET BUTCH PATRICK TO SIGN
YOUR MUNSTERS LUNCH BOX?
AND THEN HE WOULDN'T.
BUTCH PATRICK WAS A DICK.
ALL RIGHT, AS FAR AS YOUR MOM KNOWS,
YOU'RE STAYING AT YOUR COUSIN'S, ALL RIGHT?
AND I'M COUNTING ON YOU TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
AT LEAST NOT TO DO, NOT TO DO THE WRONG THING.
SHE'S MORE MATURE THAN YOU.
HUH?
IN SOME WAYS?
I MEAN, MAYBE MATURE IS NOT THE RIGHT WORD.
DAD.
YOU REALLY LIKE THIS GIRL, DON'T YOU?
I LIKED THE SAME TYPE.
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE I DID.
BUT BE CAREFUL, HUH?
THESE ARTY GIRLS--
I DON'T WANNA SEE YOU GET HURT, OKAY?
ALL RIGHT, GOOD TALK, RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
HOLA!
NEIL, YOUR FRIENDS ARE MULTIPLYING.
IS THAT A PREGNANT JOKE?
THIS SHIT IS GETTING SUPER OLD.
WE'RE NOT LETTING HER DO THIS AGAIN.
YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT ABOUT ME, BUT I'M NOT A FUCKING FLAKE.
-WHAT HAPPENED?
-MIKE HAPPENED.
FUCKING DOUCHEBAG.
IT'S A GOOD THING I WENT BY THERE.
-SHE'S NOT GONNA GO?
-OH, SHE'S GOING.
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU.
LOOK AT WHAT YOU DO TO YOURSELF FOR HER, DUMB ASS.
THAT'S FINE.
I FEEL KIND OF RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU.
I MEAN, YOU'RE JUST LIKE HER WHEN WE FIRST MET.
I LIKED HER 'CAUSE SHE WAS ALL SMART AND FUNNY,
AND SHE TRIED SO HARD TO BE MY FRIEND.
AND SHE WOULD, LIKE, OFFER TO DO MY HOMEWORK AND SHIT.
AND I WOULD JUST MAKE FUN OF HER COSTUMES AND STUFF.
YOU KNOW SHE USED TO DRESS LIKE AN ELF, RIGHT?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DIDN'T THINK I TRIED TO CHANGE HER.
I MEAN I TOOK HER OUT WITH MIKE, AND THAT WAS IT.
I GUESS HE WAS LIKE THE FIRST NORMAL GUY
TO EVER TAKE INTEREST IN HER.
HE'S NORMAL?
DON'T CHANGE FOR HER, DUDE.
DON'T LET HER BE YOUR MIKE.
-PLEASE BE QUIET, OKAY?
MY MOM'S SLEEPING.
-SHE HERE?
-YES.
-THEN WHAT THE FUCK, DUDE,
-WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?
-I DON'T--
SHE TOLD NEIL SHE WOULD TAKE HIM TO COMIC CON.
HOLY SHIT.
THAT'S AMAZING.
DUDE.
OH, HO, DUDE, PLEASE GET OUT.
I NEED A BETTER LOOK AT THIS.
THIS COMING FROM A GUY IN HIS PAJAMAS.
I'M LISTEN-
- I'M NOT BUSTING YOUR BALLS.
I PROMISE YOU.
JUST COME ON.
- I NEED A FUCKING PICTURE.
- YOU'RE SUCH A DICK.
I'M NOT THE ONE MAKING A SCENE, OKAY, MARTINE?
YOU'RE THE ONE MAKING A SCENE RIGHT NOW.
COME ON, GET UP.
GIVE ME A LITTLE, GIVE ME A LITTLE TWIRLY TWIRL.
OH, MAN, I'M NOT NEARLY STONED ENOUGH FOR THIS RIGHT NOW.
OH!
WHAT THE FUCK!
JESUS!
-I ONLY WANTED A PICTURE, FREAK.
-YOU ARE THE FREAK.
YOU AND YOUR STUPID FUCKING MUSTACHE.
OW.
YO, BRO.
YOU EVER SEE THOSE UM-- YOU EVER SEE THOSE PICTURES
I TOOK OF HER WEARING THAT ELF SHIT?
WELL, SOMETIMES ALL SHE WORE WERE THOSE LITTLE EARS.
YEAH, THOSE WERE MY SPECIAL PICS.
NEIL!
GET THE FUCK OFF!
OH, GALADRIEL.
BABE, I KNEW YOU WERE A NERD.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A FUCKING RETARD.
WHOA!
OH, SHIT!
OH!
THIS IS FUNNY.
YOU'RE FUCKING CRAZY.
YOU CAN'T BE ALL STOIC IN THAT COSTUME.
IT LOOKS RIDICULOUS.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
I AM WORRIED ABOUT DRIVING FOR THREE HOURS
WITH A GUILT-BOT PROGRAMMED TO GUILT ME TO DEATH.
HOW CAN YOU HANG OUT WITH THAT GUY?
HE'S LIKE EVERYTHING YOU PRETEND TO HATE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "PRETEND?"
NOTHING.
JUST FORGET IT.
YOU ARE ACTING LIKE A REALLY JEALOUS BOYFRIEND RIGHT NOW.
WELL, I'M NOT YOUR BOYFRIEND.
YEAH, YOU'RE NOT.
HEY, I'M SORRY.
OKAY, I KNOW-- I KNOW THAT MIKE
BRINGS OUT THE WORST IN ME.
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, IT WAS, LIKE, REALLY COOL
WHEN YOU KNOCKED HIM DOWN.
FUCKER.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
ABOUT THE LIVE READ.
I KNOW ALREADY.
I SAW.
IT WAS POSTED ON THE FORUM.
CONGRATS.
I TOLD YOU IT WAS GOOD.
-DID THEY WRITE YOU?
-MM-HMM, YEAH.
THEY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THE NUMBER OF SLOTS.
POLITICS AGAIN.
POLITICS.
I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU TRANSCENDED ALL OF THAT.
YEAH.
WELCOME TO COMIC CON.
WHAT NAME IS YOUR RESERVATION UNDER?
HOW DO YOU KNOW WE'RE HERE FOR COMIC CON?
EMILY BRONTE.
ALL RIGHT, MISS BRONTE,
I HAVE YOU DOWN FOR A SINGLE KING?
OH, CAN WE GET TWO BEDS?
UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE AT CAPACITY.
THAT'S OKAY.
WE'LL SLEEP TOGETHER.
SWANKY.
IT'S BIG.
COME HERE.
TRY THIS OUT!
I DON'T WANNA MESS UP MY COSTUME.
DID YOU TALK TO THEM YET?
NO, DO I NEED TO?
YOU'RE READING TOMORROW.
IF IT WERE ME, I WOULD BE CHECKING UP ON LIKE
THE ORDER OF THE LINEUP AND HOW MUCH TIME I HAVE,
AND HOW I'M GONNA BE TAPED AND SHIT.
TAPED?
WHY WOULD THEY TAPE IT?
I DON'T WANT TO BE ON TAPE.
THAT'S NORMAL, OKAY?
YOU NEED TO RELAX.
YOU'RE SO FUCKING NUTS.
JESUS.
WHAT'S WITH YOU?
YOU LOOK LIKE HOW I LOOK
WHEN I'M TRYING TO AVOID SOMEONE.
OKAY, SO WE HAVE THE OPENING NIGHT PARTY TONIGHT.
AND THEN TOMORROW WE HAVE WRITER EVALS 'TIL FIVE,
THEN THE SLASH MIXER, AND THEN THE LIVE READ.
HELLO!
PERSON TALKING TO YOU I.R.L.
SORRY.
UM-- I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GAWK AT YOUR PHONE SOMEWHERE
WHERE I CAN'T GIVE YOU SHIT ABOUT IT.
-FINE, I'LL LEAVE IT.
-NO, DON'T DO IT FOR ME, DUDE.
I'M JUST TRYING TO BUST YOU OUT
OF YOUR SELF-INDUCED SOCIAL MEDIA PRISON.
YOU'VE REALLY OPENED MY EYES.
THROW OFF THE SHACKLES!
THROW 'EM OFF!
WIZARDS MAN.
WAND-ON-WAND ACTION.
THAT'S WHAT THE READERS WANT.
IT'S CASTING A SPELL ON MY WAND,
-I'LL TELL YOU THAT.
-YEAH.
BUT THAT HARRY-DRACO GENRE, THAT'S GETTING OLD.
NOW WHAT I'M INTO IS THAT SNAPE-DUMBLEDORE FIC.
WOW, THAT IS LITERALLY OLD.
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE INTO OCTOGENARIANS?
YEAH, WELL, UH, VANGUARD IS NO SPRING CHICKEN.
EASY.
WELL, USUALLY.
HEY.
OH, DID YOU READ THAT STORY I SENT YOU,
"PANTY RAID AT SLYTHERIN"?
OH, YEAH, DUDE.
I CALLED MY MOM.
I READ IT OUT LOUD.
FINALLY.
COME ON.
WE GOT BUSINESS TO CONDUCT.
I THINK I'D RATHER GO LOOK AT COMICS.
NEIL, THIS IS TOHO.
WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING?
I DUNNO.
TOHO?
UH, HMMM...
IS BLUE.
IT'S BLUE.
WORKS FOR ME.
THAT IS A SICK VANGUARD COSTUME
YOU'VE GOT THERE, BRO.
IS THAT FROM "KRAGON'S WAR?"
ANYWAYS, SO-- MY NAME IS HAGOFF PAUL
AND THIS IS A LITTLE GREETING.
IS THAT?
IS THAT LSD?
FOR THE PARTY TONIGHT, PLAYBOY.
IT'S MOLLY.
MDMA?
-NO, NO.
-IT LOOKS LIKE ACID.
IT'S ECSTASY.
HAVE YOU EVER DONE THAT BEFORE?
NO, BUT I WANT TO.
THAT STUFF STAYS IN YOUR SYSTEM FOREVER.
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF AN ACID FLASHBACK?
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP IN A YEAR
AND STAB MY PARENTS TO DEATH WITH A KITCHEN KNIFE, OKAY?
WELL, THAT MAKES ONE OF US.
WHAT IF IT RUINS THE WHOLE WEEKEND?
WHAT IF WE MISS THE LIVE READING
BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE HOSPITAL GETTING OUR STOMACH'S PUMPED?
WE ARE GOING TO A PARTY
WITH ALL SORTS OF LIGHTS AND COSTUMES, OKAY?
-DO YOU NORMALLY GO TO PARTIES, NEIL?
-NO.
-DO YOU LIKE TO MINGLE?
-NO.
-OPEN YOUR MOUTH, PLAYBOY.
-NO...
JULIA.
THERE WE GO.
OH, WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T SWALLOW.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I SWALLOW IT?
♪ WE'RE GOING BACK AND FORTH WE'RE GOING BACK AND FORTH ♪
I'M HALLUCINATING!
IT'S NOT ACID!
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
HOLD HER THERE.
OFF, OFF, OFF, OFF.
-I'M SICK.
-OKAY.
I'M SO STONED.
STONED ON ACID.
I MEAN, MOLLY--
THIS MUST BE LIKE EVERY DAY FOR MADONNA.
HERE.
DRINK SOME WATER.
OH, OKAY.
OH.
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.
YOU'RE IN A TOTALLY SAFE PLACE.
WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE UH...
EVER BEEN ATTRACTED TO ANYONE BEFORE YOU.
YOU MEAN ANY GIRL.
ANY HUMAN BEING.
WHAT ARE YOU ATTRACTED TO ABOUT ME?
I'M NOT ASHAMED OF MYSELF WITH YOU.
SHOULD I HAVE DONE THAT?
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT.
PANTS.
-ARE YOU DOING YOUR HOMEWORK?
-NO.
"JULIA TUGGED AT HIS PANTS,
SLIDING THEM DOWN EVER SO SLOWLY."
OKAY, IF YOU'RE GONNA WRITE ABOUT US,
YOU NEED TO USE SOME MODIFIERS.
"JULIA TUGGED AT HIS TIGHT PANTS,
SLIDING THEM OFF PAINFULLY SLOW.
SAVORING THE MOMENT THE HEIGHTENED
PLEASURE INVOLVED."
I'M GLAD YOU DECIDED TO BRANCH OUT.
YOU'RE A TOUGH ONE TO FIGURE OUT.
NO, I'M NOT.
HI, YOU'VE REACHED JULIA'S VOICEMAIL.
I PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
HI, YOU'VE REACHED JULIA'S VOICEMAIL.
I PROBABLY--
THE ALLITERATION IS GOOD, BUT YOU USE IT WAY TOO MUCH.
YEAH, IT'S SORT OF MY CRUTCH.
AND THE ALLEGORY IS A BIT ON-THE-NOSE.
OH, I ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WAS MORE OF A METAPHOR THAN AN ALLEGORY.
UH, DO YOU KNOW WHAT AN ALLEGORY IS?
LOOK, YOU'RE OKAY.
UH, AND YOU'RE FEMALE.
WE NEED MORE WOMEN IN OUR FIELD.
MOST OF THEM ARE PRETTY UGLY.
UNLIKE YOU.
YOU CAN HAVE A CAREER.
WRITING IS MORE THAN JUST WRITING.
THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS.
DUDE, I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
IT'S A-- IT'S A TIJUANA BIBLE.
IT'S QUITE THE IMPORTANT ARTIFACT.
MEXICANS ARE FAR MORE SEXUALLY LIBERATED.
WHAT'S WITH THE LOOK?
YOU JUST LEFT THIS MORNING.
YEAH, I WAS GETTING A CRITIQUE.
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.
TO MEET THE PROS.
I'M SORRY.
HEY.
I HAVE TO GO MEET SOMEONE.
WHO?
DENIS?
SORRY, I LOOKED THROUGH YOUR PHONE.
I DIDN'T THINK THAT YOU WOULD CARE.
HEY-
- DON'T!
DON'T DO THAT.
-WHAT'S YOUR DEAL?
-NOTHING.
DON'T GET ALL WEIRD ON ME JUST BECAUSE WE MESSED AROUND.
WHY DID YOU RIP UP OUR PAGES?
I DON'T KNOW.
WE WERE ZONKED.
WE WROTE SOME CRAZY SHIT, OKAY?
I DIDN'T WANT IT JUST FLOATING AROUND.
SO LAST NIGHT WAS JUST THE DRUGS?
YOU HAVE BEEN HIDING THIS DENIS GUY FROM ME.
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK THAT YOU WERE STRAIGHT.
CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
HOW ABOUT NOW?
I'LL CHECK MY BARS.
THAT'S BETTER.
OH, I'M SORRY.
THIS IS AGE RESTRICTED.
HI.
OH, MY GOD, NEIL.
OH, I'M SO SORRY.
I UH-
- I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO LOOK UH, SO YOUNG.
-UH, DO YOU WANNA SEE MY ID?
-NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, I'M SORRY, BELIEVE ME, I LOOKED YOUNG
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE, TOO.
UH, WHEN I WAS 18.
-YOU STILL LOOK YOUNG.
-OH, WELL, THANK YOU.
OH, MY GOD, IT'S JUST SO GREAT TO UH, FINALLY MEET YOU,
IN THE FLESH, SO TO SPEAK, UM...
-YEAH.
-YEAH.
-OH, YES, OF COURSE.
SHALL WE?
-YEAH.
YOU'RE STARING.
VIRGINS STARE.
-THEY DO?
-YEAH, WELL, CON VIRGINS.
YEAH, IT'S JUST SO WEIRD NOW THAT IT'S ALL IN 3-D.
YEAH, I KNOW.
INTERNET RULE 34.
IF IT EXISTS THERE'S PORN OF IT.
JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL.
I JUST DISCOVERED WHAT A CURTAIN FIC IS.
-CURTAIN FIC?
-MM-HMM.
I MEAN, OKAY, SO, THIS IS AIMED AT OLDER GAYS.
OF COURSE THEY'RE LIKE POST-SEX,
PROTO-NESTING, DOMESTIC FETISHISTS.
AND SO NORMALLY WHERE YOU'D HAVE LIKE KIRK AND SPOCK,
YOU KNOW, MAKING LOVE,
UH, IN THIS CASE, IT'S COUPLES HAVING THESE LIKE LAVISH SHOPPING SPREES
AT POTTERY BARN.
FOR CURTAINS.
THEY SELL CURTAINS AT POTTERY BARN?
THEY SELL EVERYTHING AT POTTERY BARN.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT'S MOSTLY HARMLESS I GUESS,
BUT NOT ALL OF IT IS...
AND YOU REALLY NEED TO WATCH OUT FOR CREEPS,
ESPECIALLY AT YOUR AGE.
-BUT YOU'RE NOT A CREEP.
-NO, I'M NOT A CREEP,
BUT ISN'T THAT EXACTLY WHAT A CREEP WOULD SAY?
OH, I THOUGHT YOU CAME ALONE.
OH, JESUS, SPEAKING OF CREEPY.
I CAME WITH A FRIEND.
OH, AND DOES HE WRITE SLASH?
SHE.
AND YEAH.
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, I THINK SHE'S IN REGULAR WRITING TODAY.
OH, REGULAR WRITING.
-DENIS.
-OH, RONNIE, HEY, UM, THIS IS NEIL.
-HE'S ONE OF OUR NEW WRITERS.
-OH, YEAH, I BET.
RONNIE HARWOOD.
I'M SENIOR WRITER AT THE RABBIT'S HOLE.
SO SOME OF THE INNER CIRCLE ARE GONNA GO OUT
FOR AN EARLY DINNER BEFORE THE READING.
-ARE YOU GAME?
-YEAH.
YOU CAN BRING YOUR NEW LITTLE FRIEND.
EVERYBODY AGREES THAT BATMAN BLOWING ROBIN
AND ROBIN BLOWING BATMAN IS TOTALLY PLAYED OUT,
BUT NOW I'M SEEING CHRISTIAN BALE'S BATMAN
BLOWING BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN.
BLOWING VAL KILMER.
OH, THAT'S REALLY HOT.
I GOT A CEASE AND DESIST FROM WARNER'S LAST WEEK,
SO OBVIOUSLY I'M DOING SOMETHING RIGHT.
YEAH, YOU'RE MOVING UP IN THE WORLD.
WHAT KIND OF SLASH DO YOU WRITE?
YOU'VE BEEN TO OUR WEBSITE, IT'S EASY ENOUGH TO FIND.
RIGHT.
I'M GUESSING THIS IS YOUR FIRST CON,
SINCE YOU'RE WHAT, HE'S 18?
-MM-HMM.
-YEAH, 18.
HMM.
I WAS EDITING THE R.P.F. BOARD TODAY.
I'LL NEVER GET ALL THE BIEBER FIC.
NEIL, ARE YOU INTO JUSTIN BIEBER?
WHAT'S R.P.F.?
R.P.F. IS REAL PEOPLE FICTION OR CELEBRITY SLASH.
SLASH ABOUT, YOU KNOW, CELEBS.
OH, OH, LIKE THE BRONTE SISTERS.
THEY WROTE STORIES ABOUT NAPOLEON
AND THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON.
YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY OLD SCHOOL,
BUT NOW IT'S MOSTLY JUST LIKE POINTLESS BOY BAND ORGIES.
YEAH, AND JUVENILE REGRESSIVES ARE POPPING UP ALL OVER.
SPEAKING OF...
HOW LONG HAVE YOU SLASHED VANGUARD?
OH, VANGUARD IS JUVENILE, BUT TREK AND TOLKIEN, THAT'S--
IT'S ALL ABOUT AUDIENCE AND INTENT, DENIS.
THIS IS FIRST YEAR STUFF.
VANGUARD DOESN'T PLAY TO THE 40-PLUS CROWD, OUR BASE.
BESIDES, IT'S NOT OUR MISSION TO INDOCTRINATE CHILDREN.
IT'S NOT OUR MISSION TO INDOCTRINATE ANYONE.
I READ TOLKIEN WHEN I WAS EIGHT.
YES, AND DENIS LOVES HIS VANGUARD.
RONNIE PREFERS HER MASTURBATION MATERIAL
TO STEM FROM BAD '60S TELEVISION.
YOU EVER SEE "THE BRADY BUNCH," DUDE?
REALLY, FREDDIE?
HE'S A CHILD.
MAINSTREAM SUCCESS HAS NO BEARING ON OUR FIELD.
NEVER HAS.
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS JUVENILE FICTION
BEGETS JUVENILE EROTICA.
LET ME BE FRANK.
YOU WRITE SEX LIKE A 12-YEAR-OLD
AND I THINK YOU KNOW IT.
IT'S LIKE YOU FOUND ALL THESE PROVOCATIVE WORDS
AND JUST TOSSED THEM INTO A TEXT EDITOR.
HAVE YOU EVER EVEN HAD SEX?
I DOUBT HALF OUR WRITERS HAVE HAD SEX.
-LET ME SEE YOUR ID.
-RONNIE.
WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, DENIS,
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO TO JAIL.
NOBODY'S GOING TO JAIL.
JESUS!
NEIL, COME ON.
IT'S FINE.
SIT DOWN.
YEAH, IT'S FINE IF HE PONIES UP AN ID.
I REMEMBER NOW.
YOU WROTE ALL THAT REALLY GROSS MIKE AND GREG BRADY FIC.
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED SEX WITH 12-YEAR-OLDS.
IF IT'S WRITTEN MATURELY.
NICE.
ARE YOU REALLY 18?
NEIL, NEIL, COME ON, STOP.
STOP, STOP, STOP.
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
LOOK, RONNIE, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, SHE'S LIKE THAT WITH EVERYBODY.
IT'S NOT YOU.
OH, UM.
LET'S GO SOMEPLACE ELSE.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WAIT.
IT JUST-- THIS DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.
WHY?
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA BE MAD, I'M NOT BE UPSET OR ANYTHING.
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME HOW OLD YOU ARE.
-I ALREADY TOLD YOU.
-I KNOW, I KNOW.
TELL ME AGAIN.
-15.
-15?
OH, FUCK!
I'LL BE 16 IN NOVEMBER.
-PLEASE DON'T REJECT ME.
-DUDE, THIS IS WRONG.
I KNOW IT IS.
THIS IS JUST THE SECOND TIME TODAY.
-I COULD GO TO JAIL.
-I WON'T TELL ANYONE.
DID YOU JUST TELL ME YOU WERE 18 SO YOU COULD GET INTO THE LIVE READING?
-NO!
-WHAT DO YOU EVEN WANT FROM ME?
I JUST THOUGHT IT'D BE DIFFERENT.
HERE WITH YOU.
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
YOU ACTUALLY REMIND ME A LOT OF MYSELF.
-YOU TURNED OUT OKAY.
-DID I?
I SHOT OFF A SERIES OF INSANE MESSAGES
TO SOMEBODY I DIDN'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT.
I SAID THINGS I WOULD NEVER SAY TO SOMEBODY FACE TO FACE.
EVER.
YOU KNOW, OUTSIDE OF LIKE CONS,
I HAVE PRACTICALLY ZERO SOCIAL SKILLS.
MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID IT'S GOING TO GET ME IN TROUBLE,
AND NOW HERE I AM.
AND YES, INCIDENTALLY, I LIVE WITH MY MOTHER,
IN THE HOUSE WHERE I GREW UP, IN SAGINAW.
SO, YOU KNOW, DON'T BE TOO SURE ABOUT THINGS.
YOU LIVE WITH YOUR MOM?
STOP.
STOP.
STOP.
STOP.
YOU SAID THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME.
IT IT SOMEONE IN OUR GROUP?
WAS IT THAT GIRL YOU CAME HERE WITH?
YEAH, WELL.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE STRAIGHT.
-I MIGHT NOT BE.
-WELL, THIS ISN'T THE WAY TO FIND OUT.
YOU HAVE TIME.
YOU'RE WRITING.
FOCUS ON THAT.
HOW CAN I FOCUS ON SOMETHING
I'M NOT EVEN OLD ENOUGH TO DO?
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
YOU WANT TO BE A WRITER?
A REAL WRITER, NOT FAN FIC?
YOU'RE GOOD.
KEEP WRITING AND LET THE REST OF THE STUFF
SORT ITSELF OUT NATURALLY.
I WISH SOMEBODY HAD TOLD ME THAT WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.
WELL, YOU BETTER GO.
IT'S ABOUT TIME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO HERE IS.
I WANNA MAKE SURE YOU'RE OKAY.
WELL, I KNOW YOU HAVE TO GO.
I AM THE MODERATOR.
I MEAN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY, I'M NOT COMING.
I CAN'T, NOT NOW.
NOT RIGHT NOW.
I WISH IT WASN'T THIS WAY.
YOU KNOW, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I THINK YOU WANT TO BE QUEER.
WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT THAT?
TO FIT IN,
EVEN SOME PLACE SMALL.
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.
YOU CAME BACK?
THE LIVE READ'S ABOUT TO START.
YOU SHOULD BE THERE.
I CAME BACK FOR YOU.
YOU DON'T GET IT.
YOU SUBMITTED ONCE AND THEY'RE LIKE,
"HEY, COME READ IT ON STAGE."
I HAVE LIKE 500 THINGS POSTED UP THERE.
I KNOW.
I'VE READ EVERY ONE OF THEM.
IT'S HARD CARING ABOUT SOMEONE.
LETTING THEM CARE ABOUT YOU.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE HARD.
I LOVE YOU.
I KISSED HIM.
THAT DENIS GUY?
I'M NOT GOING TO THE LIVE READ.
-YOU HAVE TO.
-I CAN'T.
NEIL, PLEASE, FOR BOTH OF US.
FUCK THOSE CRUSTY OLD ASSHOLES.
I FOLLOWED YOU INTO THE RESTAURANT
WHEN YOU WEREN'T ANSWERING MY CALLS.
I'M SORRY THAT LADY IS SUCH AN ASSHOLE.
LOOK, THEY ONLY WIN IF YOU LET THEM.
YOU ARE A FEATURED FUCKING STORY, DUDE.
YOU MADE IT!
WE'RE DOING THIS.
YOU AND ME TOGETHER.
I AM YOUR GODDAMN COACH.
OKAY?
AS THEY ENTERED THE NEXIVERSE,
GANDALF, HIS PENIS NOW LONGER THAN HIS STAFF,
TUNED-
- TURNED TO DUMBLEDORE,
"DUMBLEDORE," HE SAID TO DUMBLEDORE,
"ONLY THE ENERGY OF OUR MUTUAL ORGASM,
COMBINED WITH UNBROKEN EYE CONTACT
CAN CLOSE THE DOOR TO THE NEXIVERSE,
THUS STOPPING THE COMBINED ARMIES OF SAURON AND VOLDEMORT.
WITHOUT A MOMENT'S THOUGHT, DUMBLEDORE SELFLESSLY
GAVE OF HIS OWN MANHOOD,
PLACING THE HEAD OF HIS POUNDING PENIS
AGAINST THAT OF THE WISE OLD WIZARD FROM ALT MIDDLE EARTH,
LIKE IN GHOSTBUSTERS.
END OF CHAPTER SEVEN.
OKAY, THAT WAS GAN-DUM 69
WITH "HOLE PLUGGERS OF THE NEXIVERSE."
AND WHO DOESN'T LIKE SOME GOOD OLD-FASHIONED WIZARD-ON-WIZARD ACTION?
ONE MORE TIME FOR HER, GAN-DUM 69.
UM...
SO-UH, I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS MY FEELINGS
ABOUT WHAT WE DO AND THE PURPOSE IT SERVES.
OFTEN WE'RE TREATED LIKE FREAKS.
ESPECIALLY THOSE OF US WHO ARE A LITTLE BIT OLDER.
AND UH, STILL DOING THIS.
UM...
AND WHEN WE'RE AWAY FROM THIS LITTLE COMMUNITY
THAT WE'VE CREATED FOR OURSELVES,
YOU KNOW, WE'RE OUTSIDERS, AND WE'RE WEIRDOES,
AND WE'RE SEXUAL DEVIANTS,
BUT NOT HERE.
OUR NEXT READER IS A YOUNG MAN
THAT I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING WITH MUCH INTEREST.
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE HE WRITES VANGUARD.
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE STAGE, VAN FAN 42.
UM, THIS IS CALLED...
"SHORE LEAVE ON DREENAN FOUR."
"THE BALMY TROPIC WEATHER PATTERNS
OF DREENAN FOUR GAVE CAUSE FOR THE INDIGENOUS PROXANS
TO WEAR VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY OF ATTIRE.
THIS YEAR WITH THE ELLIPTICAL ORBIT PULLING THEM CLOSER
THAN EVER TO DREENAN PRIME,
CLOTHING WAS MORE A HARDSHIP THAN AN OPTION.
VANGUARD FOUND HIMSELF UNARMORED
ON THE BEACHES OF THE ZARAUG
DURING WHAT SEEMED TO BE A RELIGIOUS MATING RITUAL.
'DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHERE THEY KEEP THE TOWELS?
'
A LEAN, NAKED PROXON INQUIRED.
HIS SUPPLE MANHOOD STOOD PROUD
AGAINST THE HARSH LIGHT OF DREENAN PRIME.
THE PROXON BOY REPEATED HIMSELF,
'WELL, DO YOU?
'
VANGUARD'S HAND NOW PUMPED HIS STONE COCK."
HE'S 15.
YOU'RE OUTSIDERS.
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SUPPORT OTHER OUTSIDERS.
I MEAN, YOU GUYS WRITE NINJA TURTLE BONDAGE PORN
AND YOU'RE JUDGING?
HE JUST POURED OUT HIS SAD, PATHETIC HEART
TO YOU PHILISTINES!
AND I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
LET HIM READ.
NO.
I MAY BE 15,
BUT YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE.
I'LL BE 16 IN A FEW MONTHS.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, THAT IS MY FAULT.
I'M THE ONE WHO BROKE THE RULES.
DON'T BLAME HIM.
SO YOU'RE NOT-- MAD AT ME ANYMORE, RIGHT?
I'D ONLY BE MAD IF YOU STOPPED WRITING BECAUSE OF THIS.
ME?
NO.
I'VE GOT MY BODY ARMOR ON.
HEY, I LOVE YOU, TOO.
WELL, DUH.
I GOTTA TELL YOU SOMETHING.
I THINK I MAY BE A LESBIAN.
THE WAY I FIGURE IT...
IF I'M LESBIAN AND YOU'RE GAY,
THEN WE CAN BE A GAY COUPLE,
AND IT SORT OF CANCELS EACH OTHER OUT.
CAUSE I'M MORE MANNISH AND YOU'RE LIKE A GIRL.
WAIT, WHAT...
I'M LIKE A GIRL?
I'M SORRY, NEIL.
I'M SORRY I SAID YOU WERE GAY.
I DON'T KNOW WHY I SAID THAT.
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU ARE.
THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT.
I TOLD THEM YOU WERE 16.
WHAT?
I'M THE REASON YOU DIDN'T GET INTO THE LIVE READ.
IT WAS MY FAULT.
IT WAS DOWN TO YOU AND ME,
AND I TOLD THEM THAT I WAS 18,
AND YOU WERE 16.
THAT EDITOR, RONNIE, LOVES YOUR WRITING.
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.
IT NEVER WAS,
SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP WRITING.
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE READING.
I'M SORRY.
YEAH.
I REALLY DO LOVE YOU.
IT'S NOT SO CRAZY THEY BELIEVED YOU WERE 18.
YOU DO LOOK OLDER NOW.
JESUS!
MOM KNOWS YOU STAYED WITH HER.
WHAT?
-MOM'S AROUND?
-MM-HMM.
-HOW BAD IS IT?
-IT'S BAD.
DAD TOOK A BULLET FOR YOU.
THAT GIRL'S MOM CALLED.
DID YOU GUYS STEAL HER CREDIT CARD?
I HOPE YOU LOST YOUR CHERRY, NEILY BOPPER.
'CAUSE FROM THE SOUND OF IT,
YOU MIGHT NOT BE SEEING MUCH OF HER FOR A WHILE.
LET ME SEE THAT.
WHAT, DO YOU THINK I'M TOO DUMB?
DON'T WORRY, MAN, SHE'LL COME AROUND.
SEASONS END,
EVEN ON MILLIARCHA V, WHERE NUCLEAR WINTER
WAS SLOWLY GIVING WAY TO BRIGHT SPRING.
VANGUARD FELT IT.
AND HE KNEW HIS OWN SEASON WAS NOW AT A CLOSE.
BE IT BURIAL IN THE COLD VACUUM OF SPACE,
OR A QUAINT DOMESTIC CABIN ON THE FRONTIER'S RIM,
EVERYONE RETIRES.
THINGS, PEOPLE...
COME INTO YOUR LIFE SUDDENLY,
AND THEN ARE JUST AS SUDDENLY GONE.
BUT THEIR SEASON SHAPES YOU.
MAKES YOU DARE THINGS YOU HADN'T PREVIOUSLY EVEN DREAMT.
AND FOR THAT, AND FOR MY FRIEND, THIS AUTHOR IS HAPPY.

The pleasure gardens of milliarcha v made it the Jewel of the inner rim for over five centuries.
It took nearly 48 hours for everything to change.
A great alien evil had enslaved the once peaceful planet.
For the high council, there was only one option.
Vanguard, the infamous mercenary was dispatched to face the entity responsible, the kragon, the Duke of raggidi, the butcher of barsa, destroyer of worlds.
Vanguard's orders were simple.
Eliminate.
Time for school.
I know.
He crashed hard.
Vanguard nearly broke the slave girl's fall.
She was straddling him now.
Face to face.
Seems I didn't leave this world early enough.
The air is still breathable.
Just the same.
Neither gained much ground.
They were almost evenly matched.
We are almost evenly matched.
Almost?
I was weaned on the psychedelic gasses of raggidi prime.
I see their effect on humans is not unusual.
It would be a shame to waste so worthy an adversary.
The raggidi also find the gas to have a pleasing effect.
Vanguard peered into the evil lord's eyes, then back to the slave girl.
Then those eyes.
Then the girl.
Then the eyes.
And then the girl.
Then the...
It all happened so fast.
A flash of bodies, limbs, flesh pressing together.
Their hunger knew no bounds.
Suddenly all the atrocities, the murderous tyrant had ever committed were nothing more than an afterthought.
Lust was the only thing on vanguard's mind.
Lust was all that mattered now.
- A toast.
It's my good fortune to have a good fortune.
And I bring it all to you, most honorable heads of houses, prentiss and hollycotton.
And of course, your highly eligible daughters, one of whom I soon intend to wed.
- He knew it was wrong.
-
-Cheers.
But why did it feel so right?
In the throes of passion, vanguard was quickly reminded of the debacle at the high council.
And with it, his previous conquest.
-What's that?
-Nothing.
If it's nothing, why do you care?
It wouldn't even make sense.
Really?
Are you saying I'm dumb?
No, there's just-- there's no context.
Neil, is that a diary?
I don't know.
Neil won't let me see it.
-Let me see that.
-Hey!
Senator zaxa approached vanguard, his eyes set on the soldier of fortune's engorged...
Pelvic region?
Mother of fuck!
We should burn it.
We don't burn books, Jessie.
Fucking disgusting.
Many taxonomic groups don't actually have separate sexes, so hermaphroditism is a normal thing.
Now what Edward is handing out represents the sequential hermaphrodite.
In this case, the slipper snail.
It begins its life as a male.
But if the female population dwindles, then the largest male in the group will spontaneously switch genders.
I will pull your face off.
Oh, I'm shaking.
All right.
Stand.
-You wrote this?
-Fuck no.
Julia, out.
Now.
Okay, who's the budding d.H. Lawrence here?
Mr. shafer.
Let's chat after class.
Where's mom?
She's at her book club thingy.
What book are they reading?
-What?
-At mom's book club, what book?
Are you autistic?
Who cares?
Dad doesn't want to think about her stupid book club.
-She's exploring interests.
-Fuck that.
Maybe she's with an attorney.
Your mother is not with an attorney.
We're just figuring stuff out, okay?
- Like how to get divorced?
-
-Uh!
What do you even know about divorce in the first place?
You wanna start some shit?
-Whoa, what is that?
-Neil got caught with porno and now he has to see a counselor.
Porno?
Like porno porno?
I didn't have porno, idiot.
Really?
Because, oh, it says right here-- lemme-- lemme see that.
Oh, Jesus.
I knew it was a bad idea to go there alone.
But my tire was low, and I couldn't make it back.
The gas station was closed and the lights were off, but the air compressor still took my change.
As I pumped new life into the flaccid tire,
I heard a voice behind me.
He was older, probably in his 40s, by the sound of him.
But I didn't dare turn around to check.
He pressed the pistol hard against my lower back.
Pushing, pushing it through my sweater until it bruised my flesh.
He told me to get down on all fours,
-like a dog.
-Thank you, Julia, that is enough.
-I'm not finished.
-Oh, you're finished.
-Have a seat.
-I have three pages left.
This wasn't the assignment.
Well, you assigned a confessional.
This didn't happen to you.
-How do you know?
-Come on.
What?
It could have.
- Not likely.
Mr. snow, this is a narrative writing class and I wrote a narrative.
It is not your place to condemn my subject.
But it absolutely is my place to condemn inappropriate material.
How the hell can you call this inappropriate?
You're not even qualified to judge.
You're a man.
So are you.
All right, okay, we're done here.
I need to see the principal.
Are you going to get him?
Sign in and sit down.
Eww.
Pohl?
Is that "starchild?"
Yeah.
Pohl's only halfway okay when he collaborates with other writers.
Did you ever read "the space merchants?"
Mm-hmm.
It's pretty good.
I think this one kinda sucks though.
I have something for you.
I didn't know you wrote.
Oh, i-- this- i didn't mean for- i liked it.
Are you in trouble?
Yeah, I have to see a counselor.
Yeah, well, I'm here for enacting my first amendment rights.
I wrote an erotic fable.
Well, it was more of a parable.
It's a bit more grounded than yours, but-- you get the idea.
What?
Do you write other stories, like, um-- like erotic literature?
Mm-hmm.
All the time.
-It's all online.
-Really?
Where?
A riddle.
Eat me, drink me.
Well, good luck, young juvie.
Wait, you're leaving?
Where are they?
I don't think you're supposed to smoke.
My mom smoked when she was pregnant with me.
I don't think that's-- it's not like a myth.
It's a circulation thing.
No, it's fine.
We get it, shit ass!
All right, where to?
The mall!
His was the way of the warrior.
Crass.
Uneducated.
But strong.
His abilities would prove useless in the enchanted forest.
Where the ancient inhabitants dwelled and recesses of one's own mind.
The hunter pushed forth unaware fain had been watching him from the moment he entered.
Neil!
It's Neil, right?
Are you watching me?
No.
Well, yeah.
No, i-
- I was just curious.
-About?
-What we talked about the other day.
We talked the other day?
Sorry.
Neil.
God, come back.
I'm fucking with you.
-Um.
-It's cool.
I write slash, too.
Yeah, I know.
I read your stuff.
All of it.
Your fan fic is amazing.
I see you got my code.
I do like what you did with the forest guard in "midnight come lately."
They're really under utilized in canon.
Yeah, they're conceptually awesome, but I feel like nobody gets it.
It's like they're begging us to fix 'em.
You're doing what they wished they could do if they didn't have to answer to the publisher.
Yeah, exactly.
Mainstream success is for chumps.
You know, like, the wood spirit, and pagan gods and ritual magic?
It's really...
Sexual?
Yeah.
It's so rich.
Organized religion just totally nut clipped everything that was great about traditional fertility rituals.
I mean, that's the only part about fame that I even give a shit about.
It's just a jumping off point.
It's funny that they think it's kid's stuff, but, like, there's all this subtext.
I know.
I bet we're the only two kids in this entire joint that know about what we know about.
It's kind of special.
You wanna ditch?
School?
No, I mean, you wanna dig a ditch?
-Let's go.
-Oh, i-
- I can't
I have a test in social studies next period.
It's on the incas.
Well, it's not like a midterm or anything, so um yeah.
I let martine take my car to work, so we have to walk.
But it's just the mall.
Martine's crazy.
I mean, she's pretty much best friend, she's just sort of a bitch.
Is that-- is that the pregnant girl?
"At frontier's rim?"
I hate these things.
They never get the book right.
Well, I guess I'm lucky that fain hasn't made the leap to the big screen yet.
Just it pisses me off that whenever I see vanguard in my head
-that guy...
-Well, he's not your character.
I mean, that's why it's called fan fic.
-Yeah, but.
-You seen it yet?
Like five times.
God damn it.
She's not getting off work until like 6.
Okay, I don't have anything better to do.
Will it be-- smell like...
Will my parents be able to tell?
You don't have to.
It's cool.
No, I mean, i want to, but...
Thank you.
Uh!
Shut your door.
-Put your seat down.
-Why?
What, are you ashamed to be seen with me?
I don't know.
I just-
- I don't want to get into it.
There's too much backstory.
Mike holloway drove his truck through my mom's marigolds when I was ten.
Then he gave her the finger.
I am so stoned.
Heads up, knob-goblin!
Uh!
Hey, wake up!
Let's go.
Move.
Move to the back.
Move it!
-Go to the back.
-Okay.
Ow!
I'm pregnant, bitch!
You know, your arm's not pregnant, moron.
Jesus, I thought that was Mike.
You're really tearing through them these days.
Are you kidding me?
Hi.
I just don't get what you guys are doing for an hour and a half in the parking lot.
Were you like blowing each other?
We were talking about writing.
Whoa!
Wait, you write that shit, too?
I should have known.
Who do you have fucking?
Harry Potter?
Thomas the train engine?
I just gotta know whose fictional dick is going in whose made-up mouth.
You can't even read.
Yeah, I can read.
I read all the time.
I read actual books for adults.
-Not baby books.
-Okay, name one.
"Wuthering heights," ass blood.
-The bronte sisters wrote fan fic.
-What?
The bronte sisters.
Emily bronte, of "wuthering heights," wrote erotic fan fiction.
They're like pioneers.
Wow.
It's really good Mike isn't here to find out that you're still such a fucking geeeeeek!
Dude, you know weed stays in your system for like two weeks.
On your clothes, on your jacket.
Leave him alone.
Hey, tomorrow, 2:00.
Let's meet in the courtyard.
We can drive around.
Bye.
Belzac and deron zaxa had been fighting for hours.
Sweat tinged the air of the war chamber.
That was the first thing vanguard noticed as he entered.
The bulge in his leather pants jumped to attention-- erect member out of-- suddenly, belzac reentered-- his mouth, usually only engaged in ordering soldiers to their deaths, now found its true purpose.
We will not stand for this.
If the trade union continues to block us at every turn...
Block you?
Block you.
Your armada destroyed the last- twelve.
-Twelve shipments of illinium
-sent to parak menom.
-Only 12?
Now 13.
It's an embargo.
A legal embargo.
Odd definition of the word legal.
-Actually-- -oh, so that's why you brought your...
Muscle?
You have nothing to fear from us, deron zaxa.
You or your muscle.
I will not be mocked aboard my own ship.
Hired ship.
It's his freighter.
What do I pay you for?
Move!
Whatever he pays you, we'll double it.
Allow us to show you what we'll pay you for.
I don't have all day.
Yes, sir, very busy.
You have a lunch at... 1300.
Christ!
God!
Zaxa's hand reached down-- down to his zipper.
The ambient humidity in the room reached a level that set off the climate klaxon.
But zaxa couldn't...
Or wouldn't... stop.
Hey, Neil.
God I sucked today.
You were really good.
That accent is, it's out of control.
I think it's funny when you do it like that.
It's supposed to be a comedy, right?
Yeah, I suppose you're right.
See, that's why i like you, man.
You always make me feel better.
So you get like touched inappropriately by the doctor?
No, he just puts goo all over your belly.
-It's not a big deal.
-Yeah.
You have no clue how big a speculum is.
It's like three adult dicks glued together.
Sounds like me though.
Hey, snoop dog!
Come here!
-Well, who's this?
-Julia's new boyfriend.
-Jealous?
-For real?
What's up, bro?
I'm Mike.
Ow.
I'm Neil.
-Well, I guess i owe you one, Neil.
-You do?
Yeah, for taking little miss elf quest off my hands.
She has been up my hole like 24-7.
Hey, fetus.
So long, kiddies, let's ride around.
Better not leak on my seats, martine.
I don't leak.
It all stays in me.
For like another two months.
Gross.
Hey, I wanna tell you about something.
There's a con in Houston coming up.
Like a comic con?
Yes, like a comic con.
A big one.
The rabbit's hole is hosting a private mixer.
-It's invite only.
-Oh, yeah.
-I think I heard of that.
-Well, I got invited.
Really?
Cool.
Yeah, there's a live read, too.
I mean, that's only for rock stars, so, I don't wanna be presumptuous or whatever, but I think they might ask me.
You can still get invited.
You just need to upload your damn work.
Yeah, but... don't you have to be 18?
You're joking, right?
I don't even know if my stuff is...
-I don't know!
-Come on, it's good.
You barely even read any.
Well, it's gotta be good.
I mean, you're so repressed.
That shit has gotta come out somehow.
Drop us off at Neil's house!
Oh, man, I thought you were joking.
Exactly how i imagined it.
I guess it's pretty drab.
My mom's been kind of away.
Moment of truth.
Crack her open.
Julia, I didn't really mean for these to be seen by anybody.
Yes, you did.
Otherwise you wouldn't have written them.
I can't watch.
-I thought you couldn't watch.
-Sorry.
Oh, my god.
Do these girls actually wear space bikinis?
It's ceremonial.
They were given-- it's not my idea.
Well, I just like that there's actual girls in here.
Wow, you are one twisted fuck.
I love it.
-Ooh, prepare to be analized!
-It's not a toy.
It's not a toy.
That's so weird.
-It looks like a toy.
-You're gonna break it.
-That's crazy.
-Whoa!
Say your space prayers, sucka.
Am I interrupting?
Don't you knock?
Um, dad is working late.
There's food in the fridge.
Where are you going?
Oh, my band has a show.
What's your band?
Dance or die.
It sounds awesome.
Yeah, well, it's pretty stupid.
I bet you're really good.
-Just get out!
-All right.
I'm off.
I have to pick up Tim.
It smells like sweat in here.
What was that?
I'm bisexual, just so you know.
Eww, she's not even gay.
All women are bisexual.
All of them.
My first blog, clitora majora, is all about it.
-So, you ready?
-No.
For what?
It's time to upload.
I don't think I'm ready.
Dude, they only send invites to writers who post.
And besides, writers, real writers, let people read their shit.
And your shit is good.
I mean, it's not as good as mine, but traditionally boys don't write very good erotica.
-So, by those standards-- -okay, fine.
Just, stop talking.
Really?
Oh, my god.
What are you like the one person on the entire Internet that doesn't lie about their age?
-Are you a mennonite?
-No.
I just, I don't want to misrepresent myself.
Okay.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that this is not about misrepresenting yourself.
You don't want to do this because once you do, you're one of us.
It's the final line.
The last taboo.
Well, there's no turning back, Van fan.
It's in god's hands now.
What?
Can we just turn comments off?
No, dude, it's part of the public record now.
You're killing me.
Let's talk about something else.
Literally anything else.
I like the way you eat.
Neil, when we were horsing around, did you get a boner?
-Like a little bit of a boner?
-No!
Okay.
It's cool if you did.
I thought that you were-- what?
Nothing.
It's cool if you popped a chub.
God, shut up.
-Yo.
-Where's martine?
I don't know.
At the abortion clinic with her mom.
Wanna grab some food?
We can go to footlongers and get some subs.
Watch "celebrity apprentice" at my place.
And by your place you mean your mom's basement?
Yeah, whatever.
I got weed.
You wanna come?
Whoa!
What the fuck do you think I look like?
A fucking full service food court?
No, that's okay.
I've got math homework.
See, he's got math homework.
He's got a future.
Fuck you.
Neil, really great work today.
I have you nymph.
The hot breath is his voice in her elongated, elfin ear.
The ear that to nymph kind, seconded as a highly erogenous zone.
Fain was lost unto herself.
His name now known to her.
Michael.
Sir Michael.
My sweet Michael.
All right, so nicklepenny comes through the door minus his pants.
Hollycotton is surprised and crosses to l-6.
Mr. nicklepenny!
-I thought you were-- -across the hall?
This mansion is still quite a mystery to me.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
That's too much.
Reverse.
No, no, that's not right either.
Look, I have a test in 30 minutes, and I'm not going to fail because of your slow ass.
And how long did we wait for you to get off-book?
Fuck you!
I have dyslexia.
Miss Lewis, this is a tech rehearsal and I can't put up with her anymore.
I take dyslexia medication.
Jessie, take a break.
Neil, hey.
Neil!
Huh?
Could you be so kind as to relieve miss hunt for a moment?
I can't put up with her-- can you imagine having to deal with her parents?
So, Jessie tells me you're a writer.
You really freaked her out.
-Oh, I didn't mean to.
-Dude, that needed to happen.
This place could use some subversion.
Yeah, um, in ap English, we got to read Oscar wilde- so you gonna let me read it?
-Oh.
Okay, let's take it from the double entendre.
It seems that Horace has mistakenly taken my clothes.
Thankfully not all of them.
Yes, thankfully.
Oh-- it's cotton.
Cotton's a very versatile fabric, don't you think?
Extremely pliable to a man's touch.
What appears course, now in my hands is so very, very soft.
Oh, my god.
Oh, listen to this, "deron zaxa, ever the orator, put his mouth to quite a different purpose now."
Dude, this deron zaxa guy is you straight up.
-Neil.
-You do know he's straight, right?
Thanks.
You're gonna have to drive my car.
Are you crying?
No.
I'm pretty sure you're crying.
Never drink vodka from a plastic jug with a handle.
Okay.
Mike holloway is pure dick cheese.
Neil, I have something important to tell you.
Something I've been thinking about for a while.
I think you use too much flowery prose.
What?
You say things like, "he stroked his velvet rod,"
when you should be like, "he pumped his stone cock."
Readers respond better to direct language.
Thanks.
I can impart the wisdom of our one year age difference, you know?
Um, your mom has a lot of religious stuff.
Yeah, I think that's why my dad killed himself.
He was gay, you know.
My dad, he kept it to himself.
I guess he preferred death to coming out.
Man, do you really think being gay killed him?
I don't wanna be here when my mom gets home.
What?
Mom's home.
Stay here.
I-
- I had to print something for work.
You know we've always supported your interests.
And the Internet is, wow, an incredible tool.
-We don't have to do this.
-I think what we're trying to say is just 'cause information is out there, doesn't mean it's accurate.
We just don't want you getting particular information, you know,
-from the wrong sources.
-I'm 15.
Hey, you can read whatever you want.
We're fine with that.
As long as you're reading.
Uh-huh, as long as it's not "mein kampf."
But actually, well, "mein kampf" is actually a pretty interesting read.
Honey, I don't want you to feel awkward about this.
If you want to read intelligent prose on human sexuality
I can make you a reading list.
Eww!
No!
What do you mean intelligent?
Well, it's just whoever wrote that story on your computer, they obviously don't have the first clue about actual human relationships.
It's demented.
I don't think your mother's talking about
-the homosexual content, not particularly.
-Please stop.
It's just more of a basic plotting problem.
You're absorbing material that has some rudimentary grammatical errors in it.
You've got sentence fragments, you've got dangling participles.
I actually have been helping Neil with his writing.
-Huh.
-He's got a lot of innate talent.
He just uses too much flowery prose.
There's no flowery prose!
Neil tells me you two are considering a split?
- What?
-I'm sorry.
I just thought I could provide some insight, since my parents are divorced.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Open and honest dialog is key to maintaining a stable relationship.
-Is it now?
-Totally.
I write about it all the time.
That and be honest about one's own sexual desires.
-It's rare that anyone ever is.
-Huh.
I edit a lit journal on women's studies.
I plan to pursue that in college.
-Women's studies?
-Yeah, female sexuality in literature, specifically.
Reverse gender roles in pop culture, sexual submissive hierarchy, rape paradigms.
I actually wrote a 22 page thesis on the concept of venereal disease as a female guilt trigger.
It's no big deal.
I did a paper on monotremes, remember?
Are monotremes a form of VD?
Don't be embarrassed, Neil.
It's natural.
Yeah, Neil, don't be embarrassed.
It's natural.
-Do you ever read any online-- -dad!
-I actually write online -poetry.
Online poetry.
Lady poetry.
-About strong women.
-Lady poetry?
You really need to bring friend around more often.
Did Neil tell you guys about the convention?
- The comic con?
-It's also for writers.
Neil, you didn't mention that.
It's for regular writers!
- Is that true?
-Define regular.
I think she means non-erotic.
Are you guys crazy?
What makes you think
I would go to an erotic writing convention?
I don't know!
Why would you have it on your computer?
I mean, do they have that-- what was the name?
-Uh-- vang-- -vanguard erotica.
-Please stop saying "erotica" at the dinner table.
-No, please don't.
I just need to know if you're going to a place for adults.
Yeah, mom has a strict no sex dungeon policy.
I'm not.
We're not!
You don't have to lie to me, you know.
Your mom is not as square as you think.
I even went to a key party once.
When did you go to a key party?
I'm not lying.
Good.
Good.
So speaking of writing, how much do you guys know about the bronte sisters?
I'm sorry about that.
You know what, no, Neil, you have to get past this repression.
Yeah, well, why don't I come by and give a lecture on the sexual fantasies of Emily bronte to your mom.
Your parents are cool.
You're lucky.
Our situations are so different.
-You told me that your dad killed himself.
-He did.
"Oh, hey, Neil's parents, why don't you let me give you some insight because my parents are divorced."
-You don't get it.
-Yeah, I don't.
What?
Well, I'm picking you up tomorrow at 9 am, so be ready.
-Some dinner, huh?
-Sorry.
Hey, I like her.
She's a character.
Well, lemme guess.
I can't go now?
Dad.
I'm good.
Take it.
Take it.
Do you remember when I used to take you to those autograph conventions?
Yeah.
Remember when you stood in line for two hours to try to get butch Patrick to sign your munsters lunch box?
And then he wouldn't.
Butch Patrick was a dick.
All right, as far as your mom knows, you're staying at your cousin's, all right?
And I'm counting on you to do the right thing.
At least not to do, not to do the wrong thing.
She's more mature than you.
Huh?
In some ways?
I mean, maybe mature is not the right word.
Dad.
You really like this girl, don't you?
I liked the same type.
When I was your age I did.
But be careful, huh?
These arty girls--
I don't wanna see you get hurt, okay?
All right, good talk, right?
All right, I'll see you later.
Hola!
Neil, your friends are multiplying.
Is that a pregnant joke?
This shit is getting super old.
We're not letting her do this again.
You can say whatever you want about me, but I'm not a fucking flake.
-What happened?
-Mike happened.
Fucking douchebag.
It's a good thing i went by there.
-She's not gonna go?
-Oh, she's going.
I mean, look at you.
Look at what you do to yourself for her, dumb ass.
That's fine.
I feel kind of responsible for you.
I mean, you're just like her when we first met.
I liked her 'cause she was all smart and funny, and she tried so hard to be my friend.
And she would, like, offer to do my homework and shit.
And I would just make fun of her costumes and stuff.
You know she used to dress like an elf, right?
I don't know.
I didn't think I tried to change her.
I mean I took her out with Mike, and that was it.
I guess he was like the first normal guy to ever take interest in her.
He's normal?
Don't change for her, dude.
Don't let her be your Mike.
-Please be quiet, okay?
My mom's sleeping.
-She here?
-Yes.
-Then what the fuck, dude,
-what is she doing here?
-I don't-- she told Neil she would take him to comic con.
Holy shit.
That's amazing.
Dude.
Oh, ho, dude, please get out.
I need a better look at this.
This coming from a guy in his pajamas.
I'm listen-
- I'm not busting your balls.
I promise you.
Just come on.
- I need a fucking picture.
-
-You're such a dick.
I'm not the one making a scene, okay, martine?
You're the one making a scene right now.
Come on, get up.
Give me a little, give me a little twirly twirl.
Oh, man, I'm not nearly stoned enough for this right now.
Oh!
What the fuck!
Jesus!
-I only wanted a picture, freak.
-You are the freak.
You and your stupid fucking mustache.
Ow.
Yo, bro.
You ever see those um-- you ever see those pictures
I took of her wearing that elf shit?
Well, sometimes all she wore were those little ears.
Yeah, those were my special pics.
Neil!
Get the fuck off!
Oh, Galadriel.
Babe, I knew you were a nerd.
I didn't know you were a fucking retard.
Whoa!
Oh, shit!
Oh!
This is funny.
You're fucking crazy.
You can't be all stoic in that costume.
It looks ridiculous.
Don't worry about me.
I am worried about driving for three hours with a guilt-bot programmed to guilt me to death.
How can you hang out with that guy?
He's like everything you pretend to hate.
What do you mean "pretend?"
Nothing.
Just forget it.
You are acting like a really jealous boyfriend right now.
Well, I'm not your boyfriend.
Yeah, you're not.
Hey, I'm sorry.
Okay, I know-- i know that Mike brings out the worst in me.
You have to admit, it was, like, really cool when you knocked him down.
Fucker.
I have to tell you something.
About the live read.
I know already.
I saw.
It was posted on the forum.
Congrats.
I told you it was good.
-Did they write you?
-Mm-hmm, yeah.
They said something about the number of slots.
Politics again.
Politics.
I'm really glad that you transcended all of that.
Yeah.
Welcome to comic con.
What name is your reservation under?
How do you know we're here for comic con?
Emily bronte.
All right, miss bronte,
I have you down for a single king?
Oh, can we get two beds?
Unfortunately, we're at capacity.
That's okay.
We'll sleep together.
Swanky.
It's big.
Come here.
Try this out!
I don't wanna mess up my costume.
Did you talk to them yet?
No, do I need to?
You're reading tomorrow.
If it were me, I would be checking up on like the order of the lineup and how much time I have, and how I'm gonna be taped and shit.
Taped?
Why would they tape it?
I don't want to be on tape.
That's normal, okay?
You need to relax.
You're so fucking nuts.
Jesus.
What's with you?
You look like how I look when I'm trying to avoid someone.
Okay, so we have the opening night party tonight.
And then tomorrow we have writer evals 'til five, then the slash mixer, and then the live read.
Hello!
Person talking to you I.R.L.
Sorry.
Um-- i have to go to the bathroom.
You're just going to gawk at your phone somewhere where I can't give you shit about it.
-Fine, I'll leave it.
-No, don't do it for me, dude.
I'm just trying to bust you out of your self-induced social media prison.
You've really opened my eyes.
Throw off the shackles!
Throw 'em off!
Wizards man.
Wand-on-wand action.
That's what the readers want.
It's casting a spell on my wand,
-I'll tell you that.
-Yeah.
But that Harry-Draco genre, that's getting old.
Now what I'm into is that Snape-Dumbledore fic.
Wow, that is literally old.
I didn't realize you were into octogenarians?
Yeah, well, uh, vanguard is no spring chicken.
Easy.
Well, usually.
Hey.
Oh, did you read that story I sent you,
"panty raid at Slytherin"?
Oh, yeah, dude.
I called my mom.
I read it out loud.
Finally.
Come on.
We got business to conduct.
I think I'd rather go look at comics.
Neil, this is toho.
What are you drinking?
I dunno.
Toho?
Uh, hmmm... is blue.
It's blue.
Works for me.
That is a sick vanguard costume you've got there, bro.
Is that from "kragon's war?"
Anyways, so-- my name is hagoff Paul and this is a little greeting.
Is that?
Is that LSD?
For the party tonight, playboy.
It's Molly.
Mdma?
-No, no.
-It looks like acid.
It's ecstasy.
Have you ever done that before?
No, but I want to.
That stuff stays in your system forever.
Have you ever heard of an acid flashback?
Look, I don't want to wake up in a year and stab my parents to death with a kitchen knife, okay?
Well, that makes one of us.
What if it ruins the whole weekend?
What if we miss the live reading because we're in the hospital getting our stomach's pumped?
We are going to a party with all sorts of lights and costumes, okay?
-Do you normally go to parties, Neil?
-No.
-Do you like to mingle?
-No.
-Open your mouth, playboy.
-No...
Julia.
There we go.
Oh, whatever you do, don't swallow.
What will happen if I swallow it?
I'm hallucinating!
It's not acid!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold her there.
Off, off, off, off.
-I'm sick.
-Okay.
I'm so stoned.
Stoned on acid.
I mean, Molly--
this must be like every day for Madonna.
Here.
Drink some water.
Oh, okay.
Oh.
You're safe now.
You're in a totally safe place.
What?
I don't know if I've uh...
Ever been attracted to anyone before you.
You mean any girl.
Any human being.
What are you attracted to about me?
I'm not ashamed of myself with you.
Should I have done that?
I don't know if I should have done that.
Pants.
-Are you doing your homework?
-No.
"Julia tugged at his pants, sliding them down ever so slowly."
Okay, if you're gonna write about us, you need to use some modifiers.
"Julia tugged at his tight pants, sliding them off painfully slow.
Savoring the moment the heightened pleasure involved."
I'm glad you decided to branch out.
You're a tough one to figure out.
No, I'm not.
Hi, you've reached Julia's voicemail.
I probably don't want to talk to you.
Hi, you've reached Julia's voicemail.
I probably--
the alliteration is good, but you use it way too much.
Yeah, it's sort of my crutch.
And the allegory is a bit on-the-nose.
Oh, I actually thought it was more of a metaphor than an allegory.
Uh, do you know what an allegory is?
Look, you're okay.
Uh, and you're female.
We need more women in our field.
Most of them are pretty ugly.
Unlike you.
You can have a career.
Writing is more than just writing.
There are other factors.
Dude, I want to show you something.
It's a-- it's a Tijuana Bible.
It's quite the important artifact.
Mexicans are far more sexually liberated.
What's with the look?
You just left this morning.
Yeah, I was getting a critique.
I mean, that's why we're here.
To meet the pros.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
I have to go meet someone.
Who?
Denis?
Sorry, I looked through your phone.
I didn't think that you would care.
Hey-- don't!
Don't do that.
-What's your deal?
-Nothing.
Don't get all weird on me just because we messed around.
Why did you rip up our pages?
I don't know.
We were zonked.
We wrote some crazy shit, okay?
I didn't want it just floating around.
So last night was just the drugs?
You have been hiding this denis guy from me.
I didn't even think that you were straight.
Can you hear me now?
How about now?
I'll check my bars.
That's better.
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is age restricted.
Hi.
Oh, my god, Neil.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I uh-
- I didn't expect you to look uh, so young.
-Uh, do you wanna see my ID?
-No, no, no, no.
No, I'm sorry, believe me, i looked young when I was your age, too.
Uh, when I was 18.
-You still look young.
-Oh, well, thank you.
Oh, my god, it's just so great to uh, finally meet you, in the flesh, so to speak, um...
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-Oh, yes, of course.
Shall we?
-Yeah.
You're staring.
Virgins stare.
-They do?
-Yeah, well, con virgins.
Yeah, it's just so weird now that it's all in 3-d.
Yeah, I know.
Internet rule 34.
If it exists there's porn of it.
Just when you think you've seen it all.
I just discovered what a curtain fic is.
-Curtain fic?
-Mm-hmm.
I mean, okay, so, this is aimed at older gays.
Of course they're like post-sex, proto-nesting, domestic fetishists.
And so normally where you'd have like kirk and Spock, you know, making love, uh, in this case, it's couples having these like lavish shopping sprees at pottery barn.
For curtains.
They sell curtains at pottery barn?
They sell everything at pottery barn.
I mean, you know, it's mostly harmless I guess, but not all of it is...
And you really need to watch out for creeps, especially at your age.
-But you're not a creep.
-No, I'm not a creep, but isn't that exactly what a creep would say?
Oh, I thought you came alone.
Oh, Jesus, speaking of creepy.
I came with a friend.
Oh, and does he write slash?
She.
And yeah.
You know, actually, i think she's in regular writing today.
Oh, regular writing.
-Denis.
-Oh, Ronnie, hey, um, this is Neil.
-He's one of our new writers.
-Oh, yeah, I bet.
Ronnie harwood.
I'm senior writer at the rabbit's hole.
So some of the inner circle are gonna go out for an early dinner before the reading.
-Are you game?
-Yeah.
You can bring your new little friend.
Everybody agrees that Batman blowing Robin and Robin blowing Batman is totally played out, but now I'm seeing Christian bale's Batman blowing Ben affleck as Batman.
Blowing val kilmer.
Oh, that's really hot.
I got a cease and desist from Warner's last week, so obviously I'm doing something right.
Yeah, you're moving up in the world.
What kind of slash do you write?
You've been to our website, it's easy enough to find.
Right.
I'm guessing this is your first con, since you're what, he's 18?
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, 18.
Hmm.
I was editing the r.P.F. Board today.
I'll never get all the bieber fic.
Neil, are you into Justin bieber?
What's r.P.F.?
R.P.F. Is real people fiction or celebrity slash.
Slash about, you know, celebs.
Oh, oh, like the bronte sisters.
They wrote stories about Napoleon and the Duke of Wellington.
Yeah, I mean, it's pretty old school, but now it's mostly just like pointless boy band orgies.
Yeah, and juvenile regressives are popping up all over.
Speaking of...
How long have you slashed vanguard?
Oh, vanguard is juvenile, but trek and tolkien, that's-- it's all about audience and intent, denis.
This is first year stuff.
Vanguard doesn't play to the 40-plus crowd, our base.
Besides, it's not our mission to indoctrinate children.
It's not our mission to indoctrinate anyone.
I read tolkien when I was eight.
Yes, and denis loves his vanguard.
Ronnie prefers her masturbation material to stem from bad '60s television.
You ever see "the Brady bunch," dude?
Really, Freddie?
He's a child.
Mainstream success has no bearing on our field.
Never has.
What we do know is juvenile fiction begets juvenile erotica.
Let me be frank.
You write sex like a 12-year-old and I think you know it.
It's like you found all these provocative words and just tossed them into a text editor.
Have you ever even had sex?
I doubt half our writers have had sex.
-Let me see your ID.
-Ronnie.
Well, I don't know about you, denis, but I don't want to go to jail.
Nobody's going to jail.
Jesus!
Neil, come on.
It's fine.
Sit down.
Yeah, it's fine if he ponies up an ID.
I remember now.
You wrote all that really gross Mike and Greg Brady fic.
What's your point?
I thought you liked sex with 12-year-olds.
If it's written maturely.
Nice.
Are you really 18?
Neil, Neil, come on, stop.
Stop, stop, stop.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Look, Ronnie, I mean, you know, she's like that with everybody.
It's not you.
Oh, um.
Let's go someplace else.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait.
It just-- this doesn't feel right.
Why?
Look, I'm not gonna be mad, I'm not be upset or anything.
I need you to tell me how old you are.
-I already told you.
-I know, I know.
Tell me again.
-15.
-15?
Oh, fuck!
I'll be 16 in November.
-Please don't reject me.
-Dude, this is wrong.
I know it is.
This is just the second time today.
-I could go to jail.
-I won't tell anyone.
Did you just tell me you were 18 so you could get into the live reading?
-No!
-What do you even want from me?
I just thought it'd be different.
Here with you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You actually remind me a lot of myself.
-You turned out okay.
-Did I?
I shot off a series of insane messages to somebody I didn't know the first thing about.
I said things I would never say to somebody face to face.
Ever.
You know, outside of like cons,
I have practically zero social skills.
My mother always said it's going to get me in trouble, and now here I am.
And yes, incidentally, i live with my mother, in the house where I grew up, in saginaw.
So, you know, don't be too sure about things.
You live with your mom?
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
You said this was the second time.
It it someone in our group?
Was it that girl you came here with?
Yeah, well.
I thought you might be straight.
-I might not be.
-Well, this isn't the way to find out.
You have time.
You're writing.
Focus on that.
How can I focus on something
I'm not even old enough to do?
Well, what do you want to do?
You want to be a writer?
A real writer, not fan fic?
You're good.
Keep writing and let the rest of the stuff sort itself out naturally.
I wish somebody had told me that when I was your age.
Well, you better go.
It's about time.
I don't know what the right thing to do here is.
I wanna make sure you're okay.
Well, I know you have to go.
I am the moderator.
I mean, you don't have to worry, I'm not coming.
I can't, not now.
Not right now.
I wish it wasn't this way.
You know, for what it's worth,
I think you want to be queer.
Why would anyone want that?
To fit in, even some place small.
I'll see you around.
You came back?
The live read's about to start.
You should be there.
I came back for you.
You don't get it.
You submitted once and they're like,
"hey, come read it on stage."
I have like 500 things posted up there.
I know.
I've read every one of them.
It's hard caring about someone.
Letting them care about you.
It doesn't have to be hard.
I love you.
I kissed him.
That denis guy?
I'm not going to the live read.
-You have to.
-I can't.
Neil, please, for both of us.
Fuck those crusty old assholes.
I followed you into the restaurant when you weren't answering my calls.
I'm sorry that lady is such an asshole.
Look, they only win if you let them.
You are a featured fucking story, dude.
You made it!
We're doing this.
You and me together.
I am your goddamn coach.
Okay?
As they entered the nexiverse,
Gandalf, his penis now longer than his staff, tuned-- turned to Dumbledore,
"Dumbledore," he said to Dumbledore,
"only the energy of our mutual orgasm, combined with unbroken eye contact can close the door to the nexiverse, thus stopping the combined armies of Sauron and Voldemort.
Without a moment's thought, Dumbledore selflessly gave of his own manhood, placing the head of his pounding penis against that of the wise old wizard from alt middle earth, like in ghostbusters.
- End of chapter seven.
Okay, that was gan-dum 69 with "hole pluggers of the nexiverse."
And who doesn't like some good old-fashioned wizard-on-wizard action?
One more time for her, gan-dum 69.
Um...
So-uh, I think everybody knows my feelings about what we do and the purpose it serves.
Often we're treated like freaks.
Especially those of us who are a little bit older.
- And uh, still doing this.
Um... and when we're away from this little community that we've created for ourselves, you know, we're outsiders, and we're weirdoes, and we're sexual deviants, but not here.
Our next reader is a young man that I have been following with much interest.
And not just because he writes vanguard.
Please welcome to the stage, Van fan 42.
Um, this is called...
"Shore leave on dreenan four."
"The balmy tropic weather patterns of dreenan four gave cause for the indigenous proxans to wear very little in the way of attire.
This year with the elliptical orbit pulling them closer than ever to dreenan prime, clothing was more a hardship than an option.
Vanguard found himself unarmored on the beaches of the zaraug during what seemed to be a religious mating ritual.
'Do you happen to know where they keep the towels?
' a lean, naked proxon inquired.
His supple manhood stood proud against the harsh light of dreenan prime.
The proxon boy repeated himself, 'well, do you?
' vanguard's hand now pumped his stone cock."
He's 15.
You're outsiders.
You were supposed to support other outsiders.
I mean, you guys write ninja turtle bondage porn and you're judging?
He just poured out his sad, pathetic heart to you philistines!
And I think it's beautiful.
Let him read.
No.
I may be 15, but you're an asshole.
I'll be 16 in a few months.
All right, everybody, that is my fault.
I'm the one who broke the rules.
Don't blame him.
So you're not-- mad at me anymore, right?
I'd only be mad if you stopped writing because of this.
Me?
No.
I've got my body armor on.
Hey, I love you, too.
Well, duh.
I gotta tell you something.
I think I may be a lesbian.
The way I figure it...
If I'm lesbian and you're gay, then we can be a gay couple, and it sort of cancels each other out.
Cause I'm more mannish and you're like a girl.
Wait, what...
I'm like a girl?
I'm sorry, Neil.
I'm sorry I said you were gay.
I don't know why I said that.
I don't care what you are.
That's the only thing that I don't care about.
I told them you were 16.
What?
I'm the reason you didn't get into the live read.
It was my fault.
It was down to you and me, and I told them that I was 18, and you were 16.
That editor, Ronnie, loves your writing.
It's not about that.
It never was, so you have to keep writing.
I thought you didn't care about the reading.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
I really do love you.
It's not so crazy they believed you were 18.
You do look older now.
Jesus!
Mom knows you stayed with her.
What?
-Mom's around?
-Mm-hmm.
-How bad is it?
-It's bad.
Dad took a bullet for you.
That girl's mom called.
Did you guys steal her credit card?
I hope you lost your cherry, nelly bopper.
'Cause from the sound of it, you might not be seeing much of her for a while.
Let me see that.
What, do you think I'm too dumb?
Don't worry, man, she'll come around.
Seasons end, even on milliarcha v, where nuclear winter was slowly giving way to bright spring.
Vanguard felt it.
And he knew his own season was now at a close.
Be it burial in the cold vacuum of space, or a quaint domestic cabin on the frontier's rim, everyone retires.
Things, people...
Come into your life suddenly, and then are just as suddenly gone.
But their season shapes you.
Makes you dare things you hadn't previously even dreamt.
And for that, and for my friend, this author is happy.
Previously on "Notorious"...
She's dead.
I have orders to arrest your client for the murder of Sarah Keaton.
That's Levi Young.
Why would he send me photos incriminating his best friend?
You sent me those photos for a reason.
I sent you three photos.
The third one was Sarah in bed with your friend Jake Gregorian.
If you run a story about me,
I'll take a copy of that photo to one of your competitors.
You're hacking into his home computer?
You're committing a crime.
How else am I supposed to help my boss?
That's SweetVicki.
You found her?
You've been texting with Levi Young.
He was pretending to be SweetVicki.
Tomorrow, LHL, an exclusive.
With who?
Oscar Keaton, the prison interview.
Look straight into the camera.
The viewers need to see
- you have nothing to hide.
- Understood.
And, remember, this interview is about Levi.
Louise will try and bait you into talking about Sarah and the murder.
Steer her away.
20 seconds.
If you start to sweat, look at that monitor, and dab your forehead when no one's watching.
Thank you.
10 seconds out.
Louise, let's start with questions about Levi and then pivot to the murder.
I want to get Oscar on the record about Sarah.
Copy that.
And in 3, 2...
Good evening.
We have an exclusive interview with Internet mogul Oscar Keaton, who is awaiting trial for the murder of his wife.
For several months prior to his arrest,
Keaton was having a cyber-affair with a person he only knew as "SweetVicki."
But in a shocking twist, he's learned that SweetVicki was none other than his own business partner, Levi Young.
We go live now to the L.A. County Jail for Mr. Keaton's reaction.
Welcome, Mr. Keaton.
You and Levi Young have been best friends since you were 8 years old, and the two of you started your company in the basement of his mother's house.
That's right, Louise.
So tell me, why on earth would he do this to you?
It's clear the man's trying to destroy me.
I've never trusted anyone so much in my entire life, and he betrayed me.
Levi is a genius when it comes to writing code, but I was the face of the company, and I...
I think he resented that.
Ask about the affair.
Cue the photo.
A few days ago, LHL received a photo of you with another woman.
Do you have a comment?
It happened once.
The important thing is that Sarah forgave me.
Was this one time before or after you beat her?
Cue photo 2.
From these photos, it look like you cheated on your wife, and when she confronted you, you got violent.
I'm deeply ashamed.
I've made my share of mistakes in my life.
Trusting Levi was one of them.
First, we were just sending pictures back and forth.
But then, I started sharing things with her....him, things I should've kept private.
I can only assume Levi planned on using that information against me with the Board of Directors.
Now that I'm in jail, Levi has a lot to gain.
Hold on.
Are you suggesting
Levi killed Sarah and framed you?
I just know that I didn't kill my wife.
Now I'm asking the L.A.P.D. to keep looking...
Hey, something just came in on the scanner.
A jogger found a body by the Sepulveda Dam.
It's the missing football player Jason Moore.
I'm confident they'll find the answers
- they're looking for.
- Wrap.
Tease Jason Moore.
Toss to a break.
Mr. Keaton, thank you for being on our show tonight.
Thank you, Louise.
We'll take a break, and when we return, a development in the case of Jason Moore, missing since Friday.
How many times are they gonna run those damn photos?
They're out there, and now, you've addressed them.
You stayed on point, you made it about Levi.
You did well.
I trusted that man with my life.
And we're back in 3, 2...
Welcome back.
We have an update on the case of Jason Moore, the 19-year-old California University football player.
Sadly, his body was discovered near the Sepulveda Dam in the San Fernando Valley.
Our sources are telling us that he'd been severely beaten.
Jason grew up in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Van Nuys and received a full football scholarship to nearby California University.
Unfortunately, he would only play for the Falcons as a freshman.
He died at 19.
Under the leadership of Coach Phil Ryder, the CU Falcons have won three consecutive post-season bowl games, including last season's... but ultimately decided on California University... so he could stay close to his mother.
The police are treating Jason's death as a homicide, although it will be days before a coroner will officially rule on cause of death.
I can't believe he's really dead.
His poor mom.
...late Friday night, and never returned to his dorm.
His roommate called his mother the next day...
- Oh, God!
- What?
I...
I need to get out of here.
This is bad.
What's going on?
Chloe, they're saying your brother killed Jason.
What?
!
That's crazy!
Who's saying that?
Like, everyone.
Dax, talk to me, please.
The kids on that stupid app don't know that you and Jason were friends.
There's no way the police will take them seriously.
I'm just going for a drive, okay?
I need to clear my head.
I'll go with you.
No!
I want to be alone.
We'll be right back with further details on this devastating turn of events.
I'm sorry, but Jake isn't in yet, and unless you have an appointment...
I am not leaving until I talk with him.
It's all right, Ella.
We're fine.
What do you want?
I saw Oscar's interview.
He has it all wrong.
I went to see him in jail, but they told me you took me off the visitor list.
Oscar doesn't want to see you right now.
I just need to talk to him.
I can explain myself.
He's my friend.
I think your friendship ended when you started catfishing him, Levi.
Oh, but apparently, you can sleep with his wife and still be his lawyer.
Yeah.
I took the photo.
I know the truth.
Were you hiding in the bushes, you pervert?
I was looking out for Oscar!
You know what?
Get out!
Never come back here again!
What?
Uh, I'm sorry.
Can I help you?
I'm Chloe Edwards.
This is my friend Finn.
You went to Van Nuys High School with my mom, Brenda Wilcox.
Brenda?
Yeah, of course.
Uh, she was a good friend.
What can I do for you?
You know that Cal U football player that was killed?
Mm-hmm.
Jason Moore.
Yeah.
I saw him rush for 250 yards against Monroe his senior year.
Last night, my brothe was arrested for his murder.
He didn't do it.
We need your help.
Okay.
So, I talked with my contact at L.A.P.D., and your brother was pulled over at 2:00 A.M.
They brought him in on a bench warrant, which means that Dax has been arrested before.
Last year, he was caught selling pot.
Well, apparently, he skipped a court date.
So, that's all this is about.
No.
They're using the warrant to hold him while they gather evidence on the homicide.
My brother would never hurt anyone.
Why do the cops think he would?
Because of that app, Tell Me a Secret.
It's this anonymous chat room where everyone in that room is physically located within the same square mile.
Someone in the chat room wrote that Dax was the killer.
Then everyone else piled on.
How well did Dax know Jason?
We were all best friends since were 10... me, Dax and Jason.
And then, junior year, Jason grew like a foot, starting working out.
Next thing we know, he was playing varsity football.
Me and Dax barely graduated high school, and Jason got a full ride to college.
Must have been hard getting left behind.
Are you kidding?
Football was Jason's way out.
We were happy for him.
After high school, Finn moved in with Dax and me.
Were either of you with your brother the night Jason went missing?
No.
I was working graveyard at the Blue Door Diner.
And I was home, but Dax wasn't with me.
Where's your mom now?
She lives at Gateways.
She had a breakdown about five years ago, diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic.
That's when my dad took off.
I've been Dax's legal guardian ever since.
Chloe, I'm sorry.
I had no idea.
Mom showed up at Dax's school when he was 13.
She was hysterical, running up and down the hallways, shouting his name.
Kids were cruel.
They said it was just a matter of time before he snapped like she did.
He's a good person.
He just uses the psycho image to keep people at a distance.
Well, I'll down to lockup, and we'll get started.
Okay.
Um, you should know Dax doesn't trust people.
It's okay.
Neither do I.
No, it's not okay.
It's the third time he's done this to us.
Oh, I get it.
He's a busy man, and his word is crap.
Good morning.
I got your text, your voice mail, and your e-mail.
What's up?
I just wanted to say, again, I am really sorry for springing that video on you.
I keep thinking about it, and...
Stop.
I got to vent.
You heard me out.
We're good.
Now, who just peed in your Cheerios?
The former Vice President.
He's dropping us to go golfing at Pebble Beach, and I have to come up with a whole new show.
You live for that drama.
Tell me what's really going on.
It's Eric.
Tomorrow would've been our one-year anniversary.
I keep thinking I'm over him, and then I get a whiff of his cologne on my blanket, and I...
You miss him.
I miss what I thought we had.
And he's probably off celebrating his freedom with some stripper.
It's not the worst idea.
Hey, that cute new cameraman has some attractive friends.
Trust me.
Below the line will blow your mind.
Thank you.
I'll remember that.
Any time.
Dax, my name is Jake Gregorian.
I'm your lawyer.
All right.
Do you know why you're here?
For selling pot.
Right, for selling pot.
Now, let's talk about why you're really here.
You were arrested going south on the 5.
Innocent men don't run.
You fit the profile, you're a loner, you sell drugs.
Yeah.
People think I'm a freak.
Doesn't mean I killed him.
You know, I grew up just a few blocks from you.
Went to Van Nuys High.
I did fine, academically, except for math.
I sucked at math.
I was about to fail calculus when somebody helped me.
Your mom.
She was brilliant, Dax.
She had all these little memory games...
Lo-di-hi minus hi-di-lo.
All over lo squared.
Yep.
Hard to forget, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Dax, your mom saved my ass, and now, it's my turn to save yours.
But you got to talk to me, man.
Good.
All right.
Let's start with the night Jason went missing.
Where were you?
Where I am every Friday...
Trolling campus selling weed to douchebag college kids.
All right.
Not the most sympathetic alibi, but I can work with that.
Uh, I'll be back.
In the meantime, do not talk to anyone, okay?
Hey, Jake.
I heard you were representing Dax Edwards in the Jason Moore homicide.
Homicide?
As of now, Dax is only here for skipping a court date.
Well, homicide charges are being filed.
Forensics found strands of the victim's hair in your client's car.
So what?
Dax and Jason are friends.
Jason's probably been in his car a bunch of times.
All you guys have, Ken, is a bunch of anonymous online chatter and no motive.
It's murder one, Jake.
You think we'd make an arrest without a motive?
Thank you all for being here today.
My name is Phil Ryder.
Jason's mom, Tina, has asked me to say a few words as his coach.
Did you hear they made an arrest?
Isn't that the guy who used to do those underwear commercials?
Yeah, after he won two rings with Dallas.
He had a gift.
I've never seen so much raw talent.
Who knows how far Jason could've gone...
The Heisman, the NFL?
Now we're hearing that Dax Edwards has been arrested.
Let me make one thing clear...
Dax Edwards is a low-life drug dealer.
I caught this kid trying to sell his crap to my players a couple months ago.
And, believe me, I put a end to that quick.
I'm sorry.
This is not about that piece of garbage.
This, here, today is about Jason Moore... whose short, but brilliant life we are here to mourn.
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey.
Are you watching the press conference?
Why don't they just go ahead and hang my client right there in the quad?
You're representing Dax Edwards?
Yes, I am, and I want to put his sister on your show tonight, get out our side of the story.
Find out everything you can about Dax Edwards.
- We got his sister for tonight.
- Okay.
I don't know.
I've got the Vice President tonight, but I guess I could push him for you.
Mm-hmm.
Canceled on you again?
I'll see you tonight.
Her son's passion for the game.
We're gonna move forward with the pep rally tomorrow.
In the meantime, my heart goes out to his family.
Nothing can bring Jason back, but I made a promise to his mother that
I will not rest until justice is served.
Well, your paperwork's in order.
Congratulations.
You take care of yourself, now.
That's the plan.
So, you want me to confirm that our client was selling drugs?
Well, I'd rather Dax go down for selling pot than murder.
Good point.
I'll head to the campus and see if I can find support for his alibi.
Keep me posted.
Good news.
I tracked down the kid who created
Tell Me a Secret.
- Kid?
- Mm-hmm.
He's 21, started the app as a freshman at Princeton.
Now works from his home in Beverly Hills.
Yeah, we need to get the name of the user who started the rumor about Dax.
Yeah.
Don't worry.
If the kid resists,
I'll put the fear of God in him.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
I'm looking for a good lawyer.
See, I hacked into a computer network the other night with the help of a very beautiful accomplice.
Uh, that was a felony, and I had nothing to do with that.
Why are you really here?
Louise sent me to get her favorite Chardonnay from some vineyard in Montesito.
Turns out they have it at the convenience store right around the corner.
Anyway, I was wondering if we could get together again sometime.
Are you asking me out?
I was thinking we could... hang.
I'm free tomorrow, as long as you stick to misdemeanors.
Deal.
I'll pick you up.
Where do you live?
Let's just meet here.
Okay.
And, we're not 12.
It's not a "hang." It's a date.
Mr. Gregorian, I'm glad you're here.
I'm so nervous.
Call me Jake.
Take a deep breath.
It's just two people having a conversation.
Chloe, we're two minutes to air.
Are you good?
Yeah, I guess.
You're gonna be fine.
You know your brother better than anyone in the world.
It's the reason why Louise is talking to you.
Okay.
Megan, what is he doing here?
Julia didn't tell you?
Can you change it to "Coach Phil Ryder"?
I want to give him his title.
You're not putting the coach on.
Excuse me?
Chloe's not going on TV with a guy that hates her brother.
You can't tell me who to book as a guest on this show.
You know what?
You're right.
I think we're out.
If you back out, it'll look like she has something to hide.
I don't care.
It's too risky.
I'm doing it.
I heard what that coach said about Dax.
He doesn't get to do that.
Not without a fight from me.
A lot of things have been said about your brother, both on the news and online.
But, tell us about the Dax you know.
He's just a sweet kid.
He plays his guitar and writes songs.
When Dax was 14, he read a 300-page service manual so he could repair my old car by himself.
People are saying he's guilty.
Dax has always been different.
And, honestly, it's easy to say things on the Internet when you can be anonymous.
You think he's innocent?
I know he is.
Coach Ryder, you've been critical of Dax Edwards.
That's true.
Okay, but look, I can't fault this young woman for believing in her brother.
I mean, you did the best you could.
What's that supposed to mean?
Come on.
Your mom went nuts, your dad split.
You got stuck with a problem child.
You don't know anything about me or my family.
Hey, look, I'm just trying to be nice.
No.
You're a bully, just like all those people who are saying things about my brother online.
Maybe we should take a quick break.
No, Louise, hold your horses.
I want to respond to that.
Go ahead.
The reason people are saying things online, is because our whole damn culture has gotten so PC, nobody will say it in person.
But, okay, fine, you want to take the gloves off?
I will tell it like it is.
Dax Edwards is a cold-blooded killer.
- That is not...
- Ben, cue up the recording.
What recording?
Louise, read your pocket screen.
You don't know what you're talking about!
My brother is not a murderer.
We have a development in the case.
The L.A.P.D. has released a recording of a voicemail Dax left Jason six weeks before he was murdered.
We're gonna play it now.
Hey, douchebag, Chloe just old me what happened.
I don't know who you think you are now, but stay the hell away from my sister!
That is your brother's voice, right?
Yes, but it's not what it sounds like.
Did you have a sexual relationship with Jason Moore?
What?
!
Of course not!
Go to commercial.
Please.
She's an adult.
Let her answer the question.
Why is your brother threatening the victim to stay away from you?
I'm sorry.
I-I can't do this.
You know how they say crazy runs in the family.
With these people, it's running a 4-minute mile.
We'll be right back.
What the hell is wrong with you today?
You blindsided her, you blindsided me.
I'm doing my job.
Chloe is not a celebrity, Julia.
She's not a criminal.
She is a young lady who's trying to help her little brother.
I don't think it would've hurt you or your show to, I don't know, maybe give us a head's up.
Thanks.
Chloe!
Chloe, wait!
Chloe!
Jake, I saw the show.
Chloe okay?
I'm not sure.
Can't find her.
She's not answering her phone.
You know how she said she had an alibi?
Yeah, she was working at a diner.
Well, I talked to her manager.
They laid her off six months ago.
So, she lied, and she won't answer questions about Jason.
What else is she hiding?
Ready?
How'd you know she'd be here?
When we were kids, Dax and Chloe's mom used to take us to this park.
We still hang out here sometimes.
Hi, Chloe.
What are you doing here?
I know you haven't worked at the diner for months.
Why'd you lie to me?
I got fired from my job.
I'm looking for something that pays enough to cover rent, but, in the meantime, I've been dancing at a... club.
I was there all night.
You can ask any of the other girls.
Why didn't you tell me?
My mom's mental, my brother sells drugs, and I work at a strip club.
It's not a pretty picture.
What about that voicemail?
Your brother sounded pretty angry.
Jason has always had a crush on me.
One night, he came to the club with a bunch of his football buddies.
They were drunk.
He wanted a lap dance, and I said no.
He got angry, got physical, and a bouncer tossed him out.
When I went home, I told Dax, and that's when he made that call, but it blew over.
Sorry.
Yeah?
Yeah, okay.
Thanks.
Chloe, your brother got in a fight.
He's in the jail infirmary.
Oh, God.
Come on.
I'll drive you.
All right.
Levi.
Over here, Levi.
How you doing, SweetVicki?
Get out.
Levi, did you kill Sarah Keaton?
Huh?
Levi's getting a lot of attention.
Uh, Levi is a creep who betrayed his best friend.
Did you visit Dax?
Is he okay?
Broken rib, black eye.
We got to get him out of lockup.
Any luck corroborating his alibi?
No.
I went all over campus, but nobody wants to admit to buying drugs.
I guess that shouldn't surprise me.
The thing is, they don't want to talk about Jason, either.
They've totally closed ranks.
Yeah, but they're all too happy to gossip about it on Tell Me a Secret.
You're right.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking I need to figure out a way to use this app to our advantage.
Good.
Hey.
I was just getting ready for our date.
Change of plans.
Instead of dinner, how do you feel about an afternoon stakeout?
Hey.
How'd it go with the app creator?
Uh, I threatened the kid with a defamation lawsuit, but the little cockroach called my bluff.
He won't give us the name of the user who started the thread and named Dax as the killer.
There must be some way to force his hand.
Well, the only precedent is eminent threat.
Then a judge could issue an order and make him give us the user's identity.
And Dax is facing the death penalty.
You're right, and I've been on the phone with every federal judge we know.
So far, no luck.
There may be one other federal judge who might help us.
Does he owe you a favor?
No, not me.
Forget it, Jake.
I can't even believe you're asking me.
Would you just hear me out?
Eric cheated on me.
I'm not asking him for a favor.
You know what?
You are right.
I hate him for what he did.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked.
As long as you're here, I should tell you that the network wants the coach back on for an hour tonight.
You have got to be kidding me!
I think the guy's an arrogant jerk, but America loves him.
He's trending on Twitter.
#CoachTellsltLikeltls
Do me a favor, and just try to keep it balanced.
What is your thing with this kid?
We grew up in the same neighborhood.
When I was in high school, we had a kid just like Dax.
He got picked on every day.
Let me guess.
His name was Jake Gregorian?
Nice try.
I'm not buying it.
That's not what I was saying.
Wait.
You were the bully?
Worse.
I was the guy that could've stopped the bully... but didn't.
I'm sorry I blindsided your client's sister.
You could make it up to her by helping her brother.
Fine.
Fine.
You'll talk to Eric?
Fine.
I'll think about it.
I know you.
That's a yes.
You really expect me to issue a court order when the First Amendment's at play?
I shouldn't have come.
It'll be uploaded to the ECF by the end of the day.
How do I say no to you?
Today, of all days.
What do you mean?
Well, it would've been our one-year anniversary.
We were supposed to go to Medora for dinner.
- Right.
- You know, I don't think
I canceled that reservation.
We could still go.
We're not getting back together.
Oh, Julia.
Look, I know that what I did was unforgivable.
I'm in therapy now, and I know that it's gonna be a while before I'm healthy enough to be with you or anyone else.
But I want you in my life.
And maybe someday, you'll see that I'm a changed man.
So, what do you say?
Will you have dinner with me?
Just dinner.
Let's get in!
- Thanks for coming.
- Are you kidding me?
French fries and a college pep rally... totally my jam.
So, you like football?
A bunch of meatheads slamming into each other?
I'll pass.
Hey, I was once one of those meatheads in high school.
Oh, that explains a lot.
Hmm.
What were you?
Let me guess...
You were the hot mathlete?
I didn't have what you would call a normal high school experience.
What?
Were you, like, homeschooled or something?
Oh, my God.
You were.
That's hilarious.
This is exactly why I don't tell people.
They think it's weird.
I think it's cool.
I mean, I went to an expensive private school, and now, I'm running errands for a living.
You got homeschooled, and you're a successful lawyer.
You tell me what's weird.
Thanks.
Okay.
So, it looks like everyone's inside.
We've got the bulk of the student body in one place.
Let's tell them a secret.
Hmm.
Did it come through?
"Dax Edwards was just released from custody because the cops have identified the real killer.
They're on their way to the pep rally to make an arrest."
Homeschooled or not, you're a genius.
Let's go.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What the hell?
!
We need to talk.
Move, lady!
We're in a hurry.
I'm an attorney, and if you know something about Jason Moore, it's in your best interest to come clean.
We don't know anything about anything.
Dude, we know exactly what happened.
Either you talk to us, or we call the cops.
Up to you.
Okay, fine, then.
Wait!
We didn't mean to kill Jason.
We swear.
Thank you for helping me, but I need you to keep this between us.
Are you kidding?
You know I've been looking for a way to make my bones with Julia.
Fine.
I'll keep my mouth shut.
That look is very effective.
I'll call you.
We saw Jason coming out of a frat party.
He was drunk off his ass.
We decided to have a little fun with him.
We tied a T-shirt around his eyes, like a blindfold.
Then we threw him in my trunk and drove him to the dam.
Fun.
Then what happened?
If we didn't intend to kill him...
I mean, if it was an accident...
You could still be looking at murder charges.
I can't represent you, but if you tell us everything,
I promise I'll get you the best possible defense.
You have my word.
I had my old helmet.
We put it on and took turns tackling him like a practice dummy.
What did you have against Jason?
Nothing.
He was a solid freshman.
They were hazing him.
Isn't that right?
Only it went too far, and when you realized you'd killed him, you took off.
He was alive when we left.
That's how it works.
The freshmen take their licks, and then they find their own way home.
They did it to me, they did it to him.
It's a tradition.
Welcome back.
We've been taking your calls tonight on LHL.
Once again, our guest is Coach Phil Ryder, the man who insists he's telling it like it is.
Lenny, from Amarillo, you're on.
Coach, I was at that game against Cleveland in '94 when you had three touchdowns.
Unbelievable.
What's your question, Lenny?
Hey, you ever think about running for office?
I would sure vote for you.
Well, never say never, right, Lenny?
I'm serious.
America needs a leader like you.
You're a straight talker, and that's what we've been...
Does anyone have a good question?
Every caller wants to kiss this guy's ass.
It used to be, the point of college was to prepare our kids for the real world.
All we've done is create this generation of snowflakes.
And you know how we did it?
We started handing out awards just for showing up.
We've created a monster.
In fact, Louise, can I tell it like it is?
Why stop now?
Hey, Jake.
We're live.
What's going on?
I'm on my way up.
I have reason to believe Jason Moore died after being hazed by his teammates.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
And there's more.
This is why sports are so important.
Louise, check your pocket screen.
They're an anecdote to a culture of false achievements.
Win or lose, it is my job to toughen my players up.
Does that include hazing them?
I do...
I don't know what you're talking about.
Come on, Coach.
It's a well-known part of being on a sports team.
- You better be right about this.
- I've got a source.
Tell her that we know he authorized two of his players to haze Jason Moore.
- Who's your source?
- Just ask him if it's true.
Julia, I promise, it'll be good TV.
but not on your team?
Ask the coach if he authorized hazing by two of his players.
Is it true you authorized two of your players to haze Jason?
Nope.
No, that's...
That's not accurate.
Did you know about your football team's hazing culture?
Finn, get in here.
Okay, Louise, what you're talking about,
I wouldn't call hazing.
This is all in good fun, okay?
It's towel fights, hiding another guy's jock strap.
This is nothing like what happened to Jason.
A week before he died, did you pull two of your captains aside and tell them that the new freshmen were "too soft"
and they needed to toughen them up?
Look, that's not what I...
So, that's not what you meant, but isn't it possible that your players took your instructions a bit too far and they killed Jason Moore?
Dax Edwards killed Jason Moore.
Coach, you were trying to make your athletes better, tougher men.
Here's what I want to know...
Could this all be your fault?
Listen, if these idiots pushed it too far and they killed Jason, that is on them, not me!
Finally.
There you have it.
Thanks for telling it like it is.
We'll be right back.
And we're clear.
What did I tell you?
- Good TV.
- Good TV.
Where are you going?
Get my client out of jail.
Jake, that was quite a show tonight.
Ryder's coaching career is over.
I'm here to retrieve Dax Edwards.
Open up the gates.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid I can't do that.
Lozowski and Sanchez admitting to hitting Jason with their helmets.
Bruises on the body correspond with that kind of blunt object, but according to the coroner, the fatal head wound was caused by a sharp object, probably a rock.
That could've happened while they were tackling him.
Yeah, maybe, but they said they left Jason at 12:30, and we have security footage of them downing chili dogs at Tommy's 15 minutes later.
So what?
Jason's phone records just came in.
There's a call from his cellphone at 1:07.
Jason called Dax.
Look, we're charging the football players with felony hazing, but your guy looks good for the murder.
My heart's still racing from the show.
After all this time, I still get that buzz.
We took down an obnoxious bully.
We earned dessert.
I think I'll pass.
Trust me.
You're gonna want it.
Flaming cherries jubilee.
Here you are, Miss Louise.
Thank you, Marco.
Just leave the whiskey and the lighter.
Of course.
What's this?
All your sad Eric crap.
It's time to purge.
You went in my office?
In my drawers?
I did.
Because I'm a good friend.
I thought he was the one.
I know, hon, but he wasn't.
Now...
I know it's a bit cliche, but it works.
To letting go.
I don't understand.
The football players admitted to beating the crap out of Jason.
Yeah, but I checked the timeline, Ella.
Detective Matthews is right.
Jake, the court order against Tell Me a Secret just came through.
Tell me they'll comply.
We need that name.
When I showed the kid the court order, he panicked.
Said if his users found out that their secrets weren't actually anonymous, they'd ditch his app and he'd wind up like Friendster.
So I agreed to tear up the order if he gave us what we wanted.
You know who accused Dax?
I never could keep a secret.
That's crazy.
Why would I accuse my best friend of murder?
That's a good question.
You want to answer, or should I?
Finn?
Jason did get hazed that night, but when the football players left, he was still alive.
And he had to find a way home.
So who did he call?
He called his old friends Dax and Finn.
In fact, he called the landline here, and records show that that call was answered.
FiFinn was the only one home.
Mm-hmm.
You drove out to pick him up.
Isn't that right?
What happened when you got there?
He was a mess...
Drunk, bleeding.
He said those football players kicked his ass.
I thought for sure he was gonna quit the team, but he was happy...
Happy they beat the crap out of him.
He said it was a tradition, that he finally felt a part of something... that he had real friends.
Real friends.
That would've pissed me off, too.
I couldn't believe it.
I drove out there in the middle of the night.
I was his friend.
I told him that he was being a jerk, and he laughed at me.
Said that I was a loser.
Then he tried to get in my car.
Finn, what did you do?
I was angry.
And I just...
I picked up a rock, and I threw it at him.
I swear I didn't mean to kill him.
I just...
I hit him in the head, and he dropped.
Oh, God.
You blamed it on Dax.
Why?
Because I knew everyone would believe it.
Hey.
Got your text.
What are we doing here?
I felt bad I had to cut our date short.
Well, I like your way of apologizing.
Are we paying by the hour?
I live here.
In a motel?
You know how I told you I was homeschooled?
Mm-hmm.
Well, truth is, we never really had a home.
It was always just my mom and I, on the move, skipping out on rents, dodging my mom's crazy ex-boyfriends.
So, when I passed the Bar and started working,
I got an apartment like you're supposed to.
But I could never bring myself to buy furniture.
It just felt so permanent.
It never felt like home, and this did, so I moved in, and that was three years ago.
Three years?
You're the only one I've ever told.
Why me?
Because you could've told Julia about the football players, and you didn't.
And I trust you.
Mm.
Hey, you seem like someone who likes to take things slow.
Take off your clothes.
Hey, boss.
How was dinner?
It was, um... cathartic.
Can I have the overtime spreadsheets?
There's a budget meeting in the morning.
Mm-hmm.
_
This message is for Julia George.
You think I wanted to hurt Oscar?
I just wanted to protect him.
Sarah was bad for him, and I was the only one who could see it.
I only wanted him to be happy.
But you and Jake Gregorian...
You twisted everything.
You made me the enemy.
If you want the truth, come and get it.
You got the story all wrong.
Here you go.
Can you get me Levi Young's address?
Yeah, of course.
Text it to me.
I'll be in the car.
Levi?
What took you so long?
You said I got the story wrong.
I sent those photos so Oscar would know the truth.
Why didn't you just tell him the truth?
And tell him I've been watching over him... taking pictures?
That makes me look crazy.
But Oscar needed to know Jake couldn't be trusted, that Sarah would've used the abuse against him.
I got ahead of that.
For him.
But you also sent me a photo of Oscar cheating on Sarah.
How does that help him?
You wanted to make sure Sarah never took Oscar back.
You have feelings for him.
What?
Most of the photos...
They're of the two of you.
Oscar said he could talk to SweetVicki about all areas of his life.
By pretending to be her, you could have the relationship with him you always wanted.
You're in love with him.
That's crazy.
I know what it's like to have all your hopes and dreams wrapped up in one person and realize there's no future with them.
Trust me.
I...
I understand.
But Oscar never would.
He might not, but at least you could let him know you never intended to hurt him.
I would never hurt him.
I would never hurt Sarah.
I'm not that kind of person.
I believe you.
I got the story wrong.
Yeah.
But you have the chance to set it right.
Please put down the gun.
Tell Oscar I'm sorry.
Okay.
Previously on "Notorious"...
She's dead.
I have orders to arrest your client for the murder of Sarah Keaton.
That's Levi Young.
Why would he send me photos incriminating his best friend?
You sent me those photos for a reason.
I sent you three photos.
The third one was Sarah in bed with your friend Jake Gregorian.
If you run a story about me,
I'll take a copy of that photo to one of your competitors.
You're hacking into his home computer?
You're committing a crime.
How else am I supposed to help my boss?
That's SweetVicki.
You found her?
You've been texting with Levi Young.
He was pretending to be SweetVicki.
Tomorrow, LHL, an exclusive.
With who?
Oscar Keaton, the prison interview.
Look straight into the camera.
The viewers need to see
- you have nothing to hide.
- Understood.
And, remember, this interview is about Levi.
Louise will try and bait you into talking about Sarah and the murder.
Steer her away.
20 seconds.
If you start to sweat, look at that monitor, and dab your forehead when no one's watching.
Thank you.
10 seconds out.
Louise, let's start with questions about Levi and then pivot to the murder.
I want to get Oscar on the record about Sarah.
Copy that.
And in 3, 2...
Good evening.
We have an exclusive interview with Internet mogul Oscar Keaton, who is awaiting trial for the murder of his wife.
For several months prior to his arrest,
Keaton was having a cyber-affair with a person he only knew as "SweetVicki."
But in a shocking twist, he's learned that SweetVicki was none other than his own business partner, Levi Young.
We go live now to the L.A. County Jail for Mr. Keaton's reaction.
Welcome, Mr. Keaton.
You and Levi Young have been best friends since you were 8 years old, and the two of you started your company in the basement of his mother's house.
That's right, Louise.
So tell me, why on earth would he do this to you?
It's clear the man's trying to destroy me.
I've never trusted anyone so much in my entire life, and he betrayed me.
Levi is a genius when it comes to writing code, but I was the face of the company, and I...
I think he resented that.
Ask about the affair.
Cue the photo.
A few days ago, LHL received a photo of you with another woman.
Do you have a comment?
It happened once.
The important thing is that Sarah forgave me.
Was this one time before or after you beat her?
Cue photo 2.
From these photos, it look like you cheated on your wife, and when she confronted you, you got violent.
I'm deeply ashamed.
I've made my share of mistakes in my life.
Trusting Levi was one of them.
First, we were just sending pictures back and forth.
But then, I started sharing things with her....him, things I should've kept private.
I can only assume Levi planned on using that information against me with the Board of Directors.
Now that I'm in jail, Levi has a lot to gain.
Hold on.
Are you suggesting
Levi killed Sarah and framed you?
I just know that I didn't kill my wife.
Now I'm asking the L.A.P.D. to keep looking...
Hey, something just came in on the scanner.
A jogger found a body by the Sepulveda Dam.
It's the missing football player Jason Moore.
I'm confident they'll find the answers
- they're looking for.
- Wrap.
Tease Jason Moore.
Toss to a break.
Mr. Keaton, thank you for being on our show tonight.
Thank you, Louise.
We'll take a break, and when we return, a development in the case of Jason Moore, missing since Friday.
How many times are they gonna run those damn photos?
They're out there, and now, you've addressed them.
You stayed on point, you made it about Levi.
You did well.
I trusted that man with my life.
And we're back in 3, 2...
Welcome back.
We have an update on the case of Jason Moore, the 19-year-old California University football player.
Sadly, his body was discovered near the Sepulveda Dam in the San Fernando Valley.
Our sources are telling us that he'd been severely beaten.
Jason grew up in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Van Nuys and received a full football scholarship to nearby California University.
Unfortunately, he would only play for the Falcons as a freshman.
He died at 19.
Under the leadership of Coach Phil Ryder, the CU Falcons have won three consecutive post-season bowl games, including last season's... but ultimately decided on California University... so he could stay close to his mother.
The police are treating Jason's death as a homicide, although it will be days before a coroner will officially rule on cause of death.
I can't believe he's really dead.
His poor mom.
...late Friday night, and never returned to his dorm.
His roommate called his mother the next day...
- Oh, God!
- What?
I...
I need to get out of here.
This is bad.
What's going on?
Chloe, they're saying your brother killed Jason.
What?
!
That's crazy!
Who's saying that?
Like, everyone.
Dax, talk to me, please.
The kids on that stupid app don't know that you and Jason were friends.
There's no way the police will take them seriously.
I'm just going for a drive, okay?
I need to clear my head.
I'll go with you.
No!
I want to be alone.
We'll be right back with further details on this devastating turn of events.
I'm sorry, but Jake isn't in yet, and unless you have an appointment...
I am not leaving until I talk with him.
It's all right, Ella.
We're fine.
What do you want?
I saw Oscar's interview.
He has it all wrong.
I went to see him in jail, but they told me you took me off the visitor list.
Oscar doesn't want to see you right now.
I just need to talk to him.
I can explain myself.
He's my friend.
I think your friendship ended when you started catfishing him, Levi.
Oh, but apparently, you can sleep with his wife and still be his lawyer.
Yeah.
I took the photo.
I know the truth.
Were you hiding in the bushes, you pervert?
I was looking out for Oscar!
You know what?
Get out!
Never come back here again!
What?
Uh, I'm sorry.
Can I help you?
I'm Chloe Edwards.
This is my friend Finn.
You went to Van Nuys High School with my mom, Brenda Wilcox.
Brenda?
Yeah, of course.
Uh, she was a good friend.
What can I do for you?
You know that Cal U football player that was killed?
Mm-hmm.
Jason Moore.
Yeah.
I saw him rush for 250 yards against Monroe his senior year.
Last night, my brothe was arrested for his murder.
He didn't do it.
We need your help.
Okay.
So, I talked with my contact at L.A.P.D., and your brother was pulled over at 2:00 A.M.
They brought him in on a bench warrant, which means that Dax has been arrested before.
Last year, he was caught selling pot.
Well, apparently, he skipped a court date.
So, that's all this is about.
No.
They're using the warrant to hold him while they gather evidence on the homicide.
My brother would never hurt anyone.
Why do the cops think he would?
Because of that app, Tell Me a Secret.
It's this anonymous chat room where everyone in that room is physically located within the same square mile.
Someone in the chat room wrote that Dax was the killer.
Then everyone else piled on.
How well did Dax know Jason?
We were all best friends since were 10... me, Dax and Jason.
And then, junior year, Jason grew like a foot, starting working out.
Next thing we know, he was playing varsity football.
Me and Dax barely graduated high school, and Jason got a full ride to college.
Must have been hard getting left behind.
Are you kidding?
Football was Jason's way out.
We were happy for him.
After high school, Finn moved in with Dax and me.
Were either of you with your brother the night Jason went missing?
No.
I was working graveyard at the Blue Door Diner.
And I was home, but Dax wasn't with me.
Where's your mom now?
She lives at Gateways.
She had a breakdown about five years ago, diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic.
That's when my dad took off.
I've been Dax's legal guardian ever since.
Chloe, I'm sorry.
I had no idea.
Mom showed up at Dax's school when he was 13.
She was hysterical, running up and down the hallways, shouting his name.
Kids were cruel.
They said it was just a matter of time before he snapped like she did.
He's a good person.
He just uses the psycho image to keep people at a distance.
Well, I'll down to lockup, and we'll get started.
Okay.
Um, you should know Dax doesn't trust people.
It's okay.
Neither do I.
No, it's not okay.
It's the third time he's done this to us.
Oh, I get it.
He's a busy man, and his word is crap.
Good morning.
I got your text, your voice mail, and your e-mail.
What's up?
I just wanted to say, again, I am really sorry for springing that video on you.
I keep thinking about it, and...
Stop.
I got to vent.
You heard me out.
We're good.
Now, who just peed in your Cheerios?
The former Vice President.
He's dropping us to go golfing at Pebble Beach, and I have to come up with a whole new show.
You live for that drama.
Tell me what's really going on.
It's Eric.
Tomorrow would've been our one-year anniversary.
I keep thinking I'm over him, and then I get a whiff of his cologne on my blanket, and I...
You miss him.
I miss what I thought we had.
And he's probably off celebrating his freedom with some stripper.
It's not the worst idea.
Hey, that cute new cameraman has some attractive friends.
Trust me.
Below the line will blow your mind.
Thank you.
I'll remember that.
Any time.
Dax, my name is Jake Gregorian.
I'm your lawyer.
All right.
Do you know why you're here?
For selling pot.
Right, for selling pot.
Now, let's talk about why you're really here.
You were arrested going south on the 5.
Innocent men don't run.
You fit the profile, you're a loner, you sell drugs.
Yeah.
People think I'm a freak.
Doesn't mean I killed him.
You know, I grew up just a few blocks from you.
Went to Van Nuys High.
I did fine, academically, except for math.
I sucked at math.
I was about to fail calculus when somebody helped me.
Your mom.
She was brilliant, Dax.
She had all these little memory games...
Lo-di-hi minus hi-di-lo.
All over lo squared.
Yep.
Hard to forget, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Dax, your mom saved my ass, and now, it's my turn to save yours.
But you got to talk to me, man.
Good.
All right.
Let's start with the night Jason went missing.
Where were you?
Where I am every Friday...
Trolling campus selling weed to douchebag college kids.
All right.
Not the most sympathetic alibi, but I can work with that.
Uh, I'll be back.
In the meantime, do not talk to anyone, okay?
Hey, Jake.
I heard you were representing Dax Edwards in the Jason Moore homicide.
Homicide?
As of now, Dax is only here for skipping a court date.
Well, homicide charges are being filed.
Forensics found strands of the victim's hair in your client's car.
So what?
Dax and Jason are friends.
Jason's probably been in his car a bunch of times.
All you guys have, Ken, is a bunch of anonymous online chatter and no motive.
It's murder one, Jake.
You think we'd make an arrest without a motive?
Thank you all for being here today.
My name is Phil Ryder.
Jason's mom, Tina, has asked me to say a few words as his coach.
Did you hear they made an arrest?
Isn't that the guy who used to do those underwear commercials?
Yeah, after he won two rings with Dallas.
He had a gift.
I've never seen so much raw talent.
Who knows how far Jason could've gone...
The Heisman, the NFL?
Now we're hearing that Dax Edwards has been arrested.
Let me make one thing clear...
Dax Edwards is a low-life drug dealer.
I caught this kid trying to sell his crap to my players a couple months ago.
And, believe me, I put a end to that quick.
I'm sorry.
This is not about that piece of garbage.
This, here, today is about Jason Moore... whose short, but brilliant life we are here to mourn.
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey.
Are you watching the press conference?
Why don't they just go ahead and hang my client right there in the quad?
You're representing Dax Edwards?
Yes, I am, and I want to put his sister on your show tonight, get out our side of the story.
Find out everything you can about Dax Edwards.
- We got his sister for tonight.
- Okay.
I don't know.
I've got the Vice President tonight, but I guess I could push him for you.
Mm-hmm.
Canceled on you again?
I'll see you tonight.
Her son's passion for the game.
We're gonna move forward with the pep rally tomorrow.
In the meantime, my heart goes out to his family.
Nothing can bring Jason back, but I made a promise to his mother that
I will not rest until justice is served.
Well, your paperwork's in order.
Congratulations.
You take care of yourself, now.
That's the plan.
So, you want me to confirm that our client was selling drugs?
Well, I'd rather Dax go down for selling pot than murder.
Good point.
I'll head to the campus and see if I can find support for his alibi.
Keep me posted.
Good news.
I tracked down the kid who created
Tell Me a Secret.
- Kid?
- Mm-hmm.
He's 21, started the app as a freshman at Princeton.
Now works from his home in Beverly Hills.
Yeah, we need to get the name of the user who started the rumor about Dax.
Yeah.
Don't worry.
If the kid resists,
I'll put the fear of God in him.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
I'm looking for a good lawyer.
See, I hacked into a computer network the other night with the help of a very beautiful accomplice.
Uh, that was a felony, and I had nothing to do with that.
Why are you really here?
Louise sent me to get her favorite Chardonnay from some vineyard in Montesito.
Turns out they have it at the convenience store right around the corner.
Anyway, I was wondering if we could get together again sometime.
Are you asking me out?
I was thinking we could... hang.
I'm free tomorrow, as long as you stick to misdemeanors.
Deal.
I'll pick you up.
Where do you live?
Let's just meet here.
Okay.
And, we're not 12.
It's not a "hang." It's a date.
Mr. Gregorian, I'm glad you're here.
I'm so nervous.
Call me Jake.
Take a deep breath.
It's just two people having a conversation.
Chloe, we're two minutes to air.
Are you good?
Yeah, I guess.
You're gonna be fine.
You know your brother better than anyone in the world.
It's the reason why Louise is talking to you.
Okay.
Megan, what is he doing here?
Julia didn't tell you?
Can you change it to "Coach Phil Ryder"?
I want to give him his title.
You're not putting the coach on.
Excuse me?
Chloe's not going on TV with a guy that hates her brother.
You can't tell me who to book as a guest on this show.
You know what?
You're right.
I think we're out.
If you back out, it'll look like she has something to hide.
I don't care.
It's too risky.
I'm doing it.
I heard what that coach said about Dax.
He doesn't get to do that.
Not without a fight from me.
A lot of things have been said about your brother, both on the news and online.
But, tell us about the Dax you know.
He's just a sweet kid.
He plays his guitar and writes songs.
When Dax was 14, he read a 300-page service manual so he could repair my old car by himself.
People are saying he's guilty.
Dax has always been different.
And, honestly, it's easy to say things on the Internet when you can be anonymous.
You think he's innocent?
I know he is.
Coach Ryder, you've been critical of Dax Edwards.
That's true.
Okay, but look, I can't fault this young woman for believing in her brother.
I mean, you did the best you could.
What's that supposed to mean?
Come on.
Your mom went nuts, your dad split.
You got stuck with a problem child.
You don't know anything about me or my family.
Hey, look, I'm just trying to be nice.
No.
You're a bully, just like all those people who are saying things about my brother online.
Maybe we should take a quick break.
No, Louise, hold your horses.
I want to respond to that.
Go ahead.
The reason people are saying things online, is because our whole damn culture has gotten so PC, nobody will say it in person.
But, okay, fine, you want to take the gloves off?
I will tell it like it is.
Dax Edwards is a cold-blooded killer.
- That is not...
- Ben, cue up the recording.
What recording?
Louise, read your pocket screen.
You don't know what you're talking about!
My brother is not a murderer.
We have a development in the case.
The L.A.P.D. has released a recording of a voicemail Dax left Jason six weeks before he was murdered.
We're gonna play it now.
Hey, douchebag, Chloe just old me what happened.
I don't know who you think you are now, but stay the hell away from my sister!
That is your brother's voice, right?
Yes, but it's not what it sounds like.
Did you have a sexual relationship with Jason Moore?
What?
!
Of course not!
Go to commercial.
Please.
She's an adult.
Let her answer the question.
Why is your brother threatening the victim to stay away from you?
I'm sorry.
I-I can't do this.
You know how they say crazy runs in the family.
With these people, it's running a 4-minute mile.
We'll be right back.
What the hell is wrong with you today?
You blindsided her, you blindsided me.
I'm doing my job.
Chloe is not a celebrity, Julia.
She's not a criminal.
She is a young lady who's trying to help her little brother.
I don't think it would've hurt you or your show to, I don't know, maybe give us a head's up.
Thanks.
Chloe!
Chloe, wait!
Chloe!
Jake, I saw the show.
Chloe okay?
I'm not sure.
Can't find her.
She's not answering her phone.
You know how she said she had an alibi?
Yeah, she was working at a diner.
Well, I talked to her manager.
They laid her off six months ago.
So, she lied, and she won't answer questions about Jason.
What else is she hiding?
Ready?
How'd you know she'd be here?
When we were kids, Dax and Chloe's mom used to take us to this park.
We still hang out here sometimes.
Hi, Chloe.
What are you doing here?
I know you haven't worked at the diner for months.
Why'd you lie to me?
I got fired from my job.
I'm looking for something that pays enough to cover rent, but, in the meantime, I've been dancing at a... club.
I was there all night.
You can ask any of the other girls.
Why didn't you tell me?
My mom's mental, my brother sells drugs, and I work at a strip club.
It's not a pretty picture.
What about that voicemail?
Your brother sounded pretty angry.
Jason has always had a crush on me.
One night, he came to the club with a bunch of his football buddies.
They were drunk.
He wanted a lap dance, and I said no.
He got angry, got physical, and a bouncer tossed him out.
When I went home, I told Dax, and that's when he made that call, but it blew over.
Sorry.
Yeah?
Yeah, okay.
Thanks.
Chloe, your brother got in a fight.
He's in the jail infirmary.
Oh, God.
Come on.
I'll drive you.
All right.
Levi.
Over here, Levi.
How you doing, SweetVicki?
Get out.
Levi, did you kill Sarah Keaton?
Huh?
Levi's getting a lot of attention.
Uh, Levi is a creep who betrayed his best friend.
Did you visit Dax?
Is he okay?
Broken rib, black eye.
We got to get him out of lockup.
Any luck corroborating his alibi?
No.
I went all over campus, but nobody wants to admit to buying drugs.
I guess that shouldn't surprise me.
The thing is, they don't want to talk about Jason, either.
They've totally closed ranks.
Yeah, but they're all too happy to gossip about it on Tell Me a Secret.
You're right.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking I need to figure out a way to use this app to our advantage.
Good.
Hey.
I was just getting ready for our date.
Change of plans.
Instead of dinner, how do you feel about an afternoon stakeout?
Hey.
How'd it go with the app creator?
Uh, I threatened the kid with a defamation lawsuit, but the little cockroach called my bluff.
He won't give us the name of the user who started the thread and named Dax as the killer.
There must be some way to force his hand.
Well, the only precedent is eminent threat.
Then a judge could issue an order and make him give us the user's identity.
And Dax is facing the death penalty.
You're right, and I've been on the phone with every federal judge we know.
So far, no luck.
There may be one other federal judge who might help us.
Does he owe you a favor?
No, not me.
Forget it, Jake.
I can't even believe you're asking me.
Would you just hear me out?
Eric cheated on me.
I'm not asking him for a favor.
You know what?
You are right.
I hate him for what he did.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked.
As long as you're here, I should tell you that the network wants the coach back on for an hour tonight.
You have got to be kidding me!
I think the guy's an arrogant jerk, but America loves him.
He's trending on Twitter.
#CoachTellsltLikeltls
Do me a favor, and just try to keep it balanced.
What is your thing with this kid?
We grew up in the same neighborhood.
When I was in high school, we had a kid just like Dax.
He got picked on every day.
Let me guess.
His name was Jake Gregorian?
Nice try.
I'm not buying it.
That's not what I was saying.
Wait.
You were the bully?
Worse.
I was the guy that could've stopped the bully... but didn't.
I'm sorry I blindsided your client's sister.
You could make it up to her by helping her brother.
Fine.
Fine.
You'll talk to Eric?
Fine.
I'll think about it.
I know you.
That's a yes.
You really expect me to issue a court order when the First Amendment's at play?
I shouldn't have come.
It'll be uploaded to the ECF by the end of the day.
How do I say no to you?
Today, of all days.
What do you mean?
Well, it would've been our one-year anniversary.
We were supposed to go to Medora for dinner.
- Right.
- You know, I don't think
I canceled that reservation.
We could still go.
We're not getting back together.
Oh, Julia.
Look, I know that what I did was unforgivable.
I'm in therapy now, and I know that it's gonna be a while before I'm healthy enough to be with you or anyone else.
But I want you in my life.
And maybe someday, you'll see that I'm a changed man.
So, what do you say?
Will you have dinner with me?
Just dinner.
Let's get in!
- Thanks for coming.
- Are you kidding me?
French fries and a college pep rally... totally my jam.
So, you like football?
A bunch of meatheads slamming into each other?
I'll pass.
Hey, I was once one of those meatheads in high school.
Oh, that explains a lot.
Hmm.
What were you?
Let me guess...
You were the hot mathlete?
I didn't have what you would call a normal high school experience.
What?
Were you, like, homeschooled or something?
Oh, my God.
You were.
That's hilarious.
This is exactly why I don't tell people.
They think it's weird.
I think it's cool.
I mean, I went to an expensive private school, and now, I'm running errands for a living.
You got homeschooled, and you're a successful lawyer.
You tell me what's weird.
Thanks.
Okay.
So, it looks like everyone's inside.
We've got the bulk of the student body in one place.
Let's tell them a secret.
Hmm.
Did it come through?
"Dax Edwards was just released from custody because the cops have identified the real killer.
They're on their way to the pep rally to make an arrest."
Homeschooled or not, you're a genius.
Let's go.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What the hell?
!
We need to talk.
Move, lady!
We're in a hurry.
I'm an attorney, and if you know something about Jason Moore, it's in your best interest to come clean.
We don't know anything about anything.
Dude, we know exactly what happened.
Either you talk to us, or we call the cops.
Up to you.
Okay, fine, then.
Wait!
We didn't mean to kill Jason.
We swear.
Thank you for helping me, but I need you to keep this between us.
Are you kidding?
You know I've been looking for a way to make my bones with Julia.
Fine.
I'll keep my mouth shut.
That look is very effective.
I'll call you.
We saw Jason coming out of a frat party.
He was drunk off his ass.
We decided to have a little fun with him.
We tied a T-shirt around his eyes, like a blindfold.
Then we threw him in my trunk and drove him to the dam.
Fun.
Then what happened?
If we didn't intend to kill him...
I mean, if it was an accident...
You could still be looking at murder charges.
I can't represent you, but if you tell us everything,
I promise I'll get you the best possible defense.
You have my word.
I had my old helmet.
We put it on and took turns tackling him like a practice dummy.
What did you have against Jason?
Nothing.
He was a solid freshman.
They were hazing him.
Isn't that right?
Only it went too far, and when you realized you'd killed him, you took off.
He was alive when we left.
That's how it works.
The freshmen take their licks, and then they find their own way home.
They did it to me, they did it to him.
It's a tradition.
Welcome back.
We've been taking your calls tonight on LHL.
Once again, our guest is Coach Phil Ryder, the man who insists he's telling it like it is.
Lenny, from Amarillo, you're on.
Coach, I was at that game against Cleveland in '94 when you had three touchdowns.
Unbelievable.
What's your question, Lenny?
Hey, you ever think about running for office?
I would sure vote for you.
Well, never say never, right, Lenny?
I'm serious.
America needs a leader like you.
You're a straight talker, and that's what we've been...
Does anyone have a good question?
Every caller wants to kiss this guy's ass.
It used to be, the point of college was to prepare our kids for the real world.
All we've done is create this generation of snowflakes.
And you know how we did it?
We started handing out awards just for showing up.
We've created a monster.
In fact, Louise, can I tell it like it is?
Why stop now?
Hey, Jake.
We're live.
What's going on?
I'm on my way up.
I have reason to believe Jason Moore died after being hazed by his teammates.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
And there's more.
This is why sports are so important.
Louise, check your pocket screen.
They're an anecdote to a culture of false achievements.
Win or lose, it is my job to toughen my players up.
Does that include hazing them?
I do...
I don't know what you're talking about.
Come on, Coach.
It's a well-known part of being on a sports team.
- You better be right about this.
- I've got a source.
Tell her that we know he authorized two of his players to haze Jason Moore.
- Who's your source?
- Just ask him if it's true.
Julia, I promise, it'll be good TV.
but not on your team?
Ask the coach if he authorized hazing by two of his players.
Is it true you authorized two of your players to haze Jason?
Nope.
No, that's...
That's not accurate.
Did you know about your football team's hazing culture?
Finn, get in here.
Okay, Louise, what you're talking about,
I wouldn't call hazing.
This is all in good fun, okay?
It's towel fights, hiding another guy's jock strap.
This is nothing like what happened to Jason.
A week before he died, did you pull two of your captains aside and tell them that the new freshmen were "too soft"
and they needed to toughen them up?
Look, that's not what I...
So, that's not what you meant, but isn't it possible that your players took your instructions a bit too far and they killed Jason Moore?
Dax Edwards killed Jason Moore.
Coach, you were trying to make your athletes better, tougher men.
Here's what I want to know...
Could this all be your fault?
Listen, if these idiots pushed it too far and they killed Jason, that is on them, not me!
Finally.
There you have it.
Thanks for telling it like it is.
We'll be right back.
And we're clear.
What did I tell you?
- Good TV.
- Good TV.
Where are you going?
Get my client out of jail.
Jake, that was quite a show tonight.
Ryder's coaching career is over.
I'm here to retrieve Dax Edwards.
Open up the gates.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid I can't do that.
Lozowski and Sanchez admitting to hitting Jason with their helmets.
Bruises on the body correspond with that kind of blunt object, but according to the coroner, the fatal head wound was caused by a sharp object, probably a rock.
That could've happened while they were tackling him.
Yeah, maybe, but they said they left Jason at 12:30, and we have security footage of them downing chili dogs at Tommy's 15 minutes later.
So what?
Jason's phone records just came in.
There's a call from his cellphone at 1:07.
Jason called Dax.
Look, we're charging the football players with felony hazing, but your guy looks good for the murder.
My heart's still racing from the show.
After all this time, I still get that buzz.
We took down an obnoxious bully.
We earned dessert.
I think I'll pass.
Trust me.
You're gonna want it.
Flaming cherries jubilee.
Here you are, Miss Louise.
Thank you, Marco.
Just leave the whiskey and the lighter.
Of course.
What's this?
All your sad Eric crap.
It's time to purge.
You went in my office?
In my drawers?
I did.
Because I'm a good friend.
I thought he was the one.
I know, hon, but he wasn't.
Now...
I know it's a bit cliche, but it works.
To letting go.
I don't understand.
The football players admitted to beating the crap out of Jason.
Yeah, but I checked the timeline, Ella.
Detective Matthews is right.
Jake, the court order against Tell Me a Secret just came through.
Tell me they'll comply.
We need that name.
When I showed the kid the court order, he panicked.
Said if his users found out that their secrets weren't actually anonymous, they'd ditch his app and he'd wind up like Friendster.
So I agreed to tear up the order if he gave us what we wanted.
You know who accused Dax?
I never could keep a secret.
That's crazy.
Why would I accuse my best friend of murder?
That's a good question.
You want to answer, or should I?
Finn?
Jason did get hazed that night, but when the football players left, he was still alive.
And he had to find a way home.
So who did he call?
He called his old friends Dax and Finn.
In fact, he called the landline here, and records show that that call was answered.
FiFinn was the only one home.
Mm-hmm.
You drove out to pick him up.
Isn't that right?
What happened when you got there?
He was a mess...
Drunk, bleeding.
He said those football players kicked his ass.
I thought for sure he was gonna quit the team, but he was happy...
Happy they beat the crap out of him.
He said it was a tradition, that he finally felt a part of something... that he had real friends.
Real friends.
That would've pissed me off, too.
I couldn't believe it.
I drove out there in the middle of the night.
I was his friend.
I told him that he was being a jerk, and he laughed at me.
Said that I was a loser.
Then he tried to get in my car.
Finn, what did you do?
I was angry.
And I just...
I picked up a rock, and I threw it at him.
I swear I didn't mean to kill him.
I just...
I hit him in the head, and he dropped.
Oh, God.
You blamed it on Dax.
Why?
Because I knew everyone would believe it.
Hey.
Got your text.
What are we doing here?
I felt bad I had to cut our date short.
Well, I like your way of apologizing.
Are we paying by the hour?
I live here.
In a motel?
You know how I told you I was homeschooled?
Mm-hmm.
Well, truth is, we never really had a home.
It was always just my mom and I, on the move, skipping out on rents, dodging my mom's crazy ex-boyfriends.
So, when I passed the Bar and started working,
I got an apartment like you're supposed to.
But I could never bring myself to buy furniture.
It just felt so permanent.
It never felt like home, and this did, so I moved in, and that was three years ago.
Three years?
You're the only one I've ever told.
Why me?
Because you could've told Julia about the football players, and you didn't.
And I trust you.
Mm.
Hey, you seem like someone who likes to take things slow.
Take off your clothes.
Hey, boss.
How was dinner?
It was, um... cathartic.
Can I have the overtime spreadsheets?
There's a budget meeting in the morning.
Mm-hmm.
_
This message is for Julia George.
You think I wanted to hurt Oscar?
I just wanted to protect him.
Sarah was bad for him, and I was the only one who could see it.
I only wanted him to be happy.
But you and Jake Gregorian...
You twisted everything.
You made me the enemy.
If you want the truth, come and get it.
You got the story all wrong.
Here you go.
Can you get me Levi Young's address?
Yeah, of course.
Text it to me.
I'll be in the car.
Levi?
What took you so long?
You said I got the story wrong.
I sent those photos so Oscar would know the truth.
Why didn't you just tell him the truth?
And tell him I've been watching over him... taking pictures?
That makes me look crazy.
But Oscar needed to know Jake couldn't be trusted, that Sarah would've used the abuse against him.
I got ahead of that.
For him.
But you also sent me a photo of Oscar cheating on Sarah.
How does that help him?
You wanted to make sure Sarah never took Oscar back.
You have feelings for him.
What?
Most of the photos...
They're of the two of you.
Oscar said he could talk to SweetVicki about all areas of his life.
By pretending to be her, you could have the relationship with him you always wanted.
You're in love with him.
That's crazy.
I know what it's like to have all your hopes and dreams wrapped up in one person and realize there's no future with them.
Trust me.
I...
I understand.
But Oscar never would.
He might not, but at least you could let him know you never intended to hurt him.
I would never hurt him.
I would never hurt Sarah.
I'm not that kind of person.
I believe you.
I got the story wrong.
Yeah.
But you have the chance to set it right.
Please put down the gun.
Tell Oscar I'm sorry.
Okay.
Previously on "Notorious"...
She's dead.
I have orders to arrest your client for the murder of Sarah Keaton.
That's Levi Young.
Why would he send me photos incriminating his best friend?
You sent me those photos for a reason.
I sent you three photos.
The third one was Sarah in bed with your friend Jake Gregorian.
If you run a story about me,
I'll take a copy of that photo to one of your competitors.
You're hacking into his home computer?
You're committing a crime.
How else am I supposed to help my boss?
That's SweetVicki.
You found her?
You've been texting with Levi Young.
He was pretending to be SweetVicki.
Tomorrow, LHL, an exclusive.
With who?
Oscar Keaton, the prison interview.
Look straight into the camera.
The viewers need to see
- you have nothing to hide.
- Understood.
And, remember, this interview is about Levi.
Louise will try and bait you into talking about Sarah and the murder.
Steer her away.
Man: 20 seconds.
If you start to sweat, look at that monitor, and dab your forehead when no one's watching.
Thank you.
10 seconds out.
Julia:
Louise, let's start with questions about Levi and then pivot to the murder.
I want to get Oscar on the record about Sarah.
Copy that.
And in 3, 2...
Good evening.
We have an exclusive interview with Internet mogul Oscar Keaton, who is awaiting trial for the murder of his wife.
For several months prior to his arrest,
Keaton was having a cyber-affair with a person he only knew as "SweetVicki."
But in a shocking twist, he's learned that SweetVicki was none other than his own business partner, Levi Young.
We go live now to the L.A. County Jail for Mr. Keaton's reaction.
Welcome, Mr. Keaton.
You and Levi Young have been best friends since you were 8 years old, and the two of you started your company in the basement of his mother's house.
That's right, Louise.
So tell me, why on earth would he do this to you?
It's clear the man's trying to destroy me.
I've never trusted anyone so much in my entire life, and he betrayed me.
Levi is a genius when it comes to writing code, but I was the face of the company, and I...
I think he resented that.
Ask about the affair.
Cue the photo.
A few days ago, LHL received a photo of you with another woman.
Do you have a comment?
It happened once.
The important thing is that Sarah forgave me.
Was this one time before or after you beat her?
Cue photo 2.
From these photos, it look like you cheated on your wife, and when she confronted you, you got violent.
I'm deeply ashamed.
I've made my share of mistakes in my life.
Trusting Levi was one of them.
First, we were just sending pictures back and forth.
But then, I started sharing things with her....him, things I should've kept private.
I can only assume Levi planned on using that information against me with the Board of Directors.
Now that I'm in jail, Levi has a lot to gain.
Hold on.
Are you suggesting
Levi killed Sarah and framed you?
I just know that I didn't kill my wife.
Now I'm asking the L.A.P.D. to keep looking...
Hey, something just came in on the scanner.
A jogger found a body by the Sepulveda Dam.
It's the missing football player Jason Moore.
I'm confident they'll find the answers
- they're looking for.
- Wrap.
Tease Jason Moore.
Toss to a break.
Mr. Keaton, thank you for being on our show tonight.
Thank you, Louise.
We'll take a break, and when we return, a development in the case of Jason Moore, missing since Friday.
How many times are they gonna run those damn photos?
They're out there, and now, you've addressed them.
You stayed on point, you made it about Levi.
You did well.
I trusted that man with my life.
[Handcuffs click]
[Door closes]
And we're back in 3, 2...
Welcome back.
We have an update on the case of Jason Moore, the 19-year-old California University football player.
Sadly, his body was discovered near the Sepulveda Dam in the San Fernando Valley.
Our sources are telling us that he'd been severely beaten.
Jason grew up in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Van Nuys and received a full football scholarship to nearby California University.
Unfortunately, he would only play for the Falcons as a freshman.
He died at 19.
Under the leadership of Coach Phil Ryder, the CU Falcons have won three consecutive post-season bowl games, including last season's...

His poor mom.

Chloe, they're saying your brother killed Jason.
What?
!
That's crazy!
Who's saying that?
Like, everyone.
Dax, talk to me, please.
The kids on that stupid app don't know that you and Jason were friends.
There's no way the police will take them seriously.
I'm just going for a drive, okay?
I need to clear my head.
I'll go with you.
No!
I want to be alone.

We'll be right back with further details on this devastating turn of events.
Ella:
I'm sorry, but Jake isn't in yet, and unless you have an appointment...
I am not leaving until I talk with him.
It's all right, Ella.
We're fine.
What do you want?
I saw Oscar's interview.
He has it all wrong.
I went to see him in jail, but they told me you took me off the visitor list.
Oscar doesn't want to see you right now.
I just need to talk to him.
I can explain myself.
He's my friend.
I think your friendship ended when you started catfishing him, Levi.
Oh, but apparently, you can sleep with his wife and still be his lawyer.
Yeah.
I took the photo.
I know the truth.
Were you hiding in the bushes, you pervert?
I was looking out for Oscar!
You know what?
Get out!
Never come back here again!
What?
Uh, I'm sorry.
Can I help you?
I'm Chloe Edwards.
This is my friend Finn.
You went to Van Nuys High School with my mom, Brenda Wilcox.
Brenda?
Yeah, of course.
Uh, she was a good friend.
What can I do for you?
You know that Cal U football player that was killed?
Mm-hmm.
Jason Moore.
Yeah.
I saw him rush for 250 yards against Monroe his senior year.
Last night, my brothe was arrested for his murder.
He didn't do it.
We need your help.
Okay.
So, I talked with my contact at L.A.P.D., and your brother was pulled over at 2:00 A.M.
They brought him in on a bench warrant, which means that Dax has been arrested before.
Last year, he was caught selling pot.
Well, apparently, he skipped a court date.
So, that's all this is about.
No.
They're using the warrant to hold him while they gather evidence on the homicide.
My brother would never hurt anyone.
Why do the cops think he would?
Because of that app, Tell Me a Secret.
It's this anonymous chat room where everyone in that room is physically located within the same square mile.
Someone in the chat room wrote that Dax was the killer.
Then everyone else piled on.
How well did Dax know Jason?
We were all best friends since were 10... me, Dax and Jason.
And then, junior year, Jason grew like a foot, starting working out.
Next thing we know, he was playing varsity football.
Me and Dax barely graduated high school, and Jason got a full ride to college.
Must have been hard getting left behind.
Are you kidding?
Football was Jason's way out.
We were happy for him.
After high school, Finn moved in with Dax and me.
Were either of you with your brother the night Jason went missing?
No.
I was working graveyard at the Blue Door Diner.
And I was home, but Dax wasn't with me.
Where's your mom now?
She lives at Gateways.
She had a breakdown about five years ago, diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic.
That's when my dad took off.
I've been Dax's legal guardian ever since.
Chloe, I'm sorry.
I had no idea.
Mom showed up at Dax's school when he was 13.
She was hysterical, running up and down the hallways, shouting his name.
Kids were cruel.
They said it was just a matter of time before he snapped like she did.
He's a good person.
He just uses the psycho image to keep people at a distance.
Well, I'll down to lockup, and we'll get started.
Okay.
Um, you should know Dax doesn't trust people.
[Scoffs] It's okay.
Neither do I.
[Door opens]
No, it's not okay.
It's the third time he's done this to us.
Oh, I get it.
He's a busy man, and his word is crap.
- [Phone receiver clicks]
- Good morning.
I got your text, your voice mail, and your e-mail.
What's up?
I just wanted to say, again, I am really sorry for springing that video on you.
I keep thinking about it, and...
Stop.
I got to vent.
You heard me out.
We're good.
Now, who just peed in your Cheerios?
The former Vice President.
He's dropping us to go golfing at Pebble Beach, and I have to come up with a whole new show.
You live for that drama.
Tell me what's really going on.
It's Eric.
Tomorrow would've been our one-year anniversary.
I keep thinking I'm over him, and then I get a whiff of his cologne on my blanket, and I...
You miss him.
I miss what I thought we had.
And he's probably off celebrating his freedom with some stripper.
- It's not the worst idea.
- [Laughs]
Hey, that cute new cameraman has some attractive friends.
Trust me.
Below the line will blow your mind.
Thank you.
I'll remember that.
Any time.
[Door opens, closes]
Dax, my name is Jake Gregorian.
I'm your lawyer.
All right.
Do you know why you're here?
For selling pot.
Right, for selling pot.
Now, let's talk about why you're really here.
You were arrested going south on the 5.
Innocent men don't run.
You fit the profile, you're a loner, you sell drugs.
Yeah.
People think I'm a freak.
Doesn't mean I killed him.
[Sighs]
You know, I grew up just a few blocks from you.
Went to Van Nuys High.
I did fine, academically, except for math.
I sucked at math.
I was about to fail calculus when somebody helped me.
Your mom.
She was brilliant, Dax.
She had all these little memory games...
Lo-di-hi minus hi-di-lo.
All over lo squared.
Yep.
Hard to forget, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[Sighs]
Dax, your mom saved my ass, and now, it's my turn to save yours.
But you got to talk to me, man.
Good.
All right.
Let's start with the night Jason went missing.
Where were you?
[Chuckles]
Where I am every Friday...
Trolling campus selling weed to douchebag college kids.
[Laughs]
All right.
Not the most sympathetic alibi, but I can work with that.
Uh, I'll be back.
In the meantime, do not talk to anyone, okay?
Hey, Jake.
I heard you were representing Dax Edwards in the Jason Moore homicide.
Homicide?
As of now, Dax is only here for skipping a court date.
Well, homicide charges are being filed.
Forensics found strands of the victim's hair in your client's car.
So what?
Dax and Jason are friends.
Jason's probably been in his car a bunch of times.
All you guys have, Ken, is a bunch of anonymous online chatter and no motive.
It's murder one, Jake.
You think we'd make an arrest without a motive?
Thank you all for being here today.
My name is Phil Ryder.
Jason's mom, Tina, has asked me to say a few words as his coach.
Did you hear they made an arrest?
Isn't that the guy who used to do those underwear commercials?
Yeah, after he won two rings with Dallas.
He had a gift.
I've never seen so much raw talent.
Who knows how far Jason could've gone...
The Heisman, the NFL?
Now we're hearing that Dax Edwards has been arrested.
Let me make one thing clear...
Dax Edwards is a low-life drug dealer.
I caught this kid trying to sell his crap to my players a couple months ago.
And, believe me, I put a end to that quick.
I'm sorry.
This is not about that piece of garbage.
This, here, today is about Jason Moore... whose short, but brilliant life we are here to mourn.
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey.
Are you watching the press conference?
Why don't they just go ahead and hang my client right there in the quad?
You're representing Dax Edwards?
Yes, I am, and I want to put his sister on your show tonight, get out our side of the story.
[Whispers] Find out everything you can about Dax Edwards.
- We got his sister for tonight.
- Okay.
I don't know.
I've got the Vice President tonight, but I guess I could push him for you.
Mm-hmm.
Canceled on you again?
I'll see you tonight.
Her son's passion for the game.
We're gonna move forward with the pep rally tomorrow.
In the meantime, my heart goes out to his family.
Nothing can bring Jason back, but I made a promise to his mother that
I will not rest until justice is served.
Well, your paperwork's in order.
Congratulations.
You take care of yourself, now.
That's the plan.
So, you want me to confirm that our client was selling drugs?
Well, I'd rather Dax go down for selling pot than murder.
Good point.
I'll head to the campus and see if I can find support for his alibi.
Keep me posted.
Good news.
I tracked down the kid who created
Tell Me a Secret.
- [Yawns] Kid?
- Mm-hmm.
He's 21, started the app as a freshman at Princeton.
Now works from his home in Beverly Hills.
Yeah, we need to get the name of the user who started the rumor about Dax.
Yeah.
Don't worry.
If the kid resists,
I'll put the fear of God in him.
[Elevator dings]
Hey.
What are you doing here?
I'm looking for a good lawyer.
See, I hacked into a computer network the other night with the help of a very beautiful accomplice.
Uh, that was a felony, and I had nothing to do with that.
[Laughs]
Why are you really here?
Louise sent me to get her favorite Chardonnay from some vineyard in Montesito.
Turns out they have it at the convenience store right around the corner.
Anyway, I was wondering if we could get together again sometime.
Are you asking me out?
I was thinking we could... hang.
I'm free tomorrow, as long as you stick to misdemeanors.
Deal.
I'll pick you up.
Where do you live?
Let's just meet here.
Okay.
And, we're not 12.
It's not a "hang." It's a date.
Mr. Gregorian, I'm glad you're here.
I'm so nervous.
Call me Jake.
Take a deep breath.
It's just two people having a conversation.
Chloe, we're two minutes to air.
Are you good?
Yeah, I guess.
You're gonna be fine.
You know your brother better than anyone in the world.
It's the reason why Louise is talking to you.
Okay.
Megan, what is he doing here?
Julia didn't tell you?
Can you change it to "Coach Phil Ryder"?
I want to give him his title.
You're not putting the coach on.
Excuse me?
Chloe's not going on TV with a guy that hates her brother.
You can't tell me who to book as a guest on this show.
You know what?
You're right.
I think we're out.
If you back out, it'll look like she has something to hide.
I don't care.
It's too risky.
Chloe:
I'm doing it.
I heard what that coach said about Dax.
He doesn't get to do that.
Not without a fight from me.
A lot of things have been said about your brother, both on the news and online.
But, tell us about the Dax you know.
He's just a sweet kid.
He plays his guitar and writes songs.
When Dax was 14, he read a 300-page service manual so he could repair my old car by himself.
People are saying he's guilty.
Dax has always been different.
And, honestly, it's easy to say things on the Internet when you can be anonymous.
You think he's innocent?
I know he is.
Coach Ryder, you've been critical of Dax Edwards.
That's true.
Okay, but look, I can't fault this young woman for believing in her brother.
I mean, you did the best you could.
What's that supposed to mean?
Come on.
Your mom went nuts, your dad split.
You got stuck with a problem child.
You don't know anything about me or my family.
Hey, look, I'm just trying to be nice.
No.
You're a bully, just like all those people who are saying things about my brother online.
Maybe we should take a quick break.
No, Louise, hold your horses.
I want to respond to that.
Go ahead.
The reason people are saying things online, is because our whole damn culture has gotten so PC, nobody will say it in person.
But, okay, fine, you want to take the gloves off?
I will tell it like it is.
Dax Edwards is a cold-blooded killer.
- That is not...
- Ben, cue up the recording.
What recording?
Louise, read your pocket screen.
You don't know what you're talking about!
My brother is not a murderer.
We have a development in the case.
The L.A.P.D. has released a recording of a voicemail Dax left Jason six weeks before he was murdered.
We're gonna play it now.
Dax:
Hey, douchebag, Chloe just old me what happened.
I don't know who you think you are now, but stay the hell away from my sister!
That is your brother's voice, right?
Yes, but it's not what it sounds like.
Did you have a sexual relationship with Jason Moore?
What?
!
Of course not!
Go to commercial.
Please.
She's an adult.
Let her answer the question.
Why is your brother threatening the victim to stay away from you?
I'm sorry.
I-I can't do this.
[Door closes]
You know how they say crazy runs in the family.
With these people, it's running a 4-minute mile.
We'll be right back.
What the hell is wrong with you today?
You blindsided her, you blindsided me.
I'm doing my job.
Chloe is not a celebrity, Julia.
She's not a criminal.
She is a young lady who's trying to help her little brother.
I don't think it would've hurt you or your show to, I don't know, maybe give us a head's up.
Thanks.
[Door opens, closes]
Chloe!
Chloe, wait!
Chloe!
Jake, I saw the show.
Chloe okay?
I'm not sure.
Can't find her.
She's not answering her phone.
You know how she said she had an alibi?
Yeah, she was working at a diner.
Well, I talked to her manager.
They laid her off six months ago.
So, she lied, and she won't answer questions about Jason.
What else is she hiding?
Man:
Ready?
[Carousel music playing]
How'd you know she'd be here?
When we were kids, Dax and Chloe's mom used to take us to this park.
We still hang out here sometimes.
Hi, Chloe.
What are you doing here?
I know you haven't worked at the diner for months.
Why'd you lie to me?
I got fired from my job.
I'm looking for something that pays enough to cover rent, but, in the meantime, I've been dancing at a... club.
I was there all night.
You can ask any of the other girls.
Why didn't you tell me?
My mom's mental, my brother sells drugs, and I work at a strip club.
It's not a pretty picture.
What about that voicemail?
Your brother sounded pretty angry.
Jason has always had a crush on me.
One night, he came to the club with a bunch of his football buddies.
They were drunk.
He wanted a lap dance, and I said no.
He got angry, got physical, and a bouncer tossed him out.
When I went home, I told Dax, and that's when he made that call, but it blew over.
- [Cellphone rings]
- Sorry.
Yeah?
Yeah, okay.
Thanks.
Chloe, your brother got in a fight.
He's in the jail infirmary.
Oh, God.
Come on.
I'll drive you.
All right.
Levi.
Over here, Levi.
How you doing, SweetVicki?
Get out.
Levi, did you kill Sarah Keaton?
Huh?
Levi's getting a lot of attention.
Uh, Levi is a creep who betrayed his best friend.
Did you visit Dax?
Is he okay?
Broken rib, black eye.
We got to get him out of lockup.
Any luck corroborating his alibi?
No.
I went all over campus, but nobody wants to admit to buying drugs.
I guess that shouldn't surprise me.
The thing is, they don't want to talk about Jason, either.
They've totally closed ranks.
Yeah, but they're all too happy to gossip about it on Tell Me a Secret.
You're right.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking I need to figure out a way to use this app to our advantage.
Good.
[Cellphone vibrates]
Hey.
I was just getting ready for our date.
Change of plans.
Instead of dinner, how do you feel about an afternoon stakeout?
Hey.
How'd it go with the app creator?
Uh, I threatened the kid with a defamation lawsuit, but the little cockroach called my bluff.
He won't give us the name of the user who started the thread and named Dax as the killer.
There must be some way to force his hand.
Well, the only precedent is eminent threat.
Then a judge could issue an order and make him give us the user's identity.
And Dax is facing the death penalty.
You're right, and I've been on the phone with every federal judge we know.
So far, no luck.
There may be one other federal judge who might help us.
Does he owe you a favor?
No, not me.
Forget it, Jake.
I can't even believe you're asking me.
Would you just hear me out?
Eric cheated on me.
I'm not asking him for a favor.
You know what?
You are right.
I hate him for what he did.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked.
[Sighs]
As long as you're here, I should tell you that the network wants the coach back on for an hour tonight.
You have got to be kidding me!
I think the guy's an arrogant jerk, but America loves him.
He's trending on Twitter.
#CoachTellsltLikeltls
Do me a favor, and just try to keep it balanced.
What is your thing with this kid?
We grew up in the same neighborhood.
When I was in high school, we had a kid just like Dax.
He got picked on every day.
Let me guess.
His name was Jake Gregorian?
Nice try.
I'm not buying it.
That's not what I was saying.
Wait.
You were the bully?
Worse.
I was the guy that could've stopped the bully... but didn't.
I'm sorry I blindsided your client's sister.
You could make it up to her by helping her brother.
Fine.
Fine.
You'll talk to Eric?
Fine.
I'll think about it.
I know you.
That's a yes.
You really expect me to issue a court order when the First Amendment's at play?
I shouldn't have come.
[Sighs]
It'll be uploaded to the ECF by the end of the day.
How do I say no to you?
Today, of all days.
What do you mean?
Well, it would've been our one-year anniversary.
We were supposed to go to Medora for dinner.
- Right.
- You know, I don't think
I canceled that reservation.
We could still go.
We're not getting back together.
Oh, Julia.
Look, I know that what I did was unforgivable.
I'm in therapy now, and I know that it's gonna be a while before I'm healthy enough to be with you or anyone else.
But I want you in my life.
And maybe someday, you'll see that I'm a changed man.
So, what do you say?
Will you have dinner with me?
Just dinner.
[Marching band playing]
- [Cheering]
- Young man:
Let's get in!
- Thanks for coming.
- Are you kidding me?
French fries and a college pep rally... totally my jam.
- [Laughs]
- So, you like football?
A bunch of meatheads slamming into each other?
I'll pass.
Hey, I was once one of those meatheads in high school.
Oh, that explains a lot.
Hmm.
What were you?
Let me guess...
You were the hot mathlete?
I didn't have what you would call a normal high school experience.
What?
Were you, like, homeschooled or something?
[Laughs] Oh, my God.
You were.
That's hilarious.
This is exactly why I don't tell people.
They think it's weird.
I think it's cool.
I mean, I went to an expensive private school, and now, I'm running errands for a living.
You got homeschooled, and you're a successful lawyer.
You tell me what's weird.
Thanks.
Okay.
So, it looks like everyone's inside.
We've got the bulk of the student body in one place.
Let's tell them a secret.
Hmm.
Did it come through?
[Cellphone beeps]
"Dax Edwards was just released from custody because the cops have identified the real killer.
They're on their way to the pep rally to make an arrest."
Homeschooled or not, you're a genius.
Let's go.
[Engine revs, tires squeal]
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What the hell?
!
We need to talk.
Move, lady!
We're in a hurry.
I'm an attorney, and if you know something about Jason Moore, it's in your best interest to come clean.
We don't know anything about anything.
Dude, we know exactly what happened.
Either you talk to us, or we call the cops.
Up to you.
Okay, fine, then.
Wait!
We didn't mean to kill Jason.
We swear.
Thank you for helping me, but I need you to keep this between us.
Are you kidding?
You know I've been looking for a way to make my bones with Julia.
[Chuckling] Fine.
I'll keep my mouth shut.
That look is very effective.
I'll call you.
We saw Jason coming out of a frat party.
He was drunk off his ass.
We decided to have a little fun with him.
We tied a T-shirt around his eyes, like a blindfold.
Then we threw him in my trunk and drove him to the dam.
Fun.
Then what happened?
If we didn't intend to kill him...
I mean, if it was an accident...
You could still be looking at murder charges.
I can't represent you, but if you tell us everything,
I promise I'll get you the best possible defense.
You have my word.
I had my old helmet.
We put it on and took turns tackling him like a practice dummy.
What did you have against Jason?
Nothing.
He was a solid freshman.
They were hazing him.
Isn't that right?
Only it went too far, and when you realized you'd killed him, you took off.
He was alive when we left.
That's how it works.
The freshmen take their licks, and then they find their own way home.
They did it to me, they did it to him.
It's a tradition.
Louise:
Welcome back.
We've been taking your calls tonight on LHL.
Once again, our guest is Coach Phil Ryder, the man who insists he's telling it like it is.
[Chuckles]
Lenny, from Amarillo, you're on.
Lenny:
Coach, I was at that game against Cleveland in '94 when you had three touchdowns.
Unbelievable.
What's your question, Lenny?
Hey, you ever think about running for office?
I would sure vote for you.
Well, never say never, right, Lenny?
[Chuckles]
I'm serious.
America needs a leader like you.
You're a straight talker, and that's what we've been...
Does anyone have a good question?
Every caller wants to kiss this guy's ass.
It used to be, the point of college was to prepare our kids for the real world.
All we've done is create this generation of snowflakes.
And you know how we did it?
We started handing out awards just for showing up.
We've created a monster.
In fact, Louise, can I tell it like it is?
Why stop now?
Hey, Jake.
We're live.
What's going on?
I'm on my way up.
I have reason to believe Jason Moore died after being hazed by his teammates.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
And there's more.
This is why sports are so important.
Louise, check your pocket screen.
They're an anecdote to a culture of false achievements.
Win or lose, it is my job to toughen my players up.
Does that include hazing them?
[Scoffs]
I do...
I don't know what you're talking about.
Come on, Coach.
It's a well-known part of being on a sports team.
- You better be right about this.
- I've got a source.
Tell her that we know he authorized two of his players to haze Jason Moore.
- Who's your source?
- Just ask him if it's true.
Julia, I promise, it'll be good TV.
Louise: but not on your team?
Ask the coach if he authorized hazing by two of his players.
Is it true you authorized two of your players to haze Jason?
Nope.
No, that's...
That's not accurate.
Did you know about your football team's hazing culture?
Finn, get in here.
Okay, Louise, what you're talking about,
I wouldn't call hazing.
This is all in good fun, okay?
It's towel fights, hiding another guy's jock strap.
This is nothing like what happened to Jason.
A week before he died, did you pull two of your captains aside and tell them that the new freshmen were "too soft"
and they needed to toughen them up?
[Sighs]
Look, that's not what I...
So, that's not what you meant, but isn't it possible that your players took your instructions a bit too far and they killed Jason Moore?
Dax Edwards killed Jason Moore.
Coach, you were trying to make your athletes better, tougher men.
Here's what I want to know...
Could this all be your fault?
Listen, if these idiots pushed it too far and they killed Jason, that is on them, not me!
Finally.
There you have it.
Thanks for telling it like it is.
We'll be right back.
Man:
And we're clear.
What did I tell you?
- Good TV.
- Good TV.
Where are you going?
[Exhales deeply] Get my client out of jail.
[Siren wailing]
Jake, that was quite a show tonight.
Ryder's coaching career is over.
I'm here to retrieve Dax Edwards.
Open up the gates.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid I can't do that.
Lozowski and Sanchez admitting to hitting Jason with their helmets.
Bruises on the body correspond with that kind of blunt object, but according to the coroner, the fatal head wound was caused by a sharp object, probably a rock.
That could've happened while they were tackling him.
Yeah, maybe, but they said they left Jason at 12:30, and we have security footage of them downing chili dogs at Tommy's 15 minutes later.
So what?
[Sighs] Jason's phone records just came in.
There's a call from his cellphone at 1:07.
Jason called Dax.
Look, we're charging the football players with felony hazing, but your guy looks good for the murder.
Julia:
My heart's still racing from the show.
After all this time, I still get that buzz.
We took down an obnoxious bully.
We earned dessert.
I think I'll pass.
Trust me.
You're gonna want it.
Flaming cherries jubilee.
Here you are, Miss Louise.
Thank you, Marco.
Just leave the whiskey and the lighter.
Of course.
What's this?
All your sad Eric crap.
It's time to purge.
You went in my office?
In my drawers?
I did.
Because I'm a good friend.
I thought he was the one.
I know, hon, but he wasn't.
Now...
[Chuckles]
I know it's a bit cliche, but it works.
To letting go.
[Sighs]
I don't understand.
The football players admitted to beating the crap out of Jason.
Yeah, but I checked the timeline, Ella.
Detective Matthews is right.
Jake, the court order against Tell Me a Secret just came through.
Tell me they'll comply.
We need that name.
When I showed the kid the court order, he panicked.
Said if his users found out that their secrets weren't actually anonymous, they'd ditch his app and he'd wind up like Friendster.
So I agreed to tear up the order if he gave us what we wanted.
You know who accused Dax?
I never could keep a secret.
That's crazy.
Why would I accuse my best friend of murder?
That's a good question.
You want to answer, or should I?
Finn?
Jason did get hazed that night, but when the football players left, he was still alive.
And he had to find a way home.
So who did he call?
He called his old friends Dax and Finn.
In fact, he called the landline here, and records show that that call was answered.
FiFinn was the only one home.
Mm-hmm.
You drove out to pick him up.
Isn't that right?
What happened when you got there?
He was a mess...
Drunk, bleeding.
He said those football players kicked his ass.
I thought for sure he was gonna quit the team, but he was happy...
Happy they beat the crap out of him.
He said it was a tradition, that he finally felt a part of something... that he had real friends.
Real friends.
That would've pissed me off, too.
I couldn't believe it.
I drove out there in the middle of the night.
I was his friend.
I told him that he was being a jerk, and he laughed at me.
Said that I was a loser.
Then he tried to get in my car.
Finn, what did you do?
I was angry.
And I just...
I picked up a rock, and I threw it at him.
I swear I didn't mean to kill him.
I just...
I hit him in the head, and he dropped.
Oh, God.
You blamed it on Dax.
Why?
Because I knew everyone would believe it.
Hey.
Got your text.
What are we doing here?
I felt bad I had to cut our date short.
Well, I like your way of apologizing.
Are we paying by the hour?
I live here.
In a motel?
You know how I told you I was homeschooled?
Mm-hmm.
Well, truth is, we never really had a home.
It was always just my mom and I, on the move, skipping out on rents, dodging my mom's crazy ex-boyfriends.
So, when I passed the Bar and started working,
I got an apartment like you're supposed to.
But I could never bring myself to buy furniture.
It just felt so permanent.
It never felt like home, and this did, so I moved in, and that was three years ago.
Three years?
You're the only one I've ever told.
Why me?
[Chuckles]
Because you could've told Julia about the football players, and you didn't.
And I trust you.

[Indistinct talking]
Hey, boss.
How was dinner?
It was, um... cathartic.
Can I have the overtime spreadsheets?
There's a budget meeting in the morning.
Mm-hmm.
_
This message is for Julia George.
You think I wanted to hurt Oscar?
I just wanted to protect him.
[Scoffs] Sarah was bad for him, and I was the only one who could see it.
I only wanted him to be happy.
But you and Jake Gregorian...
You twisted everything.
You made me the enemy.
If you want the truth, come and get it.
You got the story all wrong.
Here you go.
Can you get me Levi Young's address?
Yeah, of course.
Text it to me.
I'll be in the car.
[Insects chirping]
Levi?
What took you so long?
You said I got the story wrong.
I sent those photos so Oscar would know the truth.
Why didn't you just tell him the truth?
And tell him I've been watching over him...
[Scoffs] taking pictures?
That makes me look crazy.
But Oscar needed to know Jake couldn't be trusted, that Sarah would've used the abuse against him.
I got ahead of that.
For him.
But you also sent me a photo of Oscar cheating on Sarah.
How does that help him?
You wanted to make sure Sarah never took Oscar back.
You have feelings for him.
What?
Most of the photos...
They're of the two of you.
Oscar said he could talk to SweetVicki about all areas of his life.
By pretending to be her, you could have the relationship with him you always wanted.
You're in love with him.
That's crazy.
I know what it's like to have all your hopes and dreams wrapped up in one person and realize there's no future with them.
- Trust me.
I...
I understand.
- [Exhales deeply]
But Oscar never would.
He might not, but at least you could let him know you never intended to hurt him.
I would never hurt him.
I would never hurt Sarah.
I'm not that kind of person.
I believe you.
I got the story wrong.
Yeah.
But you have the chance to set it right.
Please put down the gun.
Tell Oscar I'm sorry.
Okay.
[Gunshot]
Previously on "Notorious"...
She's dead.
I have orders to arrest your client for the murder of Sarah Keaton.
That's Levi Young.
Why would he send me photos incriminating his best friend?
You sent me those photos for a reason.
I sent you three photos.
The third one was Sarah in bed with your friend Jake Gregorian.
If you run a story about me,
I'll take a copy of that photo to one of your competitors.
You're hacking into his home computer?
You're committing a crime.
How else am I supposed to help my boss?
That's SweetVicki.
You found her?
You've been texting with Levi Young.
He was pretending to be SweetVicki.
Tomorrow, LHL, an exclusive.
With who?
Oscar Keaton, the prison interview.
Look straight into the camera.
The viewers need to see
- you have nothing to hide.
- Understood.
And, remember, this interview is about Levi.
Louise will try and bait you into talking about Sarah and the murder.
Steer her away.
20 seconds.
If you start to sweat, look at that monitor, and dab your forehead when no one's watching.
Thank you.
10 seconds out.
Louise, let's start with questions about Levi and then pivot to the murder.
I want to get Oscar on the record about Sarah.
Copy that.
And in 3, 2...
Good evening.
We have an exclusive interview with Internet mogul Oscar Keaton, who is awaiting trial for the murder of his wife.
For several months prior to his arrest,
Keaton was having a cyber-affair with a person he only knew as "SweetVicki."
But in a shocking twist, he's learned that SweetVicki was none other than his own business partner, Levi Young.
We go live now to the L.A. County Jail for Mr. Keaton's reaction.
Welcome, Mr. Keaton.
You and Levi Young have been best friends since you were 8 years old, and the two of you started your company in the basement of his mother's house.
That's right, Louise.
So tell me, why on earth would he do this to you?
It's clear the man's trying to destroy me.
I've never trusted anyone so much in my entire life, and he betrayed me.
Levi is a genius when it comes to writing code, but I was the face of the company, and I...
I think he resented that.
Ask about the affair.
Cue the photo.
A few days ago, LHL received a photo of you with another woman.
Do you have a comment?
It happened once.
The important thing is that Sarah forgave me.
Was this one time before or after you beat her?
Cue photo 2.
From these photos, it look like you cheated on your wife, and when she confronted you, you got violent.
I'm deeply ashamed.
I've made my share of mistakes in my life.
Trusting Levi was one of them.
First, we were just sending pictures back and forth.
But then, I started sharing things with her....him, things I should've kept private.
I can only assume Levi planned on using that information against me with the Board of Directors.
Now that I'm in jail, Levi has a lot to gain.
Hold on.
Are you suggesting
Levi killed Sarah and framed you?
I just know that I didn't kill my wife.
Now I'm asking the L.A.P.D. to keep looking...
Hey, something just came in on the scanner.
A jogger found a body by the Sepulveda Dam.
It's the missing football player Jason Moore.
I'm confident they'll find the answers
- they're looking for.
- Wrap.
Tease Jason Moore.
Toss to a break.
Mr. Keaton, thank you for being on our show tonight.
Thank you, Louise.
We'll take a break, and when we return, a development in the case of Jason Moore, missing since Friday.
How many times are they gonna run those damn photos?
They're out there, and now, you've addressed them.
You stayed on point, you made it about Levi.
You did well.
I trusted that man with my life.
And we're back in 3, 2...
Welcome back.
We have an update on the case of Jason Moore, the 19-year-old California University football player.
Sadly, his body was discovered near the Sepulveda Dam in the San Fernando Valley.
Our sources are telling us that he'd been severely beaten.
Jason grew up in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Van Nuys and received a full football scholarship to nearby California University.
Unfortunately, he would only play for the Falcons as a freshman.
He died at 19.
Under the leadership of Coach Phil Ryder, the CU Falcons have won three consecutive post-season bowl games, including last season's... but ultimately decided on California University... so he could stay close to his mother.
The police are treating Jason's death as a homicide, although it will be days before a coroner will officially rule on cause of death.
I can't believe he's really dead.
His poor mom.
...late Friday night, and never returned to his dorm.
His roommate called his mother the next day...
- God!
- What?
I...
I need to get out of here.
This is bad.
What's going on?
Chloe, they're saying your brother killed Jason.
What?
!
That's crazy!
Who's saying that?
Like, everyone.
Dax, talk to me, please.
The kids on that stupid app don't know that you and Jason were friends.
There's no way the police will take them seriously.
I'm just going for a drive, okay?
I need to clear my head.
I'll go with you.
No!
I want to be alone.
We'll be right back with further details on this devastating turn of events.
I'm sorry, but Jake isn't in yet, and unless you have an appointment...
I am not leaving until I talk with him.
It's all right, Ella.
We're fine.
What do you want?
I saw Oscar's interview.
He has it all wrong.
I went to see him in jail, but they told me you took me off the visitor list.
Oscar doesn't want to see you right now.
I just need to talk to him.
I can explain myself.
He's my friend.
I think your friendship ended when you started catfishing him, Levi.
But apparently, you can sleep with his wife and still be his lawyer.
Yeah.
I took the photo.
I know the truth.
Were you hiding in the bushes, you pervert?
I was looking out for Oscar!
You know what?
Get out!
Never come back here again!
What?
I'm sorry.
Can I help you?
I'm Chloe Edwards.
This is my friend Finn.
You went to Van Nuys High School with my mom, Brenda Wilcox.
Brenda?
Yeah, of course.
She was a good friend.
What can I do for you?
You know that Cal U football player that was killed?
Jason Moore.
Yeah.
I saw him rush for 250 yards against Monroe his senior year.
Last night, my brothe was arrested for his murder.
He didn't do it.
We need your help.
Okay.
So, I talked with my contact at L.A.P.D., and your brother was pulled over at 2:00 A.M.
They brought him in on a bench warrant, which means that Dax has been arrested before.
Last year, he was caught selling pot.
Well, apparently, he skipped a court date.
So, that's all this is about.
No.
They're using the warrant to hold him while they gather evidence on the homicide.
My brother would never hurt anyone.
Why do the cops think he would?
Because of that app, Tell Me a Secret.
It's this anonymous chat room where everyone in that room is physically located within the same square mile.
Someone in the chat room wrote that Dax was the killer.
Then everyone else piled on.
How well did Dax know Jason?
We were all best friends since were 10... me, Dax and Jason.
And then, junior year, Jason grew like a foot, starting working out.
Next thing we know, he was playing varsity football.
Me and Dax barely graduated high school, and Jason got a full ride to college.
Must have been hard getting left behind.
Are you kidding?
Football was Jason's way out.
We were happy for him.
After high school, Finn moved in with Dax and me.
Were either of you with your brother the night Jason went missing?
No.
I was working graveyard at the Blue Door Diner.
And I was home, but Dax wasn't with me.
Where's your mom now?
She lives at Gateways.
She had a breakdown about five years ago, diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic.
That's when my dad took off.
I've been Dax's legal guardian ever since.
Chloe, I'm sorry.
I had no idea.
Mom showed up at Dax's school when he was 13.
She was hysterical, running up and down the hallways, shouting his name.
Kids were cruel.
They said it was just a matter of time before he snapped like she did.
He's a good person.
He just uses the psycho image to keep people at a distance.
Well, I'll down to lockup, and we'll get started.
Okay.
Um, you should know Dax doesn't trust people.
It's okay.
Neither do I.
No, it's not okay.
It's the third time he's done this to us.
I get it.
He's a busy man, and his word is crap.
Good morning.
I got your text, your voice mail, and your e-mail.
What's up?
I just wanted to say, again, I am really sorry for springing that video on you.
I keep thinking about it, and...
Stop.
I got to vent.
You heard me out.
We're good.
Now, who just peed in your Cheerios?
The former Vice President.
He's dropping us to go golfing at Pebble Beach, and I have to come up with a whole new show.
You live for that drama.
Tell me what's really going on.
It's Eric.
Tomorrow would've been our one-year anniversary.
I keep thinking I'm over him, and then I get a whiff of his cologne on my blanket, and I...
You miss him.
I miss what I thought we had.
And he's probably off celebrating his freedom with some stripper.
It's not the worst idea.
Hey, that cute new cameraman has some attractive friends.
Trust me.
Below the line will blow your mind.
Thank you.
I'll remember that.
Any time.
Dax, my name is Jake Gregorian.
I'm your lawyer.
All right.
Do you know why you're here?
For selling pot.
Right, for selling pot.
Now, let's talk about why you're really here.
You were arrested going south on the 5.
Innocent men don't run.
You fit the profile, you're a loner, you sell drugs.
Yeah.
People think I'm a freak.
Doesn't mean I killed him.
You know, I grew up just a few blocks from you.
Went to Van Nuys High.
I did fine, academically, except for math.
I sucked at math.
I was about to fail calculus when somebody helped me.
Your mom.
She was brilliant, Dax.
She had all these little memory games...
Lo-di-hi minus hi-di-lo.
All over lo squared.
Yep.
Hard to forget, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Dax, your mom saved my ass, and now, it's my turn to save yours.
But you got to talk to me, man.
Good.
All right.
Let's start with the night Jason went missing.
Where were you?
Where I am every Friday...
Trolling campus selling weed to douchebag college kids.
All right.
Not the most sympathetic alibi, but I can work with that.
I'll be back.
In the meantime, do not talk to anyone, okay?
Hey, Jake.
I heard you were representing Dax Edwards in the Jason Moore homicide.
Homicide?
As of now, Dax is only here for skipping a court date.
Well, homicide charges are being filed.
Forensics found strands of the victim's hair in your client's car.
So what?
Dax and Jason are friends.
Jason's probably been in his car a bunch of times.
All you guys have, Ken, is a bunch of anonymous online chatter and no motive.
It's murder one, Jake.
You think we'd make an arrest without a motive?
Thank you all for being here today.
My name is Phil Ryder.
Jason's mom, Tina, has asked me to say a few words as his coach.
Did you hear they made an arrest?
Isn't that the guy who used to do those underwear commercials?
Yeah, after he won two rings with Dallas.
He had a gift.
I've never seen so much raw talent.
Who knows how far Jason could've gone...
The Heisman, the NFL?
Now we're hearing that Dax Edwards has been arrested.
Let me make one thing clear...
Dax Edwards is a low-life drug dealer.
I caught this kid trying to sell his crap to my players a couple months ago.
And, believe me, I put a end to that quick.
I'm sorry.
This is not about that piece of garbage.
This, here, today is about Jason Moore... whose short, but brilliant life we are here to mourn.
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey.
Are you watching the press conference?
Why don't they just go ahead and hang my client right there in the quad?
You're representing Dax Edwards?
Yes, I am, and I want to put his sister on your show tonight, get out our side of the story.
Find out everything you can about Dax Edwards.
- We got his sister for tonight.
- Okay.
I don't know.
I've got the Vice President tonight, but I guess I could push him for you.
Canceled on you again?
I'll see you tonight.
Her son's passion for the game.
We're gonna move forward with the pep rally tomorrow.
In the meantime, my heart goes out to his family.
Nothing can bring Jason back, but I made a promise to his mother that
I will not rest until justice is served.
Well, your paperwork's in order.
Congratulations.
You take care of yourself, now.
That's the plan.
So, you want me to confirm that our client was selling drugs?
Well, I'd rather Dax go down for selling pot than murder.
Good point.
I'll head to the campus and see if I can find support for his alibi.
Keep me posted.
Good news.
I tracked down the kid who created
Tell Me a Secret.
Kid?
He's 21, started the app as a freshman at Princeton.
Now works from his home in Beverly Hills.
Yeah, we need to get the name of the user who started the rumor about Dax.
Yeah.
Don't worry.
If the kid resists,
I'll put the fear of God in him.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
I'm looking for a good lawyer.
See, I hacked into a computer network the other night with the help of a very beautiful accomplice.
That was a felony, and I had nothing to do with that.
Why are you really here?
Louise sent me to get her favorite Chardonnay from some vineyard in Montesito.
Turns out they have it at the convenience store right around the corner.
Anyway, I was wondering if we could get together again sometime.
Are you asking me out?
I was thinking we could... hang.
I'm free tomorrow, as long as you stick to misdemeanors.
Deal.
I'll pick you up.
Where do you live?
Let's just meet here.
Okay.
And, we're not 12.
It's not a "hang." It's a date.
Mr. Gregorian, I'm glad you're here.
I'm so nervous.
Call me Jake.
Take a deep breath.
It's just two people having a conversation.
Chloe, we're two minutes to air.
Are you good?
Yeah, I guess.
You're gonna be fine.
You know your brother better than anyone in the world.
It's the reason why Louise is talking to you.
Okay.
Megan, what is he doing here?
Julia didn't tell you?
Can you change it to "Coach Phil Ryder"?
I want to give him his title.
You're not putting the coach on.
Excuse me?
Chloe's not going on TV with a guy that hates her brother.
You can't tell me who to book as a guest on this show.
You know what?
You're right.
I think we're out.
If you back out, it'll look like she has something to hide.
I don't care.
It's too risky.
I'm doing it.
I heard what that coach said about Dax.
He doesn't get to do that.
Not without a fight from me.
A lot of things have been said about your brother, both on the news and online.
But, tell us about the Dax you know.
He's just a sweet kid.
He plays his guitar and writes songs.
When Dax was 14, he read a 300-page service manual so he could repair my old car by himself.
People are saying he's guilty.
Dax has always been different.
And, honestly, it's easy to say things on the Internet when you can be anonymous.
You think he's innocent?
I know he is.
Coach Ryder, you've been critical of Dax Edwards.
That's true.
Okay, but look, I can't fault this young woman for believing in her brother.
I mean, you did the best you could.
What's that supposed to mean?
Come on.
Your mom went nuts, your dad split.
You got stuck with a problem child.
You don't know anything about me or my family.
Hey, look, I'm just trying to be nice.
No.
You're a bully, just like all those people who are saying things about my brother online.
Maybe we should take a quick break.
No, Louise, hold your horses.
I want to respond to that.
Go ahead.
The reason people are saying things online, is because our whole damn culture has gotten so PC, nobody will say it in person.
But, okay, fine, you want to take the gloves off?
I will tell it like it is.
Dax Edwards is a cold-blooded killer.
- That is not...
- Ben, cue up the recording.
What recording?
Louise, read your pocket screen.
You don't know what you're talking about!
My brother is not a murderer.
We have a development in the case.
The L.A.P.D. has released a recording of a voicemail Dax left Jason six weeks before he was murdered.
We're gonna play it now.
Hey, douchebag, Chloe just old me what happened.
I don't know who you think you are now, but stay the hell away from my sister!
That is your brother's voice, right?
Yes, but it's not what it sounds like.
Did you have a sexual relationship with Jason Moore?
What?
!
Of course not!
Go to commercial.
Please.
She's an adult.
Let her answer the question.
Why is your brother threatening the victim to stay away from you?
I'm sorry.
I-I can't do this.
You know how they say crazy runs in the family.
With these people, it's running a 4-minute mile.
We'll be right back.
What the hell is wrong with you today?
You blindsided her, you blindsided me.
I'm doing my job.
Chloe is not a celebrity, Julia.
She's not a criminal.
She is a young lady who's trying to help her little brother.
I don't think it would've hurt you or your show to, I don't know, maybe give us a head's up.
Thanks.
Chloe!
Chloe, wait!
Chloe!
Jake, I saw the show.
Chloe okay?
I'm not sure.
Can't find her.
She's not answering her phone.
You know how she said she had an alibi?
Yeah, she was working at a diner.
Well, I talked to her manager.
They laid her off six months ago.
So, she lied, and she won't answer questions about Jason.
What else is she hiding?
Ready?
How'd you know she'd be here?
When we were kids, Dax and Chloe's mom used to take us to this park.
We still hang out here sometimes.
Hi, Chloe.
What are you doing here?
I know you haven't worked at the diner for months.
Why'd you lie to me?
I got fired from my job.
I'm looking for something that pays enough to cover rent, but, in the meantime, I've been dancing at a... club.
I was there all night.
You can ask any of the other girls.
Why didn't you tell me?
My mom's mental, my brother sells drugs, and I work at a strip club.
It's not a pretty picture.
What about that voicemail?
Your brother sounded pretty angry.
Jason has always had a crush on me.
One night, he came to the club with a bunch of his football buddies.
They were drunk.
He wanted a lap dance, and I said no.
He got angry, got physical, and a bouncer tossed him out.
When I went home, I told Dax, and that's when he made that call, but it blew over.
Sorry.
Yeah?
Yeah, okay.
Thanks.
Chloe, your brother got in a fight.
He's in the jail infirmary.
God.
Come on.
I'll drive you.
All right.
Levi.
Over here, Levi.
How you doing, SweetVicki?
Get out.
Levi, did you kill Sarah Keaton?
Levi's getting a lot of attention.
Levi is a creep who betrayed his best friend.
Did you visit Dax?
Is he okay?
Broken rib, black eye.
We got to get him out of lockup.
Any luck corroborating his alibi?
No.
I went all over campus, but nobody wants to admit to buying drugs.
I guess that shouldn't surprise me.
The thing is, they don't want to talk about Jason, either.
They've totally closed ranks.
Yeah, but they're all too happy to gossip about it on Tell Me a Secret.
You're right.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking I need to figure out a way to use this app to our advantage.
Good.
Hey.
I was just getting ready for our date.
Change of plans.
Instead of dinner, how do you feel about an afternoon stakeout?
Hey.
How'd it go with the app creator?
I threatened the kid with a defamation lawsuit, but the little cockroach called my bluff.
He won't give us the name of the user who started the thread and named Dax as the killer.
There must be some way to force his hand.
Well, the only precedent is eminent threat.
Then a judge could issue an order and make him give us the user's identity.
And Dax is facing the death penalty.
You're right, and I've been on the phone with every federal judge we know.
So far, no luck.
There may be one other federal judge who might help us.
Does he owe you a favor?
No, not me.
Forget it, Jake.
I can't even believe you're asking me.
Would you just hear me out?
Eric cheated on me.
I'm not asking him for a favor.
You know what?
You are right.
I hate him for what he did.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked.
As long as you're here, I should tell you that the network wants the coach back on for an hour tonight.
You have got to be kidding me!
I think the guy's an arrogant jerk, but America loves him.
He's trending on Twitter.
#CoachTellsltLikeltls
Do me a favor, and just try to keep it balanced.
What is your thing with this kid?
We grew up in the same neighborhood.
When I was in high school, we had a kid just like Dax.
He got picked on every day.
Let me guess.
His name was Jake Gregorian?
Nice try.
I'm not buying it.
That's not what I was saying.
Wait.
You were the bully?
Worse.
I was the guy that could've stopped the bully... but didn't.
I'm sorry I blindsided your client's sister.
You could make it up to her by helping her brother.
Fine.
Fine.
You'll talk to Eric?
Fine.
I'll think about it.
I know you.
That's a yes.
You really expect me to issue a court order when the First Amendment's at play?
I shouldn't have come.
It'll be uploaded to the ECF by the end of the day.
How do I say no to you?
Today, of all days.
What do you mean?
Well, it would've been our one-year anniversary.
We were supposed to go to Medora for dinner.
- Right.
- You know, I don't think
I canceled that reservation.
We could still go.
We're not getting back together.
Julia.
Look, I know that what I did was unforgivable.
I'm in therapy now, and I know that it's gonna be a while before I'm healthy enough to be with you or anyone else.
But I want you in my life.
And maybe someday, you'll see that I'm a changed man.
So, what do you say?
Will you have dinner with me?
Just dinner.
Let's get in!
- Thanks for coming.
- Are you kidding me?
French fries and a college pep rally... totally my jam.
So, you like football?
A bunch of meatheads slamming into each other?
I'll pass.
Hey, I was once one of those meatheads in high school.
That explains a lot.
What were you?
Let me guess...
You were the hot mathlete?
I didn't have what you would call a normal high school experience.
What?
Were you, like, homeschooled or something?
My God.
You were.
That's hilarious.
This is exactly why I don't tell people.
They think it's weird.
I think it's cool.
I mean, I went to an expensive private school, and now, I'm running errands for a living.
You got homeschooled, and you're a successful lawyer.
You tell me what's weird.
Thanks.
Okay.
So, it looks like everyone's inside.
We've got the bulk of the student body in one place.
Let's tell them a secret.
Did it come through?
"Dax Edwards was just released from custody because the cops have identified the real killer.
They're on their way to the pep rally to make an arrest."
Homeschooled or not, you're a genius.
Let's go.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What the hell?
!
We need to talk.
Move, lady!
We're in a hurry.
I'm an attorney, and if you know something about Jason Moore, it's in your best interest to come clean.
We don't know anything about anything.
Dude, we know exactly what happened.
Either you talk to us, or we call the cops.
Up to you.
Okay, fine, then.
Wait!
We didn't mean to kill Jason.
We swear.
Thank you for helping me, but I need you to keep this between us.
Are you kidding?
You know I've been looking for a way to make my bones with Julia.
Fine.
I'll keep my mouth shut.
That look is very effective.
I'll call you.
We saw Jason coming out of a frat party.
He was drunk off his ass.
We decided to have a little fun with him.
We tied a T-shirt around his eyes, like a blindfold.
Then we threw him in my trunk and drove him to the dam.
Fun.
Then what happened?
If we didn't intend to kill him...
I mean, if it was an accident...
You could still be looking at murder charges.
I can't represent you, but if you tell us everything,
I promise I'll get you the best possible defense.
You have my word.
I had my old helmet.
We put it on and took turns tackling him like a practice dummy.
What did you have against Jason?
Nothing.
He was a solid freshman.
They were hazing him.
Isn't that right?
Only it went too far, and when you realized you'd killed him, you took off.
He was alive when we left.
That's how it works.
The freshmen take their licks, and then they find their own way home.
They did it to me, they did it to him.
It's a tradition.
Welcome back.
We've been taking your calls tonight on LHL.
Once again, our guest is Coach Phil Ryder, the man who insists he's telling it like it is.
Lenny, from Amarillo, you're on.
Coach, I was at that game against Cleveland in '94 when you had three touchdowns.
Unbelievable.
What's your question, Lenny?
Hey, you ever think about running for office?
I would sure vote for you.
Well, never say never, right, Lenny?
I'm serious.
America needs a leader like you.
You're a straight talker, and that's what we've been...
Does anyone have a good question?
Every caller wants to kiss this guy's ass.
It used to be, the point of college was to prepare our kids for the real world.
All we've done is create this generation of snowflakes.
And you know how we did it?
We started handing out awards just for showing up.
We've created a monster.
In fact, Louise, can I tell it like it is?
Why stop now?
Hey, Jake.
We're live.
What's going on?
I'm on my way up.
I have reason to believe Jason Moore died after being hazed by his teammates.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
And there's more.
This is why sports are so important.
Louise, check your pocket screen.
They're an anecdote to a culture of false achievements.
Win or lose, it is my job to toughen my players up.
Does that include hazing them?
I do...
I don't know what you're talking about.
Come on, Coach.
It's a well-known part of being on a sports team.
- You better be right about this.
- I've got a source.
Tell her that we know he authorized two of his players to haze Jason Moore.
- Who's your source?
- Just ask him if it's true.
Julia, I promise, it'll be good TV.
but not on your team?
Ask the coach if he authorized hazing by two of his players.
Is it true you authorized two of your players to haze Jason?
Nope.
No, that's...
That's not accurate.
Did you know about your football team's hazing culture?
Finn, get in here.
Okay, Louise, what you're talking about,
I wouldn't call hazing.
This is all in good fun, okay?
It's towel fights, hiding another guy's jock strap.
This is nothing like what happened to Jason.
A week before he died, did you pull two of your captains aside and tell them that the new freshmen were "too soft"
and they needed to toughen them up?
Look, that's not what I...
So, that's not what you meant, but isn't it possible that your players took your instructions a bit too far and they killed Jason Moore?
Dax Edwards killed Jason Moore.
Coach, you were trying to make your athletes better, tougher men.
Here's what I want to know...
Could this all be your fault?
Listen, if these idiots pushed it too far and they killed Jason, that is on them, not me!
Finally.
There you have it.
Thanks for telling it like it is.
We'll be right back.
Andwe'reclear.
What did I tell you?
- Good TV.
- Good TV.
Where are you going?
Get my client out of jail.
Jake, that was quite a show tonight.
Ryder's coaching career is over.
I'm here to retrieve Dax Edwards.
Open up the gates.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid I can't do that.
Lozowski and Sanchez admitting to hitting Jason with their helmets.
Bruises on the body correspond with that kind of blunt object, but according to the coroner, the fatal head wound was caused by a sharp object, probably a rock.
That could've happened while they were tackling him.
Yeah, maybe, but they said they left Jason at 12:30, and we have security footage of them downing chili dogs at Tommy's 15 minutes later.
So what?
Jason's phone records just came in.
There's a call from his cellphone at 1:07.
Jason called Dax.
Look, we're charging the football players with felony hazing, but your guy looks good for the murder.
My heart's still racing from the show.
After all this time, I still get that buzz.
We took down an obnoxious bully.
We earned dessert.
I think I'll pass.
Trust me.
You're gonna want it.
Flaming cherries jubilee.
Here you are, Miss Louise.
Thank you, Marco.
Just leave the whiskey and the lighter.
Of course.
What's this?
All your sad Eric crap.
It's time to purge.
You went in my office?
In my drawers?
I did.
Because I'm a good friend.
I thought he was the one.
I know, hon, but he wasn't.
Now...
I know it's a bit cliche, but it works.
To letting go.
I don't understand.
The football players admitted to beating the crap out of Jason.
Yeah, but I checked the timeline, Ella.
Detective Matthews is right.
Jake, the court order against Tell Me a Secret just came through.
Tell me they'll comply.
We need that name.
When I showed the kid the court order, he panicked.
Said if his users found out that their secrets weren't actually anonymous, they'd ditch his app and he'd wind up like Friendster.
So I agreed to tear up the order if he gave us what we wanted.
You know who accused Dax?
I never could keep a secret.
That's crazy.
Why would I accuse my best friend of murder?
That's a good question.
You want to answer, or should I?
Finn?
Jason did get hazed that night, but when the football players left, he was still alive.
And he had to find a way home.
So who did he call?
He called his old friends Dax and Finn.
In fact, he called the landline here, and records show that that call was answered.
FiFinn was the only one home.
You drove out to pick him up.
Isn't that right?
What happened when you got there?
He was a mess...
Drunk, bleeding.
He said those football players kicked his ass.
I thought for sure he was gonna quit the team, but he was happy...
Happy they beat the crap out of him.
He said it was a tradition, that he finally felt a part of something... that he had real friends.
Real friends.
That would've pissed me off, too.
I couldn't believe it.
I drove out there in the middle of the night.
I was his friend.
I told him that he was being a jerk, and he laughed at me.
Said that I was a loser.
Then he tried to get in my car.
Finn, what did you do?
I was angry.
And I just...
I picked up a rock, and I threw it at him.
I swear I didn't mean to kill him.
I just...
I hit him in the head, and he dropped.
God.
You blamed it on Dax.
Why?
Because I knew everyone would believe it.
Hey.
Got your text.
What are we doing here?
I felt bad I had to cut our date short.
Well, I like your way of apologizing.
Are we paying by the hour?
I live here.
In a motel?
You know how I told you I was homeschooled?
Well, truth is, we never really had a home.
It was always just my mom and I, on the move, skipping out on rents, dodging my mom's crazy ex-boyfriends.
So, when I passed the Bar and started working,
I got an apartment like you're supposed to.
But I could never bring myself to buy furniture.
It just felt so permanent.
It never felt like home, and this did, so I moved in, and that was three years ago.
Three years?
You're the only one I've ever told.
Why me?
Because you could've told Julia about the football players, and you didn't.
And I trust you.
Hey, you seem like someone who likes to take things slow.
Take off your clothes.
Hey, boss.
How was dinner?
It was, um... cathartic.
Can I have the overtime spreadsheets?
There's a budget meeting in the morning.

This message is for Julia George.
You think I wanted to hurt Oscar?
I just wanted to protect him.
Sarah was bad for him, and I was the only one who could see it.
I only wanted him to be happy.
But you and Jake Gregorian...
You twisted everything.
You made me the enemy.
If you want the truth, come and get it.
You got the story all wrong.
Here you go.
Can you get me Levi Young's address?
Yeah, of course.
Text it to me.
I'll be in the car.
Levi?
What took you so long?
You said I got the story wrong.
I sent those photos so Oscar would know the truth.
Why didn't you just tell him the truth?
And tell him I've been watching over him... taking pictures?
That makes me look crazy.
But Oscar needed to know Jake couldn't be trusted, that Sarah would've used the abuse against him.
I got ahead of that.
For him.
But you also sent me a photo of Oscar cheating on Sarah.
How does that help him?
You wanted to make sure Sarah never took Oscar back.
You have feelings for him.
What?
Most of the photos...
They're of the two of you.
Oscar said he could talk to SweetVicki about all areas of his life.
By pretending to be her, you could have the relationship with him you always wanted.
You're in love with him.
That's crazy.
I know what it's like to have all your hopes and dreams wrapped up in one person and realize there's no future with them.
Trust me.
I...
I understand.
But Oscar never would.
He might not, but at least you could let him know you never intended to hurt him.
I would never hurt him.
I would never hurt Sarah.
I'm not that kind of person.
I believe you.
I got the story wrong.
Yeah.
But you have the chance to set it right.
Please put down the gun.
Tell Oscar I'm sorry.
Okay.

Alice:
Why do I have a feeling this is not a social call?
Ben:
I need that bracelet back.
See, you're fine stealing from other people, but when it happens to you, you don't like it.
I was forced to steal it to pay off my debt, and if I don't hand it over,
- if I don't pay off my debt...
- You're a dead man?
I can tell by the way you said that, you don't believe me.
I spent a year believing you.
Look where that got me.
That was the old me.
This is the new me.
And the new me is gonna get shot in the head if you don't give me the bracelet back.
If I give it back, I'm an accessory to a crime.
If you keep it, you'll be found guilty of the crime.
And let me tell you something... my Benefactor isn't the only one looking for it.
Those people shooting at me last night?
If they find out you have it, they'll be shooting at you, too.
Now you're just trying to scare me.
No, I'm trying to terrify you, because you should be terrified, because I'm terrified for you.
All right, fine.

Hey, I'm Todd.

Captain, I'm Felicia.
This is Greg.
We're Nia's property managers.
Danny:
Here to assess the damage, but it looks like there isn't any.
Yeah, Todd came over to help, so...
Wanted to make sure she didn't lose her security deposit.
Yeah.
So, uh, it was nice meeting you.

Yeah, I'll walk you out.

Danny:
So, who's Captain Todd Walker?
And why is he leaving with all our evidence?
When I got out of the shower,
Rhys was on the phone speaking Punjabi.
He thinks I only speak Hindi.
Not that he's ever asked.
And what was he saying?
Apparently the diamonds in the bracelet came from India 200 years ago before the British walked in and stole everything.
So he's selling them back?
He's giving them back.
That little bastard.
He's expanding into India.
And Africa and the Middle East.
To think Ben and I were just gonna hand him that bracelet.
Are you not?
Certainly not... not under the terms of our current agreement.
This calls for a renegotiation.
[Line ringing]
Ben:
Rhys and I just had the most enlightening talk with Mickey Shive.
Do you have the bracelet?
Well, there's good news and bad.
Mickey gave it to his boss this morning.
- Emeric Shive is in town?
- Until tomorrow.
Then he's leaving on a private jet.
Bound for India, I expect.
How did you know?
What's the good news?
We have until noon tomorrow to figure out a way to steal the bracelet back.
Do me a favor.
When you get the bracelet, give it to me.
I'll give it to Rhys.
Rhys:
Is that her?
Don't tell me you got to check in, as well.
Got to go.
Come on, before Mickey wakes up.
Oh, don't worry about that.
Can't have him talking to the cops.
Besides, isn't he the one that put a bullet hole in your lovely suit?
Can I drive?
[Engine starts]
We need to work faster.
This is Mickey Shive?
Two shots fired with ballistics I've only ever seen once... in Paris... a woman named Nathalie Duchamp.
And you think Shive and this woman were killed by...
Christopher Hall.
[Door closes]
Hey, what's up?
Dao's here.
Mickey Shive is dead.
How?
- What happened?
- Shot twice in the back.
Dao thinks Christopher did it.
I have to call you back.
What are you doing here?
Allie.
You made me an accessory to murder.
Dao gave me Shive's location.
I gave it to you, and now Shive is dead.
This is why I didn't want you involved.
The people I work for, the people I work with are killers.
And you're not?
You know I'm not.
You act like I'm just supposed to believe you.
After everything you've done to me, every lie you've told...
Did you at least get the bracelet back?
No.
Shive gave it to his boss, who's on a flight to India tomorrow, so I have from now until then to get it back.
But you can't.
Dao is watching him, waiting for you to make your move.
I can't not.
My boss needs that bracelet.
So does Dao.

Well, this is not gonna end well for me.
Or for me.
I know you don't believe a word I'm saying, but I am sorry, Allie.

Nia's the first woman ever to join the Rangers... the Army's elite special ops force.
Now that the Pentagon's opened up combat roles to women, she'll be among the first to deploy.
Which is why there's been backlash.
Stupid stuff at first.
My gear was stolen, equipment was messed with.
But then I started getting threats.
What kind of threats?
E-mails, notes, photos.
Did you report all this?
To my commanding officer weeks ago.
But then I got this.
My dog tags, which had been stolen, along with a killed-in-action letter on official stationary addressed to my parents.
That's when I said maybe she should come in and meet you guys.
Yeah, but the thing is, if anyone knew
I went outside the Army for help...
No one will know.
We will figure out who's behind this, and we'll make it stop.
What you're doing is too important.
Thank you.
But if you could just find out who this is,
I'll take care of it myself.
Maybe you can take care of a federal agent for me while you're at it.
No, please.
Allow me.
So, where is it?
Someplace safe.
That sounds unnecessarily mysterious.
There were Shives all over the consulate last night.
Reps from all the major U.S. syndicates.
Armed to the teeth.
So I hid the bracelet so if they got to me, they wouldn't be able to get to it.
Clever boy.
Well done.
- How's your omelet?
- Mm, it's fine.
You must have worked up quite an appetite.
Mmm!
That is good.
You want to try Felicity's omelet?
No, thanks.

So, what is this bracelet, Rhys?
Why is every crook in town after it?
'Cause it's worth a bloody fortune.
Well, you already have a fortune.

- Ben's right.
You didn't fly all the way from London for a piece of jewelry.
What's it really?

I'm not just here for the bracelet.

- Since when do you listen to Mum?
How can you not?
She bangs on and on.
- The woman never shuts up.
- About what?
About you.
About us.
She wants us to make peace.
I wasn't aware we were at war.
No, not officially.
So you'll forgive our debt?
Yes.
I will.
The minute you pay me back.
And so much for making peace.
I did forgive you this month's payment in exchange for the bracelet.
Speaking of which...
Shall you and me go and retrieve it from its secret hiding place?
I think it's safer for you if I go alone, in case anyone's watching me.
That's pretty thoughtful of you, Benji.
Don't be long.
I've come to apologize.
We're not interested in your apology.
Then perhaps this.
A peace offering.
What are we looking at?
A gala at the Larágan Consulate.
They had an uninvited guest.
Your friend, Christopher Hall.
We believe he stole something from the Larágan Prime Minister.
What did he steal?
This.
If we find that bracelet, we'll find Christopher Hall.
Maybe he is here to make peace.
Oh, right, 'cause that's what Rhys does.
Wherever he goes, he just makes peace.
Why would you believe anything that comes out of his lying mouth?
Because I know him.
I know when he's lying.
See?
This is exactly why I had to get you away from him... because the minute the two of you are together,
- I cease to exist.
- That's not true.
I am partners with you now, not him.
Well, make sure he knows that.
I know my brother.
He's here for more than just a bracelet.
So whatever it is, we have to present a united front.
He'll try and divide and conquer.
He always does.
So we can't let him or anything else come between us.
Do you promise me?
I promise.
We don't know much about the bracelet... only that every crime syndicate in town seems to be after it.
But you think Christopher has it.
So what do you want from us?
You're the one with all the information.
I wanted to share it with you to make it up to you.
You think this makes up for bugging my house, invading my privacy?
We all have the same goal, Ms. Vaughan.
We have very different methods, Agent Dao.
So if you'll excuse me...
You want to make it up to her?
Then don't come back until you catch him.
You slept with my brother!
I wasn't aware you and I were exclusive.
No, we're not.
Let's be clear.
This is not romantic jealousy you are witnessing.
This is disgust.
You slept with me, and then you slept with my brother.
Technically, I slept with him first.
I've been doing that for quite some time.
- I assumed you knew.
- How would I know?
Given your rather pronounced lesbian tendencies, why would I make that assumption?
You sleep with Ben.
How do you explain your lesbian tendencies?
I prefer not to.
Takes all the fun out of them.
Did you know he was coming?
No, I would have told you.
Do you know why he wants this bracelet?
He's not said.
Can you find out?
He thinks I'm his.
Right, which is exactly why he might actually tell you.
And then you can tell me.
What's in it for me?
I don't know.
What would you like?
You are disgusting.
- I think I'm nice.
- Hmm.
So, both the Army and the media are making Nia the center of attention with these stories.
There have been articles for and against her in every major publication.
And the stuff on the message boards is out of control.
But this was somebody close to her, close enough to steal her dog tags.
Someone she went to Ranger school with, someone who washed out?
Sophie and I went through a list of the wash-outs.
And so far, there's only one of them who's had access to this kind of official stationary.
1st Lieutenant Evan Connors.
That little bitch is making death threats?
I didn't say that, or use those words, but has he ever said anything?
No.
No, he knows better.
What about any other Rangers?
The other Rangers are my family now.
They've got my back.
It isn't them.
What about outside the Rangers?

Look, I'm sorry.
- Was that a secret?
- No, no.
No, it's fine.
So, when do I get to have this little chat with Evan Connors?
Not yet.
Not until we have proof.
We'll find this guy, whoever he is.
Just... give us a little more time.
We're talking more now than we did when you were Christopher Hall.

- Is your neck okay?
- You're not going after them.
- Don't tell me what to do.
Get in the car or get out of my way!
This is my debt!
It's my problem!
It's my fault I stole the bracelet from you.
I am doing this alone.
Let me help.
I want to help.
You want to help me steal a bracelet?
I want to help you not die.
You don't know anything about these people... who they are or how they work.
No, I don't.
But I know someone who does.
You want to work with Agent Dao?
Mm-hmm.
Are you absolutely sure?
Mm-hmm.
Is he back?
- Have you heard from him?
- Not yet.
I thought you two were supposed to be partners.
We are.
When Benji and I were partners,
I knew where he was at all times.
Well, maybe that's why he's working with me and not with you.
You're in a mood.
I have missed you, you know.
You have not.
I have.
You used to do all the work.
I didn't have to do anything.
Yeah, it's good to be king.
Did you actually think that when Dad died they would put you in charge?
I mean, I don't know if you've noticed, darling, but you're kind of a lady.
Men don't like taking orders from ladies.
Tell that to the Queen.
I think Elizabeth knows.
The thing is... you act as if you've been exiled.
When, in actual fact, you abandoned me, and you took Benji with you.
He did have a choice in the matter.
Yeah, but I couldn't exactly offer him the same enticements, could I?
Not for lack of trying.
He is rather straight, isn't he?
Bless him.
How are things in that department?
Fine, thanks.
How's about things with you and whatever her name is?

She's fascinated by the two of you.
She tells me you do all your own legwork for every con.
Yeah, well, we can't exactly afford staff with the debt you've got us carrying.

How come you got no money all of a sudden?
You used to be very good at this.
I still am!
It's not me.
It's your precious Benji.

- There a problem here?
- No.
There's not a problem here.
- Danny, this is my brother, Brian.
- Who's this guy?
- A friend of mine.
- I'm...
All right?
Now go back to your friends.
I'm fine.
Nia, Nia, Stop!
Was this you?
Nope.
But whoever it was, I'm a fan.
- What the hell's going on here?
- Nia, can we go?
I carried the same weight as you, ran the same miles as you.
I just didn't wash out like you.
You failed twice, same as me.
But Sergeant Moore was told he had to graduate at least one woman.
So if you're wondering why we all hate you, including Sergeant Moore...
You want to talk that way to my sister in front of me, Lieutenant?
You sure you want to do that?
I can fight my own battles, Brian.
You want to find out what kind of soldier I am?
Come on.
You and me, right now.
See?
That's the thing about girls... so emotional.
You're not worth it.
Nia.
Nia!
Why would I bother with death threats?
You're not even a real soldier.
The minute you land overseas, you're gonna die.
Hey.
- What did you do that for?
- That wasn't for you.
That was for me.
I hate that guy.
You're focusing on Christopher because you want it to be Christopher, but we can't ignore the other two crime families that were there last night.
We're watching all of them.
If Mickey Shive has the bracelet and tries to move it or sell it, we'll be there when Christopher tries to steal it from them.
And if Christopher has the bracelet?
We'll be there when they try to take it from him.
Will you let me know when and where so I can be there?
Of course.
Does your hand hurt?
- No, it's fine.
- Really?
'Cause that's not how you throw a punch.
That was a solid punch!
No, that is how you break your hand.
Come here.
Let me show you.
- Oh, easy!
Oh!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
That is gonna be bad in the morning.
Let's put some ice on it.
Don't touch anything.
What's that supposed to be?
A battlefield cross for soldiers who die in combat.
It's my grave.
Mickey Shive has a girlfriend.
That poor girl.
She's a porn star, and personal trainer, of course, named Erin Savvy.
I love Los Angeles, don't you?
Ms. Savvy has an apartment at the Park Plaza, and Shive is there.
- I'm on my way now.
- I'll come with you.
No, you will not.
Mickey Shive is probably armed, definitely dangerous, and you're not going anywhere near him.
And as for you, you're not doing yourself any favors with me coming up here trying to get my partner killed.
- I only came here bec...
- Now you're interrupting?
We want to catch Christopher as much as you do.
And we're happy to share information.
But that is it.
You copy?
Copy that.
Allie?
Copy that.
_
_
There he is.
That's him.
That's Mickey Shive.
Oh, he does look like a proper gangster, doesn't he?
I'm making the call.
Oh, I wanted to make the call.
- It's already dialing.
- I've practiced my accent and everything.
- Rhys, this is serious.
- I know.
Give me the phone.
911?
There's a man.
He's been shot.
I think he's dying.
Please.
Uh, yeah, the Park Plaza, room 701.
Oh, my God, there's... there's so much blood.
It's a little theatrical.
You used to love my theatrics.
Yeah, your theatrics got us into a lot of trouble.
You used to love trouble.
My sister's domesticated you.
She sucked all the fun out of you, like some Earl Grey succubus.
Just because it's not you and me getting wasted every night, with different women every night...
- Sometimes the same woman.
- doesn't mean...
- At the same time.
- that I'm not fun.
Yeah, but are you happy, Benji?
You don't seem very happy to me.
Shive's on the move.
You didn't answer my question.
Well, I think it's called growing up.
Oh.
You've grown up, have you?
I'm trying.
So is that why you left?
You know why I left.
You made it impossible for her to stay.
What?
And you and Margot are the same person, are you?
You have to do everything she does?
Oh, I hate couples like that.
You wouldn't even know each other if it weren't for me.
I invited you into this family.
You were my partner, and she stole you.
She didn't steal me.
I left because I wanted to be with her.
Interesting.
Interesting.
Use of the word "wanted..." past tense.
Now you're reaching.
Now, I'm just listening, just mirroring.
You can come back to the firm any time you want, you know.
- I've forgiven you.
- Oh, you've forgiven me?
Hey, maybe I've done some growing up, too.
Right.
When can we put the siren on?
It's called the battlefield cross.
Oh, my God.
The door was open when we got there, but it didn't look forced.
So they might have had a key.
Or stolen a key and copied it.
If they got to her dog tags, could have gotten to her key.
Can we check CCTV footage from last night?
I did, but you can't see Nia's house from the street.
Couldn't have been Evan.
I was tailing him all day.
Did Nia give you any other suspects?
No, but Evan did... he said Nia's C.O. was forced to graduate at least one female Ranger.
- If only for publicity's sake.
- What's his name?
His name is Sergeant Joshua Moore.
I'll see what I can dig up on him.
Did you search Nia's house last night?
No, I'm headed back there now.
- I'll come with you?
- Yeah, sure.
You could have your old job back, be your own man.
What makes you think I'm not my own man?
My sister would never allow that.
You underestimate her.
That is one thing I would never do.
Is there a problem, officer?
As a matter of fact, Mickey, there is.
You see, you took something very valuable from my friend here.
Hello, Mickey.
See how much fun this is?
!
See, if you came back, we could do this all the time.
Do you want to have a go?
Suit yourself.
Nia?
What are you guys doing here?
You can't be here.
I'm not alone.
Oh.
Hey, I'm Todd.
Uh, Captain Todd Walker, this is...
Captain, I'm Felicia.
This is Greg.
We're Nia's property managers.
Here to assess the damage, but it looks like there isn't any.
Yeah, Todd came over to help, so...
Wanted to make sure she didn't lose her security deposit.
Yeah.
So, uh, it was nice meeting you.
Nia, check in later?
Yeah, I'll walk you out.
So, who's Captain Todd Walker?
And why is he leaving with all our evidence?
When I got out of the shower,
Rhys was on the phone speaking Punjabi.
He thinks I only speak Hindi.
Not that he's ever asked.
And what was he saying?
Apparently the diamonds in the bracelet came from India 200 years ago before the British walked in and stole everything.
So he's selling them back?
He's giving them back.
That little bastard.
He's expanding into India.
And Africa and the Middle East.
To think Ben and I were just gonna hand him that bracelet.
Are you not?
Certainly not... not under the terms of our current agreement.
This calls for a renegotiation.
Rhys and I just had the most enlightening talk with Mickey Shive.
Do you have the bracelet?
Well, there's good news and bad.
Mickey gave it to his boss this morning.
- Emeric Shive is in town?
- Until tomorrow.
Then he's leaving on a private jet.
Bound for India, I expect.
How did you know?
What's the good news?
We have until noon tomorrow to figure out a way to steal the bracelet back.
Do me a favor.
When you get the bracelet, give it to me.
I'll give it to Rhys.
Is that her?
Don't tell me you got to check in, as well.
Got to go.
Come on, before Mickey wakes up.
Oh, don't worry about that.
Can't have him talking to the cops.
Besides, isn't he the one that put a bullet hole in your lovely suit?
Can I drive?
We need to work faster.
This is Mickey Shive?
Two shots fired with ballistics I've only ever seen once... in Paris... a woman named Nathalie Duchamp.
And you think Shive and this woman were killed by...
Christopher Hall.
Hey, what's up?
Dao's here.
Mickey Shive is dead.
How?
- What happened?
- Shot twice in the back.
Dao thinks Christopher did it.
I have to call you back.
What are you doing here?
Allie.
You made me an accessory to murder.
Dao gave me Shive's location.
I gave it to you, and now Shive is dead.
This is why I didn't want you involved.
The people I work for, the people I work with are killers.
And you're not?
You know I'm not.
You act like I'm just supposed to believe you.
After everything you've done to me, every lie you've told...
Did you at least get the bracelet back?
No.
Shive gave it to his boss, who's on a flight to India tomorrow, so I have from now until then to get it back.
But you can't.
Dao is watching him, waiting for you to make your move.
I can't not.
My boss needs that bracelet.
So does Dao.
Well, this is not gonna end well for me.
Or for me.
I know you don't believe a word I'm saying, but I am sorry, Allie.
Let me ask you something.
What if it were possible for Dao to get his bracelet and you to get yours?
There's only one bracelet.
Just like there's only one Maria Kreyn?
You did not have to do this.
We're a full-service security firm.
Stakeouts and takeout.
If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
Well, I don't need you sitting out there in front of my house all night.
Why?
'Cause I'm a man?
No, because I'm never gonna be able to eat all that by myself.
You're here to help, right?
We are a full-service organization.
Hello?
Hey.
Where are you?
I'm on my way.
What's gonig on?
Army Rangers go through regular performance reviews, right?
- For promotions?
- Okay.
So Nia's friend Todd got reviewed and promoted six months early.
By whom?
Nia's C.O., the guy Evan mentioned in the bar...
Sergeant Joshua Moore.
Do you want me to tell her or...
No, I'll do it.
Thanks, Soph.
Yep.
What'd she say?
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
- Nia...
- No, Shawn.
You've met them both.
It isn't Todd or Sergeant Moore.
Nia, I can't even imagine how difficult this is for you.
I got through Ranger school with Todd.
He'd do anything for me.
I'd do anything for him.
- I hope that's true.
- And Sergeant
Moore wasn't forced to pass me.
I got through the course like everyone else.
We're not implying that you didn't.
Look...
I appreciate you guys trying to help.
I do, but...
You're wrong.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Let's find out.
What?
Let's find out if we're wrong.
Let's find out if Todd is really your friend.
- How?
- Meet with him.
Tell him everything... about coming here, about us.
You hired private detectives?
You saw what happened to my house, that stuff on my wall.
You're not supposed to go outside on stuff like this.
You can't tell anyone.
Okay?
After you leave, he'll run straight to Sergeant Moore or whoever's giving him orders.
- We got a big problem.
- He'll want to calm him down, so he'll agree to meet.
You got to get here right now.
And when they do, we'll be there.
Oh, my God.
Is that...?
Nia's brother.
My own brother?
!
Look, before you say anything...
Major Brooks, you don't get to talk right now.
You don't get to tell me what to do, Ms. Vaughan.
Shut up, Brian!
Does Dad know about this?
You gonna tell him?
You sent me death threats.
- Nia.
- You destroyed my house.
- I was trying to protect you.
- How?
By turning my friends against me?
First Todd, and then my C.O.?
!
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You have no friends!
Listen, I love you.
I respect you.
You are the strongest, bravest woman I know.
But you're a woman.
And there are Rangers out there who hate you because of that, who do not have your back.
And if they don't have your back in combat, you're dead.
And I don't want you to die.
There are other ways you can serve.
All I ever wanted to be is a Ranger.
Like Dad.
Like you.
You are a Ranger.
- Ms. Vaughan...
- It's okay, Alice.
It's not okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm so tired of hearing men say they are trying to protect us when what that does is take away our choices.
This is your life.
These are your choices to make.
But they're yours.
Not his.
You okay?
He said he was just trying to help.
So, what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna go be a Ranger.
And if he's right and something happens out there, it's kind of the gig, you know?
You work with some powerful, kick-ass women.
Well, that's the way I like them.
I don't understand.
Why is he not picking up?
- He's not picking up because...
- Benji, call me!
Because I am doing the talking for both of us.
Margot.
We had a deal.
Yes, we had a deal to steal the bracelet from the Larágan Consulate in exchange for our missed payment, but now...
We had a deal for the bracelet.
If you want us to steal it again, then you will forgive our debt in full.
It's a small price to pay for all of India, Africa, and the Middle East.
- Who told you about that?
- Do we have a deal?
Because, in 40 minutes, that bracelet is on its way to India without you.
I am going to need this in writing.
You are the absolute worst.
You know that?
Most people have sisters who love them, support them.
Most people don't have you for a brother.
All right.
What's the plan?
The plan is already in motion.
We are good to go.
Copy that.
Eyes on Emeric Shive.
_
Agent Dao?
Shive's hiding to the airport.
I'm on my way.
Welcome aboard, Mr. Shive.
Champagne?
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?
It turns out Emeric Shive has a very high tolerance for doctored champagne.
It's good to know for next time.
There's not gonna be a next time.
Now, you say that now...
Is he here?
Did you find Christopher?
He didn't show.
But we did find this.
Hmm.
We'll catch him next time.
Here's to freedom.
And to family.
Hear, hear.
To our Benefactor.
Former Benefactor.
Here's to India... and Africa and the Middle East.
And Los Angeles.
I like it here.
I think I'll stay.
I was sure Christopher would be there.
Can you not just enjoy the fact that you arrested Emeric Shive today?
And you got the bracelet back.
Exactly.
It was too easy.
I can't help but think I'm being played.
By whom?
Alice?
Me?
Maybe.
Alice plays games... while you seduce me.
Is that what you think I'm doing?
God, I hope so.
How do I know you're not just using me?
Oh, I am.
Thank you... for saving my life today.
It can't ever happen again.
I'm lying to Val again.
I'm lying to Dao.
I'm in bed with the man who ruined my life.
Do you want me to leave?
That's the problem.
So, are you never gonna ask?
Ask what?
Who's better?
Brother or sister?
Oh, that's it.
Go on.
Get out of here.
Bye.
Safe travels.
Will you visit me now that you're free?
What, in India?
Or Africa or the Middle East.
Wow.
He's put you in charge of all that?
He must really trust you.
Oh.
As much as he trusts anyone.
Watch yourself with him.
I love my brother, but he's only out for himself.
Unlike the rest of us.
Sleep well.
You naughty girl.
I was just saying goodbye.
It looks like you were doing a great deal more than that.
- Rhys, I wasn't...
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
It's late.
Let's you and I go and have a little chat while you pack.
I didn't tell her about the bracelet.
Hey.
Hey.
It's all right.
I'm not angry.
Well, I am a little bit.
But I'll get over it.
I just need a little quid pro quo.
That's how it works in my family.
Margot gets something on me, I get something on her.
I don't know anything.
She didn't tell you why she couldn't make this month's payment... what went wrong on her last con?
All she said was... there was a woman.
Alice Vaughan?
Alice Vaughan.
Alice...
Vaughan.
Thank you, darling.
That'll do nicely.
Hello, Ms. Vaughan.
How lovely to meet you.
- Previously on "The Catch"...
- Agent Dao is here right now.
Ben:
And going through your mail at the moment.
You can't trust this guy.
How well do you know Alice Vaughan?
I know her well enough to know that you've been bugging her house.
If you ever come anywhere near her again,
I will personally see to it that you are deported back to where you came from.
Do you want to maybe get a drink?
Shawn kind of asked me to dinner.
Our payment is now officially past due, so it won't be long before they send someone after us, and when that happens, we have two options... deliver or die.
You've taken the words right out of my mouth.
I really hope I don't have to kill you.
Why'd you leave the family?
You were next in line.
No, I was never next in line.
I'm a woman.
Our Benefactor has decided to forgive your payment this month.
He needs you to steal a bracelet.
The Shives are here.
Is every crime syndicate in town after this bracelet?

Our Benefactor has come to collect.
Right, then.
Where's my bracelet?
[Cellphone rings]
Alice:
Why do I have a feeling this is not a social call?
Ben:
I need that bracelet back.
See, you're fine stealing from other people, but when it happens to you, you don't like it.
I was forced to steal it to pay off my debt, and if I don't hand it over,
- if I don't pay off my debt...
- You're a dead man?
I can tell by the way you said that, you don't believe me.
I spent a year believing you.
Look where that got me.
That was the old me.
This is the new me.
And the new me is gonna get shot in the head if you don't give me the bracelet back.
If I give it back, I'm an accessory to a crime.
If you keep it, you'll be found guilty of the crime.
And let me tell you something... my Benefactor isn't the only one looking for it.
Those people shooting at me last night?
If they find out you have it, they'll be shooting at you, too.
Now you're just trying to scare me.
No, I'm trying to terrify you, because you should be terrified, because I'm terrified for you.
All right, fine.
You want the bracelet so badly?

Stupid stuff at first.
My gear was stolen, equipment was messed with.
But then I started getting threats.
What kind of threats?
E-mails, notes, photos.
Did you report all this?
To my commanding officer weeks ago.
But then I got this.
My dog tags, which had been stolen, along with a killed-in-action letter on official stationary addressed to my parents.
That's when I said maybe she should come in and meet you guys.
Yeah, but the thing is, if anyone knew
I went outside the Army for help...
No one will know.
We will figure out who's behind this, and we'll make it stop.
What you're doing is too important.

There have been articles for and against her in every major publication.
And the stuff on the message boards is out of control.
But this was somebody close to her, close enough to steal her dog tags.
Someone she went to Ranger school with, someone who washed out?
Sophie and I went through a list of the wash-outs.
And so far, there's only one of them who's had access to this kind of official stationary.
1st Lieutenant Evan Connors.
That little bitch is making death threats?
I didn't say that, or use those words, but has he ever said anything?
No.
No, he knows better.
What about any other Rangers?
The other Rangers are my family now.
They've got my back.
It isn't them.
What about outside the Rangers?
The only person I see is Shawn.
Shawn?
Sullivan, as in Agent Shawn.
Wait, so you and Shawn are...
No, I thought he was dating you.
No, I mean, we've gone out a couple times...
I'm sorry.
Look, I'm sorry.
- Was that a secret?
- No, no.
No, it's fine.
So, when do I get to have this little chat with Evan Connors?
Not yet.
Not until we have proof.
We'll find this guy, whoever he is.
Just... give us a little more time.

Alice:
We're talking more now than we did when you were Christopher Hall.
Ben:
Where are you now?
On my way to the Larágan Consulate to return the bracelet.
Alice, don't do that.

Get in the car or get out of my way!
This is my debt!
It's my problem!
It's my fault I stole the bracelet from you.
I am doing this alone.
Let me help.
I want to help.
You want to help me steal a bracelet?
I want to help you not die.
You don't know anything about these people... who they are or how they work.
No, I don't.

You want to work with Agent Dao?
Mm-hmm.
Are you absolutely sure?
Mm-hmm.

We are.
When Benji and I were partners,

Well, maybe that's why he's working with me and not with you.

I mean, I don't know if you've noticed, darling, but you're kind of a lady.
Men don't like taking orders from ladies.
Tell that to the Queen.
I think Elizabeth knows.
The thing is... you act as if you've been exiled.
When, in actual fact, you abandoned me, and you took Benji with you.
He did have a choice in the matter.
Yeah, but I couldn't exactly offer him the same enticements, could I?
Not for lack of trying.
He is rather straight, isn't he?
Bless him.
How are things in that department?
Fine, thanks.
How's about things with you and whatever her name is?
Felicity.
She's fascinated by the two of you.

I was forced to steal it to pay off my debt, and if I don't hand it over,
- if I don't pay off my debt...
- You're a dead man?
I can tell by the way you said that, you don't believe me.
I spent a year believing you.
Look where that got me.
That was the old me.
This is the new me.
And the new me is gonna get shot in the head if you don't give me the bracelet back.
If I give it back, I'm an accessory to a crime.
If you keep it, you'll be found guilty of the crime.
And let me tell you something... my Benefactor isn't the only one looking for it.
Those people shooting at me last night?
If they find out you have it, they'll be shooting at you, too.
Now you're just trying to scare me.
No, I'm trying to terrify you, because you should be terrified, because I'm terrified for you.
All right, fine.
You want the bracelet so badly?
Come and get it.
I don't want to bother him, you know.
It's... maybe something for later.
He's great.
But Alice...
She's busy, too, and I just don't think that...
Yes, we're talking about you.
Shawn needs your help.
It's actually not for me.
It's for an army buddy of mine.
You were in the Army?
- The four years after college.
- Totally.
She's one of the first female Army Rangers, and she could really use your help.
"She"?
Captain Nia Brooks, this is Alice Vaughan...
Hi.
- Valerie Anderson...
- Hello.
And this is Danny Yoon, the detective
I was telling you about, and Sophie.
I have heard good things.
Oh, he's way too nice to me.
He is annoyingly perfect, isn't he?
We hear congratulations are in order.
You're making history.
Thank you, but I'm not sure what I'm...
Don't let her downplay it.
Nia's the first woman ever to join the Rangers... the Army's elite special ops force.
Now that the Pentagon's opened up combat roles to women, she'll be among the first to deploy.
Which is why there's been backlash.
Stupid stuff at first.
My gear was stolen, equipment was messed with.
But then I started getting threats.
What kind of threats?
E-mails, notes, photos.
Did you report all this?
To my commanding officer weeks ago.
But then I got this.
My dog tags, which had been stolen, along with a killed-in-action letter on official stationary addressed to my parents.
That's when I said maybe she should come in and meet you guys.
Yeah, but the thing is, if anyone knew
I went outside the Army for help...
No one will know.
We will figure out who's behind this, and we'll make it stop.
What you're doing is too important.
Thank you.
But if you could just find out who this is,
I'll take care of it myself.
Maybe you can take care of a federal agent for me while you're at it.
No, please.
Allow me.
So, where is it?
Someplace safe.
That sounds unnecessarily mysterious.
There were Shives all over the consulate last night.
Reps from all the major U.S. syndicates.
Armed to the teeth.
So I hid the bracelet so if they got to me, they wouldn't be able to get to it.
Clever boy.
Well done.
- How's your omelet?
- Mm, it's fine.
You must have worked up quite an appetite.
Mmm!
That is good.
You want to try Felicity's omelet?
No, thanks.
I've had it.
So, what is this bracelet, Rhys?
Why is every crook in town after it?
'Cause it's worth a bloody fortune.
Well, you already have a fortune.
Several, including mine.
- Now, now.
- Ben's right.
You didn't fly all the way from London for a piece of jewelry.
What's it really?
All right.
- The truth?
- Mm-hmm.
I'm not here for the bracelet.
I'm not just here for the bracelet.
I'm here because Mum sent me.
- You are not!
- What?
- It's true.
- Since when do you listen to Mum?
How can you not?
She bangs on and on.
- The woman never shuts up.
- About what?
About you.
About us.
She wants us to make peace.
I wasn't aware we were at war.
No, not officially.
So you'll forgive our debt?
Yes.
I will.
The minute you pay me back.
And so much for making peace.
I did forgive you this month's payment in exchange for the bracelet.
Speaking of which...
Shall you and me go and retrieve it from its secret hiding place?
I think it's safer for you if I go alone, in case anyone's watching me.
That's pretty thoughtful of you, Benji.
Don't be long.
I've come to apologize.
We're not interested in your apology.
Then perhaps this.
A peace offering.
What are we looking at?
A gala at the Larágan Consulate.
They had an uninvited guest.
Your friend, Christopher Hall.
We believe he stole something from the Larágan Prime Minister.
What did he steal?
This.
If we find that bracelet, we'll find Christopher Hall.
Maybe he is here to make peace.
Oh, right, 'cause that's what Rhys does.
Wherever he goes, he just makes peace.
Why would you believe anything that comes out of his lying mouth?
Because I know him.
I know when he's lying.
See?
This is exactly why I had to get you away from him... because the minute the two of you are together,
- I cease to exist.
- That's not true.
I am partners with you now, not him.
Well, make sure he knows that.
I know my brother.
He's here for more than just a bracelet.
So whatever it is, we have to present a united front.
He'll try and divide and conquer.
He always does.
So we can't let him or anything else come between us.
Do you promise me?
I promise.
We don't know much about the bracelet... only that every crime syndicate in town seems to be after it.
But you think Christopher has it.
So what do you want from us?
You're the one with all the information.
I wanted to share it with you to make it up to you.
You think this makes up for bugging my house, invading my privacy?
We all have the same goal, Ms. Vaughan.
We have very different methods, Agent Dao.
So if you'll excuse me...
You want to make it up to her?
Then don't come back until you catch him.
You slept with my brother!
I wasn't aware you and I were exclusive.
No, we're not.
Let's be clear.
This is not romantic jealousy you are witnessing.
This is disgust.
You slept with me, and then you slept with my brother.
Technically, I slept with him first.
I've been doing that for quite some time.
- I assumed you knew.
- How would I know?
Given your rather pronounced lesbian tendencies, why would I make that assumption?
You sleep with Ben.
How do you explain your lesbian tendencies?
I prefer not to.
Takes all the fun out of them.
Did you know he was coming?
No, I would have told you.
Do you know why he wants this bracelet?
He's not said.
Can you find out?
He thinks I'm his.
Right, which is exactly why he might actually tell you.
And then you can tell me.
What's in it for me?
I don't know.
What would you like?
You are disgusting.
- I think I'm nice.
- Hmm.
So, both the Army and the media are making Nia the center of attention with these stories.
There have been articles for and against her in every major publication.
And the stuff on the message boards is out of control.
But this was somebody close to her, close enough to steal her dog tags.
Someone she went to Ranger school with, someone who washed out?
Sophie and I went through a list of the wash-outs.
And so far, there's only one of them who's had access to this kind of official stationary.
1st Lieutenant Evan Connors.
That little bitch is making death threats?
I didn't say that, or use those words, but has he ever said anything?
No.
No, he knows better.
What about any other Rangers?
The other Rangers are my family now.
They've got my back.
It isn't them.
What about outside the Rangers?
The only person I see is Shawn.
Shawn?
Sullivan, as in Agent Shawn.
Wait, so you and Shawn are...
No, I thought he was dating you.
No, I mean, we've gone out a couple times...
I'm sorry.
Look, I'm sorry.
- Was that a secret?
- No, no.
No, it's fine.
So, when do I get to have this little chat with Evan Connors?
Not yet.
Not until we have proof.
We'll find this guy, whoever he is.
Just... give us a little more time.
We're talking more now than we did when you were Christopher Hall.
Where are you now?
On my way to the Larágan Consulate to return the bracelet.
Alice, don't do that.
Agent Dao is looking for it, too.
Dao's the least of my problems right now.
Mine, too, at the moment.
I'll have to call you back.
I assume you're here for this?
Allie, behind you!
I'll take that gun and the bracelet.
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
Is your neck okay?
- I'm fine!
I'm fine!
- How's your neck?
- They're getting away!
- Is your neck okay?
- You're not going after them.
- Don't tell me what to do.
Get in the car or get out of my way!
This is my debt!
It's my problem!
It's my fault I stole the bracelet from you.
I am doing this alone.
Let me help.
I want to help.
You want to help me steal a bracelet?
I want to help you not die.
You don't know anything about these people... who they are or how they work.
No, I don't.
But I know someone who does.
You want to work with Agent Dao?
Mm-hmm.
Are you absolutely sure?
Mm-hmm.
Is he back?
- Have you heard from him?
- Not yet.
I thought you two were supposed to be partners.
We are.
When Benji and I were partners,
I knew where he was at all times.
Well, maybe that's why he's working with me and not with you.
You're in a mood.
I have missed you, you know.
You have not.
I have.
You used to do all the work.
I didn't have to do anything.
Yeah, it's good to be king.
Did you actually think that when Dad died they would put you in charge?
I mean, I don't know if you've noticed, darling, but you're kind of a lady.
Men don't like taking orders from ladies.
Tell that to the Queen.
I think Elizabeth knows.
The thing is... you act as if you've been exiled.
When, in actual fact, you abandoned me, and you took Benji with you.
He did have a choice in the matter.
Yeah, but I couldn't exactly offer him the same enticements, could I?
Not for lack of trying.
He is rather straight, isn't he?
Bless him.
How are things in that department?
Fine, thanks.
How's about things with you and whatever her name is?
Felicity.
She's fascinated by the two of you.
She tells me you do all your own legwork for every con.
Yeah, well, we can't exactly afford staff with the debt you've got us carrying.
I keep meaning to ask you.
What happened?
How come you got no money all of a sudden?
You used to be very good at this.
I still am!
It's not me.
It's your precious Benji.
Really?
Do tell.
You're back.
I was worried.
About you, not the bracelet.
Can I have it?
I'm sorry.
Mickey Shive was waiting for me.
What do you think they're gonna do with it?
Sell it, of course.
Same as me.
To whom?
Rhys, if you tell us a bit about the bracelet, we can help you recover it.
Oh, you're going to.
Tell me about Mickey Shive.
So, what do we know about 1st Lieutenant Evan Connors?
He drinks light beer.
That's reason enough to sic Nia on him.
Yeah, I'm gonna have to get back to you on that.
You need to turn around and go home.
What are you doing here?
If anyone sees me with you...
You know how we avoid that?
By leaving right now.
- Let's go.
- He's here, isn't he?
- I just want to talk to him.
- Do you want our help or not?
- There a problem here?
- No.
There's not a problem here.
- Danny, this is my brother, Brian.
- Who's this guy?
- A friend of mine.
- I'm...
All right?
Now go back to your friends.
I'm fine.
Nia, Nia, Stop!
Was this you?
Nope.
But whoever it was, I'm a fan.
- What the hell's going on here?
- Nia, can we go?
I carried the same weight as you, ran the same miles as you.
I just didn't wash out like you.
You failed twice, same as me.
But Sergeant Moore was told he had to graduate at least one woman.
So if you're wondering why we all hate you, including Sergeant Moore...
You want to talk that way to my sister in front of me, Lieutenant?
You sure you want to do that?
I can fight my own battles, Brian.
You want to find out what kind of soldier I am?
Come on.
You and me, right now.
See?
That's the thing about girls... so emotional.
You're not worth it.
Nia.
Nia!
Why would I bother with death threats?
You're not even a real soldier.
The minute you land overseas, you're gonna die.
Hey.
- What did you do that for?
- That wasn't for you.
That was for me.
I hate that guy.
You're focusing on Christopher because you want it to be Christopher, but we can't ignore the other two crime families that were there last night.
We're watching all of them.
If Mickey Shive has the bracelet and tries to move it or sell it, we'll be there when Christopher tries to steal it from them.
And if Christopher has the bracelet?
We'll be there when they try to take it from him.
Will you let me know when and where so I can be there?
Of course.
Does your hand hurt?
- No, it's fine.
- Really?
'Cause that's not how you throw a punch.
That was a solid punch!
No, that is how you break your hand.
Come here.
Let me show you.
- Oh, easy!
Oh!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
That is gonna be bad in the morning.
Let's put some ice on it.
Don't touch anything.
What's that supposed to be?
A battlefield cross for soldiers who die in combat.
It's my grave.
Mickey Shive has a girlfriend.
That poor girl.
She's a porn star, and personal trainer, of course, named Erin Savvy.
I love Los Angeles, don't you?
Ms. Savvy has an apartment at the Park Plaza, and Shive is there.
- I'm on my way now.
- I'll come with you.
No, you will not.
Mickey Shive is probably armed, definitely dangerous, and you're not going anywhere near him.
And as for you, you're not doing yourself any favors with me coming up here trying to get my partner killed.
- I only came here bec...
- Now you're interrupting?
We want to catch Christopher as much as you do.
And we're happy to share information.
But that is it.
You copy?
Copy that.
Allie?
Copy that.
_
_
There he is.
That's him.
That's Mickey Shive.
Oh, he does look like a proper gangster, doesn't he?
I'm making the call.
Oh, I wanted to make the call.
- It's already dialing.
- I've practiced my accent and everything.
- Rhys, this is serious.
- I know.
Give me the phone.
911?
There's a man.
He's been shot.
I think he's dying.
Please.
Uh, yeah, the Park Plaza, room 701.
Oh, my God, there's... there's so much blood.
It's a little theatrical.
You used to love my theatrics.
Yeah, your theatrics got us into a lot of trouble.
You used to love trouble.
My sister's domesticated you.
She sucked all the fun out of you, like some Earl Grey succubus.
Just because it's not you and me getting wasted every night, with different women every night...
- Sometimes the same woman.
- doesn't mean...
- At the same time.
- that I'm not fun.
Yeah, but are you happy, Benji?
You don't seem very happy to me.
Shive's on the move.
You didn't answer my question.
Well, I think it's called growing up.
Oh.
You've grown up, have you?
I'm trying.
So is that why you left?
You know why I left.
You made it impossible for her to stay.
What?
And you and Margot are the same person, are you?
You have to do everything she does?
Oh, I hate couples like that.
You wouldn't even know each other if it weren't for me.
I invited you into this family.
You were my partner, and she stole you.
She didn't steal me.
I left because I wanted to be with her.
Interesting.
Interesting.
Use of the word "wanted..." past tense.
Now you're reaching.
Now, I'm just listening, just mirroring.
You can come back to the firm any time you want, you know.
- I've forgiven you.
- Oh, you've forgiven me?
Hey, maybe I've done some growing up, too.
Right.
When can we put the siren on?
It's called the battlefield cross.
Oh, my God.
The door was open when we got there, but it didn't look forced.
So they might have had a key.
Or stolen a key and copied it.
If they got to her dog tags, could have gotten to her key.
Can we check CCTV footage from last night?
I did, but you can't see Nia's house from the street.
Couldn't have been Evan.
I was tailing him all day.
Did Nia give you any other suspects?
No, but Evan did... he said Nia's C.O. was forced to graduate at least one female Ranger.
- If only for publicity's sake.
- What's his name?
His name is Sergeant Joshua Moore.
I'll see what I can dig up on him.
Did you search Nia's house last night?
No, I'm headed back there now.
- I'll come with you?
- Yeah, sure.
You could have your old job back, be your own man.
What makes you think I'm not my own man?
My sister would never allow that.
You underestimate her.
That is one thing I would never do.
Is there a problem, officer?
As a matter of fact, Mickey, there is.
You see, you took something very valuable from my friend here.
Hello, Mickey.
See how much fun this is?
!
See, if you came back, we could do this all the time.
Do you want to have a go?
Suit yourself.
Nia?
What are you guys doing here?
You can't be here.
I'm not alone.
Oh.
Hey, I'm Todd.
Uh, Captain Todd Walker, this is...
Captain, I'm Felicia.
This is Greg.
We're Nia's property managers.
Here to assess the damage, but it looks like there isn't any.
Yeah, Todd came over to help, so...
Wanted to make sure she didn't lose her security deposit.
Yeah.
So, uh, it was nice meeting you.
Nia, check in later?
Yeah, I'll walk you out.
So, who's Captain Todd Walker?
And why is he leaving with all our evidence?
When I got out of the shower,
Rhys was on the phone speaking Punjabi.
He thinks I only speak Hindi.
Not that he's ever asked.
And what was he saying?
Apparently the diamonds in the bracelet came from India 200 years ago before the British walked in and stole everything.
So he's selling them back?
He's giving them back.
That little bastard.
He's expanding into India.
And Africa and the Middle East.
To think Ben and I were just gonna hand him that bracelet.
Are you not?
Certainly not... not under the terms of our current agreement.
This calls for a renegotiation.
Rhys and I just had the most enlightening talk with Mickey Shive.
Do you have the bracelet?
Well, there's good news and bad.
Mickey gave it to his boss this morning.
- Emeric Shive is in town?
- Until tomorrow.
Then he's leaving on a private jet.
Bound for India, I expect.
How did you know?
What's the good news?
We have until noon tomorrow to figure out a way to steal the bracelet back.
Do me a favor.
When you get the bracelet, give it to me.
I'll give it to Rhys.
Is that her?
Don't tell me you got to check in, as well.
Got to go.
Come on, before Mickey wakes up.
Oh, don't worry about that.
Can't have him talking to the cops.
Besides, isn't he the one that put a bullet hole in your lovely suit?
Can I drive?
We need to work faster.
This is Mickey Shive?
Two shots fired with ballistics I've only ever seen once... in Paris... a woman named Nathalie Duchamp.
And you think Shive and this woman were killed by...
Christopher Hall.
Hey, what's up?
Dao's here.
Mickey Shive is dead.
How?
- What happened?
- Shot twice in the back.
Dao thinks Christopher did it.
I have to call you back.
What are you doing here?
Allie.
You made me an accessory to murder.
Dao gave me Shive's location.
I gave it to you, and now Shive is dead.
This is why I didn't want you involved.
The people I work for, the people I work with are killers.
And you're not?
You know I'm not.
You act like I'm just supposed to believe you.
After everything you've done to me, every lie you've told...
Did you at least get the bracelet back?
No.
Shive gave it to his boss, who's on a flight to India tomorrow, so I have from now until then to get it back.
But you can't.
Dao is watching him, waiting for you to make your move.
I can't not.
My boss needs that bracelet.
So does Dao.
Well, this is not gonna end well for me.
Or for me.
I know you don't believe a word I'm saying, but I am sorry, Allie.
Let me ask you something.
What if it were possible for Dao to get his bracelet and you to get yours?
There's only one bracelet.
Just like there's only one Maria Kreyn?
You did not have to do this.
We're a full-service security firm.
Stakeouts and takeout.
If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
Well, I don't need you sitting out there in front of my house all night.
Why?
'Cause I'm a man?
No, because I'm never gonna be able to eat all that by myself.
You're here to help, right?
We are a full-service organization.
Hello?
Hey.
Where are you?
I'm on my way.
What's gonig on?
Army Rangers go through regular performance reviews, right?
- For promotions?
- Okay.
So Nia's friend Todd got reviewed and promoted six months early.
By whom?
Nia's C.O., the guy Evan mentioned in the bar...
Sergeant Joshua Moore.
Do you want me to tell her or...
No, I'll do it.
Thanks, Soph.
Yep.
What'd she say?
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
- Nia...
- No, Shawn.
You've met them both.
It isn't Todd or Sergeant Moore.
Nia, I can't even imagine how difficult this is for you.
I got through Ranger school with Todd.
He'd do anything for me.
I'd do anything for him.
- I hope that's true.
- And Sergeant
Moore wasn't forced to pass me.
I got through the course like everyone else.
We're not implying that you didn't.
Look...
I appreciate you guys trying to help.
I do, but...
You're wrong.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Let's find out.
What?
Let's find out if we're wrong.
Let's find out if Todd is really your friend.
- How?
- Meet with him.
Tell him everything... about coming here, about us.
You hired private detectives?
You saw what happened to my house, that stuff on my wall.
You're not supposed to go outside on stuff like this.
You can't tell anyone.
Okay?
After you leave, he'll run straight to Sergeant Moore or whoever's giving him orders.
- We got a big problem.
- He'll want to calm him down, so he'll agree to meet.
You got to get here right now.
And when they do, we'll be there.
Oh, my God.
Is that...?
Nia's brother.
My own brother?
!
Look, before you say anything...
Major Brooks, you don't get to talk right now.
You don't get to tell me what to do, Ms. Vaughan.
Shut up, Brian!
Does Dad know about this?
You gonna tell him?
You sent me death threats.
- Nia.
- You destroyed my house.
- I was trying to protect you.
- How?
By turning my friends against me?
First Todd, and then my C.O.?
!
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You have no friends!
Listen, I love you.
I respect you.
You are the strongest, bravest woman I know.
But you're a woman.
And there are Rangers out there who hate you because of that, who do not have your back.
And if they don't have your back in combat, you're dead.
And I don't want you to die.
There are other ways you can serve.
All I ever wanted to be is a Ranger.
Like Dad.
Like you.
You are a Ranger.
- Ms. Vaughan...
- It's okay, Alice.
It's not okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm so tired of hearing men say they are trying to protect us when what that does is take away our choices.
This is your life.
These are your choices to make.
But they're yours.
Not his.
You okay?
He said he was just trying to help.
So, what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna go be a Ranger.
And if he's right and something happens out there, it's kind of the gig, you know?
You work with some powerful, kick-ass women.
Well, that's the way I like them.
I don't understand.
Why is he not picking up?
- He's not picking up because...
- Benji, call me!
Because I am doing the talking for both of us.
Margot.
We had a deal.
Yes, we had a deal to steal the bracelet from the Larágan Consulate in exchange for our missed payment, but now...
We had a deal for the bracelet.
If you want us to steal it again, then you will forgive our debt in full.
It's a small price to pay for all of India, Africa, and the Middle East.
- Who told you about that?
- Do we have a deal?
Because, in 40 minutes, that bracelet is on its way to India without you.
I am going to need this in writing.
You are the absolute worst.
You know that?
Most people have sisters who love them, support them.
Most people don't have you for a brother.
All right.
What's the plan?
The plan is already in motion.
We are good to go.
Copy that.
Eyes on Emeric Shive.
_
Agent Dao?
Shive's hiding to the airport.
I'm on my way.
Welcome aboard, Mr. Shive.
Champagne?
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?
It turns out Emeric Shive has a very high tolerance for doctored champagne.
It's good to know for next time.
There's not gonna be a next time.
Now, you say that now...
Is he here?
Did you find Christopher?
He didn't show.
But we did find this.
Hmm.
We'll catch him next time.
Here's to freedom.
And to family.
Hear, hear.
To our Benefactor.
Former Benefactor.
Here's to India... and Africa and the Middle East.
And Los Angeles.
I like it here.
I think I'll stay.
I was sure Christopher would be there.
Can you not just enjoy the fact that you arrested Emeric Shive today?
And you got the bracelet back.
Exactly.
It was too easy.
I can't help but think I'm being played.
By whom?
Alice?
Me?
Maybe.
Alice plays games... while you seduce me.
Is that what you think I'm doing?
God, I hope so.
How do I know you're not just using me?
Oh, I am.
Thank you... for saving my life today.
It can't ever happen again.
I'm lying to Val again.
I'm lying to Dao.
I'm in bed with the man who ruined my life.
Do you want me to leave?
That's the problem.
So, are you never gonna ask?
Ask what?
Who's better?
Brother or sister?
Oh, that's it.
Go on.
Get out of here.
Bye.
Safe travels.
Will you visit me now that you're free?
What, in India?
Or Africa or the Middle East.
Wow.
He's put you in charge of all that?
He must really trust you.
Oh.
As much as he trusts anyone.
Watch yourself with him.
I love my brother, but he's only out for himself.
Unlike the rest of us.
Sleep well.
You naughty girl.
I was just saying goodbye.
It looks like you were doing a great deal more than that.
- Rhys, I wasn't...
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
It's late.
Let's you and I go and have a little chat while you pack.
I didn't tell her about the bracelet.
Hey.
Hey.
It's all right.
I'm not angry.
Well, I am a little bit.
But I'll get over it.
I just need a little quid pro quo.
That's how it works in my family.
Margot gets something on me, I get something on her.
I don't know anything.
She didn't tell you why she couldn't make this month's payment... what went wrong on her last con?
All she said was... there was a woman.
Alice Vaughan?
Alice Vaughan.
Alice...
Vaughan.
Thank you, darling.
That'll do nicely.
Hello, Ms. Vaughan.
How lovely to meet you.
Your finances are a disgrace.
My wife will be sorry she wed me.
Your wife deserves better.
I'm with child again.
Is Ross glad?
I've not told him.
Are you stalking me, Dr Enys?
Not at all.
A short while ago, I pointed this at my head, and since then, have been trying to decide whether to do it again.
Why would you not have come home, Francis?
I am coming home.
It's common sense to testify against him.
No, sir, I never said them words and I never thought 'em neither.
We find him not guilty on all three charges.
In failing to get him hanged, you have left yourself exposed.
There is one thing I do desire.
A child in the crib.
Do not wish it with our future so uncertain.
Come on.
I applaud your foresight.
It's as well to be prepared.
For what?
Any encounter with those who might...wish us ill.
Ross Poldark would not dare lay a finger on me.
Even though we tried to get him hanged?
We failed.
Did you forget?
Ah, but on that score, there are other ways to choke a man.
And if the rumours about his finances are true, it shouldn't be difficult.
Well, I look forward to hearing of your progress.
Yes?
Beggin' yer pardon, Cap'n, sir.
There's a letter for ye, sir, if it pleases ye.
Ah, the ole Trevorgie workings?
'Tis a fine thought, sir.
What is?
Whatever 'ee was thinking, sir.
I'm thinking of thrashing you from here to Sawle.
Aye, sir.
Well, whatever 'ee say, sir.
Much obliged, sir.
'I write to remind you that your loan of £1,000, 'with interest at 40%, is shortly due for repayment.
'Your friend, Harris Pascoe.'
- All I need!
- What is?
Jud.
His grovelling is killing me!
Are you away somewhere?
To Truro, for the Wheal Leisure shareholders' meeting.
Just, since the trial, I've scarce seen you, let alone had time to speak.
You always seem about some business or other.
The mine, the harvest.
Would you have me neglect our affairs?
- No, Ross.
- We'll talk soon.
I promise.
Gentlemen, welcome to the quarterly meeting of the Wheal Leisure shareholders.
Now, before we begin, I must make you aware that Mrs Jacqueline Tregidden has sold her shares to a Mr Coke.
Since Mrs Tregidden has always trusted us to do our business without her interference, let's hope this gentleman will do the same.
If...
Good day to you, gentlemen.
My name is Tankard, acting on behalf of Mr Coke.
Mr Warleggan, more like.
Pray, go on with the business, sir.
I'm most eager to hear what you have to say.
Oh, shield your eyes, my boy!
The dazzle of Warleggan livery can blind a man!
George has invited us to a soiree.
I've sent our regrets.
No, no, no.
No, surely not.
Pray, convey our delight in declining his invitation.
Now then, boy, would you like to do your lessons, or help me in the fields?
- The fields!
- The fields is the correct answer!
Gentlemen, it's been four years since we opened Wheal Leisure.
We started with 50 men, now we employ 100.
We're not prosperous, but we consistently show a small profit.
Though we're not getting fat on it.
But that could change if another lode of copper could be found.
Mr Henshawe?
'Tis common knowledge that the ancient Trevorgie workings - abandoned a half-century ago when the owner died - were never worked out.
The old shafts caved in long ago.
'Tis impossible to reach from above grass, but if you look at this old map, compare it with the current map of Wheal Leisure workings, you'll see that we've extended considerably in the direction of Trevorgie.
My proposal is this - we divert our quarterly profits into starting an exploratory tunnel to see if we can join up the old Trevorgie workings and access the untapped copper.
And who's to do the digging?
Will it take men away from the day-to-day workings?
Can you guarantee that copper will be found?
How will this affect my client's dividends?
As you know, sir, there are no guarantees in mining.
Mr Henshawe will personally supervise the venture.
A small team, including myself, will be led by Zacky Martin.
And we'll take on six extra men to cover them.
Well, I can't see the harm in it.
I doubt their wages will bankrupt us!
- No, you can be sure o' that, sir.
- I'm in favour.
Who's with me?
Motion carried.
Mr Aukitt and Mr Tankard declined.
Cap'n McNeil.
Mistress Poldark.
Have you recovered from your husband's ordeal?
I give thanks daily for his acquittal, sir.
Doubtless he's a wiser man for it.
No more sailing close to the wind.
Well, you know Ross.
- Is he home?
- In town.
I'm in the neighbourhood at the behest of Unwin Trevaunance, advising on matters of local security.
But I trust I may drop in and take a glass of rum with my old army comrade, or, indeed, my old comrade's wife?
Allow me, ma'am.
Thank you.
George Warleggan finally has a spy in the camp.
It was bound to happen eventually.
But provided the other shareholders hold firm,
Tankard and George can be kept in check.
Well, it's the last thing 'ee need now with all the rumours going about.
- Rumours?
- The parlous state o' your finances.
Have people nothing better to gossip about?
You'll have to excuse me, gentlemen.
I'll see you tonight at the mine.
When's the last time 'ee took a day off?
When I sat in jail awaiting trial.
Cap'n Ross be home soon, I bla'.
I hope so, seeing as Cap'n mcNeil has called especially to see him.
Your health, ma'am.
In truth, 'twas also you I wished to see, on account of your skill at cow doctoring.
I've no such thing, sir.
Sir Hugh Bodrugan has heard different.
His prize cow Sheba is sick.
He'd esteem it the greatest of favours if you'd cast your eye over the beast and prescribe a remedy.
- He asked for you particularly.
- I don't doubt it.
May I tell him that he need not hope in vain?
- Captain McNeil.
- An ambush, sir!
Caught off guard and in possession of the field!
How are you, sir?
On manoeuvres hereabouts?
Quartered with Sir Hugh at Werry House, whither I'm attempting to lure your wife.
To what end?
Sir Hugh wants me to tend to his cow, though I say I've no skill.
Can I persuade you to lend your wife to such a cause?
Demelza has a mind of her own, sir.
But since she has a special fondness for Sir Hugh, no doubt she'll be over directly.
If you'll excuse me, I have mine figures to attend to.
Look, Horace.
What beastly little hovels!
Who could bear to live here?
I urge you to quit this place and come to London.
Loathsome sights do not distress you.
I did not say I found all the sights loathsome hereabouts.
Well done, my boy.
He's not been right since he returned from Bodmin.
He is changed and I do not know how or why.
But we must be glad of it.
Elizabeth Poldark "Regrets".
This is Francis's doing.
Why waste your time on these people?
Surely, Unwin is of more use.
Unwin is proving less of an asset than I'd hoped.
All manner of promises made in exchange for votes, and I'm beginning to fear they've been wasted.
What's the use of having an MP in your pocket if he's too obtuse to do your bidding?
He is pliable.
Is that not an asset?
Only if yoked to wit and intelligence, which, in this case, it is not.
How was the meeting?
- Illuminating.
- Tell me.
Oh, but first, summon Tom Harry.
There's another small matter regarding Poldark's manservant.
When 'Is Worshipfulness, the judge, he says to me,
"Mr Paynter," He says,
"Did this man do wrong or no?"
And I says, "Sithee, Your Honourableness,
"Ross Poldark is as innocent
"as a newly-dropped babe in its first wettels."
And, says 'is Majestic Honourableness,
"Mr Paynter, 'tis your testimony
"and your testimony alone have set this man free."
Did you mislay your manners, leaving me alone to deal with our guest?
You appeared to be handling him admirably.
- I felt like an intruder.
- Meaning what?
Demelza, do you really suppose he wants you to cure Bodrugan's cow?
He makes his intentions very plain.
I think I ought to be able to judge that for myself.
No doubt you think so.
Just be careful his uniform doesn't dazzle you.
It has that effect on some people.
Especially a common miner's daughter who don't know any better?
That's for you to demonstrate.
You are detestable, saying that!
- I'm sure I didn't start this argument.
- No, but you never do!
You just give me the cold shoulder and sour looks and despise everything that isn't up to your high-an'-mighty standards!
What 'ee bin sayin' to upset the maid?
I haven't the faintest idea.
Demelza.
- Are you well?
- Quite well, thank 'ee.
I came in search of Garrick.
He scented a rabbit and...
Garrick!
Garrick, come to!
Is Ross recovered from the trial?
He rarely speaks of it.
And your news?
The child?
Is he pleased?
Not exactly.
You've not told him.
He don't wish for another.
Since Julia, he...
He haven't the heart for it.
And we're to blame.
'Tis not my belief.
It's good of you to say so, but the fact that there's still discord between our families...
There is.
And I think 'twill not be lightly set aside.
By Ross at least.
Garrick!
When we strike, it must be clean and swift and out of sight.
Giss on, man!
You're talking to the master now.
Gentlemen, a good night's work?
Well, a good deal nearer Trevorgie than this time yesterday!
Go home and get some rest.
None of that for the wicked!
It's home to breakfast and then away to Truro.
My finances require urgent attention.
- Demelza.
- Ross.
- You first.
- No, you.
I want to apologise.
I've been distracted of late.
But there are things I've been wishing to say to you...
And I you...
About our finances.
My shares in Wheal Leisure are the only thing of value we have.
I've begun work on this new tunnel to try and improve our chances of the mine becoming more profitable, but still, our own coffers are almost bare.
It doesn't need to be like that.
You're head purser at the mine.
Why won't you take a wage?
I prefer to plough every last penny into the mine.
We have, however, a more pressing concern.
Last year, I asked Pascoe to find me a loan of 1,000 pounds.
The interest, at 40%, is due this week.
- 400 pounds?
- Yes.
How is half such a sum to be found?
What's to be done?
Ride to Truro, see if Pascoe's managed to get the loan extended for another year.
In the meantime, the more I work in the mine, the better our chances of reaching Trevorgie.
And the interest?
Look about you.
See what you can bear to part with.
Then look again.
Mistress Demelza!
Have you come to steal my heart?
No, sir.
I've come to visit your cow.
It wasn't easy, but I've secured agreement for your loan to be extended for another year at the same exorbitant rate, provided this year's interest is forthcoming tomorrow.
- A mere pounds!
- Quite so.
She do look fair sick, Sir Hugh.
What treatment has she had?
Well, all manner of blisters, clysters, salves and poultices, all to no avail.
But I've no doubt you'll offer better advice.
I will.
Start afresh with a better beast.
How went the shareholders' meeting?
Well enough, but for the appearance of a new shareholder.
Tankard?
The Warleggan proxy?
You heard.
Are they on a mission to own the company?
No, sir.
Just to own me.
This cow you speak of - your Emma?
Oh, she's our pride and joy, sir, so we could not let her go except at a goodly price.
Well, not if the rumours be true.
Your husband's financial difficulties.
Of course, I'm always happy to help a friend, and I could be persuaded to pay the "Goodly price"
if the terms were right.
And what terms would you require?
Oh, merely a kind of interest, payable here and here and here.
- Sir Hugh, you forget yourself!
- On the contrary...
Judas, I think my dog has better manners!
Sir Hugh, I believe you're wanted at the house.
Urgently.
Sir Hugh's a mite unruly sometimes.
Should you decide to brave his company again,
I will personally undertake to protect you from his enthusiasm.
I'm much obliged, sir.
I'm not overjoyed to think of Sir Hugh in possession of Emma.
No, nor I, but you said she must be sold, and I've secured a buyer.
So, what else must go?
Well, not the oxen.
Without them, we cannot plough.
The pigs, the chickens.
- The clock.
- The carpet.
The settle.
At least one chair.
- My brooch is worth £100.
- That was a gift.
But it may need to be sold in the end.
I wonder what Garrick would fetch on the open market?
One overgrown mongrel, carnivorous.
- Crockery breaker.
- Stealer of pies.
Do you suppose there'd be any takers?
May I fetch you anything from market, Uncle?
- You're going in with Unwin, are you?
- Good Lord, no!
I'm in need of some sensible conversation.
Well, then, Hicks must escort you.
Caroline,
- But... you cannot be roaming about the countryside unaccompanied.
No, Uncle.
But if I were to go, what could I bring you?
Sugared almonds?
Marzipan?
You spoil your old uncle, don't you, eh?
Dr Enys!
What a lucky encounter.
How are you, Miss Penvenen?
I have a tingling in my throat.
- Do you think it could be serious?
- I very much doubt it.
You seem otherwise in the peak of health.
I hope it's not Morbus strangulatorius.
If it were the putrid throat, you'd soon know it.
Is that what Ross Poldark's daughter had?
- He's not exactly blessed with luck, is he?
- No.
And that doesn't seem about to change.
How humiliating it must be for him.
Less for her, I suppose.
I doubt either of them see it that way.
Will you excuse me, ma'am?
I have patients to see to.
Mistress Poldark.
Ross.
How are you?
No, you don't look at all well.
Can it be the anxieties of the trial?
Nor you, George.
Could you have had some disappointment?
None that I know of.
Perhaps it is yet to come.
Ross.
- How did you manage it?
- It was quite straightforward.
We sold pretty much everything we own.
See, a real horse is much better than a hobbyhorse, is it not?
Why does Uncle George not visit us any more?
Uncle George is not our friend.
Is Uncle Ross our friend?
In time.
In time, I hope he will be.
You're quite the favourite with Mrs Tabb these days.
She cannot abide Dr Choake.
I suspect she prefers the cheapness of my remedies.
Or possibly their efficacy.
Aunt Agatha, Dr Enys has agreed to take tea with us.
You know how she loves to hear of the latest dread diseases.
Is it my imagination or is Francis in better spirits these days?
Scrofula, that's it.
Great purple blotches, swellings of the neck.
Since the trial, you would not know him.
I cannot tell if it's because Ross was saved or if something happened while he was in Bodmin.
He shared your room the night before the trial.
Did you notice any strangeness in mood or behaviour?
Not that I can recall.
From something he said, I had the feeling...
You may think me callous or hysterical, but I could almost believe that Francis had intended to kill himself.
Did he?
Whatever occurred, be glad of it.
He came to town a broken man.
He returned...
Like that.
Mr Paynter!
Who, sir?
Me, sir?
Nay, not I, sir.
You will recall the bargain we struck some time ago?
Bargain?
I never struck no such thing.
I don't hold with 'em, does I?
In exchange for testifying against Ross Poldark.
Nay, p'raps I do recall something.
Thinkin' it over, I wasn't meself in court.
Maybe it slipped my mind.
In which case, 'tis only fair to give 'ee back yer guineas.
Ten, were it?
- 15.
- That is not what we have come for.
- For what, then?
This.
You see much of Ross and Demelza?
Why do you ask?
I so wish our families could be reconciled, but Ross is determined to keep his distance.
I wonder, might I ask you to speak to them on our behalf?
What could I say?
Francis is to give a supper when the harvest is in, to our tenants and friends.
Would you ask Ross and Demelza to join us, to stay the night?
You, too, are most welcome.
I'll happily carry the invitation.
I cannot guarantee how it will be received.
Sorry it's not much.
Ross, I've been wanting to speak of something, but haven't yet found the right moment.
Surgeon's here.
- Oh, Dwight!
- Hope 'ee's eaten afore!
Admiring our harvest?
I hope to augment it with an invitation.
From Trenwith.
Obviously, we won't accept.
Surely we can't forget that it's thanks to them that we lost Julia?
Or that George is still their bosom friend?
- Is he?
- You'd have us overlook it?
Have I said that?
No, in truth, I'm in no haste to go to Trenwith.
- Then we're in accord.
- It do appear so.
Dead!
He's dead!
He's dead!
He's mortal dead!
Who could have done such a thing?
He had no enemies.
He were the sweetest, kindliest, most peaceable cove a body could meet!
And ne'er a cross word did pass his lips.
And now I left a widow, all forlorn, without a penny in the world.
Not e'en to bury the poor soul, God rest it!
There is this.
When we moved him, they fell out his pockets.
Gold sov'reigns?
Gold sov'reigns?
Where'd he get such?
Where indeed?
Why, the mizzerly, mazzerly, stinkin' black worm!
He had 'em about 'im and never tell'd me?
- Reckon 'tis from the trade?
- That's unlikely.
I'll knock 'im sideways down Stippy-Stappy Lane!
Then give him a rare good burying.
Rum and vittles, hymns and viols, widow's weeds for poor ole Prudie.
'Tis a matter of looking respectable, 'tis.
We must send the ole man off 50 ways.
I've known him since I was a child.
He was the most useless servant under the sun.
But he taught me how to smoke a pipe and cheat at Loo.
They left the money.
- Yes?
- Well, then it was no random attack.
What, then?
- Vengeance.
- What for?
You were in court.
You heard his original statement.
He was ready to testify against me.
But then he did not.
What if he was paid to speak against me - hence the 15 guineas - and then changed his mind?
George has played us all.
Would George wreck all that we have?
The family, the business, now our servant?
That seems to be his aim.
Can we do nothing?
It suits George to have myself and Francis at odds.
Perhaps we should accept the invitation to Trenwith.
Are you sure, Ross?
Some things cannot be mended.
But some can.
- This is your doing?
- You're not displeased?
Far from it!
Cousin!
It's an unexpected pleasure.
Thank you for bringing him.
It means the world to Francis.
You look well, Cousin.
Demelza.
Francis.
Welcome.
I 'ave 'un!
I 'ave 'un!
I 'ave 'un!
What 'ave 'ee?
What 'ave 'ee?
What 'ave 'ee?
A neck!
A neck!
A neck!
Hurrah!
Hurrah!
Hurrah!
Elizabeth.
I was expecting a small, private gathering.
Instead, I find myself ambushed by sans-culottes!
Hardly, Mama!
These are our tenants and friends.
Trust me, a few crusts will not curry favour when they turn on you.
Ask the Marquis de Launay, if you can find his head!
You look radiant, mater-in-law!
Are you quite well, Francis?
Never better.
Come then, friends!
Shall we have some dancing?
Yes, I think we shall!
I ordered you to scare him, not assassinate him!
- Tom got a little carried away.
- This is disastrous.
You think Poldark will know who's behind it?
I wouldn't be surprised if he's outside my house right now!
How do you like my new coat?
I ordered my tailor to make it the double of Prinny's!
You most definitely need one, George.
Well, can we go to the Penvenen party?
My intended will be impatient to see me.
By all means.
Caroline?
Come in.
Caroline, my dear, are you ready yet?
- Our guests will be arriving soon.
- I have such a pain.
But Tom Choake was here just now.
Did he not bleed you?
Would you have me submit to his butchery?
So, what do you propose?
This is the last bottle of the '83.
After that, we'll have to resort to cheap gin!
Did you hear I quarrelled with George?
No.
What was the cause?
Oh, well, these things tend to sink in slowly.
At first, you barely notice, and then, one day, you wake up to the realisation that the man who's been your friend for years is a complete and utter blackguard.
Well, I don't disagree.
Indeed, I strongly believe he's behind the assault on Jud.
What will you do?
Till I can prove it...nothing.
But when I do...
- A letter for you, Doctor.
- Thank you.
Someone taken ill at Killewarren.
Tell them to be ill at a more convenient time!
It's a complaint of the throat.
I must go.
Elizabeth, where's my port?
Lady Whitworth says that fashions in London and Bath are now verging on the indecent.
- What exactly does that mean?
- Bosoms!
Acres of 'em, exposed like capons on a platter!
You look pale, child.
Are you unwell?
No.
No, that is, I believe I may be sickening for something.
Get Elizabeth to mix you a rouge.
Elizabeth goes out so seldom, she has no need of it.
It's criminal that this should be the highlight of your social calendar, Elizabeth.
I know I would be driven quite mad had I only farm hands and kitchen maids to converse with.
If you'll beg my pardon, I must take a breath of air.
Damn it!
I'm partial to a Harvest supper!
Gladdens the heart to enjoy the fruits of one's own labours.
Remind me when you were last in your fields with a scythe, sir?
Is Miss Penvenen not here?
Nor her uncle.
Most irregular.
Invited to supper and not a sign of the hosts!
Shall we hunt them down?
Ah, McNeil!
What news?
Can we rest easy in our beds, knowing you've purged the district of violence?
I lay claim to no such thing, sir.
Only last night we had a murder on our doorstep.
Surely not.
Captain Poldark's manservant.
Paul Daniel?
Where 'ee be?
Do 'ee go draw th' spigot o' th' next keg o' brandy?
I've an urge t' address th' conflagration.
Jud Paynter.
'E were a whited sepulchre.
But now 'e's passed on to flowery fields and green meads.
When Paul Daniel come back, we'll raise a toast an' send 'im on his way.
- He's gone!
- We know that, fool!
From his slab!
'Tis empty!
The corpse ain't there!
- What is it?
What is it?
- 'Tis they body-stealers!
They've robbed me o' my ole man!
My niece has been ill for three days.
Dr Choake attended her, of course.
But she grows worse and she insisted on sending for you.
- Did Dr Choake attempt a diagnosis?
- Quinsy.
- With or without fever?
- Without.
But she can hardly swallow.
- Is it the putrid throat?
- That, we will shortly ascertain.
Will you open your mouth, please?
Might a servant fetch me some warm water and salt?
I'll see it done directly.
I think I might be able to help you, but you must keep absolutely still.
Can you do that?
Adams or Wyatt?
- For what?
- Our house in London.
Caroline will want the latest thing.
She can well afford it.
I wonder whether it shouldn't be Wyatt?
His Pantheon in Oxford Street has pleasing dimensions.
Perhaps you'd better secure the lady before you start spending her fortune.
Mr Aukitt.
Excuse me.
Remind me, you still have shares in Wheal Leisure?
Yes, I do.
May I tell you a secret?
Old Fred Pendarves?
He was a mine captain at Grambler in my father's day.
For a month now, I've had him prospecting over my land.
To what end?
- Ross, you know I'll never make a farmer.
It's mining.
Mining.
It's what I keep coming back to.
It's what he wanted for me.
God knows, he'd be as surprised as me to think that any of what he taught me had sunk in, but that's the truth of it.
I must start mining again.
Don't let me deter you, but even a hole in the ground costs money.
I have money.
A few hundred put by.
If things had gone badly at the trial,
I would have given it to Demelza.
Now, I'm minded to spend it on a final attempt to secure my own destiny.
If only to spite George.
I think the best revenge is to succeed in your own right, despite his interventions.
Almost there.
All done.
Now, rinse your mouth with salt water.
It'll get easier now.
What did you do?
When did you last eat fish, Miss Penvenen?
Three days ago.
You must be more careful in future.
A fish bone.
Can I do anything for Horace while I'm here?
- Mr Aukitt?
- Can you help?
- What ails him?
- A fatal gaming encounter.
I doubt you can save him.
The ladies have deserted us.
Yes.
Perhaps we bore them!
Perhaps!
I think I must go to bed.
I find I'm less able to hold my liquor these days.
No, no, no.
Stay.
Finish your drink.
Thank you, Cousin.
For what?
I never thought to see you under my roof again.
I never thought to be here.
'Tis the shame of it.
To 'ave an 'usband and to not 'ave an 'usband.
- I'll never live it down!
- Sshh now.
Then there's the burying.
'Ee can't have a burying without a body.
No.
- So, not only am I robbed of an 'usband,
I'm robbed of the pleasure of seeing 'im planted in the ground.
Miss Penvenen, I trust you are on the mend?
I believe I am, sir.
Ah, have I missed all the fun?
You appear to have had some of your own.
Must be the ride and the night air.
Was it the putrid throat?
Thankfully not.
I did have to sedate William Aukitt, though.
He was so agitated, he could barely speak.
- What ailed him?
- A fit of the Warleggans?
He'd been talking to George and before he knew it, he'd signed away some shares, in a mining venture.
He did not specify Wheal Leisure.
Did George look happy?
Yes.
So 'ee was lying on the table.
And I wakes up in me winding sheet wi' a terrible thirst.
Dreamin' o' gin.
So off I carts to Jake's kiddley for some ale.
And what 'appens?
Ther's all up an' screaming like stuck pigs.
An' falling over each other to get out the door.
So, in I goes, drinks me fill an' I come 'ome to Prudie.
And what do I find?
All fligged out in fancy widow's weeds!
And folk feasting and drinking at my expense and nought left but a jug o' brandy and a winding sheet!
Tedn' fit.
Tedn' right.
Tedn' fair.
Tedn' proper!
Truly, I say unto 'ee, a prophet is never honoured in 'is own land.
Ross.
- I thought everyone had retired.
- I thought so too.
Is Demelza about?
I think she was feeling unwell and went up early.
I thought I'd clear up.
Oh, let me help you.
I must thank you for coming.
It was a good day.
Heaven knows how we've paid for it, but Francis was insistent.
The Poldarks have fallen low.
You must be sorry you married into the family.
Do you think I should answer that?
Perhaps I should not have asked it.
Francis tells me he has some money put by.
I'm surprised he doesn't use it for this household.
Oh, no.
He's quite adamant.
It's a special sum to be used for a special purpose.
- Does George know he has it?
- George gave it to him.
Did he?
In recompense for his gaming losses to Matthew Sanson.
Do you believe that?
Should I not?
George is not known for his philanthropy.
But Francis is changed.
Yes.
And you, I think.
For the better?
I wouldn't go that far!
I remember a time you were already perfect.
To me, I mean.
That was long ago.
And you've been more than happy since.
- With Demelza.
- And you've grown up.
Not too much, I hope.
Today, in the fields, you looked like a girl of 16.
Your age when I first knew you.
These past months have changed me.
Has made me appreciate what I have, rather than what I lack.
That's very wise.
After all, there's no point thinking about what might have been.
But you and I would never have been happy together.
Our characters are too different.
True.
But cannot love overcome such obstacles?
Surely, there's a greater impediment?
You're a lady.
You could never have played the scullery maid.
- Perhaps I have hidden talents.
- I don't dispute that.
For somehow, you've managed to bring the light back to Francis' eyes.
I cannot imagine how.
Can you not?
You should go to bed, Ross.
Demelza will be thinking you've gone astray.
Goodnight, then.
You're awake?
I thought you'd retired long ago.
I went out.
Out?
Prudie came.
Jud's alive.
What?
Or at least until Prudie do kill 'im again!
Jud's alive?
What happened?
How?
Oh, ask me tomorrow.
I'm weary to the bone.
Are you sure?
I did see him with my own eyes.
Elizabeth looked well tonight.
She did.
Her mother thinks were she not wed to Francis, she'd have half the aristocracy at her feet.
But she is wed to Francis.
And she seems content to be so.
Do you remember our last visit here?
At Christmas?
When you first told me you loved me.
And you told me you were with child.
'Twas different then.
You were glad I was with child.
We were in our first days of love.
And you would never have looked twice at another woman.
Demelza...
What man does not occasionally look at another woman?
Or woman occasionally look at another man?
And what man or woman of sense does not have qualms about bringing a child into the world?
Demelza?
Yes, Ross.
Yes, Ross.
I know that you don't want it and I know it's just another burden to you, but there's no preventing it now, so all we can do is...
How long have you known?
Since the trial.
Good God!
And not to tell me.
You said you didn't want another, not after Julia.
Nor did I.
Nor do I.
The very thought of it, a child to grow into our hearts and then be lost to us again - could you bear it?
I could not.
But if a child is coming... ..That's different.
A child is not a thought.
It is flesh and blood.
And if you can risk your heart again...
I can.
Then so can I.
Are you suggesting we go into partnership?
- Yes.
Now you're under obligation to me.
Is that where you prefer your men?
Is that wise?
Will Ross be happy?
And who's to tell 'im where I got 'em?
I've increased my shareholding in his mine, so I hope I won't have cause to inflict undue pressure on him.
You think you can do as you please, while I always do as you bid me?
Think again!
- I told Mistress not to go, but...
- Prudie!
He even tried to stop her.
PreviouslyonAngel From Hell...
ALLISON/AMY:
Oh!
I'm so sorry.
No worries.
Accidents happen.
I'll bet you're a very sweet person, Dr. Allison.
How did you know my name?
It's me, Amy, from the farmers' market!
Who's this Bit-O-Honey?
I'm Brad.
I'm the brother.
Your mother died 412 days ago, and since then, you've buried yourself inwork,buriedyourself ina relationship.
How do you know all that stuff?
Honey, I'm your guardian angel.
He'sworkingon boning yourbestfriend.
Evan and I hooked up!
(groans)
It's not that I believe you're an angel.
But?
I could use a weird friend.
Do they come any weirder?
(chuckles)
So, remember that weird woman from the coffee shop a few weeks back?
The one who put a sexual spell on me?
Yeah.
Amy.
She's been texting, so I told her she could meet us for lunch.
Do you think you can keep your flirting in check?
That was a one-time thing.
I don't usually go for a mid-50s woman.
Hey!
Aw...
Sorry I'm late.
Hey, you remember my brother Brad.
Who could forget the hottest brother since Idris Elba?
You're pretty fly yourself, girl.
Mm!
It's happening again.
I'm sorry.
And it's a little un-PC this time.
All right, kids, dig in.
No arguing.
My treat.
Uh, this is a pizza place...
with their own food.
This is how hungry I am.
Should raw oysters be room temp?
So, Allison, how's the love life?
Personal.
Private.
I'm all about discretion.
You know, last night, I had a lovely time with a certain vendor from the farmers' market, and I will not name names, so don't even try.
Okay.
Was it the oyster guy?
It was the Oyster King of L.A.!
Yes!
(laughs) And I won't go into details other than to say four orgasms.
So, Brad, what's your O-count these days?
I'm going through a massive dry spell.
Yeah, uh, two months.
Two months?
Well, that doesn't make any sense.
I know.
Oh, come on!
Oh, unless, of course, you're still living in Allison's converted garage.
Yeah.
Still getting back on my feet after the divorce.
I'll bet it's hard to seal the deal when the key to your house is the wide button on a clicker.
I do tend to lose 'em coming around the side gate.
I'll bet you do.
Maybe what you need is a change of address, my friend.
Allison, it's your turn to share.
Come on.
Has it been hard to get back out there after the whole Evan fiasco?
How he cheated on you.
With your best friend.
In your own house...
I got it.
I was there.
Happened to me.
She has been a little paralyzed lately.
No, I have not been paralyzed.
I opened an online dating account.
Well, good for you.
Yeah.
I found this really great app where I can study guys' profiles and really think about my choices.
Not good for you.
And, of course, you are overthinking this.
What you need to do is turn off the old decision-maker and just say... shuck it.
(slurps) Mmm!
That's delicious.
I'm going in.
Attaboy!
I don't... think those are very fresh.
Mm-mm.
Couldn't do it.
My throat literally closed up.
More for me.
(chuckles)
♪ ♪
You got to go with your gut more, kid.
Turn off all those voices in your head.
Said the woman claiming to be an angel.
Oh, whoa, whoa, wait, stop.
Now, you can't tell anybody that I'm your guardian angel, okay?
That would be very bad for me.
Tons of paperwork.
How 'bout we don't even talk about the angel stuff?
Because I don't believe you're an angel.
As I was saying, go with that guy, not that guy.
Grab the free sample, huh?
Pet the doggy.
Smell the baby.
(inhales) Mm.
Whoa.
That is not a clean baby.
Ooh, test the "Wet Paint" sign.
They're almost always wrong.
Oh.
That one was right.
Hey, Dad.
This is Amy.
She needs to use the restroom.
Bit of a white lie.
I just had to come up and meet Papa Bear.
(chuckles)
Marv!
Oh!
(chuckles)
You're getting a face full of the sisters now, aren't you?
(chuckles) I'm sorry.
Or should I say "You're welcome"?
"Sorry" works.
Well, congratulations on that one.
She's a masterpiece.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Who are you?
Amy.
I'm Allison's new pal.
Hey, anybody want to buy some oysters?
Only a couple dozen left.
MARV:
Yeah, no, you can't sell seafood in the office.
Oh, of course, yes.
Beverly Hills, hmm?
MARV:
Allison, do you know how late you are?
That's a real question, by the way.
My watch stopped working again.
I know, and I feel terrible.
But I did text Nancy, and she pushed my 2:00.
Cool if I come backstage?
And that area's no longer sanitary.
Just call next time, okay?
'Cause you're never late and it's a little weird.
Is he always like this?
Shaking with worry like a little Chihuahua?
What's happening?
(chuckles) Your daughter is just... fine.
And, now, if you'll kindly direct me to your restroom,
I'd like to take a little birdbath in your sink.
That way.
When did you start palling around with an oyster peddler in a vest?
She did help me find out that Evan was cheating on me.
I think she comes from a good place.
She's going to the bathroom with the door open.
Oops!
My bad!
(door shuts)
(muffled):
Forgot we were in Beverly Hills.
Mmm.
Hey.
What's going on?
Thanks for coming by.
Have a seat.
Okay.
How's your day so far?
Well, I...
Listen, I got some rough news, and I want to tell you in person.
I signed a lease on a new apartment.
I'm moving out.
That's great.
Yes.
For me.
But things have been so brutal for you.
With your boyfriend cheating on you.
With your best friend.
In your own house.
I just know that you-you felt safe with Big Bro Brad here.
The only time I was scared was the night you screamed when you saw a bat.
I wasn't screaming.
I was scrambling its sonar.
(knocking) Bat.
Get the broom.
Hello!
Oh.
(chuckles) Hey, there you are.
Hey there, Allison.
You know,
I felt terrible about forgetting my wallet today at our lunch, so I wanted to come by, give you these flowers to say thank you.
Aw.
That's so thoughtful.
Oh.
Wow.
So, this is where the magic doesn't happen.
I get it. (chuckles) Not anymore.
I'm moving out.
Good for you.
So, you're escaping the, uh, vortex of celibacy.
That's enough.
(chuckles)
I don't take shots at where you live.
Where do you live?
Just south of here.
Gorgeous doorman building,
(phone buzzes) very hip, full of beautiful people.
Hey, you know what might help the vibe in this place?
One of those chairs shaped like a giant hand.
You know?
And I think... yeah... it would just fit through.
(phone chimes)
Ooh.
Do we have a match on your dating app?
Actually, yes.
Yes, we do.
Yeah!
And this one looks interesting.
He works downtown.
He's a defense attorney.
Sounds promising.
Swipe right for yes.
Though, hold the phone--
You are.
he likes a late harvest Malbec.
Mm.
Could be a douche.
No, I'm out.
Swiping left.
Though he loves reading.
Mostly science fiction.
Your sister just froze.
How do we reboot her?
I got this.
Dude, coaster.
Wow.
Well... what we have here is a terminal case of overthinking.
And the only cure?
A night of underthinking.
You and I are going out tonight.
I can't tonight.
No, I have cribbage with my dad.
Oh, "I love cribbage" is something no one has ever said.
Go out with me to a little club called... (whispers):
Aura.
Aura?
Yeah, we can't get in there.
I know the bouncer.
Yes, we will.
Allison, go with your gut.
What do you say to an epic ladies' night out?
Do it.
Do it.
Do it.
It'll help you take your mind off me moving.
What?
Oh, uh, yes!
Yes.
Yes!
No, I can't bail on my dad.
Uh, it's already happening.
Go for Marv.
(phone chimes)
(line ringing)
Hey, sweetie.
Hi, uh, Dad.
I've got some bad news.
I'm gonna have to cancel tonight.
I...
Go with your gut.
I...
It's my gut.
I have leaky gut.
Yes.
Wow, you're terrible at this.
That's 110% oyster-related.
I know.
They just looked so good.
Yeah, I had one out on the deck by myself.
Around 6:19.
Wrap it up.
Okay, Dad, I got to...
I got to go.
I'll see you at the office.
And so the night begins.
All right, Allison, what are you gonna wear out tonight?
Don't think about it.
Go.
The red jumpsuit in the back of my closet.
Yes!
No, I can't pull off a jumpsuit.
No one can.
They're ridiculous.
They're like adult onesies.
But the gut has spoken.
Next, left-handed painkiller or right-handed painkiller?
Neither.
Suit yourself.
Rock and roll!
Okay.
All right.
(whoops)
Have my phone.
(dance music blaring) Vodka or tequila?
Go!
Vodka!
(grunts, burps) Oh!
(whoops)
Dance floor!
Okay!
(both whooping)
Yeah!
Mm-hmm.
All right, cowgirl, we need to find you a man.
What are you into?
Don't think about it.
Go.
Great ass!
(chuckles) I'm an ass girl.
I had no idea.
I'm on it.
Now, do you want to see a dating app in real life?
You tell me, and I will swipe right or left for you, okay?
Trust your gut.
Let's go!
(whoops)
No.
Nope.
Hey!
Whoa.
Hi.
I'm Allison.
Hi.
I'm Doug.
Have we met?
Oh, my God.
You're the guy I got matched with on my dating app.
What a bizarre coincidence!
There's no such thing as a coincidence.
This is 100% pure, uncut angel magic.
Now, are we swiping this guy right?
Trust your gut.
What does it say?
My gut's telling me to dance with him.
Well, then that is step one.
Step two is to kiss him.
Because you will not be certain until you do, okay?
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
There was no answer at your sister's.
Uh, yeah, she went out with Amy.
I knew she wasn't sick.
She's a horrible liar.
Yeah.
She always uses the time 6:19.
Everybody's got their tells.
It's like you with the flop sweat.
You going somewhere?
Yeah, moving out.
Got a new place.
Really?
Yeah.
It's incredible, Dad.
Balcony, brand-new kitchen, rooftop access to, like, a pool and spa.
Ah.
Sounds expensive.
I know.
You think it would be.
But it's not.
No?
It's just you said things were kind of slow at work.
No, work's good.
I, uh, I sold seven houses yesterday.
Brad...
I messed up, Dad.
I messed up.
I don't know what happened.
Amy was telling me about going with my gut and the next thing I know,
I'm signing a two-year lease.
Six months down.
Amy's behind this?
Who is this woman?
I tried to Google her.
Nothing.
Google knows everything.
I tell you, it was so weird
I called this cop friend of mine, huh?
Asked him to do a background check.
Maybe he's got something.
(phone line ringing)
Hello?
Jerry.
Hey.
Uh, anything on that Amy character?
JERRY:
Oh, yeah.
Turns out that woman's got quite a record.
I knew it.
They're all misdemeanors, and honestly I've never heard of most of these crimes before.
Aggravated nudity.
Impersonating a vehicle.
Indecent shoplifting.
That is a weird rap sheet.
I did find her current residence-- it's a halfway house over on Birchwood.
She said she lived in a beautiful doorman building.
Anyway, I also found a video in her file.
I just sent you the link.
Great, we'll look at it now.
What?
You can't serve me?
Why?
I have a shirt and shoes on.
Whoa, I just saw a rat back there.
Oh, come on.
Oh.
Whoa.
(speaking indistinctly, mouth full)
Okay, yeah.
I'd have to call that indecent shoplifting.
Thank you, Jerry.
Thanks.
Thanks very much.
All right, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna try not to freak out, here.

Big Bird stole my watch.

Stop that.
No, it's Aura.
It's a place called Aura.

Okay.
(music blaring) It's really good to be dancing.
Last year, I got in a pretty bad car accident.
Oh, totally!
What is up with the Kardashians?
Sorry, if I could just, uh...
My daughter, it's...
I'm so sorry.
Actually, let me take care of this, Dad.
Okay.

How's the door tonight?
I used to do a little road-housing back in college, so...
So Pops is freaking out,
His daughter's in there, he thinks she might be in a little bit of trouble.
I was hoping maybe we could do a quick pop-in.

All right, this is all just a big misunderstanding.
Okay?
Uh, no harm, no foul.
She just kissed my husband!
Well, we all make mistakes.
You brought a baby into a nightclub, so...
I am so, so sorry about all of this.
(screaming)
Allison!
Kev, we got a fight on the floor!
Hey, that baby just took my choker.
Uh... that's it.
You've had your fun, baby.
Now hand over the choker, or I'm gonna make you wish you were never Bjorn.

Okay, what are you two even doing here?
Just thought you might want to know your friend here, the Jolly Blonde Giant, has a criminal record.
Oh, tiny stuff.
And most of it was when I was young and in my 40s.
Tell how you stole my watch.
I did not steal your watch.
And how you drunkenly Pooh-Beared it all up inside of a donut shop.
I did not steal your watch.
Why don't you tell us about how you lied to us about where you live.
All right, what the hell is going on?
Allison, come on.
You know me.
I know you said you were my friend.
But my friends don't lie to me.
Okay, honey, I want you to trust me, so why don't we all go over to my place?
You can see where I live, learn all about me.
I have no secrets.
Give me another chance, okay?
Okay.
Last chance.
Let's go.
Okay.
We gonna get all cozy and fit in one car?
Santa's got some room right here, if you've been a good girl.
(laughs) I can't stop.
All right, this is it.
This is where I live.
It's a supervised facility for people getting back on their feet.
I'm a live-in counselor here.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
So are you a counselor here or are you a resident?
I am a counselor,
Allison, in residence.
So this is the doorman building?
You may see a halfway house with a security staff, but what I see is a grand doorman building.
And the people here are beautiful.
That's a great story.
Counterpoint:
here's my stolen watch.
Case closed.
Saddle up.
Marv...
listen.
I felt bad that things between the two of us got off on the wrong foot, so I had your watch fixed.
Check it out.
I was going to leave it at your office tomorrow.
(knock on doorframe) Yeah.
Ah.
This must be your doorman, completing the Park Avenue vibe.
No visitors after 10:00 p.m.
I'm marking you down for this one, Amy.
Oh...
We were just leaving.
Allison...
Good night, Amy.
(sighs)
Ettu,HotPockets?
We're not doing that anymore.
I am sorry you're stuck with this new apartment.
I'm good.
Brad... this place is incredible!
I know.
It's expensive.
Hey, you guys moving in?
Yes!
Just me, though.
Not her.
Who is my sister.
We aren't dating.
No.
Ever.
Never were dating.
I'm Brad.
Single Brad.
Hey, Single Brad.
I'm Katie.
It'll be so nice to finally have a man on this floor.
This place is, like, all girls.
I used to be a bouncer.
KATIE:
That's great.
See you around.
Amy is a genius.
Oh, really?
Because one cute girl lives here?
No, no, no.
I really think our lives are getting better.
Yours, yeah.
I mean, you have this brand-new apartment.
It's great.
But how is Amy good for me?
You got out of the house last night.
You had an amazing time.
Before you kissed a married man.
Who had a wife.
Who had a baby.
That kiss was disgusting, by the way.
It was weird.
It was like it felt wrong the second I did it.
Exactly.
Now you know that guy's not right for you.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess would have stared at that guy's profile for a whole week, not knowing he was a married dirtbag.
Amy.
Good God, I want this whole building to move in slow motion.
Oh, Dad, gross, you're...
Dad.
I know, right?
You can thank Amy, by the way.
She turned me onto this place.
Let's not speak of the giant.
I will say, however, it appears she fixed my watch.
She did fix it?
(knocks twice)
Hey.
Hey!
She's back!
Come on in.
What's going on?
Are you moving?
Yeah, seems like the next logical step after being kicked out.
Apparently, having guests after hours brought on a lot of scrutiny, even for counselors, so...
I can't believe we got you kicked out.
I'm sorry.
I should have told you that I lived at a halfway house, but I've asked your little human brain to process so much in the last few weeks,
I didn't think you could handle it all.
My little human brain?
Yeah, as opposed to the angel super computer
I got goin' on right up here.
(trilling) You were right.
I've been a little stuck and, uh, it felt really nice to make some decisions.
But then, you know, you start talking about being an angel and how you have this-this computer inside your head and I'm just like, what the hell am I doing with this woman?
So...
I am just going to ask you:
are you crazy?
Does it matter?
Yes!
Hey!
Hey, sister.
(laughs) Aw...
I heard you're leaving.
Yes, I am.
Are you bucking for my mini-fridge?
No.
I just wanted to say thank you.
Oh...
This woman is a godsend.
Aw, I'm really happy for you.
Call me anytime, okay?
Mm-hmm.
My phone is always on.
Okay.
Mute.
So leave a message.
(laughs)
Aw.
Nice girl.
Lots of problems.
Nose candy.
Ah... shuck it.
This is probably nuts, but, uh, hanging out with you, strangely, seems to be good for me.
Brad's moving out of the garage, so do you want to crash there for a while?
Allison, wow.
I would love to.
But are you sure?
Have you thought about this?
Not at all.
That's my girl.
Up top.
(laughs)
Why are you clapping?
I don't know.
Going with my gut.
Feels good.
I don't think it's going to fit.
Oh, it'll fit.
Right there.
Your new tenant has a box labeled "Loose Bones"...?
That's for a project, Marv.
Oh, thanks for being here on time this morning.
(pats rear)
I don't think her moving in is a good idea.
Dad, I know you've been worried about me since the breakup, and I appreciate that, but I'm going to be okay.

It's me, Amy, from the farmers' market!
- Who's this Bit-O-Honey?
- I'm Brad.
I'm the brother.
Your mother died 412 days ago, and since then, you've buried yourself in work, buried yourself in a relationship.
How do you know all that stuff?
Honey, I'm your guardian angel.
He's working on boning your best friend.
Evan and I hooked up!
It's not that I believe you're an angel.
- But?
- I could use a weird friend.
Do they come any weirder?
So, remember that weird woman from the coffee shop a few weeks back?
- The one who put a sexual spell on me?
- Yeah.
Amy.
She's been texting, so I told her she could meet us for lunch.
Do you think you can keep your flirting in check?
That was a one-time thing.
I don't usually go for a mid-50s woman.
Hey!
Aw...
Sorry I'm late.
Hey, you remember my brother Brad.
Who could forget the hottest brother since Idris Elba?
You're pretty fly yourself, girl.
Mm!
It's happening again.
I'm sorry.
And it's a little un-PC this time.
All right, kids, dig in.
No arguing.
My treat.
Uh, this is a pizza place...
with their own food.
This is how hungry I am.
Should raw oysters be room temp?
So, Allison, how's the love life?
Personal.
Private.
I'm all about discretion.
You know, last night, I had a lovely time with a certain vendor from the farmers' market, and I will not name names, so don't even try.
Okay.
Was it the oyster guy?
It was the Oyster King of L.A.!
Yes!
And I won't go into details other than to say four orgasms.
So, Brad, what's your O-count these days?
I'm going through a massive dry spell.
Yeah, uh, two months.
Two months?
Well, that doesn't make any sense.
I know.
Oh, come on!
Oh, unless, of course, you're still living in Allison's converted garage.
Yeah.
Still getting back on my feet after the divorce.
I'll bet it's hard to seal the deal when the key to your house is the wide button on a clicker.
I do tend to lose 'em coming around
- the side gate.
- I'll bet you do.
Maybe what you need is a change of address, my friend.
Allison, it's your turn to share.
Come on.
Has it been hard to get back out there after the whole Evan fiasco?
How he cheated on you.
With your best friend.
- In your own house...
- I got it.
I was there.
Happened to me.
She has been a little paralyzed lately.
No, I have not been paralyzed.
I opened an online dating account.
- Well, good for you.
- Yeah.
I found this really great app where I can study guys' profiles and really think about my choices.
Not good for you.
And, of course, you are overthinking this.
What you need to do is turn off the old decision-maker and just say... shuck it.
Mmm!
That's delicious.
- I'm going in.
- Attaboy!
I don't... think those are very fresh.
Mm-mm.
Couldn't do it.
My throat literally closed up.
More for me.
S01E03 Go with Your Gut
You got to go with your gut more, kid.
Turn off all those voices in your head.
Said the woman claiming to be an angel.
Oh, whoa, whoa, wait, stop.
Now, you can't tell anybody that I'm your guardian angel, okay?
That would be very bad for me.
Tons of paperwork.
How 'bout we don't even talk about the angel stuff?
Because I don't believe you're an angel.
As I was saying, go with that guy, not that guy.
Grab the free sample, huh?
Pet the doggy.
Smell the baby.
Mm.
Whoa.
That is not a clean baby.
Ooh, test the Wet Paint sign.
They're almost always wrong.
Oh.
That one was right.
Hey, Dad.
This is Amy.
She needs to use the restroom.
Bit of a white lie.
I just had to come up and meet Papa Bear.
Marv!
Oh!
You're getting a face full of the sisters now, aren't you?
I'm sorry.
Or should I say You're welcome?
Sorry works.
Well, congratulations on that one.
She's a masterpiece.
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
- Who are you?
- Amy.
I'm Allison's new pal.
Hey, anybody want to buy some oysters?
Only a couple dozen left.
Yeah, no, you can't sell seafood in the office.
Oh, of course, yes.
Beverly Hills, hmm?
Allison, do you know how late you are?
That's a real question, by the way.
- My watch stopped working again.
- I know, and I feel terrible.
But I did text Nancy, and she pushed my 2:00.
Cool if I come backstage?
And that area's no longer sanitary.
Just call next time, okay?
'Cause you're never late and it's a little weird.
Is he always like this?
Shaking with worry like a little Chihuahua?
What's happening?
Your daughter is just... fine.
And, now, if you'll kindly direct me to your restroom,
I'd like to take a little birdbath in your sink.
That way.
When did you start palling around with an oyster peddler in a vest?
She did help me find out that Evan was cheating on me.
I think she comes from a good place.
She's going to the bathroom with the door open.
Oops!
My bad!
Forgot we were in Beverly Hills.
Mmm.
Hey.
- What's going on?
- Thanks for coming by.
Have a seat.
Okay.
How's your day so far?
- Well, I...
- Listen, I got some rough news, and I want to tell you in person.
I signed a lease on a new apartment.
- I'm moving out.
- That's great.
Yes.
For me.
But things have been so brutal for you.
With your boyfriend cheating on you.
With your best friend.
In your own house.
I just know that you-you felt safe with Big Bro Brad here.
The only time I was scared was the night you screamed when you saw a bat.
I wasn't screaming.
I was scrambling its sonar.
Bat.
- Get the broom.
- Hello!
Oh.
Hey, there you are.
Hey there, Allison.
You know,
I felt terrible about forgetting my wallet today at our lunch, so I wanted to come by, give you these flowers to say thank you.
Aw.
That's so thoughtful.
Oh.
Wow.
So, this is where the magic doesn't happen.
- I get it.
- Not anymore.
I'm moving out.
Good for you.
So, you're escaping the, uh, vortex of celibacy.
That's enough.
I don't take shots at where you live.
Where do you live?
Just south of here.
Gorgeous doorman building, very hip, full of beautiful people.
Hey, you know what might help the vibe in this place?
One of those chairs shaped like a giant hand.
You know?
And I think... yeah... it would just fit through.
Ooh.
Do we have a match on your dating app?
Actually, yes.
Yes, we do.
Yeah!
And this one looks interesting.
He works downtown.
He's a defense attorney.
Sounds promising.
Swipe right for yes.
Though, hold the phone...
- You are. he likes a late harvest Malbec.
- Mm.
Could be a douche.
No, I'm out.
Swiping left.
Though he loves reading.
Mostly science fiction.
Your sister just froze.
How do we reboot her?
I got this.
Dude, coaster.
Wow.
Well... what we have here is a terminal case of overthinking.
And the only cure?
A night of underthinking.
You and I are going out tonight.
I can't tonight.
No, I have cribbage with my dad.
Oh, I love cribbage is something no one has ever said.
Go out with me to a little club called...
Aura.
Aura?
Yeah, we can't get in there.
I know the bouncer.
Yes, we will.
Allison, go with your gut.
What do you say to an epic ladies' night out?
Do it.
Do it.
Do it.
It'll help you take your mind off me moving.
- Oh, uh, yes!
Yes.
- Yes!
No, I can't bail on my dad.
Uh, it's already happening.
Go for Marv.
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi, uh, Dad.
I've got some bad news.
I'm gonna have to cancel tonight.
- I...
- Go with your gut.
I...
It's my gut.
- I have leaky gut.
Yes.
- Wow, you're terrible at this.
- That's 110% oyster-related.
- I know.
They just looked so good.
Yeah, I had one out on the deck
- by myself.
Around 6:19.
- Wrap it up.
Okay, Dad, I got to...
I got to go.
I'll see you at the office.
And so the night begins.
All right, Allison, what are you gonna wear out tonight?
Don't think about it.
Go.
The red jumpsuit in the back of my closet.
- Yes!
- No, I can't pull off
- a jumpsuit.
- No one can.
They're ridiculous.
They're like adult onesies.
But the gut has spoken.
Next, left-handed painkiller or right-handed painkiller?
- Neither.
- Suit yourself.
Rock and roll!
Okay.
All right.
Have my phone.
Vodka or tequila?
Go!
Vodka!
Oh!
Dance floor!
Okay!
Yeah!
Mm-hmm.
All right, cowgirl, we need to find you a man.
What are you into?
Don't think about it.
Go.
Great ass!
I'm an ass girl.
I had no idea.
I'm on it.
Now, do you want to see a dating app in real life?
You tell me, and I will swipe right or left for you, okay?
Trust your gut.
Let's go!
No.
Nope.
Hey!
Whoa.
Hi.
I'm Allison.
Hi.
I'm Doug.
Have we met?
Oh, my God.
You're the guy I got matched with on my dating app.
What a bizarre coincidence!
There's no such thing as a coincidence.
This is 100% pure, uncut angel magic.
Now, are we swiping this guy right?
Trust your gut.
What does it say?
My gut's telling me to dance with him.
Well, then that is step one.
Step two is to kiss him.
Because you will not be certain until you do, okay?
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
There was no answer at your sister's.
Uh, yeah, she went out with Amy.
I knew she wasn't sick.
She's a horrible liar.
Yeah.
She always uses the time 6:19.
Everybody's got their tells.
It's like you with the flop sweat.
You going somewhere?
Yeah, moving out.
Got a new place.
- Really?
- Yeah.
It's incredible, Dad.
Balcony, brand-new kitchen, rooftop access to, like, a pool and spa.
Ah.
Sounds expensive.
I know.
You think it would be.
- But it's not.
- No?
It's just you said things were kind of slow at work.
No, work's good.
I, uh, I sold seven houses yesterday.
- Brad...
- I messed up, Dad.
I messed up.
I don't know what happened.
Amy was telling me about going with my gut and the next thing I know,
I'm signing a two-year lease.
Six months down.
Amy's behind this?
Who is this woman?
I tried to Google her.
Nothing.
Google knows everything.
I tell you, it was so weird
I called this cop friend of mine, huh?
Asked him to do a background check.
Maybe he's got something.
- Hello?
- Jerry.
Hey.
Uh, anything on that Amy character?
Oh, yeah.
Turns out that woman's got quite a record.
I knew it.
They're all misdemeanors, and honestly I've never heard of most of these crimes before.
Aggravated nudity.
Impersonating a vehicle.
Indecent shoplifting.
That is a weird rap sheet.
I did find her current residence...
It's a halfway house over on Birchwood.
She said she lived in a beautiful doorman building.
Anyway, I also found a video in her file.
I just sent you the link.
Great, we'll look at it now.
What?
You can't serve me?
Why?
I have a shirt and shoes on.
Whoa, I just saw a rat back there.
Oh, come on.
Oh.
Whoa.
Okay, yeah.
I'd have to call that indecent shoplifting.
Thank you, Jerry.
Thanks.
Thanks very much.
All right, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna try not to freak out, here.
It's... hey, Dad, it's...

Your daughter is just fine.
Big Bird stole my watch.
Allison is with a criminal.
Where'd they go?
- Aura...
- Stop that.
No, it's Aura.
It's a place called Aura.
All right, come on, let's go.
Okay.
It's really good to be dancing.
Last year, I got in a pretty bad car accident.
Oh, totally!
What is up with the Kardashians?
Sorry, if I could just, uh...
My daughter, it's...
I'm so sorry.
Actually, let me take care of this, Dad.
Okay.
What's up...
Kevin.
How's the door tonight?
I used to do a little road-housing back in college, so...
So Pops is freaking out,
His daughter's in there, he thinks she might be in a little bit of trouble.
I was hoping maybe we could do a quick pop-in.
Give it a little looky-loo?
You're good.
Appreciate the solid from a fellow door dawg.
No?
Do you have change for a $50?
Normally, I would tip $20...
That's fine.
Shuck it.
Are you kidding me?
Oh!
Is this what you call going out for formula?
It's... not what it looks like?
Oh, my God.
You're married?
All right, this is all just a big misunderstanding.
Okay?
Uh, no harm, no foul.
She just kissed my husband!
Well, we all make mistakes.
You brought a baby into a nightclub, so...
I am so, so sorry about all of this.
Allison!
Kev, we got a fight on the floor!
Hey, that baby just took my choker.
Uh... that's it.
You've had your fun, baby.
Now hand over the choker, or I'm gonna make you wish you were never Bjorn.
Rule number one for bouncers... you want to use humor to defuse a crisis.
- Let's go.
- I did get the formula, it's in the...
What the hell did you get me into, Amy?
Okay, what are you two even doing here?
Just thought you might want to know your friend here, the Jolly Blonde Giant, has a criminal record.
Oh, tiny stuff.
And most of it was when I was young and in my 40s.
Tell how you stole my watch.
I did not steal your watch.
And how you drunkenly Pooh-Beared it all up inside of a donut shop.
I did not steal your watch.
Why don't you tell us about how you lied to us about where you live.
All right, what the hell is going on?
Allison, come on.
You know me.
I know you said you were my friend.
But my friends don't lie to me.
Okay, honey, I want you to trust me, so why don't we all go over to my place?
You can see where I live, learn all about me.
I have no secrets.
Give me another chance, okay?
Okay.
Last chance.
- Let's go.
- Okay.
We gonna get all cozy and fit in one car?
Santa's got some room right here, if you've been a good girl.
I can't stop.
All right, this is it.
This is where I live.
It's a supervised facility for people getting back on their feet.
I'm a live-in counselor here.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
So are you a counselor here or are you a resident?
I am a counselor,
Allison, in residence.
So this is the doorman building?
You may see a halfway house with a security staff, but what I see is a grand doorman building.
And the people here are beautiful.
That's a great story.
Counterpoint... here's my stolen watch.
Case closed.
Saddle up.
Marv...
listen.
I felt bad that things between the two of us got off on the wrong foot, so I had your watch fixed.
Check it out.
I was going to leave it at your office tomorrow.
Yeah.
Ah.
This must be your doorman, completing the Park Avenue vibe.
No visitors after 10:00 p.m.
I'm marking you down for this one, Amy.
- Oh...
- We were just leaving.
- Allison...
- Good night, Amy.
Et tu, Hot Pockets?
We're not doing that anymore.
No?
I am sorry you're stuck with this new apartment.
I'm good.
Brad... this place is incredible!
I know.
It's expensive.
Hey, you guys moving in?
Yes!
Just me, though.
Not her.
Who is my sister.
We aren't dating.
No.
Ever.
Never were dating.
I'm Brad.
Single Brad.
Hey, Single Brad.
I'm Katie.
It'll be so nice to finally have a man on this floor.
This place is, like, all girls.
I used to be a bouncer.
That's great.
See you around.
Amy is a genius.
Oh, really?
Because one cute girl lives here?
No, no, no.
I really think our lives are getting better.
Yours, yeah.
I mean, you have this brand-new apartment.
It's great.
But how is Amy good for me?
You got out of the house last night.
You had an amazing time.
Before you kissed a married man.
Who had a wife.
Who had a baby.
That kiss was disgusting, by the way.
It was weird.
It was like it felt wrong the second I did it.
Exactly.
Now you know that guy's not right for you.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess would have stared at that guy's profile for a whole week, not knowing he was a married dirtbag.
Amy.
Good God, I want this whole building to move in slow motion.
- Oh, Dad, gross, you're...
Dad.
- I know, right?
You can thank Amy, by the way.
She turned me onto this place.
Let's not speak of the giant.
I will say, however, it appears she fixed my watch.
She did fix it?
- Hey.
- Hey!
She's back!
Come on in.
What's going on?
Are you moving?
Yeah, seems like the next logical step after being kicked out.
Apparently, having guests after hours brought on a lot of scrutiny, even for counselors, so...
I can't believe we got you kicked out.
I'm sorry.
I should have told you that I lived at a halfway house, but I've asked your little human brain to process so much in the last few weeks,
I didn't think you could handle it all.
My little human brain?
Yeah, as opposed to the angel super computer
I got goin' on right up here.
You were right.
I've been a little stuck and, uh, it felt really nice to make some decisions.
But then, you know, you start talking about being an angel and how you have this-this computer inside your head and I'm just like, what the hell am I doing with this woman?
So...
I am just going to ask you... are you crazy?
Does it matter?
Yes!
- Hey!
- Hey, sister.
Aw...
- I heard you're leaving.
- Yes, I am.
- Are you bucking for my mini-fridge?
- No.
- I just wanted to say thank you.
- Oh...
This woman is a godsend.
Aw, I'm really happy for you.
- Call me anytime, okay?
- Mm-hmm.
My phone is always on.
Okay.
Mute.
So leave a message.
Aw.
Nice girl.
Lots of problems.
Nose candy.
Ah... shuck it.
This is probably nuts, but, uh, hanging out with you, strangely, seems to be good for me.
Brad's moving out of the garage, so do you want to crash there for a while?
Allison, wow.
I would love to.
But are you sure?
Have you thought about this?
- Not at all.
- That's my girl.
Up top.
- Why are you clapping?
- I don't know.
Going with my gut.
Feels good.
I don't think it's going to fit.
Oh, it'll fit.
Right there.
Your new tenant has a box labeled Loose Bones...?
That's for a project, Marv.
Oh, thanks for being here on time this morning.
I don't think her moving in is a good idea.
Dad, I know you've been worried about me since the breakup, and I appreciate that, but I'm going to be okay.
LAPD has a photograph of her riding her bicycle on the Santa Monica freeway.
In the carpool lane.

Your sister-in-law.
- She must be your sister-in-law.
Sweetheart, look this way.
Make me your sweetheart.
Amazing.

Go ahead.
Your brother's arriving from Mumbai today.
He called yesterday.
Why?
He's calling me to Mumbai.
I mean you and me.
To stay with him.
Mumbai?
- Yeah.
I am not going anywhere.
Look, Akira, stop arguing.
He's coming after a very long time.
Come home soon from college.
When he went against your wishes..
...and married that Mumbai-girl, you swore never to see his face again.
He's worried about his child, that's why he's calling us.
He's calling you to wash his kid's soiled pants.
He never called all these years.
And now when they can't handle the child, he calls everyday.
I am not leaving Jodhpur and going anywhere.
Akira.
We're here.
- Yes.
Thank you, Adi.
- Yeah.
I'll see you in the evening.
- Definitely.
Thank you.
Grandma, how are you?
I am fine.
Ajay, you returned home after so long.
What to do, grandma?
I was busy with work.
See you later.
- Okay.
Mom.
Excuse me, madam.
- Yes.
The principal wants to meet Akira.
I'll try talking to her.
Come in.
Sit down.
- No, I am fine.
We were just talking about you.
It's a good thing that"
...your brother wants to take both of you to Mumbai.
To look after you two.
Why are you saying no?
Well... the new semester's just started.
And I've already wasted so many years.
Uncle...
I can easily get her admission in Mumbai.
I know the principal at Holy Cross Arts and Science College..
...really well.
I'm like a father to you.
There's no scope for further education in this small city.
If you go to Mumbai..
...it'll really help your higher studies.
The door's open.
Come in.
Hey".
Mom...
Akira, this is Shilpa.
Come in.
Bless you... it's alright.
Oh, sorry..
- It's okay.
Bless you.
Come, I'll show you.
Give it.
Come.
Sorry, wrong house.
You... wrong house.
Sid.
- Hi, sis.
Come.
That's my brother.
May I come in?
- Yeah.
He lives here with us.
- I see.
Sid.
Hello, aunt.
- Hello, son.
He's planning to go abroad..
...to do his Doctorate in Finance.
Doctor!
Yes.
It's really hard work, isn't it?
Doctors are highly respected.
This is great.
Now we've a doctor at home.
Son, I've got severe pain in my knee for three months.
Take a look.
- Sorry, aunt...
I'm not the kind of doctor you think.
I am doing Finance..
I mean...
I am doing a doctorate in money-management.
PhD!
It's like a degree.
Well, that's good.
Doctors don't get much respect.
You can find a bunch of them at every nook and corner.
Yes, aunt... that's why..
Actually, he also works in a Social Welfare Organization"
...along with a few of his friends.
'Raindrops.'
- I see.
He does social work.
Forget that, let's play squash today.
I don't mind, but you will lose again.
I'll let you win.
Listen..
- Stop talking.
Sid, eat.
Akira, the principal's called us at 11 am.
And it'll take around two hours to get there.
We'll get you a local-train pass.
So that you can easily commute to and from.
I'll stay at the hostel.
Why will you stay in the hostel?
Yeah, Akira?
Why the hostel?
The hostel rent, canteen expenses...
It's unnecessary".
Ajay".
Why are you forcing her?
If she wants to stay in the hostel, then let her.
We shouldn't have a problem.
She will visit us often... during her holidays.
Akira, Ajay's told me everything.
Don't worry, you won't be wasting this year.
You... just concentrate on your studies.
Thank you.
About the hostel?
Father, I talked to you over the phone about that hostel room.
Yeah..
Yes, Father.
Sister d'Mello, is there any room available in the hostel?
No, Father.
We had four students from Nasik as well, asking for rooms.
But we couldn't help them either.
What can we do?
But we do have Room No.
17, which we never consider.
Yes... but..
- What's the problem in Room No. 17?
Last year, one of the students committed suicide in that room.
Since then... no one is willing to stay there.
It's been closed since then.
- Father, I don't have a problem.
I can live there.
Akira, someone committed suicide..
- It's okay.
Excuse me.
Dad, weren't you looking for this?
- Where was it?
You forgot it in the kitchen while talking to mom.
I'll get some privacy...
I'll live there.
But, Akira, someone committed suicide..
Don't discourage her if she wants to live there.
No, Father, I was just..
- Leave that.
Ajay, remember we discussed about a donation for the old church.
Yes.
- Here it is.
Yes.
The college campus is 55 acres wide.
Father's home is in the campus as well.
There's an old church as well, which has been closed for a long time.
Father's been collecting donations for its renovation.
There's a school here too?
- Yes.
But only for deaf and dumb children.
But it's under the same management.
Come.
Ma'am... my Ipod's missing.
Missing?
- Yes.
Since when?
It was on my bed, I just went to the next room.
When I returned, it was missing.
Always lock your room.
I've told you so many times.
I am fed up of these thefts every week.
Here's the 'Missing' register.
Fill in the details.
We'll inform you if we find anything.
Here.
See... keep your belongings carefully, and always lock them away.
Yes.
This is the one.
I'll get the room cleaned up by evening.
Good stuff..
Must be from down South.
Sir..
- Yes.
Sir, should I drive?
- Why?
You're a bit..
Bapurao.
- Sir.
Give me the alcohol tester.
Yes.
Sir.
Check yourself, it's within the limit.
But, sir, this is something else.
If you lose control.
Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.
He's a new recruit, and wants to test my control.
No, sir.
Let's show him my control.
Let it be, sir.
Sir..
Sir, careful.
Rane, sir..
Rane sir, careful.
It's okay, sir.
What's this?
Oh, God!
Don't say anything, sir.
I am new, but why did you get scared?
This is the first time he hit the brakes on time.
Get in.
All his creations...
are in the form of couplets.
And his main subjects are religion, ethics and preaching.
Niki.
- Sir, it's a strike.
Sit down everyone!
Strike?
What for?
Sir, the canteen food is horrible.
Even the rats are falling sick, sir.
So everyone suggested that if we complain together.
...then maybe the contractor will change.
Do you have to do all this during class?
Can't you do it during lunch-break?
Do you want to join them?
- Yes, sir, we'll go too.
Let's go.
Strike for this, strike for that...
everyone wants to be the next CM.
So, I was saying..
From literature's point of view..
- Are you special?
Don't disturb those who don't want to join you.
You can all go.
She's crazy.
- Niki, we'll deal with her later.
So where were we?
What's going on there?
Sorry.
Madam, she still doesn't like the canteen food.
Manik.
- Sir.
Should I drive?
- No, sir.
I'll drive.
Where's my lighter?
Is it under your seat?
Watch out!
Hey".
What are you doing?
Such disregard for traffic rules.
Hey".
First you rammed a police-car.
And now you're creating a scene.
What do you mean by police-car?
Aren't there any traffic rules for you?
And you weren't even wearing a seatbelt.
Hey"-
Uncle, you would've been squashed like a bug.
Say thank you and leave.
Enough of this nonsense.
Hello, sir.
I'm not talking nonsense.
He's showing me the finger.
Do you want me to explain politely?
Sir... he's a college professor, show some manners.
Oh, Professor.
What are you doing?
Sir, are you okay?
Sir, careful.
Come back, sir.
And they call themselves police officers.
They have their own rules.
- Are you hurt?
Sir...
I am telling you, it must be a mistake.
I am sure he didn't know that he was a professor.
Take my complaint right now and lodge an FIR.
Sir, it's a small matter.
Don't blow it out of proportion.
I am telling you, there's nothing I can do about it.
Come, sir.
We'll show them.
Let's go.
Everyone sign this, we'll take this to the commissioner.
The police assaulted our professor without a reason.
Everyone sign this.
The police think they can do anything.
And they refused to file a complaint.
We'll show them the power of students.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
The police must apologize!
The police must apologize!
Control Room!
Control Room!
A huge crowd has gathered here.
Please send forces immediately.
The police must apologize!
The police must apologize!
The police must apologize!
We want...
- Justice.
Step back.
Step back.
You cannot block the roads.
Please disperse.
- We won't tolerate it.
Get up... don't sit here!
- We won't tolerate it.
Clear the roads.
Get out of here.
The police must apologize!
Sir...
- Manik, are you a kid?
Don't talk to them, just kick them out before the Commissioner arrives.
Okay, sir.
Yes, charge at them.
- Sir.
Charge... phone..
Don't know.
Get them out of here.
Come on.
Come on.
Get up... get out of here.
Leave us.
The police must apologize!
Get rid of them.
Get them out.
Come on.
Sir, one of your officers assaulted our professor.
Sir, they were hurling stones at us...
uprooting rods.
Shinde was bleeding.
- And you panicked.
No, sir, that's not it.
You wouldn't have fired, if you hadn't panicked.
All you had to do was break a few bones.
It was a small matter.
Sir..
Where's the bottle of water?
Sir, Bapurao took it to the bathroom.
Rajeshwar.
- Yes, sir.
I had mixed vodka in that bottle which he took.
His backside will start dancing.
Call him.
Yes..
- See if he's done or not.
Bapurao!
- Coming.
Let's go.
Bloody thing... it burns.
Manik, you know what to say in the inquiry.
- Yes, sir.
Hey".
Bloody hell, he'll definitely die.
Oh no...
He rammed the car, sir.
Hello..
Looks like he'd decided to die today.
He didn't wear seatbelts either.
The tire burst, sir.
The airbags didn't open either.
The speed at which he came in, I am sure he's dead.
Sir...
let's put him in our jeep and take him to the hospital.
Waste of time, Rajeshwar!
No point.
What happened?
Is he dead?
Seems like it.
No movement in the body.
Doesn't this area fall under Inspector Khamkar?
That baldy..
- Yeah..
PanvehPanchayat area.
Sir.
Look what's here.
Is it full of money?
Check it.
Yes.
Looks like about 70-80 cr.
- Easily.
What do you think we should do?
Your call, sir.
All clear, sir!
- Such a lonely place and so much money!
Did you find Khamkar's number?
I say let's handle this by ourselves.
What say?
It's a gift - we can all settle down comfortably.
But, sir..
The Goddess of Wealth is knocking at your door..
...but you'd rather stand in the queue!
Don't worry, I'll arrange everything.
Manik, come.
- Sir.
Bapurao.
Yeah..
Rajeshwar.
- Yes, sir.
Keep it down.
Bapurao.
Hey, stop!
Leave the bag!
Everything's already messed up.
What...
'News about the increasing number of thefts in the city over the month.'
'And the recent news of robbery at Ghanshyam Das Jewellers in Kandivali.'
What's wrong?
Not in the mood?
Going home?
I am talking to you.
ACP sir, why are you wearing your clothes?
Take them off and come here.
I've something more important to do.
Will you please finish your drink in the hall?
I've to make a call.
It's an official call.
There is tension at many places in Maharashtra.
After the attack on North Indian auto drivers in Pune..
...many people have left the city.
'We received news of five road-accidents in and around Mumbai.
The total number of casualties is four.
Hello.
- Sir.
Manik, did you watch the news?
- Yes, sir, I did.
Our matter simply disappeared into thin air along with the other news.
The rest is a piece of cake...
easy-peasy.
Listen, we made one mistake.
When I hit him with the jack, I should've hit him on the face instead.
It would've looked like an accident.
But I hit him on the back instead.
Now... keep a close watch on the post-mortem and don't slip up.
Listen, carefully explain to Bapurao and Rajeshwar what to do with the rest of the money.
Yes, sir.
And from now on, call me on my new number.
Write it down.
Yes, sir.
988...
"...and don't slip up."
"Listen, carefully explain to Bapu Rao and Rajeshwar.."
"..what to do with the rest of the money."
"And from now on call me on my new number."
"Write it down."
"988... 4205869."
"Happy Birthday to you.."
Such a big prize.
- and you got it so easily.
Where did you record this?
In my bedroom.
Around 11 months ago, I got caught in a hotel raid.
He took my number and address.
...but he didn't register any case.
He released me without taking any money.
But after that"
...he started coming home whenever he wanted.
At first I didn't take it too seriously.
I thought he's a police officer after all..
...someday he'll come in handy.
But then he started bugging me - romance and whatnot.
I wanted to get rid of him.
And just last week, I fixed this camera in my bedroom.
...so that he'd stop harassing me.
Call it fate, look what I got my hands on.
And immediately called you guys.
If we make a plan, we can extort all the money from him.
Maya, if this didn't involve the police..
...we could've handled anyone else easily.
And this guy's the ACP.
If he finds out, he'll charge us with a fake case..
...and kill all of us.
If we make a foolproof plan..
...then we could all go back to Gorakhpur and live happily.
I don't want to get into this police mess.
Maya, when you called I thought.
...maybe some college student or software engineer..
...has fallen head-over-heels for you.
Look, this is quite risky.
You won't be able to get out of this one.
Let's go.
- Come on.
Sun".
Listen...
take a day's time.
Think...
and let me know tomorrow.
Didn't I already tell you?
Look, do whatever you want.
But don't ever bring this matter up again.
Let's go.
- It's getting late.
Your bill, ma'am.
Thanks.
Where is it?
Excuse me.
- Yes, ma'am.
Those students who were here - do they come regularly?
I don't know, ma'am.
What happened?
There was a camera in my bag, but now it's missing.
They just passed by my table.
I didn't notice, ma'am.
Do you know them?
I think they were Holy Cross college students.
Holy Cross college students!
And now finally, a small speech by Akira.
Good evening.
Actually, Father and the lecturers asked me to give a speech suddenly..
...so I haven't prepared much.
But since its World Disabled Day..
...it reminded me of something my father said.
My father.
We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
I think the Mike is not working.
- We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
What's wrong?
We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
Sir, there's a problem with the connection.
It'll take a while, sir.
I'll see what's wrong?
We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
"A disabled person isn't someone who doesn't have a limb.."
"..it's someone who doesn't use the limbs."
"Hands that don't come forth to help others are 'disabled'."
"The eyes that ignore atrocities...
are 'disabled'."
"Feet that turn away and desert their parents are 'disabled'."
Niki, we must do something about her.
Stop here.
How much?
- Let it be.
It's okay.
I can't take money from you.
I see...
then come every day at 8 am.
Madam..
It's not a government vehicle.
Here you go.
Good morning, sir.
- Rabiya madam...
Back again?
Are you looking to score a century in transfers?
The straight path is often the twisted one, sir.
Did you come with family, or..
- No, sir, I've come alone.
Alone?
Okay?
- Okay, sir.
Hello.
"Manik, did you watch the news?"
"Our matter disappeared into thin air along with other news."
"The rest is a piece of cake...
easy-peasy."
"Listen, we made one mistake."
"When I hit him with the jack,..
...I should've hit him on the face instead."
"It would've looked like an accident.
But I hit him on the back."
"Now... keep a close watch on the post-mortem and don't slip up."
"Listen, what to do with the rest of the money..."
'The number you've called is currently switched off.'
We should've been more careful, sir.
I never thought she would do such a thing with me.
Her house is locked and she's missing.
Even her phone's switched off.
She's a hooker;
Won't be easy to trap her.
Will she be asking for a share in the money..
...or ask for all of it?
Wonder who else is in this with her?
Don't let the word spread.
- Yes.
Sir, the call made to you was from a prepaid number.
The SIM Card... has been issued to this college ID.
First year student, Holy Cross College.
And listen... they've asked me to pay the hostel fee next week.
Please tell brother to pay it.
Yes, I..
I've to make an urgent call.
Enough!
Break her face!
Hey".
Seen a girl in a blue shirt?
So?
Are you scared now?
Please forgive me.
I've already wasted three years of my college.
Now if I thrash you people too, I'll get in trouble again.
What?
I see... you were hiding here, so you don't thrash us.
Stop talking to her.
I don't want to fight.
Listen to me.
Please tell them, was it my fault?
You were picking on me for no reason.
We'll go, just wait a minute.
David, Pooja said you were looking for me.
Nothing important.
You always used to listen to music on your phone, with the headphones.
Where is it?
I don't see it.
My phone's been stolen.
I went to wash my face and it disappeared.
I even made an entry in the 'Missing' register.
Why?
What happened?
- Nothing.
Just asked.
I'll tell you if I find it.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Okay.
The college wants to catch him red-handed, sir.
So, the call I received was from a stolen phone.
This means... whoever stole the phone is still in the hostel.
And before the hostel guys find him, we must find him first.
You two will keep an eye on Maya's home, as well as the hostel.
- Sir.
Here's your fare.
Hello.
- Sir, it's me.
She's here.
Get inside and tie her up.
- Sir, me?
I am coming!
Where is she?
What happened?
You dare record my phone calls and threaten me?
You wanted to extort money from me?
Me?
- No.
How did you record the call?
Tell me how did you record the call?
With a handycam!
Look at me..
Where's your handycam?
- Stolen.
What?
Stolen?
Someone stole it at the coffee shop.
I didn't see his face.
But I know he's a student at Holy Cross College.
What were you doing at the coffee shop?
What were you doing at the coffee shop?
Tell me the truth, or I will break your face.
You won't get another customer or a lover.
Why did you take the camera to the coffee shop?
I went to meet a couple of friends.
Did you show them the video?
Did you show them the video?
So three more people know now.
She's spoiled it all.
Messed it up!
She's messed us up!
Maya!
Maya!
Maya!
Maya!
Maya!
What was the name of the coffee shop?
Coffee shop..
Wretch.
Did she say the name of the coffee shop?
She didn't say anything.
I'm going through a real bad phase.
Go on.
Madam.
The kohl's completely smeared.
Seems she cried a lot before committing suicide.
Right, madam.
I deduced that too.
She cried her heart out.
She...
looks tense too.
This is definitely a suicide.
Her cheeks are swollen too.
Maybe someone beat her up and made her cry.
And then hung her.
But, madam, the...
door's locked from inside.
Manik, you're so naive.
Locking the door from inside...
is an old grandfather's technique.
The computer's hard disk is missing.
Her cellphone isn't here either.
There was a charger in the bedroom, did you see it?
You mean that cellphone charger.
It's not a cellphone charger, it's a video-camera charger.
There's a charger, but no camera.
Is this Plot No. 401-C?
Who is he?
- Courier, madam.
Come here.
Sign.
Thank you, sir.
What is it, madam?
- Credit card bill.
Beauty parlour, pub, supermarket, coffee shop.
She swiped her card in these four places.
Find out where she visited regularly.
Did she go alone or with friends?
Find out more details about her.
Keep this.
- Yes, ma'am.
Actually, Manik, give that to me.
I'll keep it.
Call the forensic people, ask them when they can get here.
- Yes.
I think something's wrong.
Maybe it's a murder.
Looks like it's the handiwork of at least 3 to 4 people.
Fine, you make the call until then I'll question the neighbors.
Yes, ma'am.
Bloody Rabia... always honest.
- that too on a police salary.
We can't shut her up with a share either.
You will only follow this case...
and no acting smart.
Rabia should never find out"
...that we're involved in this case.
Sir.
Let's see how far she Gets, with that baby in her tummy.
Manik.
- Yes, ma'am.
We couldn't locate Maya's buddies in the coffee shop, right?
Well, I just got their address.
Note it down.
- Madam?
Note it down.
- Y-Yes, ma'am.
House No. 3, Yamuna Nagar, Malad East.
Sir..
- Where are you taking us?
Don't worry.
Please, sir, we're getting worried.
- We'll tell you everything.
Sir..
- Come on, get it.
It's nothing, it will be over in 10 minutes.
Where are you taking us, sir?
Get in, come on.
Yes, Manik.
Madam, I found two guys at the address you gave me.
They willingly got in the car without any hassle.
But as soon as the car slowed down at the bend..
...they jumped out and escaped.
We tried catching them, but..
- I see.
See you there, we'll discuss this.
- Okay, madam.
Well, for now, my life-calling is to go to classes.
Going to Churchgate;
Can I drop you someplace?
Thanks.
Okay.
See you.
- Bye.
Akira.
Take a seat.
How's college?
All okay?
Good.
By the way, does anyone in college know that you've been to jail..
I mean...
that you were in the Remand Home.
No!
That's a good thing.
Who knows how they'll behave once they find out.
By the way, no one from my family knows about this.
The other day, the police came home..
...just for Sid's passport verification.
And dad was very uncomfortable.
If he finds out about all this, then..
You can keep meeting Sid, talk to him, be friends..
...but if things go beyond that, it'll be a problem for all.
No?
Don't worry, that won't happen.
You won't have any problems because of me.
Hope I didn't hurt you.
It's not that easy to hurt me.
Bapurao.
Yes, sir.
The college is closed for vacations.
- Yes.
Who's going to stay in the hostel now?
We've been standing out here like madmen.
Madam, please listen.
- Who are you guys?
How did you get in?
Isn't the watchman inside?
We came here to meet a student, but didn't realize it's the holidays.
Are you alone in the hostel?
- Yes.
I see..
- Who do you want to meet?
I..
- Riya.
What's her room number?
Isn't this the model we've been looking for?
Please keep it back, it's not mine.
How much did you pay for this camera?
- I told you this is not mine.
Please keep it back.
ACP sir's number on the dialing list.
What?
ACP who?
Is this your bag?
It was lying outside.
"Listen, I made a mistake."
"When I hit him with the jack.."
Come with us.
- Where?
Who are you?
Come on!
"Don't you get it?"
"It's an official call."
"Hello..."
Sir, she's out to get us.
During the college strike, she gave the file to the commissioner.
Did you ask her, did she make more copies of this video?
We searched her room, but found nothing.
And did she tell anyone about this?
What did she say?
The same old thing..
"This isn't my bag, I don't know where it came from".
If these three spill the beans to anyone.
...then we'll lose everything we've made so far.
We must do something quickly.
Plus I've to go to Nasik..
...for a very boring session with the Home Minister.
Could take a few days.
And it could be dangerous to keep them alive for three days.
I suggest... that you end this whole thing.
Don't wait for me to return.
Remember our usual spot?
- Go.
Sir... we haven't done anything.
Come on, get down.
- Where are you taking us?
Keep walking down.
Come on..
We haven't done anything, sir..
Sir..
Trying to be a hero?
Where..
Come on.
Sir..
Come on.
Come on.
Sit down.
Shut up!
- Sir..
Stop crying-
Here..
- Sir... no!
Sir, no.
- Kill them.
Take it.
Stop crying-
No...
- Sir..
Bloody dog, don't you get it?
Don't answer that now.
- ACP sir is calling.
No... no..
Yes, sir.
- You got the wrong girl, Manik.
She's not that girl.
But, sir..
Stealing stuff from the hostel, and making threat calls to me was done by someone else.
Don't shoot her.
- Sir..
Sir..
Sir, my battery's almost dead.
Call on Rajeshwar's cell.
- I didn't bring my mobile.
Sir..
- What does he want?
The phone's switched off.
No charge.
Leave it..
Let's finish the job first.
Shoot them.
Shoot.
Sir, maybe we got the wrong girl.
- What?
Yes.
That's why sir asked us to wait.
She's not that girl.
I haven't done anything!
Bloody lunatic, why does he keep changing the plan?
And he's saying this now.
Shoot her.
We'll deal with this later.
Shoot!
Sir, I am confused.
He said "Don't shoot", you're saying "Shoot".
Sir, what if this gets us in trouble later?
You're always so eager to answer the phone.
I answered only because ACP sir was calling.
To hell with your ACP!
He must be relaxing at home.
And out here, we're dealing with the mess.
Bloody..
What's he asking us to do?
Let's call him.
Go.
I need Bapurao with me.
Why?
Sir, to drive the van.
Go.
Come on, start the van.
- Yes.
Come on.
We've orders to let you go.
But you must keep quiet until they don't return.
Sir, it's Manik.
According to Bapurao's list, the thefts started last year in March.
And this girl joined now in July.
You fools got the wrong girl.
The details are clearly given in the list along with the dates.
You just make a copy, bring it to me..
...never read it, eat snacks off of it!
Let her go.
But, sir... we killed a guy in front of her.
How can we let her go?
Kill all of them.
- Okay, sir.
Now what?
What's going on?
Bloody..
The belt's broken.
What a piece of junk!
Sir... he says that the garage is six kilometers away.
Give me your walky.
- Yes.
Hello... hello, Rajeshwar sir.
Hello... hello, Rajeshwar sir.
Hello..
He's not in range.
He's all alone out there.
I think... if we travel two kilometers back..
...then his walky will be in range.
Yes.
Hello.
Hello...
Rajeshwar sir.
Rajeshwar sir, can you hear me?
Rajeshwar sir.
Hello.
What happened?
The van's belt got broken.
What do I do about them?
We've orders to shoot them all.
Hello... sir, did you hear?
Bloody..
Hello, sir.
Hello.
Hello...
Rajeshwar sir.
Hello...
Rajeshwar sir.
Rajeshwar sir.
"I've a meeting with the minister."
He said he has to go... and sent us here instead.
So that he's safe.
He's a bloody fraud.
Couldn't he check the list properly earlier?
Messed everything up by calling us in the middle of the job.
Let's get that girl before she talks to anyone.
You're saying... you saw one of the police officers before?
Yes, Father.
He was there during the strike.
Hello, Andrew, how are you?
- James, I want to meet right now.
Where are you?
I am in Pune... for a court hearing.
What is it?
There's a problem in college.
- I see... what's wrong?
Not on the phone, let's talk face-to-face.
Just get here as soon as you can tomorrow morning.
Okay.
Fine, let's meet in the morning.
- Okay, bye.
Thanks.
May I go, Father?
I am not staying at the hostel tonight.
I'll be here tomorrow morning.
Well, if there's a problem, you can stay here.
There's no problem, Father.
I am going to my brother's home.
I'll be here by tomorrow by 7 am.
- Okay.
I'll drop you at the station.
It's close by, Father.
I'll manage on my own.
Yes.
Papa, that's my sister, Akira.
Come in, Akira.
That's not the sari.
Then where is it?
There's one less.
Mom's inside.
- Count again.
But you guys must book a Cool Cab first"
...so that you all get there on time.
How's the place?
Well, it's a great place.
You?
So suddenly?
What happened?
Who are all these people?
They are Shilpa's relatives.
Her cousin's getting married.
They've come from Pune.
Something to eat?
What happened?
Did you get into a fight?
No, the door slammed on my face.
How can the door..
Wait, I'll put something on it.
- Mom!
I said it's nothing, let it be.
Akira, did you pay your hostel mess' fee?
Pay it tomorrow.
I want to talk to you.
- Say it.
Ajay.
Ajay.
- What happened?
Check this bill.
Something's wrong.
- What happened?
We selected 12 saris, didn't we?
- Yeah.
They billed us for 13 saris.
How's that possible?
Well...
I chose 5 silk saris, but I don't know about the rest.
But I..
- You settled the bill.
Yes.
- You must have counted the saris.
Maybe I checked..
- Did you count them or not?
No, I forgot.
- You didn't count the saris, Ajay.
But..
- How can you do such a thing?
- You check it.
There's no problem.
I kept telling you.
- Let me show you.
These are the ones that I counted.
These are Ritu's saris.
And I already gave aunty her saris.
Right?
There are two 'Chanderis' here..
...and those five silk saris which I packed myself.
- Okay.
What's the total?
12, Ajay.
How can you pay for 13?
Have you seen this girl?
She just left.. that way.
"Eyes have not been get wet for a long time."
"There is life from this pretext."
"Eyes have not been get wet for a long time."
"There is life from this pretext."
"Slowly slowly rain comes and fills."
Siddharth, it's Akira.
- Hi.
Can we meet now?
- No, I just finished work.
I am on my way back from Pune.
Was it something urgent?
- No.
Say it.
- No, it's okay.
Hello.
"I am desert, you fill me with water."
"There eyes clouds.."
"There eyes clouds.."
Give the fried rice to the kids standing there.
Okay.
Thank you.
Bring that plate.
Okay.
- I don't believe it, man.
- Clean that table.
He's always staring at me.
Seriously, he's crazy.
Did you keep that bag in front of my room at the hostel?
Hello... what bag?
I am talking to you, Niki.
Listen, I've been keeping my distance.
I don't know about any bag.
Then who kept that bag?
She said she doesn't know anything.
Don't touch me.
I am warning you, Niki...
don't mess with me.
Do you know the trouble you've caused me?
Wretch... how dare you hit me?
Sir, even the other day you were mistaken..
- Shut up!
Bapurao, arrest everyone and lock them up!
Come on.
Sorry, sir.
- Come on.
What are you looking at?
Come on... get in.
- Sir...
Come on... get in.
Sujata, stop staring..
...and lock the girls up in Cell No. 2.
Get in.
I want to call home.
Make a call!
Get in..
Didn't I tell you, I'd catch her?
I ask you to get one girl;
But you get the whole college!
Botched up the game!
Sir, I thought.
- Don't think.
Please.
Now I'll do whatever needs to be done.
Bapurao.
- Sir.
Come on... come out".
Come on.
Come on.
Not you.
You stay there.
Listen, everyone.
No one talks about her outside.
Or I'll lock you all up again.
We can't kill her now.
Her college friends have seen her here.
And there's no telling what she's said to whom.
So what now, sir?
I'll tell you.
Hi...
How's your mom?
All well.
Good morning, Father.
Swipe for both the cars.
Okay, sir.
Ajay, sorry to disturb you.
Has Akira left for college?
Yes, Father, she left for the hostel last night.
Why?
What's wrong?
Her room's locked..
...and she hasn't appeared for the college's internal exams either.
What?
Did she tell you anything?
No.
Last night she was trying to tell me something..
...but, she..
Ask everyone she knows.
And let me know if you speak to Akira.
Sure, Father.
- Don't forget.
Definitely, Father.
I'll call right now.
I'll just call you back.
Brother-in-law.
- Akira hasn't gone to the hostel since last night.
What?
- Her principal just called.
I'll call my volunteers, ask them to find out.
We'll find her.
Let's file a missing complaint.
And we'll ask my advocate friend..
...how to include that Inspector Manik, whom she mentioned.
Sir, a missing complaint's been filed.
And Manik's name has been included.
I told you we'd get in deep trouble.
I just spoke with them.
But they are saying the same thing.
"We'll let you know once we find out."
Hello.
Sir..
Speak up.
Sir, we did exactly what you told us.
After this... we won't face any more problems because of that girl.
All clear, sir.
Stop.
Okay, that's enough for today.
Give her a dose.
When she's conscious again after four hours.
We'll do it once again.
Yes, doctor.
I'll never talk to you again.
Never.
Understand?
How dare you take my doll?
Don't make a racket.
Come, Kamla.
It's your turn.
I won't take a bath.
Only mad people bathe every day.
You know, I have a shampoo as well.
What color?
- Yellow.
I don't like yellow.
I...
like this green.
- I've green too.
So... shall we go?
- Come on.
Let's go.
Are you a doctor?
- No, we're not doctors.
Then, are you like us?
- Yes, of course.
Then why don't you wear clothes like us?
We wear such clothes.
We like green.
Crazy girl.
- that's 'red', not 'green'.
Bedsheets... blanket... green shampoo.
- Okay.
And I was just..
What happened?
Kirti?
What happened?
Akira?
Akira!
Akira!
- Akira!
Hello.
But, Rane sir..
- Don't worry, Doctor.
Rajeshwar will be there soon.
Remember, no one should get suspicious until then.
Okay.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, this is Amitabh Bachchan speaking.
- Listen.
Okay.
This is Rani speaking.
Can you ask the ten-million rupee question first?
Come here.
Come here.
Don't get me wrong, I was just kidding.
What is this place?
This is a big..
- What's the time?
Who is the in-charge here?
Get lost.
Come on..
Get back to general ward.
Madam, what is this place?
Get back.
Who are you?
Sit.
What are you doing?
- Sit down.
Hold her.
What is this?
Come on.
Get up.
Look this way.
Akira.
- Akira.
Get up.
Look this way.
Did this girl take drugs?
Drugs?
" Yes?
Not at all.
No, sir.
And what kind of a question is that?
Hold on, Sid.
Let me talk.
May I know what Akira's done?
What did she do?
She did this.
She hurled a stone at me.
At a police officer.
It missed my eye just because I ducked.
What day was it?
And where?
Last Tuesday at around 11 pm, I was on patrol duty.
I noticed her from afar.
As soon as she saw me, she started behaving strangely.
She came up to me and asked "Are you Manik?"
Why are you roaming here in disguise?
I thought to myself that something is wrong.
I got down from my bike, and was parking it..
"When she hurled a stone at me.
Thankfully I ducked, but it hit my head and I fell down.
I arrested her immediately..
...and brought her to the police station to file an FIR.
But even at the police station..
...she kept saying to the entire staff..
"Four police officers were trying to kill me."
"They killed two boys but I escaped."
I knew it's a charade.
Or she's mentally ill.
Ma'am, did she ever hit her head when she was a kid?
Any such incident...
which could explain this behavior?
It happened long ago.
She threw acid on a boy's face.
She was sent to a children's remand home.
She even stayed there.
- That's it.
Didn't I say something's wrong?
Something's definitely wrong.
That's why I immediately brought her to the docton.
I mean psychiatrist, for treatment.
And the tests were positive.
What's the actual problem?
She's affected by recurrent persistent delusion.
Type 2.
In simpler words, such patients.
...always gets confused between reality and fantasy.
They believe one of their fantasies to be true, and starts reacting.
Akira believes that the police are following her..
...and they'll kill her in an encounter.
Due to this imagination, she's behaving strangely amongst people.
No... no need to worry.
She'll be fine soon.
It's okay, mom... it's okay.
They're saying she'll be okay.
It's okay, mom.
Now eat.
You must finish all of it.
Come on, eat.
You'll get more, now eat.
Your sit here.
Sit here.
First finish this.
Come on, eat.
You'll get water, wait.
Eat from your plate.
Hey... go away Go!
'
Akira.
Are you okay?
"Someone cast an evil eye on me, my.
Hello.
Did you eat breakfast?
What's the time?
How long have you been in this hospital?
Almost two years..
I keep coming and going.
It's been going on like that.
Is it difficult to get out of here?
Well... it's very difficult to leave with permission.
But without permission...
it's less difficult.
Can you do something for me?
Hello, Father.
I am SP Rabiya.
Mumbai Crime Branch.
Please sit.
Well... there's a coffee shop, close to your college.
Around 500 meters away.
I am sure you know.
- Yes, I know.
On the 25th of last month..
...12 students from your college celebrated a birthday there.
And one of them stole a handycam..
"From a customer's bag.
Go back..
Later I saw the coffee shop's CCTV footage.
Stop.
Stop, stop, stop.
Out of those 12 students.
...that one girl could be seen stealing the camera.
But we couldn't see her face, she was wearing a cap.
So I started looking for all the students..
...whose faces could be seen in the video.
She's a 2nd year, Commerce Student.
And that's Bharat, 3rd year Mathematics student.
And he's a... 2nd year Mathematics student as well.
And who's this?
This girl?
She's Ana.
The Principal's daughter.
Ana?
I want to see the handycam which your daughter stole.
Hi.
Did you go to the coffee shop with your friends?
When?
Which coffee shop?
You've been caught red-handed.
You've been caught stealing.
- Sir!
You've been caught stealing on camera.
- Sir... please..
You've ruined my name and respect.
How will I face the students?
Go get the handycam you stole from the coffee shop.
I want to see it.
- I am ruined..
In a way, I'm the one who encouraged this thief.
In every meeting in the hostel..
...I would tell the students, that..
"Whoever is committing these thefts in the hostel should mend their ways."
"And keep everything that's stolen in a bag.."
"..and leave it anywhere in the hostel."
"We won't take any action against this person."
'I didn't know that the thief's living in our own home.'
"Go, die somewhere."
'The college was shut down for holidays... '...when I discovered...' '...that my own daughter was the thief'
'All the students had gone home.
Only Akira was staying in the hostel.'
'That's why I left that bag outside her room.'
'So that when Akira finds the bag outside her room..'
'..she'd bring it to me immediately.'
Then I would've told everyone that the thief has returned everyone's stuff.
And I would've distributed everything back through the warden.
And this problem could've been solved.
But Akira didn't show up that night.
Next day when I went to the hostel, the room was locked.
That same night, Akira came home..
...and said that there was a bag lying outside her room.
As she opened to take a look, two policemen arrived.
They took the handycam and mobile from the bag, and kidnapped her as well.
And they took two boys along, whom they killed.
Only Akira survived.
After Akira left, I asked her again..
...and she admitted to stealing the handycam from the coffee shop.
And also told me about the foolishness she did by keeping it.
I study hard as well...
but it's never enough for dad.
He never missed a single opportunity to insult me.
He even hit me in front of my friends.
Finally I got fed up, and did all this to hurt him.
And unknowingly, it became a habit.
Sorry.
You said sorry so easily.
Do you how many lives your childishness has ruined?
He plays well.
He'll whack any ball.
Want to bet?
We're definitely losing.
Look, he hit the shot.
Didn't I tell you?
HEY!
-
Stop!
What are you doing?
Stop.
Why you...
Stop.
Hey, Stop.
Stop.
Ajay, what is all this?
Your sister's standing outside our door in such a strange condition.
Akira!
Akira!
What are you doing here?
Ajay, I want to talk to you alone.
Akira... what are you doing here?
You're under treatment, aren't you?
How can you...
Nothing's wrong with me, mom.
- We know nothing's wrong with you.
But you must finish your treatment.
There's nothing wrong with me, so why should I get treatment?
Ajay, please listen to me.
- Fine, tell me.
Last Tuesday I came here.
- Not Tuesday, you came on Wednesday.
Yes..
- One day before the wedding.
I did come on Wednesday too.
But I came one day before that too.
You and mom were not at home.
You can ask Shilpa.
That day, when you were upset with me.
Tell them.
But, Akira, why would Shilpa be upset with you?
Ask her later, but when I went back ..
...there was a bag lying outside my room.
As soon as I opened it, two policemen barged in!
Yes, we know.
Father told us.
Because I told Father.
That day, after I escaped from that encounter spot..
...I met Father first.
And then I came here.
Akira, none of this happened.
It's just your delusion.
Why will the police try to kill you, Akira?
I mean... there's no reason.
The inspector whom you assaulted, took you to the psychiatrist.
That doctor checked you..
- That bloody doctor... is a liar.
They want to help you, dear.
- Help me?
Unbelievable, mom.
They want to drive me crazy.
Just tell me how you got here.
Catch her!
From the hospital.
She beat us up and escaped!
Catch her.
Hold on.
- No.
Akira, no.
- Akira.
They give me electric shocks..
- No.
Akira.
Leave me.
Careful.
AjaY...
Ajay, no!
Mom..
- Akira, just listen to them.
Don't let them take me!
Calm down, dear.
- Save me, mom.
All will be well.
- No!
Be brave.
- They... give me shocks...
Electric shocks...
She's calmed down.
Get the wheelchair.
Stop.
Excuse me.
I am SP Rabiya.
I want to see a patient called Akira.
Where's her ward?
Thanks for saving me.
Who says thanks for something like that?
My own family doesn't trust me.
I'm sure everyone in college thinks I'm crazy too.
Giving you shocks...
and those injections.
...it's the doctor's doing.
If we catch him, everything" be fine.
Wear this.
Wait here.
- Yes, I'll be right here.
Akira... madam.
How could you do something so cheap?
Tell me.
Forgive me, please.
Sorry?
- Sorry?
Sorry?
Sorry.
You're going to say sorry?
Will your apology make everything alright?
My own family thinks I'm crazy.
No, no... no... forgive me.
Tell me... tell me the truth?
How much did they pay you?
- Madam... they forced me to do this.
That's why I had to do all this.
If you are right, why will they force you?
Few days ago...
a patient died accidentally.
...while I was giving him shock treatment.
These cops helped me in closing that matter smoothly.
That's all... nothing more.
Come on.
Get up.
Wear your shirt and come with me.
- Where, madam?
To tell my family, the principal and the entire college that you lied.
He'll me!
Someone help me!
He'll me!
Please help me.
What did he say?
- He said he's at the club.
Club.
Come on.
Someone's coming.
Rani, come here.
Is this the ladies toilet?
- Yes.
Sorry.
What is this man..
He came in the wrong toilet, so we beat him up.
Sorry, I had a little too much.
I'll leave.
Rani.
- Yes.
Lift him up.
Hello.
- Brother, it's me again.
Do you have any news yet?
No.
It's been three days.
I've been waiting for him.
Not yet.
Again, the same story!
Listen..
- A policeman's missing, and the police has no clue.
How is this possible?
Have faith in me.
- I can trust you, right?
Absolutely.
- Really?
Yes.
Sir...
Rajeshwar sir's wife.
She keeps calling us over and over again.
She's in the village;
Very frightened.
She wants to come here..
...and file a 'Missing' complaint.
I managed her for now, but..
This money mess..
I've fixed...
my daughter's marriage.
If Rajeshwar sir spills the beans..
...then I will be ruined, sir.
- Bapurao!
Get up!
Get up.
So what if he's scared?
Will he open his mouth?
You're making a mistake.
- What?
I am making a mistake?
You guys turn my life into a joke..
...and you say I'm making a mistake?
Should I blow your brains out?
Just because they sent me to a remand home as a kid..
...everyone looked down on me.
And now... this taint of being crazy.
Just being treated at the mental hospital means your life is over.
Why did you people do this to me?
Why did you people falsely accuse me?
Tell me.
Madam, these numbers match.
Good, file this separately.
Okay.
Take a picture of all this.
Okay, ma'am.
Look, ma'am.
Yes, this one too.
Get me the details of the driver of the crashed car.
Most importantly, the person who claimed the insurance.
Okay.
Since we received a complaint of Rajeshwar's disappearance.
...these three have been missing too.
No one at the police station knows anything either.
And their cellphones are off too.
We must arrest them and keep them inside.
Yeah... the TV and Press will humiliate us for a few days.
But we'll handle that.
Hello.
- Hello, Siddharth.
Akira speaking.
Where are you calling from?
- Listen to me carefully.
Go on.
The college's annual day function is tomorrow at 9:30 am.
The entire campus will gather at the auditorium.
Bring Ajay and mother along, I'll meet you there.
Inspector Rajeshwar is with me.
And he's ready to tell everyone how these policemen wanted to kill me.
Okay.
Who's call is it, Sid?
- Akira.
Akira...
Akira, where are you?
We're so worried..
- Ajay, I've told Siddharth everything.
Yeah, but..
- Bring mother along.
Don't make any excuses.
- Fine, but listen to me..
Akira... hello.
Hello.
What did she say?
She..
Yes, ma'am.
- I am SP Rabiya, Crime Branch.
"Inspector Rajeshwar is with me."
"He's ready to talk about how these cops wanted to kill me."
"When they didn't succeed.."
"..they proved that I am delusional with Dr. Santosh Tiwari's help.."
"..and locked me up at the Thane mental asylum."
"Rajeshwar has agreed to say this.."
"..in front of the media, the court and the entire college."
Agreed?
How can he agree?
I was telling you, sir.
He must be scared, right?
Sir, we've traced the location of Rajeshwar sir's mobile.
The signal was coming from the towen.
...close to Holy Cross College.
Sir... a lot of students live around the college as paying guests.
If she's hiding in one of those buildings..
...it'll take days to find her.
What time is the college function tomorrow?
- 10 am.
Is that person over there your principal?
Yes.
Who's with him?
Actually... he's the vice-principal.
Sir.
Sir, I just saw that mad person..
...head towards the building near the ground.
No one's allowed to go there.
The structure's too weak..
Did you check behind the building?
- No, sir.
The principal's arrived.
He's sitting on the front seat.
You must tell everyone...
exactly what you told me.
Get it?
If you try to act smart, I'll shoot you.
Rani!
Sir!
She's run out of bullets, sir!
Quiet.
- Sir!
Come on.
Get up.
Stop!
- Manik.
Get on your knees!
Get on your knees!
Hands at the back!
Hands at the back!
Bapurao.
Stay still or else I'll shoot.
Wretch.
Leave it.
Leave her.
You should've done something when she kidnapped you.
What's the point of showing your machismo now?
Sir, do you know what happened that day?
Don't talk nonsense.
Nonsense?
I am talking nonsense?
A college student and a mad person abduct you"
...thrash you... and mess you up.
There's nothing you could do and you're showing your anger now.
I see.
Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.
Here.
Manik.
- Sir.
Your FIR report.
Two mad people stole tools from the mortuary.
And... they abducted Rajeshwar and brought him here.
By the time we got here to save Rajeshwar..
...they'd already severed his hand.
Bapurao.
And we had no other choice.
So, in order to save Rajeshwar, we had to kill these two.
Now shoot her in the forehead.
Manik... you'll do no such thing.
You cleverly slip out of every situation.
You have a gun, don't you?
You shoot her!
Shoot her!
Get your hands and limbs severed.
Why do you always ride the gun on our shoulders?
Don't be crazy..
- You've been doing crazy things from the beginning..
...and you're calling me crazy?
Don't you know how to talk to your senior?
- Hey!
You're my senior only when we're in the department.
Out here, I am senior to you in age, and you're my junior.
Bloody fool, talking nonsense.
Hey..
- Leave me!
- Be quiet...
He'll create problems with the girls..
...and ask us to deal with it.
And sit at home by himself...
"I am in Nasik."
"..in a meeting with the minister."
He talks too much.
Manik.
- Sir.
Your new FIR report.
These two kidnapped Rajeshwar and brought him here.
We followed them here.
We killed that mad person and saved Rajeshwar.
Arrested this girl.
We were taking the girl..
"When she snatched my gun and shot Rajeshwar.
Next... she tried to kill me.
That's when you".
Go back 10 feet from your position.
And shoot her.
Shoot her, Manik.
Back.
Shoot.
Manik.
Hands up!
Manik, throw down your gun.
Here she comes again.
Or else we'll have to shoot.
Rabiya, do you even know what happened here?
Don't act without knowing the facts.
I know everything, sir.
Right from the accident on Mumbai-Pune Highway..
...to sending this girl to the mental asylum, everything.
I know everything.
You can't kill her and hide the truth anymore.
And even the commissioner knows about it.
We've orders to arrest you, sir.
Please throw your guns down.
Manik.
Throw your gun down.
Sir, please.
Amar.
- Ma'am.
Get their guns.
They killed my friend.
Her body is lying somewhere at the back.
Rafiq, go check.
Yes, ma'am.
Do you know everything?
- Yes, I do.
May I go now?
It's the commissioner?
Hello, sir.
- Where are you?
Behind Holy Cross College, in the old church.
What happened?
- We've arrested them, sir.
Don't arrest them, Rabiya.
There's a problem.
Why, sir?
The guy they murdered on the highway..
...was the brother of North Indian Party's top leader, Bablu Tiwari.
Remember... he was involved in provoking riots in the city before.
This year his party is claiming to host..
...the biggest 'Chhat Puja' event in Mumbai.
Due to which there is already growing tension amongst the local parties.
That money was being brought in for that event.
If the news leaks out, that his brother didn't die in an accident..
...but in fact, a few Mumbai police officers murdered him for the money..
...then Bablu Tiwari will provoke riots again.
And so I spoke with the Secretariat..
...and the higher authorities and made this decision.
So end the case right here and close the file.
So please follow my orders.
Don't arrest them.
But sir, two murders have been committed here.
Inspector Rajeshwar and a mad person's been shot.
Look, Rabiya, they are going to prepare a fake report anyway.
I promise a full inquiry against Rane and his entire team.
They will definitely get a life sentence.
And that girl Akira..
- You're thinking about saving one girl..
...and I am thinking about thousands of innocent people.
Please understand.
This has now become a national issue.
And so... we must keep this under wraps..
...until the 'Chhat Puja' isn't over next month.
But, sir, the media's already standing outside.
I cannot lie to them.
Rabiya, give the phone to ACP Rane.
Yes, sir.
Commissioner sir.
Hello, sir.
ACP Rane, so you're above the law now?
You'll do as you want.
- No, sir, actually..
Do you have any idea..
...that your action has stirred up a law and order situation.
Now listen carefully.
- Yes, sir.
Sure.
You've to pretend before the media..
...that Akira is an escaped mental patient.
And don't mess it up.
- Okay, sir.
We'll handle it.
Understand.
Yes, sir.
Sure, sir.
Rabiya madam, you can take your team and go back.
Manik.
- Sir.
Call the hospital, and call an ambulance to take her back.
Sir.
Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.
Make that girl sit in a corner.
Yes, sir.
What happened, madam?
I can come with you, right?
We cannot handle this case anymore, Akira.
They've been asked to take charge of this case now.
Them?
But they are responsible for all this.
How can they handle it?
Bapurao, don't just sit there and stare.
Make her sit in a corner until the ambulance doesn't arrive.
Sir.
Why should I go back to the hospital?
Sorry, Akira, but I can't help you right now.
But... what's the problem?
If your case gets registered, it will turn into a communal issue.
And the riots can..
...lead to the loss of many innocent lives.
Only you can save this city from burning up again.
And so they are going to keep you in the hospital for a while..
...and then let you go.
I am sorry, but...
there's no other choice, Akira.
How can you say that?
They tried to kill a girl.
Together they tried to prove that I'm crazy.
Arrest them!
Will you send me back to the asylum too in order to cover up the truth?
I am sorry, the department will definitely give you compensation"
...and I will try..
- Bapu Rao.
- Compensation?
What do you mean by compensation?
Come on.
You mean first you gouge both my eyes out"
...and then give me an expensive walking-stick.
Please cooperate with them.
Believe me, it can..
What's more that can happen?
You should've killed me instead.
'That day my hands were tied, but not Akira's.'
Madam!
Madam!
Madam!
Madam!
Ma'am, their guns?
- Keep it.
Sir.
Let go.
- Let go.
Let go.
Let go.
Let go.
Let go.
Madam..
Please, madam.
'If your case gets registered, it'll turn into a communal issue.'
'And the riots can..'
'..
lead to the loss of many innocent lives.'
'Only you can save this city from burning up again.'
Akira.
What... what's she saying?
She's saying that she nailed herself to the cross.
'Since the report that deemed Akira mentally ill, was fake..' ...I made sure that no case was registered against her, '
'A few days later, she was fully exonerated and she went home...' '...where she began to follow the path her father had shown her.'
'I want every daughter of this country, including mine... to become like Akira.'
'Someone who learns to live on the basis of her own strength.'
Very good.

This is where these louts loiter about.
Come on.
Didn't she come today?
Exactly what I was saying?
Start the bike.
- It's okay.
How dare you reject me!
Take that, die!
Let's go...
let'sgo .
Drive faster!
- Sister.
Faster, faster!
Didn't anyone see him?
Isaw him.
No.
No.
It was him!
You...
Get inside!
How dare you tell the police?
Take that.
Get lost!

Oh IT1Y---
Greetings, my |ady...!
This has become a daily routine.
Why doesn't someone take action against them?
What a gorgeous girl...
Look here.
Your sister-in-law.
- She must be your sister-in-law.
Sweetheart, look this way.
Make me your sweetheart.
Amazing.
Madam.
You see, madam.
He||o...he||o.
HE'!
-
You..
Wait.
Someone help her.
- Anyone.
Someone help her.
Mister.
'Everyone saw what happened.'
'But the boy's father had a huge vote-bank supporting him.'
'Your Honor, this girl assaulted my client first.'
'It was an unprovoked attack.'
'But Your Honor, I have witnesses.'
'I can prove that Akira is innocent.'
'But the witness is also saying..'
'..that this crazy girl brutally assaulted three boys.'
'In light of all the evidence..'
'..the court decides to send Akira to the Child Correction faci|ity..'
'..unti| we reach a verdict.'
'And this way...it took three years to prove Akira's innocence.'
Akira.
- Yes.
Listen.
- I am listening.
Go ahead.
Your brother's arriving from Mumbai today.
He called yesterday.
Why?
He's calling me to Mumbai.
I mean you and me.
To stay with him.
Mumbai?
-Yeah.
I am not going anywhere.
Look, Akira, stop arguing.
He's coming after a very long time.
Come home soon from college.
When he went against your wishes..
..and married that Mumbai-girl, you swore never to see his face again.
He's worried about his child, that's why he's calling us.
He's calling you to wash his kid's soiled pants.
He never called all these years.
And now when they can't handle the child, he calls everyday.
I am not leaving Jodhpur and going anywhere.
Akira.
We're here.
- Yes.
Thank you, Ani.
- Yeah.
I'll see you in the evening.
- Definitely.
Thank you.
Grandma, how are you?
I am fine.
Ajay, you returned home after so long.
What to do, grandma?
I was busy with work.
See you later.
- Okay.
Mom.
Excuse me, madam.
- Yes.
The principal wants to meet Akira.
I'll try talking to her.
Come in.
Sit down.
- No, I am fine.
We were just talking about you.
It's a good thing that"
..your brother wants to take both of you to Mumbai.
To look after you two.
Why are you saying no?
We||...the new semester's just started.
And I've already wasted so many years.
Unc|e...
I can easily get her admission in Mumbai.
I know the principal at Holy Cross Arts and Science Co||ege..
..rea||y well.
I'm like a father to you.
There's no scope for further education in this small city.
If you go to Mumbai..
..it'|| really help your higher studies.
The door's open.
Come in.
HEY--
Mom...
Akira, this is Shilpa.
Come in.
Bless you...it's alright.
Oh, sorry..
- It's okay.
Bless you.
Come, I'll show you.
Give it.
Come.
Sorry, wrong house.
You...wrong house.
Sid.
- Hi, sis.
Come.
That's my brother.
May I come in?
- Yeah.
He lives here with us.
- I see.
Sid.
Hello, aunt.
- Hello, son.
He's planning to go abroad..
..to do his Doctorate in Finance.
Doctor!
Yes.
It's really hard work, isn't it?
Doctors are highly respected.
This is great.
Now we've a doctor at home.
Son, I've got severe pain in my knee for three months.
Take a look.
- Sorry, aunt...
I'm not the kind of doctor you think.
I am doing Finance..
I mean...
I am doing a doctorate in money-management.
PhD!
It's like a degree.
Well, that's good.
Doctors don't get much respect.
You can find a bunch of them at every nook and corner.
Yes, aunt...that's why..
Actually, he also works in a Social Welfare Organization"
..a|ong with a few of his friends.
'Raindrops.'
- I see.
He does social work.
Forget that, let's play squash today.
I don't mind, but you will lose again.
I'll let you win.
Listen..
- Stop talking.
Sid, eat.
Akira, the principa|'s called us at 11 am.
And it'll take around two hours to get there.
We'll get you a local-train pass.
So that you can easily commute to and fro.
I'll stay at the hostel.
Why will you stay in the hostel?
Yeah, Akira?
Why the hostel?
The hostel rent, canteen expenses...
It's unnecessary"
Ajav---
Why are you forcing her?
If she wants to stay in the hostel, then let her.
We shouldn't have a problem.
She will visit us often...during her holidays.
Akira, Ajay's told me everything.
Don't worry, you won't be wasting this year.
You...just concentrate on your studies.
Thank you.
About the hostel?
Father, I talked to you over the phone about that hostel room.
Yeah..
Yes, Father.
Sister d'Mello, is there any room available in the hostel?
No, Father.
We had four students from Nasik as well, asking for rooms.
But we couldn't help them either.
What can we do?
But we do have Room No.
17, which we never consider.
Yes...but..
- What's the problem in Room No. 17?
Last year, one of the students committed suicide in that room.
Since then...no one is willing to stay there.
It's been closed since then.
- Father, I don't have a problem.
I can live there.
Akira, someone committed suicide..
- It's okay.
Excuse me.
Dad, weren't you looking for this?
- Where was it?
You forgot it in the kitchen while talking to mom.
I'll get some privacy...
I'||
live there.
But, Akira, someone committed suicide..
Don't discourage her if she wants to live there.
No, Father, I was just..
- Leave that.
Ajay, remember we discussed about a donation for the old church.
Yes.
- Here it is.
Yes.
The college campus is 55 acres wide.
Father's home is in the campus as well.
There's an old church as well, which has been closed for a long time.
Father's been collecting donations for its renovation.
There's a school here too?
- Yes.
But only for deaf and dumb children.
But it's under the same management.
Come.
Ma'am...my Ipod's missing.
Missing?
- Yes.
Since when?
It was on my bed, I just went to the next room.
When I returned, it was missing.
Always lock your room.
I've told you so many times.
I am fed up of these thefts every week.
Here's the 'Missing' register.
Fill in the details.
We'll inform you if we find anything.
Here.
See...keep your belongings carefully, and always lock them away.
Yes.
This is the one.
I'll get the room cleaned up by evening.
Good stuff..
Must be from down South.
Sir..
- Yes.
Sir, should I drive?
- Why?
You're a bit..
Bapurao.
- Sir.
Give me the alcohol tester.
Yes.
Sir.
Check yourself, it's within the limit.
But, sir, this is something else.
If you lose control.
Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.
He's a new recruit, and wants to test my control.
No, sir.
Let's show him my control.
Let it be, sir.
Sir..
Sir, careful.
Rane, sir..
Rane sir, careful.
It's okay, sir.
What's this?
Oh, God!
Don't say anything, sir.
I am new, but why did you get scared?
This is the first time he hit the brakes on time.
Get in.
All his creations...
are in the form of couplets.
And his main subjects are religion, ethics and preaching.
Niki.
- Sir, it's a strike.
Sit down everyone!
Strike?
What for?
Sir, the canteen food is horrible.
Even the rats are falling sick, sir.
So everyone suggested that if we complain togethen.
..then maybe the contractor will change.
Do you have to do all this during class?
Can't you do it during lunch-break?
Do you want to join them?
- Yes, sir, we'll go too.
Let's go.
Strike for this, strike for that...
everyone wants to be the next CM.
So, I was saying..
From |iterature's point of view..
- Are you special?
Don't disturb those who don't want to join you.
You can all go.
She's crazy.
- Niki, we'll deal with her later.
So where were we?
What's going on there?
Sorry.
Madam, she still doesn't like the canteen food.
Manik.
- Sir.
Should I drive?
- No, sir.
I'll drive.
Where's my lighter?
Is it under your seat?
Watch out!
HEY--
What are you doing?
Such disregard for traffic rules.
HEY--
First you rammed a police-car.
And now you're creating a scene.
What do you mean by police-car?
Aren't there any traffic rules for you?
And you weren't even wearing a seatbelt.
HEY"
Uncle, you would've been squashed like a bug.
Say thank you and leave.
Enough of this nonsense.
Hello, sir.
I'm not talking nonsense.
He's showing me the finger.
Do you want me to explain politely?
Sir...he's a college professor, show some manners.
Oh, Professor.
What are you doing?
Sir, are you okay?
Sir, careful.
Come back, sir.
And they call themselves police officers.
They have their own rules.
- Are you hurt?
Sir...
I am telling you, it must be a mistake.
I am sure he didn't know that he was a professor.
Take my complaint right now and lodge an FIR.
Sir, it's a small matter.
Don't blow it out of proportion.
I am telling you, there's nothing I can do about it.
Come, sir.
We'll show them.
Let's go.
Everyone sign this, we'll take this to the commissioner.
The police assaulted our professor without a reason.
Everyone sign this.
The police think they can do anything.
And they refused to file a complaint.
We'll show them the power of students.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
The police must apologize!
The police must apologize!
Control Room!
Control Room!
A huge crowd has gathered here.
Please send forces immediately.
The police must apologize!
The police must apologize!
The police must apologize!
We want...
- Justice.
Step back.
Step back.
You cannot block the roads.
Please disperse.
- We won't tolerate it.
Get up...don't sit here!
- We won't tolerate it.
Clear the roads.
Get out of here.
The police must apologize!
Sir...
- Manik, are you a kid?
Don't talk to them, just kick them out before the Commissioner arrives.
Okay, sir.
Yes, charge at them.
- Sir.
Charge...phone..
Don't know.
Get them out of here.
Come on.
Come on.
Get up...get out of here.
Leave us.
The police must apologize!
Get rid of them.
Get them out.
Come on.
Sir, one of your officers assaulted our professor.
Sir, they were hurling stones at us...
uprooting rods.
Shinde was bleeding.
- And you panicked.
No, sir, that's not it.
You wouldn't have fired, if you hadn't panicked.
All you had to do was break a few bones.
It was a small matter.
Sir..
Where's the bottle of water?
Sir, Bapurao took it to the bathroom
Rajeshwar.
- Yes, sir.
I had mixed vodka in that bottle which he took.
His backside will start dancing.
Call him.
Yes..
- See if he's done or not.
Bapurao!
- Coming.
Let's go.
Bloody thing...it burns.
Manik, you know what to say in the inquiry.
- Yes, sir.
HEY--
Bloody hell, he'll definitely die.
Oh no...
He rammed the car, sir.
He||o..
Looks like he'd decided to die today.
He didn't wear seatbelts either.
The tire burst, sir.
The airbags didn't open either.
The speed at which he came in, I am sure he's dead.
Sir...|et's put him in our jeep and take him to the hospital.
Waste of time, Rajeshwar!
No point.
What happened?
Is he dead?
Seems like it.
No movement in the body.
Doesn't this area fall under Inspector Khamkar?
That ba|dy..
- Yeah..
Panvel-Panchayat area.
Sir.
Look what's here.
Is it full of money?
Check it.
Yes.
Looks like about 70-80 cr.
- Easily.
What do you think we should do?
Your call, sir.
All clear, sir!
- Such a lonely place and so much money!
Did you find Khamkar's number?
I say let's handle this by ourselves.
What say?
It's a gift - we can all settle down comfortably.
But, sir..
The Goddess of Wealth is knocking at your door..
..but you'd rather stand in the queue!
Don't worry, I'll arrange everything.
Manik, come.
- Sir.
Bapurao.
Yeah..
Rajeshwar.
- Yes, sir.
Keep it down.
Bapurao.
Hey, stop!
Leave the bag!
Everything's already messed up.
What...
'News about the increasing number of thefts in the city over the month.'
'And the recent news of robbery at Ghanshyam Das Jewellers in Kandivali.'
What's wrong?
Not in the mood?
Going home?
I am talking to you.
ACP sir, why are you wearing your clothes?
Take them off and come here.
I've something more important to do.
Will you please finish your drink in the hall?
I've to make a call.
It's an official call.
There is tension at many places in Maharashtra.
After the attack on North Indian auto drivers in Pune..
..many people have left the city.
'We received news of five road-accidents in and around Mumbai.
The total number of casualties is four.
Hello.
- Sir.
Manik, did you watch the news?
- Yes, sir, I did.
Our matter simply disappeared into thin air along with the other news.
The rest is a piece of cake...
easy-peasy.
Listen, we made one mistake.
When I hit him with the jack, I shou|d've hit him on the face instead.
It would've looked like an accident.
But I hit him on the back instead.
Now...keep a close watch on the post-mortem and don't slip up.
Listen, carefully explain to Bapurao and Rajeshwar what to do with the rest of the money.
Yes, sir.
And from now on, call me on my new number.
Write it down.
Yes, sir.
988...
"...and don't slip up."
"Listen, carefully explain to Bapu Rao and Rajeshwar.."
"..what to do with the rest of the money."
"And from now on call me on my new number."
"Write it down."
"988...4205869."
"Happy Birthday to you.."
Such a big prize - and you got it so easily.
Where did you record this?
In my bedroom.
Around 11 months ago, I got caught in a hotel raid.
He took my number and address.
..but he didn't register any case.
He released me without taking any money.
But after that"
..he started coming home whenever he wanted.
At first I didn't take it too seriously.
I thought he's a police officer after a||..
..someday he'll come in handy.
But then he started bugging me - romance and whatnot.
I wanted to get rid of him.
And just last week, I fixed this camera in my bedroom.
..so that he'd stop harassing me.
Call it fate, look what I got my hands on.
And immediately called you guys.
If we make a plan, we can extort all the money from him.
Maya, if this didn't involve the po|ice..
..we cou|d've handled anyone else easily.
And this guy's the ACP.
If he finds out, he'll charge us with a fake case..
..and kill all of us.
If we make a foolproof p|an..
..then we could all go back to Gorakhpur and live happily.
I don't want to get into this police mess.
Maya, when you called I thought.
..maybe some college student or software engineer..
..has fallen head-over-heels for you.
Look, this is quite risky.
You won't be able to get out of this one.
Let's go.
- Come on.
Sunil.
Listen...
take a day's time.
Think...
and let me know tomorrow.
Didn't I already tell you?
Look, do whatever you want.
But don't ever bring this matter up again.
Let's go.
- It's getting late.
Your bill, ma'am.
Thanks.
Where is it?
Excuse me.
- Yes, ma'am.
Those students who were here - do they come regularly?
I don't know, ma'am.
What happened?
There was a camera in my bag, but now it's missing.
They just passed by my table.
I didn't notice, ma'am.
Do you know them?
I think they were Holy Cross college students.
Holy Cross college students!
And now finally, a small speech by Akira.
Good evening.
Actually, Father and the lecturers asked me to give a speech suddenly..
..so I haven't prepared much.
But since its World Disabled Day..
..it reminded me of something my father said.
My father
We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
I think the Mike is not working.
- We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
What's wrong?
We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
Sir, there's a problem with the connection.
It'll take a while, sir.
I'll see what's wrong?
We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
"A disabled person isn't someone who doesn't have a |imb.."
"..it's someone who doesn't use the |imbs."
"Hands that don't come forth to help others are 'disab|ed'."
"The eyes that ignore atrocities...
are 'disab|ed'."
"Feet that turn away and desert their parents are 'disab|ed'."
Niki, we must do something about her.
Stop here.
How much?
- Let it be.
It's okay.
I can't take money from you.
I see...
then come every day at 8 am.
Madam..
It's not a government vehicle.
Here you go.
Good morning, sir.
- Rabiya madam...
Back again?
Are you looking to score a century in transfers?
The straight path is often the twisted one, sir.
Did you come with family, or..
- No, sir, I've come alone.
Alone?
Okay?
- Okay, sir.
Hello.
"Manik, did you watch the news?"
"Our matter disappeared into thin air along with other news."
"The rest is a piece of cake...
easy-peasy."
"Listen, we made one mistake."
"When I hit him with the jack,..
..I shou|d've hit him on the face instead."
"It would've looked like an accident.
But I hit him on the back."
"Now...keep a close watch on the post-mortem and don't slip up."
"Listen, what to do with the rest of the money..."
'The number you've called is currently switched off.'
We shou|d've been more careful, sir.
I never thought she would do such a thing with me.
Her house is locked and she's missing.
Even her phone's switched off.
She's a hooker;
won't be easy to trap her.
Will she be asking for a share in the money..
..or ask for all of it?
Wonder who else is in this with her?
Don't let the word spread.
- Yes.
Sir, the call made to you was from a prepaid number.
The SIM Card...has been issued to this college ID.
First year student, Holy Cross College.
And |isten...they've asked me to pay the hostel fee next week.
Please tell brother to pay it.
Yes, I..
I've to make an urgent call.
Enough!
Break her face!
HEY--
Seen a girl in a blue shirt?
So?
Are you scared now?
Please forgive me.
I've already wasted three years of my college.
Now if I thrash you people too, I'll get in trouble again.
What?
I see...you were hiding here, so you don't thrash us.
Stop talking to her.
I don't want to fight.
Listen to me.
Please tell them, was it my fault?
You were picking on me for no reason.
We'll go, just wait a minute.
David, Pooja said you were looking for me.
Nothing important.
You always used to listen to music on your phone, with the headphones.
Where is it?
I don't see it.
My phone's been stolen.
I went to wash my face and it disappeared.
I even made an entry in the 'Missing' register.
Why?
What happened?
- Nothing.
Just asked.
I'll tell you if I find it.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Okay.
The college wants to catch him red-handed, sir.
So, the call I received was from a stolen phone.
This means...whoever stole the phone is still in the hostel.
And before the hostel guys find him, we must find him first.
You two will keep an eye on Maya's home, as well as the hostel.
- Sir.
Here's your fare.
Hello.
- Sir, it's me.
She's here.
Get inside and tie her up.
- Sir, me?
I am coming!
Where is she?
What happened?
You dare record my phone calls and threaten me?
You wanted to extort money from me?
Me?
- No.
How did you record the call?
Tell me how did you record the call?
With a handycam!
Look at me..
Where's your handycam?
- Stolen.
What?
Stolen?
Someone stole it at the coffee shop.
I didn't see his face.
But I know he's a student at Holy Cross College.
What were you doing at the coffee shop?
What were you doing at the coffee shop?
Tell me the truth, or I will break your face.
You won't get another customer or a lover.
Why did you take the camera to the coffee shop?
I went to meet a couple of friends.
Did you show them the video?
Did you show them the video?
So three more people know now.
She's spoiled it all.
Messed it up!
She's messed us up!
Maya!
Maya!
Maya!
Maya!
Maya!
What was the name of the coffee shop?
Coffee shop..
Wretch.
Did she say the name of the coffee shop?
She didn't say anything.
I'm going through a real bad phase.
Go on.
Madam.
The koh|'s completely smeared.
Seems she cried a lot before committing suicide.
Right, madam.
I deduced that too.
She cried her heart out.
She...
looks tense too.
This is definitely a suicide.
Her cheeks are swollen too.
Maybe someone beat her up and made her cry.
And then hung her.
But, madam, the...
door's locked from inside.
Manik, you're so naive.
Locking the door from inside...
is an old grandfather's technique.
The computer's hard disk is missing.
Her cellphone isn't here either.
There was a charger in the bedroom, did you see it?
You mean that cellphone charger.
It's not a cellphone charger, it's a video-camera charger.
There's a charger, but no camera.
Is this Plot No. 401-C?
Who is he?
- Courier, madam.
Come here.
Sign.
Thank you, sir.
What is it, madam?
- Credit card bill.
Beauty parlour, pub, supermarket, coffee shop.
She swiped her card in these four places.
Find out where she visited regularly.
Did she go alone or with friends?
Find out more details about her.
Keep this.
- Yes, ma'am.
Actually, Manik, give that to me.
I'll keep it.
Call the forensic people, ask them when they can get here.
- Yes.
I think something's wrong.
Maybe it's a murder.
Looks like it's the handiwork of at least 3 to 4 people.
Fine, you make the call... ..unti| then I'll question the neighbors.
Yes, ma'am.
Bloody Rabia...a|ways honest - that too on a police salary.
We can't shut her up with a share either.
You will only follow this case...
and no acting smart.
Rabia should never find out"
..that we're involved in this case.
Sir.
Let's see how far she Gets, with that baby in her tummy.
Manik.
- Yes, ma'am.
We couldn't locate Maya's buddies in the coffee shop, right?
Well, I just got their address.
Note it down.
- Madam?
Note it down.
- Y-Yes, ma'am.
House No. 3, Yamuna Nagar, Malad East.
Sir..
- Where are you taking us?
Don't worry.
Please, sir, we're getting worried.
- We'll tell you everything.
Sir..
- Come on, get it.
It's nothing, it will be over in 10 minutes.
Where are you taking us, sir?
Get in, come on.
Yes, Manik.
Madam, I found two guys at the address you gave me.
They willingly got in the car without any hassle.
But as soon as the car slowed down at the bend..
..they jumped out and escaped.
We tried catching them, but..
- I see.
See you there, we'll discuss this.
- Okay, madam.
Well, for now, my life-calling is to go to classes.
Going to Churchgate;
can I drop you someplace?
Thanks.
Okay.
See you.
- Bye.
Akira.
Take a seat.
How's college?
All okay?
Good.
By the way, does anyone in college know that you've been to jai|..
I mean...
that you were in the Remand Home.
No!
That's a good thing.
Who knows how they'll behave once they find out.
By the way, no one from my family knows about this.
The other day, the police came home..
..just for Sid's passport verification.
And dad was very uncomfortable.
If he finds out about all this, then..
You can keep meeting Sid, talk to him, be friends..
..but if things go beyond that, it'll be a problem for all.
No?
Don't worry, that won't happen.
You won't have any problems because of me.
Hope I didn't hurt you.
It's not that easy to hurt me.
Bapurao.
Yes, sir.
The college is closed for vacations.
- Yes.
Who's going to stay in the hostel now?
We've been standing out here like madmen.
Madam, please listen.
- Who are you guys?
How did you get in?
Isn't the watchman inside?
We came here to meet a student, but didn't realize it's the holidays.
Are you alone in the hostel?
- Yes.
I see..
- Who do you want to meet?
I..
- Riya.
What's her room number?
Isn't this the model we've been looking for?
Please keep it back, it's not mine.
How much did you pay for this camera?
- I told you this is not mine.
Please keep it back.
ACP sir's number on the dialing list.
What?
ACP who?
Is this your bag?
It was lying outside.
"Listen, I made a mistake."
"When I hit him with the jack.."
Come with us.
- Where?
Who are you?
Come on!
"Don't you get it?"
"It's an official ca||."
"Hello..."
Sir, she's out to get us.
During the college strike, she gave the file to the commissioner.
Did you ask her, did she make more copies of this video?
We searched her room, but found nothing.
And did she tell anyone about this?
What did she say?
The same old thing..
"This isn't my bag, I don't know where it came from".
If these three spill the beans to anyone.
..then we'll lose everything we've made so far.
We must do something quickly.
Plus I've to go to Nasik..
..for a very boring session with the Home Minister.
Could take a few days.
And it could be dangerous to keep them alive for three days.
I suggest...that you end this whole thing.
Don't wait for me to return.
Remember our usual spot?
- Go.
Sir...we haven't done anything.
Come on, get down.
- Where are you taking us?
Keep walking down.
Come on..
We haven't done anything, sir..
Sir..
Trying to be a hero?
Where..
Come on.
Sir..
Come on.
Come on.
Sit down.
Shut up!
- Sir..
Stop crying-
Here..
- Sir... no!
Sir, no.
- Kill them.
Take it.
Stop crying-
No...
- Sir..
Bloody dog, don't you get it?
Don't answer that now.
- ACP sir is calling.
No... no..
Yes, sir.
- You got the wrong girl, Manik.
She's not that girl.
But, sir..
Stealing stuff from the hostel, and making threat calls to me was done by someone else.
Don't shoot her.
- Sir..
Sir..
Sir, my battery's almost dead.
Call on Rajeshwar's cell.
- I didn't bring my mobile.
Sir..
- What does he want?
The phone's switched off.
No charge.
Leave it..
Let's finish the job first.
Shoot them.
Shoot.
Sir, maybe we got the wrong girl.
- What?
Yes.
That's why sir asked us to wait.
She's not that girl.
I haven't done anything!
Bloody lunatic, why does he keep changing the plan?
And he's saying this now.
Shoot her.
We'll deal with this later.
Shoot!
Sir, I am confused.
He said "Don't shoot", you're saying "Shoot".
Sir, what if this gets us in trouble later?
You're always so eager to answer the phone.
I answered only because ACP sir was calling.
To hell with your ACP!
He must be relaxing at home.
And out here, we're dealing with the mess.
B|oody..
What's he asking us to do?
Let's call him.
Go.
I need Bapurao with me.
Why?
Sir, to drive the van.
Go.
Come on, start the van.
- Yes.
Come on.
We've orders to let you go.
But you must keep quiet until they don't return.
Sir, it's Manik.
According to Bapurao's list, the thefts started last year in March.
And this girl joined now in July.
You fools got the wrong girl.
The details are clearly given in the list along with the dates.
You just make a copy, bring it to me..
..never read it, eat snacks off of it!
Let her go.
But, sir...we killed a guy in front of her.
How can we let her go?
Kill all of them.
- Okay, sir.
Now what?
What's going on?
B|oody..
The be|t's broken.
What a piece of junk!
Sir... he says that the garage is six kilometers away.
Give me your walky.
- Yes.
He||o...he||o, Rajeshwar sir.
He||o...he||o, Rajeshwar sir.
He||o..
He's not in range.
He's all alone out there.
I think... if we travel two kilometers back..
..then his walky will be in range.
Yes.
Hello.
Hello...
Rajeshwar sir.
Rajeshwar sir, can you hear me?
Rajeshwar sir.
Hello.
What happened?
The van's belt got broken.
What do I do about them?
We've orders to shoot them all.
He||o...sir, did you hear?
B|oody..
Hello, sir.
Hello.
Hello...
Rajeshwar sir.
Hello...
Rajeshwar sir.
Rajeshwar sir.
"I've a meeting with the minister."
He said he has to go... and sent us here instead.
So that he's safe.
He's a bloody fraud.
Couldn't he check the list properly earlier?
Messed everything up by calling us in the middle of the job.
Let's get that girl before she talks to anyone.
You're saying...you saw one of the police officers before?
Yes, Father.
He was there during the strike.
Hello, Andrew, how are you?
- James, I want to meet right now.
Where are you?
I am in Pune...for a court hearing.
What is it?
There's a problem in college.
- I see...what's wrong?
Not on the phone, let's talk face-to-face.
Just get here as soon as you can tomorrow morning.
Okay.
Fine, let's meet in the morning.
- Okay, bye.
Thanks.
May I go, Father?
I am not staying at the hostel tonight.
I'll be here tomorrow morning.
Well, if there's a problem, you can stay here.
There's no problem, Father.
I am going to my brother's home.
I'll be here by tomorrow by 7 am.
- Okay.
I'll drop you at the station.
It's close by, Father.
I'll manage on my own.
Yes.
Papa, that's my sister, Akira.
Come in, Akira.
That's not the sari.
Then where is it?
There's one less.
Mom's inside.
- Count again.
But you guys must book a Cool Cab first"
..so that you all get there on time.
How's the place?
Well, it's a great place.
You?
So suddenly?
What happened?
Who are all these people?
They are Shi|pa's relatives.
Her cousin's getting married.
They've come from Pune.
Something to eat?
What happened?
Did you get into a fight?
No, the door slammed on my face.
How can the door..
Wait, I'll put something on it.
- Mom!
I said it's nothing, let it be.
Akira, did you pay your hostel mess' fee?
Pay it tomorrow.
I want to talk to you.
- Say it.
Ajay.
Ajay.
- What happened?
Check this bill.
Something's wrong.
- What happened?
We selected 12 saris, didn't we?
- Yeah.
They billed us for 13 saris.
How's that possible?
We||...
I chose 5 silk saris, but I don't know about the rest.
But I..
- You settled the bill.
Yes.
- You must have counted the saris.
Maybe I checked..
- Did you count them or not?
No, I forgot.
- You didn't count the saris, Ajay.
But..
- How can you do such a thing?
- You check it.
There's no problem.
I kept telling you.
- Let me show you.
These are the ones that I counted.
These are Ritu's saris.
And I already gave aunty her saris.
Right?
There are two 'Chanderis' here..
..and those five silk saris which I packed myself.
- Okay.
What's the total?
12, AjaV---°"|'/ 12-
How can you pay for 13?
Have you seen this girl?
She just |eft.. that way.
"Eyes have not been get wet for a long time."
"There is life from this pretext."
"Eyes have not been get wet for a long time."
"There is life from this pretext."
"Slowly slowly rain comes and fills."
Siddharth, it's Akira.
- Hi.
Can we meet now?
- No, I just finished work.
I am on my way back from Pune.
Was it something urgent?
- No.
Say it.
- No, it's okay.
Hello.
"I am desert, you fill me with water."
"There eyes c|ouds.."
"There eyes c|ouds.."
Give the fried rice to the kids standing there.
Okay.
Thank you.
Bring that plate.
Okay.
- I don't believe it, man.
- Clean that table.
He's always staring at me.
Seriously, he's crazy.
Did you keep that bag in front of my room at the hostel?
He||o...what bag?
I am talking to you, Niki.
Listen, I've been keeping my distance.
I don't know about any bag.
Then who kept that bag?
She said she doesn't know anything.
Don't touch me.
I am warning you, Niki...
don't mess with me.
Do you know the trouble you've caused me?
Wretch...how dare you hit me?
Sir, even the other day you were mistaken..
- Shut up!
Bapurao, arrest everyone and lock them up!
Come on.
Sorry, sir.
- Come on.
What are you looking at?
Come on...get in.
- Sir...
Come on...get in.
Sujata, stop staring..
..and lock the girls up in Cell No. 2.
Get in.
I want to call home.
Make a call!
Get in..
Didn't I tell you, I'd catch her?
I ask you to get one girl;
but you get the whole college!
Botched up the game!
Sir, I thought.
- Don't think.
Please.
Now I'll do whatever needs to be done.
Bapurao.
- Sir.
Come on.
Come on.
Not you.
You stay there.
Listen, everyone.
No one talks about her outside.
Or I'll lock you all up again.
We can't kill her now.
Her college friends have seen her here.
And there's no telling what she's said to whom.
So what now, sir?
I'll tell you.
Hi...
How's your mom?
All well.
Good morning, Father.
Swipe for both the cars.
Okay, sir.
Ajay, sorry to disturb you.
Has Akira left for college?
Yes, Father, she left for the hostel last night.
Why?
What's wrong?
Her room's |ocked..
..and she hasn't appeared for the college's internal exams either.
What?
Did she tell you anything?
No.
Last night she was trying to tell me something..
..but, she..
Ask everyone she knows.
And let me know if you speak to Akira.
Sure, Father.
- Don't forget.
Definitely, Father.
I'll call right now.
I'll just call you back.
Brother-in-law.
- Akira hasn't gone to the hostel since last night.
What?
- Her principal just called.
I'll call my volunteers, ask them to find out.
We'll find her.
Let's file a missing complaint.
And we'll ask my advocate friend..
..how to include that Inspector Manik, whom she mentioned.
Sir, a missing comp|aint's been filed.
And Manik's name has been included.
I told you we'd get in deep trouble.
I just spoke with them.
But they are saying the same thing.
"We'll let you know once we find out."
Hello.
Sir..
Speak up.
Sir, we did exactly what you told us.
After this...we won't face any more problems because of that girl.
All clear, sir.
Stop.
Okay, that's enough for today.
Give her a dose.
When she's conscious again after four hours.
We'll do it once again.
Yes, doctor.
I'll never talk to you again.
Never.
Understand?
How dare you take my doll?
Don't make a racket.
Come, Kamla.
It's your turn.
I won't take a bath.
Only mad people bathe every day.
You know, I have a shampoo as well.
What color?
- Yellow.
I don't like yellow.
I...|ike this green.
- I've green too.
So...sha|| we go?
- Come on.
Let's go.
Are you a doctor?
- No, we're not doctors.
Then, are you like us?
- Yes, of course.
Then why don't you wear clothes like us?
We wear such clothes.
We like green.
Crazy girl - that's 'red', not 'green'.
Bedsheets...b|anket...green shampoo.
- Okay.
And I was just..
What happened?
Kirti?
What happened?
Akira?
Akira!
Akira!
- Akira!
Hello.
But, Rane sir..
- Don't worry, Doctor.
Rajeshwar will be there soon.
Remember, no one should get suspicious until then.
Okay.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, this is Amitabh Bachchan speaking.
- Listen.
Okay.
This is Rani speaking.
Can you ask the ten-million rupee question first?
Come here.
Come here.
Don't get me wrong, I was just kidding.
What is this place?
This is a big..
- What's the time?
Who is the in-charge here?
Get lost.
Come on..
Get back to general ward.
Madam, what is this place?
Get back.
Who are you?
Sit.
What are you doing?
- Sit down.
Hold her.
What is this?
Come on.
Get up.
Look this way.
Akira.
- Akira.
Get up.
Look this way.
Did this girl take drugs?
Drugs?
" Yes?
Not at all.
No, sir.
And what kind of a question is that?
Hold on, Sid.
Let me talk.
May I know what Akira's done?
What did she do?
She did this.
She hurled a stone at me.
At a police officer.
It missed my eye just because I ducked.
What day was it?
And where?
Last Tuesday at around 11 pm, I was on patrol duty.
I noticed her from afar.
As soon as she saw me, she started behaving strangely.
She came up to me and asked "Are you Manik?"
Why are you roaming here in disguise?
I thought to myself that something is wrong.
I got down from my bike, and was parking it..
"when she hurled a stone at me.
Thankfully I ducked, but it hit my head and I fell down.
I arrested her immediate|y..
..and brought her to the police station to file an FIR.
But even at the police station..
..she kept saying to the entire staff..
"Four police officers were trying to kill me."
"They killed two boys but I escaped."
I knew it's a charade.
Or she's mentally ill.
Ma'am, did she ever hit her head when she was a kid?
Any such incident...
which could explain this behavior?
It happened long ago.
She threw acid on a boy's face.
She was sent to a children's remand home.
She even stayed there.
- That's it.
Didn't I say something's wrong?
Something's definitely wrong.
That's why I immediately brought her to the docton.
I mean psychiatrist, for treatment.
And the tests were positive.
What's the actual problem?
She's affected by recurrent persistent delusion.
Type 2.
In simpler words, such patients.
..a|ways gets confused between reality and fantasy.
They believe one of their fantasies to be true, and starts reacting.
Akira believes that the police are following her..
..and they'll kill her in an encounter.
Due to this imagination, she's behaving strangely amongst people.
No...no need to worry.
She'll be fine soon.
It's okay, mom...it's okay.
They're saying she'll be okay.
It's okay, mom.
Now eat.
You must finish all of it.
Come on, eat.
You'll get more, now eat.
Your sit here.
Sit here.
First finish this.
Come on, eat.
You'll get water, wait.
Eat from your plate.
Hey...go away G0!
'
Akira.
Are you okay?
"Someone cast an evil eye on me, my
Hello.
Did you eat breakfast?
What's the time?
How long have you been in this hospital?
Almost two years..
I keep coming and going.
It's been going on like that.
Is it difficult to get out of here?
We||...it's very difficult to leave with permission.
But without permission...
it's less difficult.
Can you do something for me?
Hello, Father.
I am SP Rabiya.
Mumbai Crime Branch.
Please sit.
We||...there's a coffee shop, close to your college.
Around 500 meters away.
I am sure you know.
- Yes, I know.
On the 25th of last month..
..12 students from your college celebrated a birthday there.
And one of them stole a handycam..
"from a customer's bag.
Go back..
Later I saw the coffee shop's CCTV footage.
Stop.
Stop, stop, stop.
Out of those 12 students.
..that one girl could be seen stealing the camera.
But we couldn't see her face, she was wearing a cap.
So I started looking for all the students..
..whose faces could be seen in the video.
She's a 2nd year, Commerce Student.
And that's Bharat, 3rd year Mathematics student.
And he's a...2nd year Mathematics student as well.
And who's this?
This girl?
She's Ana.
The Principal's daughter.
Ana?
I want to see the handycam which your daughter stole.
Hi.
Did you go to the coffee shop with your friends?
When?
Which coffee shop?
You've been caught red-handed.
You've been caught stealing.
- Sir!
You've been caught stealing on camera.
- Sir...p|ease..
You've ruined my name and respect.
How will I face the students?
Go get the handycam you stole from the coffee shop.
I want to see it.
- I am ruined..
In a way, I'm the one who encouraged this thief.
In every meeting in the hoste|..
..I would tell the students, that..
"Whoever is committing these thefts in the hostel should mend their ways."
"And keep everything that's stolen in a bag.."
"..and leave it anywhere in the hostel."
"We won't take any action against this person."
'I didn't know that the thief's living in our own home.'
"Go, die somewhere."
'The college was shut down for holidays... '...when I discovered...' '...that my own daughter was the thief'
'All the students had gone home.
Only Akira was staying in the hostel.'
'That's why I left that bag outside her room.'
'So that when Akira finds the bag outside her room..'
'..she'd bring it to me immediately.'
Then I would've told everyone that the thief has returned everyone's stuff.
And I would've distributed everything back through the warden.
And this problem cou|d've been solved.
But Akira didn't show up that night.
Next day when I went to the hostel, the room was locked.
That same night, Akira came home..
..and said that there was a bag lying outside her room.
As she opened to take a look, two policemen arrived.
They took the handycam and mobile from the bag, and kidnapped her as well.
And they took two boys along, whom they killed.
Only Akira survived.
After Akira left, I asked her again..
..and she admitted to stealing the handycam from the coffee shop.
And also told me about the foolishness she did by keeping it.
I study hard as well...
but it's never enough for dad.
He never missed a single opportunity to insult me.
He even hit me in front of my friends.
Finally I got fed up, and did all this to hurt him.
And unknowingly, it became a habit.
Sorry.
You said sorry so easily.
Do you how many lives your childishness has ruined?
He plays well.
He'll whack any ball.
Want to bet?
We're definitely losing.
Look, he hit the shot.
Didn't I tell you?
HE'!
-
Stop!
What are you doing?
Stop.
Why you...
Stop.
Hey, swP-
Stop.
Ajay...
Ajay, what is all this?
Your sister's standing outside our door in such a strange condition.
Akira!
Akira!
What are you doing here?
Ajay, I want to talk to you alone.
Akira...what are you doing here?
You're under treatment, aren't you?
How can you...
Nothing's wrong with me, mom.
- We know nothing's wrong with you.
But you must finish your treatment.
There's nothing wrong with me, so why should I get treatment?
Ajay, please listen to me.
- Fine, tell me.
Last Tuesday I came here.
- Not Tuesday, you came on Wednesday.
Yes..
- One day before the wedding.
I did come on Wednesday too.
But I came one day before that too.
You and mom were not at home.
You can ask Shilpa.
That day, when you were upset with me.
Tell them.
But, Akira, why would Shilpa be upset with you?
Ask her later, but when I went back ..
..there was a bag lying outside my room.
As soon as I opened it, two policemen barged in!
Yes, we know.
Father told us.
Because I told Father.
That day, after I escaped from that encounter spot..
..I met Father first.
And then I came here.
Akira, none of this happened.
It's just your delusion.
Why will the police try to kill you, Akira?
I mean...there's no reason.
The inspector whom you assaulted, took you to the psychiatrist.
That doctor checked you..
- That bloody doctor...is a liar.
They want to help you, dear.
- Help me?
Unbelievable, mom.
They want to drive me crazy.
Just tell me how you got here.
Catch her!
From the hospital.
She beat us up and escaped!
Catch her.
Hold on.
- No.
Akira, no.
- Akira.
They give me electric shocks..
- No.
Akira.
Leave me.
Careful.
AjaY-
- Ajay, no!
Mom..
- Akira, just listen to them.
Don't let them take me!
Calm down, dear.
- Save me, mom.
All will be well.
- No!
Be brave.
- They...give me shocks...
Electric shocks...
She's calmed down.
Get the wheelchair.
Stop.
Excuse me.
I am SP Rabia.
I want to see a patient called Akira.
Where's her ward?
Thanks for saving me.
Who says thanks for something like that?
My own family doesn't trust me.
I'm sure everyone in college thinks I'm crazy too.
Giving you shocks...
and those injections.
..it's the doctor's doing.
If we catch him, everything'|| be fine.
Wear this.
Wait here.
- Yes, I'll be right here.
Akira...madam.
How could you do something so cheap?
Tell me.
Forgive me, please.
Sorry?
- Sorry?
Sorry?
Sorry
You're going to say sorry?
Will your apology make everything alright?
My own family thinks I'm crazy.
No, no...no...forgive me.
Tell me...te|| me the truth?
How much did they pay you?
- Madam...they forced me to do this.
That's why I had to do all this.
If you are right, why will they force you?
Few days ago...
a patient died accidentally.
..whi|e I was giving him shock treatment.
These cops helped me in closing that matter smoothly.
That's a||...nothing more.
Come on.
Get up.
Wear your shirt and come with me.
- Where, madam?
To tell my family, the principal and the entire college that you lied.
He'll me!
Someone help me!
He'll me!
Please help me.
What did he say?
- He said he's at the club.
Club.
Come on.
Someone's coming.
Rani, come here.
Is this the ladies toilet?
- Yes.
Sorry.
What is this man..
He came in the wrong toilet, so we beat him up.
Sorry, I had a little too much.
I'll leave.
Rani.
- Yes.
Lift him up
Hello.
- Brother, it's me again.
Do you have any news yet?
No.
It's been three days.
I've been waiting for him.
Not yet.
Again, the same story!
Listen..
- A po|iceman's missing, and the police has no clue.
How is this possible?
Have faith in me.
- I can trust you, right?
Absolutely.
- Really?
Yes.
Sir...
Rajeshwar sir's wife.
She keeps calling us over and over again.
She's in the village; very frightened.
She wants to come here..
..and file a 'Missing' complaint.
I managed her for now, but..
This money mess..
I've fixed...
my daughter's marriage.
If Rajeshwar sir spills the beans..
..then I will be ruined, sir.
- Bapurao!
Get up!
Get up.
So what if he's scared?
Will he open his mouth?
You're making a mistake.
- What?
I am making a mistake?
You guys turn my life into a joke..
..and you say I'm making a mistake?
Should I blow your brains out?
Just because they sent me to a remand home as a kid..
..everyone looked down on me.
And now...this taint of being crazy.
Just being treated at the mental hospital means your life is over.
Why did you people do this to me?
Why did you people falsely accuse me?
Tell me.
Madam, these numbers match.
Good, file this separately.
Okay.
Take a picture of all this.
Okay, ma'am.
Look, ma'am.
Yes, this one too.
Get me the details of the driver of the crashed car.
Most importantly, the person who claimed the insurance.
Okay.
Since we received a complaint of Rajeshwar's disappearance.
..these three have been missing too.
No one at the police station knows anything either.
And their cellphones are off too.
We must arrest them and keep them inside.
Yeah...the TV and Press will humiliate us for a few days.
But we'll handle that.
Hello.
- Hello, Siddharth.
Akira speaking.
Where are you calling from?
- Listen to me carefully.
Go on.
The college's annual day function is tomorrow at 9:30 am.
The entire campus will gather at the auditorium.
Bring Ajay and mother along, I'll meet you there.
Inspector Rajeshwar is with me.
And he's ready to tell everyone how these policemen wanted to kill me.
Okay.
Who's call is it, Sid?
- Akira.
Akira...
Akira, where are you?
We're so worried..
- Ajay, I've told Siddharth everything.
Yeah, but..
- Bring mother along.
Don't make any excuses.
- Fine, but listen to me..
Akira...he||o.
Hello.
What did she say?
She..
Yes, ma'am.
- I am SP Rabiya, Crime Branch.
"Inspector Rajeshwar is with me."
"He's ready to talk about how these cops wanted to kill me."
"When they didn't succeed.."
"..they proved that I am delusional with Dr. Santosh Tiwari's he|p.."
"..and locked me up at the Thane mental asylum."
"Rajeshwar has agreed to say this.."
"..in front of the media, the court and the entire college."
Agreed?
How can he agree?
I was telling you, sir.
He must be scared, right?
Sir, we've traced the location of Rajeshwar sir's mobile.
The signal was coming from the towen.
..c|ose to Holy Cross College.
Sir... a lot of students live around the college as paying guests.
If she's hiding in one of those bui|dings..
.. it'll take days to find her.
What time is the college function tomorrow?
- 10 am.
Is that person over there your principal?
Yes.
Who's with him?
Actua||y...he's the vice-principal.
Sir.
Sir, I just saw that mad person..
..head towards the building near the ground.
No one's allowed to go there.
The structure's too weak. .
Did you check behind the building?
- No, sir.
The principa|'s arrived.
He's sitting on the front seat.
You must tell everyone...
exactly what you told me.
Get it?
If you try to act smart, I'll shoot you.
Rani!
Sir!
She's run out of bullets, sir!
Quiet.
- Sir!
Come on.
Get up.
Stop!
- Manik.
Get on your knees!
Get on your knees!
Hands at the back!
Hands at the back!
Bapurao.
Stay still or else I'll shoot.
Wretch.
Leave it.
Leave her.
You shou|d've done something when she kidnapped you.
What's the point of showing your machismo now?
Sir, do you know what happened that day?
Don't talk nonsense.
Nonsense?
I am talking nonsense?
A college student and a mad person abduct you"
..thrash you...and mess you up.
There's nothing you could do and you're showing your anger now.
I see.
Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.
Here.
Manik.
- Sir.
Your FIR report.
Two mad people stole tools from the mortuary.
And...they abducted Rajeshwar and brought him here.
By the time we got here to save Rajeshwar..
..they'd already severed his hand.
Bapurao.
And we had no other choice.
So, in order to save Rajeshwar, we had to kill these two.
Now shoot her in the forehead.
Manik...you'|| do no such thing.
You cleverly slip out of every situation.
You have a gun, don't you?
You shoot her!
Shoot her!
Get your hands and limbs severed.
Why do you always ride the gun on our shoulders?
Don't be crazy..
- You've been doing crazy things from the beginning..
..and you're calling me crazy?
Don't you know how to talk to your senior?
- Hey!
You're my senior only when we're in the department.
Out here, I am senior to you in age, and you're my junior.
Bloody fool, talking nonsense.
Hey..
- Leave me!
- Be quiet...
He'll create problems with the gir|s..
..and ask us to deal with it.
And sit at home by himself...
"I am in Nasik."
"..in a meeting with the minister."
He talks too much.
Manik.
- Sir.
Your new FIR report.
These two kidnapped Rajeshwar and brought him here.
We followed them here.
We killed that mad person and saved Rajeshwar.
Arrested this girl.
We were taking the gir|..
"when she snatched my gun and shot Rajeshwar.
Next...she tried to kill me.
That's when you"
Go back 10 feet from your position.
And shoot her.
Shoot her, Manik.
Back.
Shoot.
Manik.
Hands up!
Manik, throw down your gun.
Here she comes again.
Or else we'll have to shoot.
Rabiya, do you even know what happened here?
Don't act without knowing the facts.
I know everything, sir.
Right from the accident on Mumbai-Pune Highway..
..to sending this girl to the mental asylum, everything.
I know everything.
You can't kill her and hide the truth anymore.
And even the commissioner knows about it.
We've orders to arrest you, sir.
Please throw your guns down.
Manik.
Throw your gun down.
Sir, please.
Amar.
- Ma'am.
Get their guns.
They killed my friend.
Her body is lying somewhere at the back.
Rafiq, go check.
Yes, ma'am.
Do you know everything?
- Yes, I do.
Ma'!
I g0 now?
It's the commissioner?
Hello, sir.
- Where are you?
Behind Holy Cross College, in the old church.
What happened?
- We've arrested them, sir.
Don't arrest them, Rabiya.
There's a problem.
Why, sir?
The guy they murdered on the highway..
..was the brother of North Indian Party's top leader, Bablu Tiwari.
Remember...he was involved in provoking riots in the city before.
This year his party is claiming to host..
..the biggest 'Chhat Puja' event in Mumbai.
Due to which there is already growing tension amongst the local parties.
That money was being brought in for that event.
If the news leaks out, that his brother didn't die in an accident..
..but in fact, a few Mumbai police officers murdered him for the money..
..then Bablu Tiwari will provoke riots again.
And so I spoke with the Secretariat..
..and the higher authorities and made this decision.
So end the case right here and close the file.
So please follow my orders.
Don't arrest them.
But sir, two murders have been committed here.
Inspector Rajeshwar and a mad person's been shot.
Look, Rabiya, they are going to prepare a fake report anyway.
I promise a full inquiry against Rane and his entire team.
They will definitely get a life sentence.
And that girl Akira..
- You're thinking about saving one gir|..
..and I am thinking about thousands of innocent people.
Please understand.
This has now become a national issue.
And so...we must keep this under wraps..
..unti| the 'Chhat Puja' isn't over next month.
But, sir, the media's already standing outside.
I cannot lie to them.
Rabiya, give the phone to ACP Rane.
Yes, sir.
Commissioner sir.
Hello, sir.
ACP Rane, so you're above the law now?
You'll do as you want.
- No, sir, actua||y..
Do you have any idea..
..that your action has stirred up a law and order situation.
Now listen carefully.
- Yes, sir.
Sure.
You've to pretend before the media..
..that Akira is an escaped mental patient.
And don't mess it up.
- Okay, sir.
We'll handle it.
Understand.
Yes, sir.
Sure, sir.
Rabiya madam, you can take your team and go back.
Manik.
- Sir.
Call the hospital, and call an ambulance to take her back.
Sir.
Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.
Make that girl sit in a corner.
Yes, sir.
What happened, madam?
I can come with you, right?
We cannot handle this case anymore, Akira.
They've been asked to take charge of this case now.
Them?
But they are responsible for all this.
How can they handle it?
Bapurao, don't just sit there and stare.
Make her sit in a corner until the ambulance doesn't arrive.
Sir.
Why should I go back to the hospital?
Sorry, Akira, but I can't help you right now.
But...what's the problem?
If your case gets registered, it will turn into a communal issue.
And the riots can..
..|ead to the loss of many innocent lives.
Only you can save this city from burning up again.
And so they are going to keep you in the hospital for a whi|e..
..and then let you go.
I am sorry, but...
there's no other choice, Akira.
How can you say that?
They tried to kill a girl.
Together they tried to prove that I'm crazy.
Arrest them!
Will you send me back to the asylum too in order to cover up the truth?
I am sorry, the department will definitely give you compensation"
..and I will try..
- Bapu Rao.
- Compensation?
What do you mean by compensation?
Come on.
You mean first you gouge both my eyes out"
..and then give me an expensive walking-stick.
Please cooperate with them.
Believe me, it can..
What's more that can happen?
You shou|d've killed me instead.
'That day my hands were tied, but not Akira's.'
Madam!
Madam!
Madam!
Madam!
Ma'am, their guns?
- Keep it.
Sir.
Let go.
- Let go.
Let go.
Let go.
Let go.
Let go.
Madam..
Please, madam.
'If your case gets registered, it'll turn into a communal issue.'
'And the riots can..'
'..|ead to the loss of many innocent lives.'
'Only you can save this city from burning up again.'
Akira.
What...what's she saying?
She's saying that she nailed herself to the cross.
'Since the report that deemed Akira mentally ill, was fake..' ...I made sure that no case was registered against her,'
'A few days later, she was fully exonerated and she went home...' '...where she began to follow the path her father had shown her.'
'I want every daughter of this country, including mine...to become like Akira.'
'Someone who learns to live on the basis of her own strength.'
Very good.

Come on.
Didn't she come today?
Exactly what I was saying?
- Start the bike.
- It's okay.
How dare you reject me!
Take that, die!
Let's go...
let's go.
- Drive faster!
- Sister.
Faster, faster!
Didn't anyone see him?
I saw him.
No.
No.
It was him!
You...
Get inside!
How dare you tell the police?
Take that.

Oh my...
Greetings, my lady...!
This has become a daily routine.
Why doesn't someone take action against them?
What a gorgeous girl...
Look here.
Your sister-in-law.
She must be your sisterin-law.
Sweetheart, look this way.
Make me your sweetheart.
Amazing.
Madam.
You see, madam.
Hello... hello.
Hey.
You..
Wait.
- Someone help her.
- Anyone.
Someone help her.
Mister.
'Everyone saw what happened.'
'But the boy's father had a huge vote-bank supporting him.'
'Your Honor, this girl assaulted my client first.'
'It was an unprovoked attack.'
'But Your Honor, I have witnesses.'
'I can prove that Akira is innocent.'
'But the witness is also saying..'
'..that this crazy girl brutally assaulted three boys.'
'In light of all the evidence..'
'..the court decides to send Akira to the Child Correction facility..'
'..until we reach a verdict.'
'And this way... it took three years to prove Akira's innocence.'
- Akira.
- Yes.
Listen.
I am listening.
Go ahead.
Your brother's arriving from Mumbai today.
He called yesterday.
Why?
He's calling me to Mumbai.
I mean you and me.
To stay with him.
- Mumbai?
- Yeah.
I am not going anywhere.
Look, Akira, stop arguing.
He's coming after a very long time.
Come home soon from college.
When he went against your wishes..
And married that Mumbai-girl, you swore never to see his face again.
He's worried about his child, that's why he's calling us.
He's calling you to wash his kid's soiled pants.
He never called all these years.
And now when they can't handle the child, he calls everyday.
I am not leaving Jodhpur and going anywhere.
Akira.
- We're here.
- Yes.
- Thank you, Am.
- Yeah.
I'll see you in the evening.
Definitely.
Thank you.
Grandma, how are you?
I am fine.
Ajay, you returned home after so long.
What to do, grandma?
I was busy with work.
- See you later.
- Okay.
Mom.
- Excuse me, madam.
- Yes.
The principal wants to meet Akira.
I'll try talking to her.
Come in.
- Sit down.
- No, I am fine.
We were just talking about you.
It's a good thing that..
Your brother wants to take both of you to Mumbai.
To look after you two.
Why are you saying no?
Well... the new semester's just started.
And I've already wasted so many years.
Uncle...
I can easily get her admission in Mumbai.
I know the principal at Holy Cross Arts and Science College..
Really well.
I'm like a father to you.
There's no scope for further education in this small city.
If you go to Mumbai..
It'll really help your higher studies.
The door's open.
Come in.
Hey..
Mom...
Akira, this is Shilpa.
Come in.
Bless you... it's alright.
Oh, sorry..
It's okay.
Bless you.
Come, I'll show you.
Give it.
Come.
Sorry, wrong house.
You... wrong house.
- Sid.
- Hi, sis.
Come.
That's my brother.
- May I come in?
- Yeah.
- He lives here with us.
- I see.
Sid.
Hello, aunt
- Hello, son.
He's planning to go abroad..
To do his Doctorate in Finance.
Doctor!
Yes.
It's really hard work, isn't it?
Doctors are highly respected.
This is great.
Now we've a doctor at home.
Son, I've got severe pain in my knee for three months.
Take a look.
- Sorry, aunt...
I'm not the kind of doctor you think.
I am doing Finance..
I mean...
I am doing a doctorate in money-management.
PhD!
It's like a degree.
Well, that's good.
Doctors don't get much respect.
You can find a bunch of them at every nook and corner.
Yes, aunt... that's why..
Actually, he also works in a Social Welfare Organization.
Along with a few of his friends.
'Raindrops.'
- I see.
He does social work.
Forget that, let's play squash today.
I don't mind, but you will lose again.
I'll let you win.
Listen..
Stop talking.
Sid, eat.
Akira, the principal's called us at 11 am.
And it'll take around two hours to get there.
We'll get you a local-train pass.
So that you can easily commute to and fro.
I'll stay at the hostel.
Why will you stay in the hostel?
Yeah, Akira?
Why the hostel?
The hostel rent, canteen expenses...
It's unnecessary..
Ajay...
Why are you forcing her?
If she wants to stay in the hostel, then let her.
We shouldn't have a problem.
She will visit us often... during her holidays.
Akira, Ajay's told me everything.
Don't worry, you won't be wasting this year.
You... just concentrate on your studies.
Thank you.
About the hostel?
Father, I talked to you over the phone about that hostel room.
Yeah..
Yes, Father.
Sister d'Mello, is there any room available in the hostel?
No, Father.
We had four students from Nasik as well, asking for rooms.
But we couldn't help them either.
What can we do?
But we do have Room No.
17, which we never consider.
Yes... but..
What's the problem in Room No. 17?
Last year, one of the students committed suicide in that room.
Since then... no one is willing to stay there.
It's been closed since then.
Father, I don't have a problem.
I can live there.
Akira, someone committed suicide..
It's okay.
Excuse me.
Dad, weren't you looking for this?
Where was it?
You forgot it in the kitchen while talking to mom.
I'll get some privacy...
I'll live there.
But, Akira, someone committed suicide..
Don't discourage her if she wants to live there.
No, Father, I was just..
Leave that.
Ajay, remember we discussed about a donation for the old church.
- Yes.
- Here it is.
Yes.
The college campus is 55 acres wide.
Father's home is in the campus as well.
There's an old church as well, which has been closed for a long time.
Father's been collecting donations for its renovation.
There's a school here too?
Yes.
But only for deaf and dumb children.
But it's under the same management.
Come.
Ma'am... my ipod's missing.
- Missing?
- Yes.
Since when?
It was on my bed, I just went to the next room.
When I returned, it was missing.
Always lock your room.
I've told you so many times.
I am fed up of these thefts every week.
Here's the 'Missing' register.
Fill in the details.
We'll inform you if we find anything.
Here.
See... keep your belongings carefully, and always lock them away.
Yes.
This is the one.
I'll get the room cleaned up by evening.
Good stuff..
Must be from down South.
- Sir..
- Yes.
- Sir, should I drive?
- Why?
You're a bit..
- Bapurao.
- Sir.
Give me the alcohol tester.
Yes.
Sir.
Check yourself, it's within the limit.
But, sir, this is something else.
If you lose control..
- Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.
He's a new recruit, and wants to test my control.
No, sir.
Let's show him my control.
Let it be, sir.
Sir..
Sir, careful.
Rane, sir..
Rane sir, careful.
It's okay, sir.
What's this?
Oh, God!
Don't say anything, sir.
I am new, but why did you get scared?
This is the first time he hit the brakes on time.
Get in.
All his creations...
are in the form of couplets.
And his main subjects are religion, ethics and preaching.
- Niki.
- Sir, it's a strike.
Sit down everyone!
Strike?
What for?
Sir, the canteen food is horrible.
Even the rats are falling sick, sir.
So everyone suggested that if we complain together..
Then maybe the contractor will change.
Do you have to do all this during class?
Can't you do it during lunch-break?
Do you want to join them?
Yes, sir, we'll go too.
Let's go.
Strike for this, strike for that...
everyone wants to be the next CM.
So, I was saying..
From literature's point of view..
Are you special?
Don't disturb those who don't want to join you.
You can all go.
She's crazy.
Niki, we'll deal with her later.
So where were we?
What's going on there?
Sorry.
Madam, she still doesn't like the canteen food.
- Manik.
- Sir.
Should I drive?
No, sir.
I'll drive.
Where's my lighter?
Is it under your seat?
Watch out!
Hey..
What are you doing?
Such disregard for traffic rules.
Hey..
First you rammed a police-car.
And now you're creating a scene.
What do you mean by police-car?
Aren't there any traffic rules for you?
And you weren't even wearing a seatbelt.
Hey...
Uncle, you would've been squashed like a bug.
Say thank you and leave.
Enough of this nonsense.
Hello, sir.
I'm not talking nonsense.
He's showing me the finger.
Do you want me to explain politely?
Sir... he's a college professor, show some manners.
Oh, Professor.
What are you doing?
Sir, are you okay?
Sir, careful.
Come back, sir.
And they call themselves police officers.
They have their own rules.
Are you hurt?
Sir...
I am telling you, it must be a mistake.
I am sure he didn't know that he was a professor.
Take my complaint right now and lodge an FIR.
Sir, it's a small matter.
Don't blow it out of proportion.
I am telling you, there's nothing I can do about it.
Come, sir.
We'll show them.
Let's go.
Everyone sign this, we'll take this to the commissioner.
The police assaulted our professor without a reason.
Everyone sign this.
The police think they can do anything.
And they refused to file a complaint.
We'll show them the power of students.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
The police must apologize!
The police must apologize!
Control Room!
Control Room!
A huge crowd has gathered here.
Please send forces immediately.
The police must apologize!
The police must apologize!
- We want...
- Justice.
Step back.
Step back.
You cannot block the roads.
Please disperse.
We won't tolerate it.
Get up... don't sit here!
We won't tolerate it.
Clear the roads.
Get out of here.
The police must apologize!
- Sir...
- Manik, are you a kid?
Don't talk to them, just kick them out before the Commissioner arrives.
Okay, sir.
- Yes, charge at them.
- Sir.
Charge... phone..
Don't know.
Get them out of here.
Come on.
Come on.
Get up... get out of here.
Leave us.
The police must apologize!
Get rid of them.
Get them out.
Come on.
Sir, one of your officers assaulted our professor.
Sir, they were hurling stones at us...
uprooting rods.
Shinde was bleeding.
And you panicked.
No, sir, that's not it.
You wouldn't have fired, if you hadn't panicked.
All you had to do was break a few bones.
It was a small matter.
Sir..
Where's the bottle of water?
Sir, Bapurao took it to the bathroom.
- Rajeshwar.
- Yes, sir.
I had mixed vodka in that bottle which he took.
His backside will start dancing.
Call him.
Yes..
See if he's done or not.
- Bapurao!
- Coming.
Let's go.
Bloody thing... it burns.
Manik, you know what to say in the inquiry.
- Yes, sir.
Hey..
Bloody hell, he'll definitely die.
Oh no...
He rammed the car, sir.
Hello..
Looks like he'd decided to die today.
He didn't wear seatbelts either.
The tire burst, sir.
The airbags didn't open either.
The speed at which he came in, I am sure he's dead.
Sir...
let's put him in our jeep and take him to the hospital.
Waste of time, Rajeshwar!
No point.
What happened?
Is he dead?
Seems like it.
No movement in the body.
Doesn't this area fall under Inspector Khamkar?
- That baldy..
- Yeah..
Panvel-Panchayat area.
Sir.
Look what's here.
Is it full of money?
Check it.
Yes.
Looks like about 70-80 cr.
Easily.
What do you think we should do?
Your call, sir.
All clear, sir!
Such a lonely place and so much money!
Did you find Khamkar's number?
I say let's handle this by ourselves.
What say?
It's a gift - we can all settle down comfortably.
But, sir..
The Goddess of Wealth is knocking at your door..
But you'd rather stand in the queue!
Don't worry, I'll arrange everything.
- Manik, come.
- Sir.
Bapurao.
Yeah..
- Rajeshwar.
- Yes, sir.
Keep it down.
Bapurao.
Hey, stop!
Leave the bag!
Everything's already messed up.
What...
'News about the increasing number of thefts in the city over the month.'
'And the recent news of robbery at Ghanshyam Das Jewellers in Kandivali.'
What's wrong?
Not in the mood?
Going home?
I am talking to you.
ACP sir, why are you wearing your clothes?
Take them off and come here.
I've something more important to do.
Will you please finish your drink in the hall?
I've to make a call.
It's an official call.
There is tension at many places in Maharashtra.
After the attack on North Indian auto drivers in Pune..
Many people have left the city.
'We received news of five road-accidents in and around Mumbai.
The total number of casualties is four.
- Hello.
- Sir.
Manik, did you watch the news?
Yes, sir, I did.
Our matter simply disappeared into thin air along with the other news.
The rest is a piece of cake...
easy-peasy.
Listen, we made one mistake.
When I hit him with the jack, I should've hit him on the face instead.
It would've looked like an accident.
But I hit him on the back instead.
Now... keep a close watch on the post-mortem and don't slip up.
Listen, carefully explain to Bapurao and Rajeshwar... what to do with the rest of the money.
Yes, sir.
And from now on, call me on my new number.
Write it down.
Yes, sir.
988...
"...and don't slip up."
"Listen, carefully explain to Bapu Rao and Rajeshwar.."
"..what to do with the rest of the money."
"And from now on call me on my new number."
"Write it down."
"988...4205869."
"Happy Birthday to you.."
Such a big prize.
And you got it so easily.
Where did you record this?
In my bedroom.
Around 11 months ago, I got caught in a hotel raid.
He took my number and address..
But he didn't register any case.
He released me without taking any money.
But after that..
He started coming home whenever he wanted.
At first I didn't take it too seriously.
I thought he's a police officer after all..
Someday he'll come in handy.
But then he started bugging me - romance and what not.
I wanted to get rid of him.
And just last week, I fixed this camera in my bedroom..
So that he'd stop harassing me.
Call it fate, look what I got my hands on.
And immediately called you guys.
If we make a plan, we can extort all the money from him.
Maya, if this didn't involve the police..
We could've handled anyone else easily.
And this guy's the ACP.
If he finds out, he'll charge us with a fake case..
And kill all of us.
If we make a foolproof plan..
Then we could all go back to Gorakhpur and live happily.
I don't want to get into this police mess.
Maya, when you called I thought..
Maybe some college student or software engineer..
Has fallen head-over-heels for you.
Look, this is quite risky.
You won't be able to get out of this one.
- Let's go.
- Come on.
Sun".
Listen... take a day's time.
Think...
and let me know tomorrow.
Didn't I already tell you?
Look, do whatever you want.
But don't ever bring this matter up again.
- Let's go.
- It's getting late.
Your bill, ma'am.
Thanks.
Where is it?
- Excuse me.
- Yes, ma'am.
Those students who were here - do they come regularly?
I don't know, ma'am.
What happened?
There was a camera in my bag, but now it's missing.
They just passed by my table.
I didn't notice, ma'am.
Do you know them?
I think they were Holy Cross college students.
Holy Cross college students!
And now finally, a small speech by Akira.
Good evening.
Actually, Father and the lecturers asked me to give a speech suddenly..
So I haven't prepared much.
But since its World Disabled Day..
It reminded me of something my father said.
My father.
We can't hear you!
I think the Mike is not working.
We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
What's wrong?
We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
Sir, there's a problem with the connection.
It'll take a while, sir.
I'll see what's wrong?
We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
"A disabled person isn't someone who doesn't have a limb.."
"..it's someone who doesn't use the limbs."
"Hands that don't come forth to help others are 'disabled'."
"The eyes that ignore atrocities...
are 'disabled'."
"Feet that turn away and desert their parents are 'disabled'."
Niki, we must do something about her.
Stop here.
- How much?
- Let it be.
It's okay.
I can't take money from you.
I see...
then come every day at 8 am.
Madam..
It's not a government vehicle.
Here you go.
Good morning, sir.
Rabiya madam...
Back again?
Are you looking to score a century in transfers?
The straight path is often the twisted one, sir.
Did you come with family, or..
No, sir, I've come alone.
Alone?
- Okay?
- Okay, sir.
Hello.
"Manik, did you watch the news?"
"Our matter disappeared into thin air along with other news."
"The rest is a piece of cake...
easy-peasy."
"Listen, we made one mistake."
"When I hit him with the jack,..
I should've hit him on the face instead."
"it would've looked like an accident.
But I hit him on the back."
"Now... keep a close watch on the post-mortem and don't slip up."
"Listen, what to do with the rest of the money..."
'The number you've called is currently switched off.'
We should've been more careful, sir.
I never thought she would do such a thing with me.
Her house is locked and she's missing.
Even her phone's switched off.
She's a hooker;
Won't be easy to trap her.
Will she be asking for a share in the money..
Or ask for all of it?
Wonder who else is in this with her?
Don't let the word spread.
Yes.
Sir, the call made to you was from a prepaid number.
The SIM Card... has been issued to this college ID.
First year student, Holy Cross College.
And listen... they've asked me to pay the hostel fee next week.
Please tell brother to pay it.
Yes, I..
I've to make an urgent call.
Enough!
Break her face!
Hey..
Seen a girl in a blue shirt?
So?
Are you scared now?
Please forgive me.
I've already wasted three years of my college.
Now if I thrash you people too, I'll get in trouble again.
What?
I see... you were hiding here, so you don't thrash us.
Stop talking to her.
I don't want to fight.
Listen to me.
Please tell them, was it my fault?
You were picking on me for no reason.
We'll go, just wait a minute.
David, Pooja said you were looking for me.
Nothing important..
You always used to listen to music on your phone, with the headphones.
Where is it?
I don't see it.
My phone's been stolen.
I went to wash my face and it disappeared.
I even made an entry in the 'Missing' register.
- Why?
What happened?
- Nothing.
Just asked.
I'll tell you if I find it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
The college wants to catch him red-handed, sir.
So, the call I received was from a stolen phone.
This means... whoever stole the phone is still in the hostel.
And before the hostel guys find him, we must find him first.
You two will keep an eye on Maya's home, as well as the hostel.
- Sir.
Here's your fare.
- Hello.
- Sir, it's me.
She's here.
Get inside and tie her up.
Sir, me?
I am coming!
Where is she?
What happened?
You dare record my phone calls and threaten me?
You wanted to extort money from me?
- Me?
- No.
How did you record the call?
Tell me how did you record the call?
With a handycam!
Look at me..
Where's your handycam?
Stolen.
What?
Stolen?
Someone stole it at the coffee shop.
I didn't see his face.
But I know he's a student at Holy Cross College.
What were you doing at the coffee shop?
What were you doing at the coffee shop?
Tell me the truth, or I will break your face.
You won't get another customer or a lover.
Why did you take the camera to the coffee shop?
I went to meet a couple of friends.
Did you show them the video?
Did you show them the video?
So three more people know now.
She's spoiled it all.
Messed it up!
She's messed us up!
Maya!
Maya!
Maya!
Maya!
Maya!
What was the name of the coffee shop?
Coffee shop..
Wretch.
Did she say the name of the coffee shop?
She didn't say anything.
I'm going through a real bad phase.
Go on.
Madam.
The kohl's completely smeared.
Seems she cried a lot before committing suicide.
Right, madam.
I deduced that too.
She cried her heart out.
She...
looks tense too.
This is definitely a suicide.
Her cheeks are swollen too.
Maybe someone beat her up and made her cry.
And then hung her.
But, madam, the...
door's locked from inside.
Manik, you're so naive.
Locking the door from inside...
is an old grandfather's technique.
The computer's hard disk is missing.
Her cellphone isn't here either.
There was a charger in the bedroom, did you see it?
You mean that cellphone charger.
It's not a cellphone charger, it's a video-camera charger.
There's a charger, but no camera.
Is this Plot No. 401-C?
- Who is he?
- Courier, madam.
Come here.
Sign.
Thank you, sir.
What is it, madam?
Credit card bill.
Beauty parlour, pub, supermarket, coffee shop.
She swiped her card in these four places.
Find out where she visited regularly.
Did she go alone or with friends?
Find out more details about her.
- Keep this.
- Yes, ma'am.
Actually, Manik, give that to me.
I'll keep it.
Call the forensic people, ask them when they can get here.
- Yes.
I think something's wrong.
Maybe it's a murder.
Looks like it's the handiwork of at least 3 to 4 people.
Fine, you make the call... until then I'll question the neighbors.
Yes, ma'am.
Bloody Rabia... always honest.
That too on a police salary.
We can't shut her up with a share either.
You will only follow this case...
and no acting smart.
Rabia should never find out..
That we're involved in this case.
Sir.
Let's see how far she Gets, with that baby in her tummy.
- Manik.
- Yes, ma'am.
We couldn't locate Maya's buddies in the coffee shop, right?
Well, I just got their address.
- Note it down.
- Madam?
- Note it down.
- Y-Yes, ma'am.
House No. 3, Yamuna Nagar, Malad East.
Sir..
Where are you taking us?
Don't worry.
Please, sir, we're getting worried.
We'll tell you everything.
- Sir..
- Come on, get it.
It's nothing, it will be over in 10 minutes.
Where are you taking us, sir?
Get in, come on.
Yes, Manik.
Madam, I found two guys at the address you gave me.
They willingly got in the car without any hassle.
But as soon as the car slowed down at the bend..
They jumped out and escaped.
We tried catching them, but..
I see.
See you there, we'll discuss this.
Okay, madam.
Well, for now, my life-calling is to go to classes.
Going to Churchgate;
Can I drop you someplace?
Thanks.
- Okay.
See you.
- Bye.
Akira.
Take a seat.
How's college?
All okay?
Good.
By the way, does anyone in college know that you've been to jail..
I mean...
that you were in the Remand Home.
No!
That's a good thing.
Who knows how they'll behave once they find out.
By the way, no one from my family knows about this.
The other day, the police came home..
Just for Sid's passport verification.
And dad was very uncomfortable.
If he finds out about all this, then..
You can keep meeting Sid, talk to him, be friends..
But if things go beyond that, it'll be a problem for all.
No?
Don't worry, that won't happen.
You won't have any problems because of me.
Hope I didn't hurt you.
It's not that easy to hurt me.
Bapurao.
Yes, sir.
The college is closed for vacations.
Yes.
Who's going to stay in the hostel now?
We've been standing out here like madmen.
Madam, please listen.
Who are you guys?
How did you get in?
Isn't the watchman inside?
We came here to meet a student, but didn't realize it's the holidays.
Are you alone in the hostel?
Yes.
I see..
Who do you want to meet?
- L..
- Riya.
What's her room number?
Isn't this the model we've been looking for?
Please keep it back, it's not mine.
How much did you pay for this camera?
I told you this is not mine.
Please keep it back.
ACP sir's number on the dialing list.
What?
ACP who?
Is this your bag?
It was lying outside.
"Listen, I made a mistake."
"When I hit him with the jack.."
Come with us.
Where?
Who are you?
Come on!
"Don't you get it?"
"it's an official call."
"Hello..."
Sir, she's out to get us.
During the college strike, she gave the file to the commissioner.
Did you ask her, did she make more copies of this video?
We searched her room, but found nothing.
And did she tell anyone about this?
What did she say?
The same old thing..
"This isn't my bag, I don't know where it came from".
If these three spill the beans to anyone..
Then we'll lose everything we've made so far.
We must do something quickly.
Plus I've to go to Nasik..
For a very boring session with the Home Minister.
Could take a few days.
And it could be dangerous to keep them alive for three days.
I suggest... that you end this whole thing.
Don't wait for me to return.
- Remember our usual spot?
- Go.
Sir... we haven't done anything.
Come on, get down.
Where are you taking us?
Keep walking down.
Come on..
We haven't done anything, sir..
Sir..
Trying to be a hero?
Where..
Come on.
Sir..
Come on.
Sit down.
- Shut up!
- Sir..
Stop crying-
- Here..
- Sir... no!
- Sir, no.
- Kill them.
Take it.
Stop crying-
- No...
- Sir..
Bloody dog, don't you get it?
Don't answer that now.
ACP sir is calling.
No... no..
Yes, sir.
You got the wrong girl, Manik.
She's not that girl.
But, sir..
Stealing stuff from the hostel, and making threat calls to me... was done by someone else.
- Don't shoot her.
- Sir..
Sir..
Sir, my battery's almost dead.
Call on Rajeshwar's cell.
I didn't bring my mobile.
- Sir..
- What does he want?
The phone's switched off.
No charge.
Leave it..
Let's finish the job first.
Shoot them.
Shoot.
Sir, maybe we got the wrong girl.
What?
Yes.
That's why sir asked us to wait.
She's not that girl.
I haven't done anything!
Bloody lunatic, why does he keep changing the plan?
And he's saying this now.
Shoot her.
We'll deal with this later.
Shooﬂ.
Sir, I am confused.
He said "Don't shoot", you're saying "Shoot".
Sir, what if this gets us in trouble later?
You're always so eager to answer the phone.
I answered only because ACP sir was calling.
To hell with your ACP!
He must be relaxing at home.
And out here, we're dealing with the mess.
Bloody..
What's he asking us to do?
Let's call him.
Go.
I need Bapurao with me.
Why?
Sir, to drive the van.
Go.
- Come on, start the van.
- Yes.
Come on.
We've orders to let you go.
But you must keep quiet until they don't return.
Sir, it's Manik.
According to Bapurao's list, the thefts started last year in March.
And this girl joined now in July.
You fools got the wrong girl.
The details are clearly given in the list along with the dates.
You just make a copy, bring it to me..
Never read it, eat snacks off of it!
Let her go.
But, sir... we killed a guy in front of her.
How can we let her go?
- Kill all of them.
- Okay, sir.
Now what?
What's going on?
Bloody..
The belt's broken.
What a piece of junk!
Sir... he says that the garage is six kilometers away.
- Give me your walky.
- Yes.
Hello... hello, Rajeshwar sir.
Hello... hello, Rajeshwar sir.
Hello..
He's not in range.
He's all alone out there.
I think... if we travel two kilometers back..
Then his walky will be in range.
Yes.
Hello.
Hello...
Rajeshwar sir.
Rajeshwar sir, can you hear me?
Rajeshwar sir.
Hello.
What happened?
The van's belt got broken.
What do I do about them?
We've orders to shoot them all.
Hello... sir, did you hear?
Bloody..
Hello, sir.
Hello.
Hello...
Rajeshwar sir.
Hello...
Rajeshwar sir.
Rajeshwar sir.
"I've a meeting with the minister."
He said he has to go... and sent us here instead.
So that he's safe.
He's a bloody fraud.
Couldn't he check the list properly earlier?
Messed everything up by calling us in the middle of the job.
Let's get that girl before she talks to anyone.
You're saying... you saw one of the police officers before?
Yes, Father.
He was there during the strike.
Hello, Andrew, how are you?
James, I want to meet right now.
Where are you?
I am in Pune... for a court hearing.
What is it?
There's a problem in college.
I see... what's wrong?
Not on the phone, let's talk face-to-face.
Just get here as soon as you can tomorrow morning.
Okay.
Fine, let's meet in the morning.
Okay, bye.
Thanks.
May I go, Father?
I am not staying at the hostel tonight.
I'll be here tomorrow morning.
Well, if there's a problem, you can stay here.
There's no problem, Father.
I am going to my brother's home.
I'll be here by tomorrow by 7 am.
Okay.
I'll drop you at the station.
It's close by, Father.
I'll manage on my own.
Yes.
Papa, that's my sister, Akira.
Come in, Akira.
That's not the sari.
Then where is it?
There's one less.
- Mom's inside.
- Count again.
But you guys must book a Cool Cab first..
So that you all get there on time.
How's the place?
Well, it's a great place.
You?
So suddenly?
What happened?
Who are all these people?
They are Shilpa's relatives.
Her cousin's getting married.
They've come from Pune.
Something to eat?
What happened?
Did you get into a fight?
No, the door slammed on my face.
How can the door..
Wait, I'll put something on it.
Mom!
I said it's nothing, let it be.
Akira, did you pay your hostel mess' fee?
Pay it tomorrow.
I want to talk to you.
Say it.
Ajay.
- Ajay.
- What happened?
Check this bill.
Something's wrong.
What happened?
We selected 12 saris, didn't we?
Yeah.
They billed us for 13 saris.
How's that possible?
Well...
I chose 5 silk saris, but I don't know about the rest.
- But I..
- You settled the bill.
Yes.
You must have counted the saris.
Maybe I checked..
Did you count them or not?
No, I forgot.
You didn't count the saris, Ajay.
But..
- How can you do such a thing?
You check it.
There's no problem.
I kept telling you.
Let me show you.
These are the ones that I counted.
These are Ritu's saris.
And I already gave aunty her saris.
Right?
There are two 'Chanderis' here..
And those five silk saris which I packed myself.
- Okay.
What's the total?
12, Ajay... only 12-
How can you pay for 13?
Have you seen this girl?
She just left.. that way.
"Eyes have not been get wet for a long time."
"There is life from this pretext."
"Eyes have not been get wet for a long time."
"There is life from this pretext."
"Slowly slowly rain comes and fills."
- Siddharth, it's Akira.
- Hi.
Can we meet now?
No, I just finished work.
I am on my way back from Pune.
- Was it something urgent?
- No.
- Say it.
- No, it's okay.
Hello.
"I am desert, you fill me with water."
"There eyes clouds.."
"There eyes clouds.."
Give the fried rice to the kids standing there.
Okay.
Thank you.
Bring that plate.
Okay.
- I don't believe it, man.
Clean that table.
He's always staring at me.
Seriously, he's crazy.
Did you keep that bag in front of my room at the hostel?
Hello... what bag?
I am talking to you, Niki.
Listen, I've been keeping my distance.
I don't know about any bag.
Then who kept that bag?
She said she doesn't know anything.
Don't touch me.
I am warning you, Niki...
don't mess with me.
Do you know the trouble you've caused me?
Wretch... how dare you hit me?
Sir, even the other day you were mistaken..
- Shut up!
Bapurao, arrest everyone and lock them up!
Come on.
- Sorry, sir.
- Come on.
What are you looking at?
- Come on... get in.
- Sir...
Come on... get in.
Sujata, stop staring..
And lock the girls up in Cell No. 2.
Get in.
I want to call home.
Make a call!
Get in..
Didn't I tell you, I'd catch her?
I ask you to get one girl;
But you get the whole college!
Botched up the game!
Sir, I thought..
Don't think.
Please.
Now I'll do whatever needs to be done.
- Bapurao.
- Sir.
Come on... come out..
Come on.
Come on.
Not you.
You stay there.
Listen, everyone.
No one talks about her outside.
Or I'll lock you all up again.
We can't kill her now.
Her college friends have seen her here.
And there's no telling what she's said to whom.
So what now, sir?
I'll tell you.
Hi...
How's your mom?
All well.
Good morning, Father.
Swipe for both the cars.
Okay, sir.
Ajay, sorry to disturb you.
Has Akira left for college?
Yes, Father, she left for the hostel last night.
Why?
What's wrong?
Her room's locked..
And she hasn't appeared for the college's internal exams either.
What?
Did she tell you anything?
No.
Last night she was trying to tell me something..
But, she..
Ask everyone she knows.
And let me know if you speak to Akira.
- Sure, Father.
- Don't forget.
Definitely, Father.
I'll call right now.
I'll just call you back.
Brother-in-law.
- Akira hasn't gone to the hostel since last night.
What?
Her principal just called.
I'll call my volunteers, ask them to find out.
We'll find her.
Let's file a missing complaint.
And we'll ask my advocate friend..
How to include that Inspector Manik, whom she mentioned.
Sir, a missing complaint's been filed.
And Manik's name has been included.
I told you we'd get in deep trouble.
I just spoke with them.
But they are saying the same thing.
"We'll let you know once we find out."
Hello.
Sir..
Speak up.
Sir, we did exactly what you told us.
After this... we won't face any more problems because of that girl.
All clear, sir.
Stop.
Okay, that's enough for today.
Give her a dose.
When she's conscious again after four hours.
We'll do it once again.
Yes, doctor.
I'll never talk to you again.
Never.
Understand?
How dare you take my doll?
Don't make a racket.
Come, Kamla.
It's your turn.
I won't take a bath.
Only mad people bathe every day.
You know, I have a shampoo as well.
- What color?
- Yellow.
I don't like yellow.
L...
like this green.
I've green too.
- So... shall we go?
- Come on.
Let's go.
Are you a doctor?
No, we're not doctors.
Then, are you like us?
Yes, of course.
Then why don't you wear clothes like us?
We wear such clothes.
We like green.
Crazy girl.
That's 'red', not 'green'.
Bedsheets... blanket... green shampoo.
- Okay.
And I was just..
What happened?
Kirti?
What happened?
Akira?
Akira!
- Akira!
- Akira!
Hello.
But, Rane sir..
Don't worry, Doctor.
Rajeshwar will be there soon.
Remember, no one should get suspicious until then.
Okay.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, this is Amitabh Bachchan speaking.
- Listen.
Okay.
This is Rani speaking.
Can you ask the ten-million rupee question first?
Come here.
Come here.
Don't get me wrong, I was just kidding.
What is this place?
This is a big..
What's the time?
Who is the in-charge here?
Get lost.
Come on..
Get back to general ward.
Madam, what is this place?
Get back.
Who are you?
Sit.
- What are you doing?
- Sit down.
Hold her.
What is this?
Come on.
Get up.
Look this way.
- Akira.
- Akira.
Get up.
Look this way.
Did this girl take drugs?
Drugs?
.
Yes?
Not at all.
No, sir.
And what kind of a question is that?
Hold on, Sid.
Let me talk.
May I know what Akira's done?
What did she do?
She did this.
She hurled a stone at me.
At a police officer.
It missed my eye just because I ducked.
What day was it?
And where?
Last Tuesday at around 11 pm, I was on patrol duty.
I noticed her from afar.
As soon as she saw me, she started behaving strangely.
She came up to me and asked "Are you Manik?"
Why are you roaming here in disguise?
I thought to myself that something is wrong.
I got down from my bike, and was parking it..
When she hurled a stone at me.
Thankfully I ducked, but it hit my head and I fell down.
I arrested her immediately..
And brought her to the police station to file an FIR.
But even at the police station..
She kept saying to the entire staff..
"Four police officers were trying to kill me."
"They killed two boys but I escaped."
I knew it's a charade.
Or she's mentally ill.
Ma'am, did she ever hit her head when she was a kid?
Any such incident...
which could explain this behavior?
It happened long ago.
She threw acid on a boy's face.
She was sent to a children's remand home.
She even stayed there.
That's it.
Didn't I say something's wrong?
Something's definitely wrong.
That's why I immediately brought her to the doctor..
I mean psychiatrist, for treatment.
And the tests were positive.
What's the actual problem?
She's affected by recurrent persistent delusion.
Type 2.
In simpler words, such patients..
Always gets confused between reality and fantasy.
They believe one of their fantasies to be true, and starts reacting.
Akira believes that the police are following her..
And they'll kill her in an encounter.
Due to this imagination, she's behaving strangely amongst people.
No... no need to worry.
She'll be fine soon.
It's okay, mom... it's okay.
They're saying she'll be okay.
It's okay, mom.
Now eat.
You must finish all of it.
Come on, eat.
You'll get more, now eat.
Your sit here.
Sit here.
First finish this.
Come on, eat.
You'll get water, wait.
Eat from your plate.
Hey a Go!
WW.
Akira.
Are you okay?
"Someone cast an evil eye on me, my."
Hello.
Did you eat breakfast?
What's the time?
How long have you been in this hospital?
Almost two years..
I keep coming and going.
It's been going on like that.
Is it difficult to get out of here?
Well... it's very difficult to leave with permission.
But without permission...
it's less difficult.
Can you do something for me?
Hello, Father.
I am SP Rabiya.
Mumbai Crime Branch.
Please sit.
Well... there's a coffee shop, close to your college.
Around 500 meters away.
I am sure you know.
Yes, I know.
On the 25th of last month..
12 students from your college celebrated a birthday there.
And one of them stole a handycam..
From a customer's bag.
Go back..
Later I saw the coffee shop's CCTV footage.
Stop.
Stop, stop, stop.
Out of those 12 students..
That one girl could be seen stealing the camera.
But we couldn't see her face, she was wearing a cap.
So I started looking for all the students..
Whose faces could be seen in the video.
She's a 2nd year, Commerce Student.
And that's Bharat, 3rd year Mathematics student.
And he's a...2nd year Mathematics student as well.
And who's this?
This girl?
She's Ana.
The Principal's daughter.
Aha?
I want to see the handycam which your daughter stole.
Hi.
Did you go to the coffee shop with your friends?
When?
Which coffee shop?
You've been caught red-handed.
You've been caught stealing.
Sir!
You've been caught stealing on camera.
Sir... please..
You've ruined my name and respect.
How will I face the students?
Go get the handycam you stole from the coffee shop.
I want to see it.
I am ruined..
In a way, I'm the one who encouraged this thief.
In every meeting in the hostel..
I would tell the students, that..
"Whoever is committing these thefts in the hostel should mend their ways."
"And keep everything that's stolen in a bag.."
"..and leave it anywhere in the hostel."
"We won't take any action against this person."
'I didn't know that the thief's living in our own home.'
"Go, die somewhere."
'The college was shut down for holidays... '...when I discovered...' '...that my own daughter was the thief'
'All the students had gone home.
Only Akira was staying in the hostel.'
'That's why I left that bag outside her room.'
'So that when Akira finds the bag outside her room..'
'..she'd bring it to me immediately.'
Then I would've told everyone that the thief has returned everyone's stuff.
And I would've distributed everything back through the warden.
And this problem could've been solved.
But Akira didn't show up that night.
Next day when I went to the hostel, the room was locked.
That same night, Akira came home..
And said that there was a bag lying outside her room.
As she opened to take a look, two policemen arrived.
They took the handycam and mobile from the bag, and kidnapped her as well.
And they took two boys along, whom they killed.
Only Akira survived.
After Akira left, I asked her again..
And she admitted to stealing the handycam from the coffee shop.
And also told me about the foolishness she did by keeping it.
I study hard as well...
but it's never enough for dad.
He never missed a single opportunity to insult me.
He even hit me in front of my friends.
Finally I got fed up, and did all this to hurt him.
And unknowingly, it became a habit.
Sorry.
You said sorry so easily.
Do you how many lives your childishness has ruined?
He plays well.
He'll whack any ball.
Want to bet?
We're definitely losing.
Look, he hit the shot.
Didn't I tell you?
Hey.
Stop!
What are you doing?
Stop.
Why you...
Stop.
A '.
Stop.
Ajay...
Ajay, what is all this?
Your sister's standing outside our door in such a strange condition.
Akira!
Akira!
What are you doing here?
Ajay, I want to talk to you alone.
Akira... what are you doing here?
You're under treatment, aren't you?
How can you...
Nothing's wrong with me, mom.
We know nothing's wrong with you.
But you must finish your treatment.
There's nothing wrong with me, so why should I get treatment?
Ajay, please listen to me.
Fine, tell me.
Last Tuesday I came here.
Not Tuesday, you came on Wednesday.
Yes..
One day before the wedding.
I did come on Wednesday too.
But I came one day before that too.
You and mom were not at home.
You can ask Shilpa.
That day, when you were upset with me.
Tell them.
But, Akira, why would Shilpa be upset with you?
Ask her later, but when I went back ..
There was a bag lying outside my room.
As soon as I opened it, two policemen barged in!
Yes, we know.
Father told us.
Because I told Father.
That day, after I escaped from that encounter spot..
I met Father first.
And then I came here.
Akira, none of this happened.
It's just your delusion.
Why will the police try to kill you, Akira?
I mean... there's no reason.
The inspector whom you assaulted, took you to the psychiatrist.
That doctor checked you..
That bloody doctor... is a liar.
They want to help you, dear.
Help me?
Unbelievable, mom.
They want to drive me crazy.
Just tell me how you got here.
Catch her!
From the hospital.
She beat us up and escaped!
Catch her.
- Hold on.
- No.
- Akira, no.
- Akira.
They give me electric shocks..
No.
Akira.
Leave me.
Careful.
Ajay..
Ajay, no!
Mom..
Akira, just listen to them.
Don't let them take me!
Calm down, dear.
Save me, mom.
- All will be well.
- No!
Be brave.
They... give me shocks...
Electric shocks...
She's calmed down.
Get the wheelchair.
Stop.
Excuse me.
I am SP Rabia.
I want to see a patient called Akira.
Where's her ward?
Thanks for saving me.
Who says thanks for something like that?
My own family doesn't trust me.
I'm sure everyone in college thinks I'm crazy too.
Giving you shocks...
and those injections..
It's the doctor's doing.
If we catch him, everything'll be fine.
Wear this.
Wait here.
Yes, I'll be right here.
Akira... madam.
How could you do something so cheap?
Tell me.
Forgive me, please.
Sorry?
' Sorry?
Sorry?
"So"?
You're going to say sorry?
Will your apology make everything alright?
My own family thinks I'm crazy.
No, no... no... forgive me.
Tell me... tell me the truth?
How much did they pay you?
Madam... they forced me to do this.
That's why I had to do all this.
If you are right, why will they force you?
Few days ago...
a patient died accidentally..
While I was giving him shock treatment.
These cops helped me in closing that matter smoothly.
That's all... nothing more.
Come on.
Get up.
Wear your shirt and come with me.
Where, madam?
To tell my family, the principal and the entire college that you lied.
Help me!
Someone help me!
Help me!
Please help me.
What did he say?
He said he's at the club.
Club.
Come on.
Someone's coming.
Rani, come here.
Is this the ladies toilet?
Yes.
Sorry."!
-
What is this man..
He came in the wrong toilet, so we beat him up.
Sorry, I had a little too much.
I'll leave.
- Rani.
- Yes.
Lift him up.
Hello.
Brother, it's me again.
Do you have any news yet?
No.
It's been three days.
I've been waiting for him.
Not yet.
Again, the same story!
Listen..
- A policeman's missing, and the police has no clue.
How is this possible?
Have faith in me.
I can trust you, right?
- Absolutely.
- Really?
Yes.
Sir...
Rajeshwar sir's wife.
She keeps calling us over and over again.
She's in the village;
Very frightened.
She wants to come here..
And file a 'Missing' complaint.
I managed her for now, but..
This money mess..
I've fixed...
my daughter's marriage.
If Rajeshwar sir spills the beans..
Then I will be ruined, sir.
Bapurao!
Get up!
Get up.
So what if he's scared?
Will he open his mouth?
You're making a mistake.
What?
I am making a mistake?
You guys turn my life into a joke..
And you say I'm making a mistake?
Should I blow your brains out?
Just because they sent me to a remand home as a kid..
Everyone looked down on me.
And now... this taint of being crazy.
Just being treated at the mental hospital means your life is over.
Why did you people do this to me?
Why did you people falsely accuse me?
Tell me.
Madam, these numbers match.
Good, file this separately.
Okay.
Take a picture of all this.
Okay, ma'am.
Look, ma'am.
Yes, this one too.
Get me the details of the driver of the crashed car.
Most importantly, the person who claimed the insurance.
Okay.
Since we received a complaint of Rajeshwar's disappearance..
These three have been missing too.
No one at the police station knows anything either.
And their cellphones are off too.
We must arrest them and keep them inside.
Yeah... the TV and Press will humiliate us for a few days.
But we'll handle that.
Hello.
- Hello, Siddharth.
Akira speaking.
Where are you calling from?
Listen to me carefully.
Go on.
The college's annual day function is tomorrow at 9:30 am.
The entire campus will gather at the auditorium.
Bring Ajay and mother along, I'll meet you there.
Inspector Rajeshwar is with me.
And he's ready to tell everyone how these policemen wanted to kill me.
Okay.
- Who's call is it, Sid?
- Akira.
Akira...
Akira, where are you?
We're so worried..
Ajay, I've told Siddharth everything.
Yeah, but..
Bring mother along.
Don't make any excuses.
Fine, but listen to me..
Akira... hello.
Hello.
What did she say?
She..
Yes, ma'am.
I am SP Rabiya, Crime Branch.
"Inspector Rajeshwar is with me."
"He's ready to talk about how these cops wanted to kill me."
"When they didn't succeed.."
"..they proved that I am delusional with Dr. Santosh Tiwari's help.."
"..and locked me up at the Thane mental asylum."
"Rajeshwar has agreed to say this.."
"..in front of the media, the court and the entire college."
Agreed?
How can he agree?
I was telling you, sir.
He must be scared, right?
Sir, we've traced the location of Rajeshwar sir's mobile.
The signal was coming from the tower..
Close to Holy Cross College.
Sir... a lot of students live around the college as paying guests.
If she's hiding in one of those buildings..
It'll take days to find her.
What time is the college function tomorrow?
- 10 am.
Is that person over there your principal?
Yes.
Who's with him?
Actually... he's the vice-principal.
Sir.
Sir, I just saw that mad person..
Head towards the building near the ground.
No one's allowed to go there.
The structure's too weak..
Did you check behind the building?
No, sir.
The principal's arrived.
He's sitting on the front seat.
You must tell everyone...
exactly what you told me.
Get it?
If you try to act smart, I'll shoot you.
Rani!
Sir!
She's run out of bullets, sir!
- Quiet.
- Sir!
Come on.
Get up.
- Stop!
- Manik.
Get on your knees!
Get on your knees!
Hands at the back!
Hands at the back!
Bapurao.
Stay still or else I'll shoot.
Wretch.
Leave it.
Leave her.
You should've done something when she kidnapped you.
What's the point of showing your machismo now?
Sir, do you know what happened that day?
Don't talk nonsense.
Nonsense?
I am talking nonsense?
A college student and a mad person abduct you..
Thrash you... and mess you up.
There's nothing you could do and you're showing your anger now.
I see.
- Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.
Here.
- Manik.
- Sir.
Your FIR report..
Two mad people stole tools from the mortuary.
And... they abducted Rajeshwar and brought him here.
By the time we got here to save Rajeshwar..
They'd already severed his hand.
Bapurao.
And we had no other choice.
So, in order to save Rajeshwar, we had to kill these two.
Now shoot her in the forehead.
Manik... you'll do no such thing.
You cleverly slip out of every situation.
You have a gun, don't you?
You shoot her!
Shoot her!
Get your hands and limbs severed.
Why do you always ride the gun on our shoulders?
Don't be crazy..
- You've been doing crazy things from the beginning..
And you're calling me crazy?
Don't you know how to talk to your senior?
- Hey!
You're my senior only when we're in the department.
Out here, I am senior to you in age, and you're my junior.
Bloody fool, talking nonsense.
Hey..
- Leave me!
- Be quiet...
He'll create problems with the girls..
And ask us to deal with it.
And sit at home by himself...
"I am in Nasik."
"..in a meeting with the minister."
He talks too much.
- Manik.
- Sir.
Your new FIR report.
These two kidnapped Rajeshwar and brought him here.
We followed them here.
We killed that mad person and saved Rajeshwar.
Arrested this girl.
We were taking the girl..
When she snatched my gun and shot Rajeshwar.
Next... she tried to kill me.
That's when you..
Go back 10 feet from your position.
And shoot her.
Shoot her, Manik.
Back.
Shoot.
Manik.
Hands HP!
Manik, throw down your gun.
Here she comes again.
Or else we'll have to shoot.
Rabiya, do you even know what happened here?
Don't act without knowing the facts.
I know everything, sir.
Right from the accident on Mumbai-Pune Highway..
To sending this girl to the mental asylum, everything.
I know everything.
You can't kill her and hide the truth anymore.
And even the commissioner knows about it.
We've orders to arrest you, sir.
Please throw your guns down.
Manik.
Throw your gun down.
Sir, please.
- Amar.
- Ma'am.
Get their guns.
They killed my friend.
Her body is lying somewhere at the back.
Rafiq, go check.
Yes, ma'am.
Do you know everything?
Yes, I do.
Ma)!
I go now?
It's the commissioner?
- Hello, sir.
- Where are you?
Behind Holy Cross College, in the old church.
What happened?
We've arrested them, sir.
Don't arrest them, Rabiya.
There's a problem.
Why, sir?
The guy they murdered on the highway..
Was the brother of North Indian Party's top leader, Bablu Tiwari.
Remember... he was involved in provoking riots in the city before.
This year his party is claiming to host..
The biggest 'Chhat Puja' event in Mumbai.
Due to which there is already growing tension amongst the local parties.
That money was being brought in for that event.
If the news leaks out, that his brother didn't die in an accident..
But in fact, a few Mumbai police officers murdered him for the money..
Then Bablu Tiwari will provoke riots again.
And so I spoke with the Secretariat"
and the higher authorities and made this decision.
So end the case right here and close the file.
So please follow my orders.
Don't arrest them.
But sir, two murders have been committed here.
Inspector Rajeshwar and a mad person's been shot.
Look, Rabiya, they are going to prepare a fake report anyway.
I promise a full inquiry against Rane and his entire team.
They will definitely get a life sentence.
And that girl Akira..
- You're thinking about saving one girl..
And I am thinking about thousands of innocent people.
Please understand.
This has now become a national issue.
And so... we must keep this under wraps..
Until the 'Chhat Puja' isn't over next month.
But, sir, the media's already standing outside.
I cannot lie to them.
Rabiya, give the phone to ACP Rane.
Yes, sir.
Commissioner sir.
Hello, sir.
ACP Rane, so you're above the law now?
You'll do as you want.
No, sir, actually..
Do you have any idea..
That your action has stirred up a law and order situation.
Now listen carefully.
Yes, sir.
Sure.
You've to pretend before the media..
That Akira is an escaped mental patient.
And don't mess it up.
Okay, sir.
We'll handle it.
Understand.
Yes, sir.
Sure, sir.
Rabiya madam, you can take your team and go back.
- Manik.
- Sir.
Call the hospital, and call an ambulance to take her back.
Sir.
- Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.
Make that girl sit in a corner.
Yes, sir.
What happened, madam?
I can come with you, right?
We cannot handle this case anymore, Akira.
They've been asked to take charge of this case now.
Them?
But they are responsible for all this.
How can they handle it?
Bapurao, don't just sit there and stare.
Make her sit in a corner until the ambulance doesn't arrive.
Sir.
Why should I go back to the hospital?
Sorry, Akira, but I can't help you right now.
But... what's the problem?
If your case gets registered, it will turn into a communal issue.
And the riots can..
Lead to the loss of many innocent lives.
Only you can save this city from burning up again.
And so they are going to keep you in the hospital for a while..
And then let you go.
I am sorry, but...
there's no other choice, Akira.
How can you say that?
They tried to kill a girl.
Together they tried to prove that I'm crazy.
Arrest them!
Will you send me back to the asylum too in order to cover up the truth?
I am sorry, the department will definitely give you compensation..
And I will try..
Bapu Rao.
Compensation?
What do you mean by compensation?
Come on.
You mean first you gouge both my eyes out..
And then give me an expensive walking-stick.
Please cooperate with them.
Believe me, it can..
What's more that can happen?
You should've killed me instead.
'That day my hands were tied, but not Akira's.'
Madam!
Madam!
- Ma'am, their guns?
- Keep it.
Sir.
- Let go.
- Let go.
Let go.
Let go.
Let go.
Let go.
Madam..
Please, madam.
'If your case gets registered, it'll turn into a communal issue.'
'And the riots can..'
'..
lead to the loss of many innocent lives.'
'Only you can save this city from burning up again.'
Akira.
What... what's she saying?
She's saying that she nailed herself to the cross.
'Since the report that deemed Akira mentally ill, was fake..'
I made sure that no case was registered against her, '
'A few days later, she was fully exonerated and she went home...' '...where she began to follow the path her father had shown her.'
'I want every daughter of this country, including mine... to become like Akira.'
'Someone who learns to live on the basis of her own strength.'
Very good.

Take that, die!
Let's go...

Drive faster!
- Sister.
Faster, faster!
Didn't anyone see him?
I saw him.
No.
No.
It was him!
You...

Take that.

Look here.
Your sister-in-law.

Sweetheart, look this way.
Make me your sweetheart.
Amazing.

You see, madam.
Hello...hello.

You..
Wait.
Someone help her.

Someone help her.

'In light of all the evidence..'
'..the court decides to send Akira to the Child Correction facility..'
'..until we reach a verdict.'
'And this way...it took three years to prove Akira's innocence.'
Akira.
- Yes.
Listen.
- I am listening.
Go ahead.
Your brother's arriving from Mumbai today.
He called yesterday.
Why?
He's calling me to Mumbai.
I mean you and me.
To stay with him.
Mumbai?
- Yeah.
I am not going anywhere.
Look, Akira, stop arguing.
He's coming after a very long time.
Come home soon from college.
When he went against your wishes..
...and married that Mumbai-girl, you swore never to see his face again.
He's worried about his child, that's why he's calling us.
He's calling you to wash his kid's soiled pants.
He never called all these years.
And now when they can't handle the child, he calls everyday.
I am not leaving Jodhpur and going anywhere.
Akira.
We're here.
- Yes.
Thank you, AM.
- Yeah.
I'll see you in the evening.
- Definitely.
Thank you.
Grandma, how are you?
I am fine.
Ajay, you returned home after so long.
What to do, grandma?
I was busy with work.
See you later.
- Okay.
Mom.
Excuse me, madam.
- Yes.
The principal wants to meet Akira.
I'll try talking to her.
Come in.
Sit down.
- No, I am fine.
We were just talking about you.
It's a good thing that"
...your brother wants to take both of you to Mumbai.
To look after you two.
Why are you saying no?
Well...the new semester's just started.
And I've already wasted so many years.
Uncle...
I can easily get her admission in Mumbai.
I know the principal at Holy Cross Arts and Science College..
...really well.
I'm like a father to you.
There's no scope for further education in this small city.
If you go to Mumbai..
...it'll really help your higher studies.
The door's open.
Come in.
Hey"
Mom...
Akira, this is Shilpa.
Come in.
Bless you...it's alright.
Oh, sorry..
- It's okay.
Bless you.
Come, I'll show you.
Give it.
Come.
Sorry, wrong house.
You...wrong house.
Sid.
- Hi, sis.
Come.
That's my brother.
May I come in?
- Yeah.
He lives here with us.
- I see.
Sid.
Hello, aunt.
- Hello, son.
He's planning to go abroad..
...to do his Doctorate in Finance.
Doctor!
Yes.
It's really hard work, isn't it?
Doctors are highly respected.
This is great.
Now we've a doctor at home.
Son, I've got severe pain in my knee for three months.
Take a look.
- Sorry, aunt...
I'm not the kind of doctor you think.
I am doing Finance..
I mean...
I am doing a doctorate in money-management.
PhD!
It's like a degree.
Well, that's good.
Doctors don't get much respect.
You can find a bunch of them at every nook and corner.
Yes, aunt...that's why..
Actually, he also works in a Social Welfare Organization"
...along with a few of his friends.
'Raindrops.'
- I see.
He does social work.
Forget that, let's play squash today.
I don't mind, but you will lose again.
I'll let you win.
Listen..
- Stop talking.
Sid, eat.
Akira, the principal's called us at 11 am.
And it'll take around two hours to get there.
We'll get you a local-train pass.
So that you can easily commute to and fro.
I'll stay at the hostel.
Why will you stay in the hostel?
Yeah, Akira?
Why the hostel?
The hostel rent, canteen expenses...
It's unnecessary"
pqay".
Why are you forcing her?
If she wants to stay in the hostel, then let her.
We shouldn't have a problem.
She will visit us often...during her holidays.
Akira, Ajay's told me everything.
Don't worry, you won't be wasting this year.
You...just concentrate on your studies.
Thank you.
About the hostel?
Father, I talked to you over the phone about that hostel room.
Yeah..
Yes, Father.
Sister d'Mello, is there any room available in the hostel?
No, Father.
We had four students from Nasik as well, asking for rooms.
But we couldn't help them either.
What can we do?
But we do have Room No.
17, which we never consider.
Yes...but..
- What's the problem in Room No. 17?
Last year, one of the students committed suicide in that room.
Since then...no one is willing to stay there.
It's been closed since then.
- Father, I don't have a problem.
I can live there.
Akira, someone committed suicide..
- It's okay.
Excuse me.
Dad, weren't you looking for this?
- Where was it?
You forgot it in the kitchen while talking to mom.
I'll get some privacy...
I'll live there.
But, Akira, someone committed suicide..
Don't discourage her if she wants to live there.
No, Father, I was just..
- Leave that.
Ajay, remember we discussed about a donation for the old church.
Yes.
- Here it is.
Yes.
The college campus is 55 acres wide.
Father's home is in the campus as well.
There's an old church as well, which has been closed for a long time.
Father's been collecting donations for its renovation.
There's a school here too?
- Yes.
But only for deaf and dumb children.
But it's under the same management.
Come.
Ma'am...my Ipod's missing.
Missing?
- Yes.
Since when?
It was on my bed, I just went to the next room.
When I returned, it was missing.
Always lock your room.
I've told you so many times.
I am fed up of these thefts every week.
Here's the 'Missing' register.
Fill in the details.
We'll inform you if we find anything.
Here.
See...keep your belongings carefully, and always lock them away.
Yes.
This is the one.
I'll get the room cleaned up by evening.
Good stuff..
Must be from down South.
Sir..
- Yes.
Sir, should I drive?
- Why?
You're a bit..
Bapurao.
- Sir.
Give me the alcohol tester.
Yes.
Sir.
Check yourself, it's within the limit.
But, sir, this is something else.
If you lose control.
Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.
He's a new recruit, and wants to test my control.
No, sir.
Let's show him my control.
Let it be, sir.
Sir..
Sir, careful.
Rane, sir..
Rane sir, careful.
It's okay, sir.
What's this?
Oh, God!
Don't say anything, sir.
I am new, but why did you get scared?
This is the first time he hit the brakes on time.
Get in.
All his creations...
are in the form of couplets.
And his main subjects are religion, ethics and preaching.
Niki.
- Sir, it's a strike.
Sit down everyone!
Strike?
What for?
Sir, the canteen food is horrible.
Even the rats are falling sick, sir.
So everyone suggested that if we complain together.
...then maybe the contractor will change.
Do you have to do all this during class?
Can't you do it during lunch-break?
Do you want to join them?
- Yes, sir, we'll go too.
Let's go.
Strike for this, strike for that...
everyone wants to be the next CM.
So, I was saying..
From literature's point of view..
- Are you special?
Don't disturb those who don't want to join you.
You can all go.
She's crazy.
- Niki, we'll deal with her later.
So where were we?
What's going on there?
Sorry.
Madam, she still doesn't like the canteen food.
Manik.
- Sir.
Should I drive?
- No, sir.
I'll drive.
Where's my lighter?
Is it under your seat?
Watch out!
Hey"
What are you doing?
Such disregard for traffic rules.
Hey"
First you rammed a police-car.
And now you're creating a scene.
What do you mean by police-car?
Aren't there any traffic rules for you?
And you weren't even wearing a seatbelt.
Hey"-
Uncle, you would've been squashed like a bug.
Say thank you and leave.
Enough of this nonsense.
Hello, sir.
I'm not talking nonsense.
He's showing me the finger.
Do you want me to explain politely?
Sir...he's a college professor, show some manners.
Oh, Professor.
What are you doing?
Sir, are you okay?
Sir, careful.
Come back, sir.
And they call themselves police officers.
They have their own rules.
- Are you hurt?
Sir...
I am telling you, it must be a mistake.
I am sure he didn't know that he was a professor.
Take my complaint right now and lodge an FIR.
Sir, it's a small matter.
Don't blow it out of proportion.
I am telling you, there's nothing I can do about it.
Come, sir.
We'll show them.
Let's go.
Everyone sign this, we'll take this to the commissioner.
The police assaulted our professor without a reason.
Everyone sign this.
The police think they can do anything.
And they refused to file a complaint.
We'll show them the power of students.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
The police must apologize!
The police must apologize!
Control Room!
Control Room!
A huge crowd has gathered here.
Please send forces immediately.
The police must apologize!
The police must apologize!
The police must apologize!
We want...
- Justice.
Step back.
Step back.
You cannot block the roads.
Please disperse.
- We won't tolerate it.
Get up...don't sit here!
- We won't tolerate it.
Clear the roads.
Get out of here.
The police must apologize!
Sir...
- Manik, are you a kid?
Don't talk to them, just kick them out before the Commissioner arrives.
Okay, sir.
Yes, charge at them.
- Sir.
Charge...phone..
Don't know.
Get them out of here.
Come on.
Come on.
Get up...get out of here.
Leave us.
The police must apologize!
Get rid of them.
Get them out.
Come on.
Sir, one of your officers assaulted our professor.
Sir, they were hurling stones at us...
uprooting rods.
Shinde was bleeding.
- And you panicked.
No, sir, that's not it.
You wouldn't have fired, if you hadn't panicked.
All you had to do was break a few bones.
It was a small matter.
Sir..
Where's the bottle of water?
Sir, Bapurao took it to the bathroom
Rajeshwar.
- Yes, sir.
I had mixed vodka in that bottle which he took.
His backside will start dancing.
Call him.
Yes..
- See if he's done or not.
Bapurao!
- Coming.
Let's go.
Bloody thing...it burns.
Manik, you know what to say in the inquiry.
- Yes, sir.
Hey"
Bloody hell, he'll definitely die.
Oh no...
He rammed the car, sir.
Hello..
Looks like he'd decided to die today.
He didn't wear seatbelts either.
The tire burst, sir.
The airbags didn't open either.
The speed at which he came in, I am sure he's dead.
Sir...
let's put him in our jeep and take him to the hospital.
Waste of time, Rajeshwar!
No point.
What happened?
Is he dead?
Seems like it.
No movement in the body.
Doesn't this area fall under Inspector Khamkar?
That baldy..
- Yeah..
PanvehPanchayat area.
Sir.
Look what's here.
Is it full of money?
Check it.
Yes.
Looks like about 70-80 cr.
- Easily.
What do you think we should do?
Your call, sir.
All clear, sir!
- Such a lonely place and so much money!
Did you find Khamkar's number?
I say let's handle this by ourselves.
What say?
It's a gift - we can all settle down comfortably.
But, sir..
The Goddess of Wealth is knocking at your door..
...but you'd rather stand in the queue!
Don't worry, I'll arrange everything.
Manik, come.
- Sir.
Bapurao.
Yeah..
Rajeshwar.
- Yes, sir.
Keep it down.
Bapurao.
Hey, stop!
Leave the bag!
Everything's already messed up.
What...
'News about the increasing number of thefts in the city over the month.'
'And the recent news of robbery at Ghanshyam Das Jewellers in Kandivali.'
What's wrong?
Not in the mood?
Going home?
I am talking to you.
ACP sir, why are you wearing your clothes?
Take them off and come here.
I've something more important to do.
Will you please finish your drink in the hall?
I've to make a call.
It's an official call.
There is tension at many places in Maharashtra.
After the attack on North Indian auto drivers in Pune..
...many people have left the city.
'We received news of five road-accidents in and around Mumbai.
The total number of casualties is four.
Hello.
- Sir.
Manik, did you watch the news?
- Yes, sir, I did.
Our matter simply disappeared into thin air along with the other news.
The rest is a piece of cake...
easy-peasy.
Listen, we made one mistake.
When I hit him with the jack, I should've hit him on the face instead.
It would've looked like an accident.
But I hit him on the back instead.
Now...keep a close watch on the post-mortem and don't slip up.
Listen, carefully explain to Bapurao and Rajeshwar what to do with the rest of the money.
Yes, sir.
And from now on, call me on my new number.
Write it down.
Yes, sir.
988...
"...and don't slip up."
"Listen, carefully explain to Bapu Rao and Rajeshwar.."
"..what to do with the rest of the money."
"And from now on call me on my new number."
"Write it down."
"988...4205869."
"Happy Birthday to you.."
Such a big prize - and you got it so easily.
Where did you record this?
In my bedroom.
Around 11 months ago, I got caught in a hotel raid.
He took my number and address.
...but he didn't register any case.
He released me without taking any money.
But after that"
...he started coming home whenever he wanted.
At first I didn't take it too seriously.
I thought he's a police officer after all..
...someday he'll come in handy.
But then he started bugging me - romance and whatnot.
I wanted to get rid of him.
And just last week, I fixed this camera in my bedroom.
...so that he'd stop harassing me.
Call it fate, look what I got my hands on.
And immediately called you guys.
If we make a plan, we can extort all the money from him.
Maya, if this didn't involve the police..
...we could've handled anyone else easily.
And this guy's the ACP.
If he finds out, he'll charge us with a fake case..
...and kill all of us.
If we make a foolproof plan..
...then we could all go back to Gorakhpur and live happily.
I don't want to get into this police mess.
Maya, when you called I thought.
...maybe some college student or software engineer..
...has fallen head-over-heels for you.
Look, this is quite risky.
You won't be able to get out of this one.
Let's go.
- Come on.
Sun".
Listen...
take a day's time.
Think...
and let me know tomorrow.
Didn't I already tell you?
Look, do whatever you want.
But don't ever bring this matter up again.
Let's go.
- It's getting late.
Your bill, ma'am.
Thanks.
Where is it?
Excuse me.
- Yes, ma'am.
Those students who were here - do they come regularly?
I don't know, ma'am.
What happened?
There was a camera in my bag, but now it's missing.
They just passed by my table.
I didn't notice, ma'am.
Do you know them?
I think they were Holy Cross college students.
Holy Cross college students!
And now finally, a small speech by Akira.
Good evening.
Actually, Father and the lecturers asked me to give a speech suddenly..
...so I haven't prepared much.
But since its World Disabled Day..
...it reminded me of something my father said.
My father
We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
I think the Mike is not working.
- We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
What's wrong?
We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
Sir, there's a problem with the connection.
It'll take a while, sir.
I'll see what's wrong?
We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
"A disabled person isn't someone who doesn't have a limb.."
"..it's someone who doesn't use the limbs."
"Hands that don't come forth to help others are 'disabled'."
"The eyes that ignore atrocities...
are 'disabled'."
"Feet that turn away and desert their parents are 'disabled'."
Niki, we must do something about her.
Stop here.
How much?
- Let it be.
It's okay.
I can't take money from you.
I see...
then come every day at 8 am.
Madam..
It's not a government vehicle.
Here you go.
Good morning, sir.
- Rabiya madam...
Back again?
Are you looking to score a century in transfers?
The straight path is often the twisted one, sir.
Did you come with family, or..
- No, sir, I've come alone.
Alone?
Okay?
- Okay, sir.
Hello.
"Manik, did you watch the news?"
"Our matter disappeared into thin air along with other news."
"The rest is a piece of cake...
easy-peasy."
"Listen, we made one mistake."
"When I hit him with the jack,..
...I should've hit him on the face instead."
"It would've looked like an accident.
But I hit him on the back."
"Now...keep a close watch on the post-mortem and don't slip up."
"Listen, what to do with the rest of the money..."
'The number you've called is currently switched off.'
We should've been more careful, sir.
I never thought she would do such a thing with me.
Her house is locked and she's missing.
Even her phone's switched off.
She's a hooker;
won't be easy to trap her.
Will she be asking for a share in the money..
...or ask for all of it?
Wonder who else is in this with her?
Don't let the word spread.
- Yes.
Sir, the call made to you was from a prepaid number.
The SIM Card...has been issued to this college ID.
First year student, Holy Cross College.
And listen...they've asked me to pay the hostel fee next week.
Please tell brother to pay it.
Yes, I..
I've to make an urgent call.
Enough!
Break her face!
Hey"
Seen a girl in a blue shirt?
So?
Are you scared now?
Please forgive me.
I've already wasted three years of my college.
Now if I thrash you people too, I'll get in trouble again.
What?
I see...you were hiding here, so you don't thrash us.
Stop talking to her.
I don't want to fight.
Listen to me.
Please tell them, was it my fault?
You were picking on me for no reason.
We'll go, just wait a minute.
David, Pooja said you were looking for me.
Nothing important.
You always used to listen to music on your phone, with the headphones.
Where is it?
I don't see it.
My phone's been stolen.
I went to wash my face and it disappeared.
I even made an entry in the 'Missing' register.
Why?
What happened?
- Nothing.
Just asked.
I'll tell you if I find it.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Okay.
The college wants to catch him red-handed, sir.
So, the call I received was from a stolen phone.
This means...whoever stole the phone is still in the hostel.
And before the hostel guys find him, we must find him first.
You two will keep an eye on Maya's home, as well as the hostel.
- Sir.
Here's your fare.
Hello.
- Sir, it's me.
She's here.
Get inside and tie her up.
- Sir, me?
I am coming!
Where is she?
What happened?
You dare record my phone calls and threaten me?
You wanted to extort money from me?
Me?
- No.
How did you record the call?
Tell me how did you record the call?
With a handycam!
Look at me..
Where's your handycam?
- Stolen.
What?
Stolen?
Someone stole it at the coffee shop.
I didn't see his face.
But I know he's a student at Holy Cross College.
What were you doing at the coffee shop?
What were you doing at the coffee shop?
Tell me the truth, or I will break your face.
You won't get another customer or a lover.
Why did you take the camera to the coffee shop?
I went to meet a couple of friends.
Did you show them the video?
Did you show them the video?
So three more people know now.
She's spoiled it all.
Messed it up!
She's messed us up!
Maya!
Maya!
Maya!
Maya!
Maya!
What was the name of the coffee shop?
Coffee shop..
Wretch.
Did she say the name of the coffee shop?
She didn't say anything.
I'm going through a real bad phase.
Go on.
Madam.
The kohl's completely smeared.
Seems she cried a lot before committing suicide.
Right, madam.
I deduced that too.
She cried her heart out.
She...
looks tense too.
This is definitely a suicide.
Her cheeks are swollen too.
Maybe someone beat her up and made her cry.
And then hung her.
But, madam, the...
door's locked from inside.
Manik, you're so naive.
Locking the door from inside...
is an old grandfather's technique.
The computer's hard disk is missing.
Her cellphone isn't here either.
There was a charger in the bedroom, did you see it?
You mean that cellphone charger.
It's not a cellphone charger, it's a video-camera charger.
There's a charger, but no camera.
Is this Plot No. 401-C?
Who is he?
- Courier, madam.
Come here.
Sign.
Thank you, sir.
What is it, madam?
- Credit card bill.
Beauty parlour, pub, supermarket, coffee shop.
She swiped her card in these four places.
Find out where she visited regularly.
Did she go alone or with friends?
Find out more details about her.
Keep this.
- Yes, ma'am.
Actually, Manik, give that to me.
I'll keep it.
Call the forensic people, ask them when they can get here.
- Yes.
I think something's wrong.
Maybe it's a murder.
Looks like it's the handiwork of at least 3 to 4 people.
Fine, you make the call until then I'll question the neighbors.
Yes, ma'am.
Bloody Rabia...always honest - that too on a police salary.
We can't shut her up with a share either.
You will only follow this case...
and no acting smart.
Rabia should never find out"
...that we're involved in this case.
Sir.
Let's see how far she Gets, with that baby in her tummy.
Manik.
- Yes, ma'am.
We couldn't locate Maya's buddies in the coffee shop, right?
Well, I just got their address.
Note it down.
- Madam?
Note it down.
- Y-Yes, ma'am.
House No. 3, Yamuna Nagar, Malad East.
Sir..
- Where are you taking us?
Don't worry.
Please, sir, we're getting worried.
- We'll tell you everything.
Sir..
- Come on, get it.
It's nothing, it will be over in 10 minutes.
Where are you taking us, sir?
Get in, come on.
Yes, Manik.
Madam, I found two guys at the address you gave me.
They willingly got in the car without any hassle.
But as soon as the car slowed down at the bend..
...they jumped out and escaped.
We tried catching them, but..
- I see.
See you there, we'll discuss this.
- Okay, madam.
Well, for now, my life-calling is to go to classes.
Going to Churchgate;
can I drop you someplace?
Thanks.
Okay.
See you.
- Bye.
Akira.
Take a seat.
How's college?
All okay?
Good.
By the way, does anyone in college know that you've been to jail..
I mean...
that you were in the Remand Home.
No!
That's a good thing.
Who knows how they'll behave once they find out.
By the way, no one from my family knows about this.
The other day, the police came home..
...just for Sid's passport verification.
And dad was very uncomfortable.
If he finds out about all this, then..
You can keep meeting Sid, talk to him, be friends..
...but if things go beyond that, it'll be a problem for all.
No?
Don't worry, that won't happen.
You won't have any problems because of me.
Hope I didn't hurt you.
It's not that easy to hurt me.
Bapurao.
Yes, sir.
The college is closed for vacations.
- Yes.
Who's going to stay in the hostel now?
We've been standing out here like madmen.
Madam, please listen.
- Who are you guys?
How did you get in?
Isn't the watchman inside?
We came here to meet a student, but didn't realize it's the holidays.
Are you alone in the hostel?
- Yes.
I see..
- Who do you want to meet?
I..
- Riya.
What's her room number?
Isn't this the model we've been looking for?
Please keep it back, it's not mine.
How much did you pay for this camera?
- I told you this is not mine.
Please keep it back.
ACP sir's number on the dialing list.
What?
ACP who?
Is this your bag?
It was lying outside.
"Listen, I made a mistake."
"When I hit him with the jack.."
Come with us.
- Where?
Who are you?
Come on!
"Don't you get it?"
"It's an official call."
"Hello..."
Sir, she's out to get us.
During the college strike, she gave the file to the commissioner.
Did you ask her, did she make more copies of this video?
We searched her room, but found nothing.
And did she tell anyone about this?
What did she say?
The same old thing..
"This isn't my bag, I don't know where it came from".
If these three spill the beans to anyone.
...then we'll lose everything we've made so far.
We must do something quickly.
Plus I've to go to Nasik..
...for a very boring session with the Home Minister.
Could take a few days.
And it could be dangerous to keep them alive for three days.
I suggest...that you end this whole thing.
Don't wait for me to return.
Remember our usual spot?
- Go.
Sir...we haven't done anything.
Come on, get down.
- Where are you taking us?
Keep walking down.
Come on..
We haven't done anything, sir..
Sir..
Trying to be a hero?
Where..
Come on.
Sir..
Come on.
Come on.
Sit down.
Shut up!
- Sir..
Stop crying-
Here..
- Sir... no!
Sir, no.
- Kill them.
Take it.
Stop crying-
No...
- Sir..
Bloody dog, don't you get it?
Don't answer that now.
- ACP sir is calling.
No... no..
Yes, sir.
- You got the wrong girl, Manik.
She's not that girl.
But, sir..
Stealing stuff from the hostel, and making threat calls to me was done by someone else.
Don't shoot her.
- Sir..
Sir..
Sir, my battery's almost dead.
Call on Rajeshwar's cell.
- I didn't bring my mobile.
Sir..
- What does he want?
The phone's switched off.
No charge.
Leave it..
Let's finish the job first.
Shoot them.
Shoot.
Sir, maybe we got the wrong girl.
- What?
Yes.
That's why sir asked us to wait.
She's not that girl.
I haven't done anything!
Bloody lunatic, why does he keep changing the plan?
And he's saying this now.
Shoot her.
We'll deal with this later.
Shoot!
Sir, I am confused.
He said "Don't shoot", you're saying "Shoot".
Sir, what if this gets us in trouble later?
You're always so eager to answer the phone.
I answered only because ACP sir was calling.
To hell with your ACP!
He must be relaxing at home.
And out here, we're dealing with the mess.
Bloody..
What's he asking us to do?
Let's call him.
Go.
I need Bapurao with me.
Why?
Sir, to drive the van.
Go.
Come on, start the van.
- Yes.
Come on.
We've orders to let you go.
But you must keep quiet until they don't return.
Sir, it's Manik.
According to Bapurao's list, the thefts started last year in March.
And this girl joined now in July.
You fools got the wrong girl.
The details are clearly given in the list along with the dates.
You just make a copy, bring it to me..
...never read it, eat snacks off of it!
Let her go.
But, sir...we killed a guy in front of her.
How can we let her go?
Kill all of them.
- Okay, sir.
Now what?
What's going on?
Bloody..
The belt's broken.
What a piece of junk!
Sir... he says that the garage is six kilometers away.
Give me your walky.
- Yes.
Hello...hello, Rajeshwar sir.
Hello...hello, Rajeshwar sir.
Hello..
He's not in range.
He's all alone out there.
I think... if we travel two kilometers back..
...then his walky will be in range.
Yes.
Hello.
Hello...
Rajeshwar sir.
Rajeshwar sir, can you hear me?
Rajeshwar sir.
Hello.
What happened?
The van's belt got broken.
What do I do about them?
We've orders to shoot them all.
Hello...sir, did you hear?
Bloody..
Hello, sir.
Hello.
Hello...
Rajeshwar sir.
Hello...
Rajeshwar sir.
Rajeshwar sir.
"I've a meeting with the minister."
He said he has to go... and sent us here instead.
So that he's safe.
He's a bloody fraud.
Couldn't he check the list properly earlier?
Messed everything up by calling us in the middle of the job.
Let's get that girl before she talks to anyone.
You're saying...you saw one of the police officers before?
Yes, Father.
He was there during the strike.
Hello, Andrew, how are you?
- James, I want to meet right now.
Where are you?
I am in Pune...for a court hearing.
What is it?
There's a problem in college.
- I see...what's wrong?
Not on the phone, let's talk face-to-face.
Just get here as soon as you can tomorrow morning.
Okay.
Fine, let's meet in the morning.
- Okay, bye.
Thanks.
May I go, Father?
I am not staying at the hostel tonight.
I'll be here tomorrow morning.
Well, if there's a problem, you can stay here.
There's no problem, Father.
I am going to my brother's home.
I'll be here by tomorrow by 7 am.
- Okay.
I'll drop you at the station.
It's close by, Father.
I'll manage on my own.
Yes.
Papa, that's my sister, Akira.
Come in, Akira.
That's not the sari.
Then where is it?
There's one less.
Mom's inside.
- Count again.
But you guys must book a Cool Cab first"
...so that you all get there on time.
How's the place?
Well, it's a great place.
You?
So suddenly?
What happened?
Who are all these people?
They are Shilpa's relatives.
Her cousin's getting married.
They've come from Pune.
Something to eat?
What happened?
Did you get into a fight?
No, the door slammed on my face.
How can the door..
Wait, I'll put something on it.
- Mom!
I said it's nothing, let it be.
Akira, did you pay your hostel mess' fee?
Pay it tomorrow.
I want to talk to you.
- Say it.
Ajay.
Ajay.
- What happened?
Check this bill.
Something's wrong.
- What happened?
We selected 12 saris, didn't we?
- Yeah.
They billed us for 13 saris.
How's that possible?
Well...
I chose 5 silk saris, but I don't know about the rest.
But I..
- You settled the bill.
Yes.
- You must have counted the saris.
Maybe I checked..
- Did you count them or not?
No, I forgot.
- You didn't count the saris, Ajay.
But..
- How can you do such a thing?
- You check it.
There's no problem.
I kept telling you.
- Let me show you.
These are the ones that I counted.
These are Ritu's saris.
And I already gave aunty her saris.
Right?
There are two 'Chanderis' here..
...and those five silk saris which I packed myself.
- Okay.
What's the total?
12, AjaV---°"I'/ 12-
How can you pay for 13?
Have you seen this girl?
She just left.. that way.
"Eyes have not been get wet for a long time."
"There is life from this pretext."
"Eyes have not been get wet for a long time."
"There is life from this pretext."
"Slowly slowly rain comes and fills."
Siddharth, it's Akira.
- Hi.
Can we meet now?
- No, I just finished work.
I am on my way back from Pune.
Was it something urgent?
- No.
Say it.
- No, it's okay.
Hello.
"I am desert, you fill me with water."
"There eyes clouds.."
"There eyes clouds.."
Give the fried rice to the kids standing there.
Okay.
Thank you.
Bring that plate.
Okay.
- I don't believe it, man.
- Clean that table.
He's always staring at me.
Seriously, he's crazy.
Did you keep that bag in front of my room at the hostel?
Hello...what bag?
I am talking to you, Niki.
Listen, I've been keeping my distance.
I don't know about any bag.
Then who kept that bag?
She said she doesn't know anything.
Don't touch me.
I am warning you, Niki...
don't mess with me.
Do you know the trouble you've caused me?
Wretch...how dare you hit me?
Sir, even the other day you were mistaken..
- Shut up!
Bapurao, arrest everyone and lock them up!
Come on.
Sorry, sir.
- Come on.
What are you looking at?
Come on...get in.
- Sir...
Come on...get in.
Sujata, stop staring..
...and lock the girls up in Cell No. 2.
Get in.
I want to call home.
Make a call!
Get in..
Didn't I tell you, I'd catch her?
I ask you to get one girl;
but you get the whole college!
Botched up the game!
Sir, I thought.
- Don't think.
Please.
Now I'll do whatever needs to be done.
Bapurao.
- Sir.
Come on.
Come on.
Not you.
You stay there.
Listen, everyone.
No one talks about her outside.
Or I'll lock you all up again.
We can't kill her now.
Her college friends have seen her here.
And there's no telling what she's said to whom.
So what now, sir?
I'll tell you.
Hi...
How's your mom?
All well.
Good morning, Father.
Swipe for both the cars.
Okay, sir.
Ajay, sorry to disturb you.
Has Akira left for college?
Yes, Father, she left for the hostel last night.
Why?
What's wrong?
Her room's locked..
...and she hasn't appeared for the college's internal exams either.
What?
Did she tell you anything?
No.
Last night she was trying to tell me something..
...but, she..
Ask everyone she knows.
And let me know if you speak to Akira.
Sure, Father.
- Don't forget.
Definitely, Father.
I'll call right now.
I'll just call you back.
Brother-in-law.
- Akira hasn't gone to the hostel since last night.
What?
- Her principal just called.
I'll call my volunteers, ask them to find out.
We'll find her.
Let's file a missing complaint.
And we'll ask my advocate friend..
...how to include that Inspector Manik, whom she mentioned.
Sir, a missing complaint's been filed.
And Manik's name has been included.
I told you we'd get in deep trouble.
I just spoke with them.
But they are saying the same thing.
"We'll let you know once we find out."
Hello.
Sir..
Speak up.
Sir, we did exactly what you told us.
After this...we won't face any more problems because of that girl.
All clear, sir.
Stop.
Okay, that's enough for today.
Give her a dose.
When she's conscious again after four hours.
We'll do it once again.
Yes, doctor.
I'll never talk to you again.
Never.
Understand?
How dare you take my doll?
Don't make a racket.
Come, Kamla.
It's your turn.
I won't take a bath.
Only mad people bathe every day.
You know, I have a shampoo as well.
What color?
- Yellow.
I don't like yellow.
I...
like this green.
- I've green too.
So...shall we go?
- Come on.
Let's go.
Are you a doctor?
- No, we're not doctors.
Then, are you like us?
- Yes, of course.
Then why don't you wear clothes like us?
We wear such clothes.
We like green.
Crazy girl - that's 'red', not 'green'.
Bedsheets...blanket...green shampoo.
- Okay.
And I was just..
What happened?
Kirti?
What happened?
Akira?
Akira!
Akira!
- Akira!
Hello.
But, Rane sir..
- Don't worry, Doctor.
Rajeshwar will be there soon.
Remember, no one should get suspicious until then.
Okay.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, this is Amitabh Bachchan speaking.
- Listen.
Okay.
This is Rani speaking.
Can you ask the ten-million rupee question first?
Come here.
Come here.
Don't get me wrong, I was just kidding.
What is this place?
This is a big..
- What's the time?
Who is the in-charge here?
Get lost.
Come on..
Get back to general ward.
Madam, what is this place?
Get back.
Who are you?
Sit.
What are you doing?
- Sit down.
Hold her.
What is this?
Come on.
Get up.
Look this way.
Akira.
- Akira.
Get up.
Look this way.
Did this girl take drugs?
Drugs?
" Yes?
Not at all.
No, sir.
And what kind of a question is that?
Hold on, Sid.
Let me talk.
May I know what Akira's done?
What did she do?
She did this.
She hurled a stone at me.
At a police officer.
It missed my eye just because I ducked.
What day was it?
And where?
Last Tuesday at around 11 pm, I was on patrol duty.
I noticed her from afar.
As soon as she saw me, she started behaving strangely.
She came up to me and asked "Are you Manik?"
Why are you roaming here in disguise?
I thought to myself that something is wrong.
I got down from my bike, and was parking it..
"When she hurled a stone at me.
Thankfully I ducked, but it hit my head and I fell down.
I arrested her immediately..
...and brought her to the police station to file an FIR.
But even at the police station..
...she kept saying to the entire staff..
"Four police officers were trying to kill me."
"They killed two boys but I escaped."
I knew it's a charade.
Or she's mentally ill.
Ma'am, did she ever hit her head when she was a kid?
Any such incident...
which could explain this behavior?
It happened long ago.
She threw acid on a boy's face.
She was sent to a children's remand home.
She even stayed there.
- That's it.
Didn't I say something's wrong?
Something's definitely wrong.
That's why I immediately brought her to the docton.
I mean psychiatrist, for treatment.
And the tests were positive.
What's the actual problem?
She's affected by recurrent persistent delusion.
Type 2.
In simpler words, such patients.
...always gets confused between reality and fantasy.
They believe one of their fantasies to be true, and starts reacting.
Akira believes that the police are following her..
...and they'll kill her in an encounter.
Due to this imagination, she's behaving strangely amongst people.
No...no need to worry.
She'll be fine soon.
It's okay, mom...it's okay.
They're saying she'll be okay.
It's okay, mom.
Now eat.
You must finish all of it.
Come on, eat.
You'll get more, now eat.
Your sit here.
Sit here.
First finish this.
Come on, eat.
You'll get water, wait.
Eat from your plate.
Hey...go away Go!
'
Akira.
Are you okay?
"Someone cast an evil eye on me, my
Hello.
Did you eat breakfast?
What's the time?
How long have you been in this hospital?
Almost two years..
I keep coming and going.
It's been going on like that.
Is it difficult to get out of here?
Well...it's very difficult to leave with permission.
But without permission...
it's less difficult.
Can you do something for me?
Hello, Father.
I am SP Rabiya.
Mumbai Crime Branch.
Please sit.
Well...there's a coffee shop, close to your college.
Around 500 meters away.
I am sure you know.
- Yes, I know.
On the 25th of last month..
...12 students from your college celebrated a birthday there.
And one of them stole a handycam..
"From a customer's bag.
Go back..
Later I saw the coffee shop's CCTV footage.
Stop.
Stop, stop, stop.
Out of those 12 students.
...that one girl could be seen stealing the camera.
But we couldn't see her face, she was wearing a cap.
So I started looking for all the students..
...whose faces could be seen in the video.
She's a 2nd year, Commerce Student.
And that's Bharat, 3rd year Mathematics student.
And he's a...2nd year Mathematics student as well.
And who's this?
This girl?
She's Ana.
The Principal's daughter.
Ana?
I want to see the handycam which your daughter stole.
Hi.
Did you go to the coffee shop with your friends?
When?
Which coffee shop?
You've been caught red-handed.
You've been caught stealing.
- Sir!
You've been caught stealing on camera.
- Sir...please..
You've ruined my name and respect.
How will I face the students?
Go get the handycam you stole from the coffee shop.
I want to see it.
- I am ruined..
In a way, I'm the one who encouraged this thief.
In every meeting in the hostel..
...I would tell the students, that..
"Whoever is committing these thefts in the hostel should mend their ways."
"And keep everything that's stolen in a bag.."
"..and leave it anywhere in the hostel."
"We won't take any action against this person."
'I didn't know that the thief's living in our own home.'
"Go, die somewhere."
'The college was shut down for holidays... '...when I discovered...' '...that my own daughter was the thief'
'All the students had gone home.
Only Akira was staying in the hostel.'
'That's why I left that bag outside her room.'
'So that when Akira finds the bag outside her room..'
'..she'd bring it to me immediately.'
Then I would've told everyone that the thief has returned everyone's stuff.
And I would've distributed everything back through the warden.
And this problem could've been solved.
But Akira didn't show up that night.
Next day when I went to the hostel, the room was locked.
That same night, Akira came home..
...and said that there was a bag lying outside her room.
As she opened to take a look, two policemen arrived.
They took the handycam and mobile from the bag, and kidnapped her as well.
And they took two boys along, whom they killed.
Only Akira survived.
After Akira left, I asked her again..
...and she admitted to stealing the handycam from the coffee shop.
And also told me about the foolishness she did by keeping it.
I study hard as well...
but it's never enough for dad.
He never missed a single opportunity to insult me.
He even hit me in front of my friends.
Finally I got fed up, and did all this to hurt him.
And unknowingly, it became a habit.
Sorry.
You said sorry so easily.
Do you how many lives your childishness has ruined?
He plays well.
He'll whack any ball.
Want to bet?
We're definitely losing.
Look, he hit the shot.
Didn't I tell you?
HE'!
-
Stop!
What are you doing?
Stop.
Why you...
Stop.
Hey, swP-
Stop.
Ajaymfiijay, what is all this?
Your sister's standing outside our door in such a strange condition.
Akira!
Akira!
What are you doing here?
Ajay, I want to talk to you alone.
Akira...what are you doing here?
You're under treatment, aren't you?
How can you...
Nothing's wrong with me, mom.
- We know nothing's wrong with you.
But you must finish your treatment.
There's nothing wrong with me, so why should I get treatment?
Ajay, please listen to me.
- Fine, tell me.
Last Tuesday I came here.
- Not Tuesday, you came on Wednesday.
Yes..
- One day before the wedding.
I did come on Wednesday too.
But I came one day before that too.
You and mom were not at home.
You can ask Shilpa.
That day, when you were upset with me.
Tell them.
But, Akira, why would Shilpa be upset with you?
Ask her later, but when I went back ..
...there was a bag lying outside my room.
As soon as I opened it, two policemen barged in!
Yes, we know.
Father told us.
Because I told Father.
That day, after I escaped from that encounter spot..
...I met Father first.
And then I came here.
Akira, none of this happened.
It's just your delusion.
Why will the police try to kill you, Akira?
I mean...there's no reason.
The inspector whom you assaulted, took you to the psychiatrist.
That doctor checked you..
- That bloody doctor...is a liar.
They want to help you, dear.
- Help me?
Unbelievable, mom.
They want to drive me crazy.
Just tell me how you got here.
Catch her!
From the hospital.
She beat us up and escaped!
Catch her.
Hold on.
- No.
Akira, no.
- Akira.
They give me electric shocks..
- No.
Akira.
Leave me.
Careful.
AjaY-
- Ajay, no!
Mom..
- Akira, just listen to them.
Don't let them take me!
Calm down, dear.
- Save me, mom.
All will be well.
- No!
Be brave.
- They...give me shocks...
Electric shocks...
She's calmed down.
Get the wheelchair.
Stop.
Excuse me.
X am SP Rama.
I want to see a patient called Akira.
Where's her ward?
Thanks for saving me.
Who says thanks for something like that?
My own family doesn't trust me.
I'm sure everyone in college thinks I'm crazy too.
Giving you shocks...
and those injections.
...it's the doctor's doing.
If we catch him, everything" be fine.
Wear this.
Wait here.
- Yes, I'll be right here.
Akira...madam.
How could you do something so cheap?
Tell me.
Forgive me, please.
Sorry?
- Sorry?
Sorry?
Sorry
You're going to say sorry?
Will your apology make everything alright?
My own family thinks I'm crazy.
No, no...no...forgive me.
Tell me...tell me the truth?
How much did they pay you?
- Madam...they forced me to do this.
That's why I had to do all this.
If you are right, why will they force you?
Few days ago...
a patient died accidentally.
...while I was giving him shock treatment.
These cops helped me in closing that matter smoothly.
That's all...nothing more.
Come on.
Get up.
Wear your shirt and come with me.
- Where, madam?
To tell my family, the principal and the entire college that you lied.
He'll me!
Someone help me!
He'll me!
Please help me.
What did he say?
- He said he's at the club.
Club.
Come on.
Someone's coming.
Rani, come here.
Is this the ladies toilet?
- Yes.
Sorry.
What is this man..
He came in the wrong toilet, so we beat him up.
Sorry, I had a little too much.
I'll leave.
Rani.
- Yes.
Lift him up
Hello.
- Brother, it's me again.
Do you have any news yet?
No.
It's been three days.
I've been waiting for him.
Not yet.
Again, the same story!
Listen..
- A policeman's missing, and the police has no clue.
How is this possible?
Have faith in me.
- I can trust you, right?
Absolutely.
- Really?
Yes.
Sir...
Rajeshwar sir's wife.
She keeps calling us over and over again.
She's in the village; very frightened.
She wants to come here..
...and file a 'Missing' complaint.
I managed her for now, but..
This money mess..
I've fixed...
my daughter's marriage.
If Rajeshwar sir spills the beans..
...then I will be ruined, sir.
- Bapurao!
Get up!
Get up.
So what if he's scared?
Will he open his mouth?
You're making a mistake.
- What?
I am making a mistake?
You guys turn my life into a joke..
...and you say I'm making a mistake?
Should I blow your brains out?
Just because they sent me to a remand home as a kid..
...everyone looked down on me.
And now...this taint of being crazy.
Just being treated at the mental hospital means your life is over.
Why did you people do this to me?
Why did you people falsely accuse me?
Tell me.
Madam, these numbers match.
Good, file this separately.
Okay.
Take a picture of all this.
Okay, ma'am.
Look, ma'am.
Yes, this one too.
Get me the details of the driver of the crashed car.
Most importantly, the person who claimed the insurance.
Okay.
Since we received a complaint of Rajeshwar's disappearance.
...these three have been missing too.
No one at the police station knows anything either.
And their cellphones are off too.
We must arrest them and keep them inside.
Yeah...the TV and Press will humiliate us for a few days.
But we'll handle that.
Hello.
- Hello, Siddharth.
Akira speaking.
Where are you calling from?
- Listen to me carefully.
Go on.
The college's annual day function is tomorrow at 9:30 am.
The entire campus will gather at the auditorium.
Bring Ajay and mother along, I'll meet you there.
Inspector Rajeshwar is with me.
And he's ready to tell everyone how these policemen wanted to kill me.
Okay.
Who's call is it, Sid?
- Akira.
Akira...
Akira, where are you?
We're so worried..
- Ajay, I've told Siddharth everything.
Yeah, but..
- Bring mother along.
Don't make any excuses.
- Fine, but listen to me..
Akira...hello.
Hello.
What did she say?
She..
Yes, ma'am.
- I am SP Rabiya, Crime Branch.
"Inspector Rajeshwar is with me."
"He's ready to talk about how these cops wanted to kill me."
"When they didn't succeed.."
"..they proved that I am delusional with Dr. Santosh Tiwari's help.."
"..and locked me up at the Thane mental asylum."
"Rajeshwar has agreed to say this.."
"..in front of the media, the court and the entire college."
Agreed?
How can he agree?
I was telling you, sir.
He must be scared, right?
Sir, we've traced the location of Rajeshwar sir's mobile.
The signal was coming from the towen.
...close to Holy Cross College.
Sir... a lot of students live around the college as paying guests.
If she's hiding in one of those buildings..
...it'll take days to find her.
What time is the college function tomorrow?
- 10 am.
Is that person over there your principal?
Yes.
Who's with him?
Actually...he's the vice-principal.
Sir.
Sir, I just saw that mad person..
...head towards the building near the ground.
No one's allowed to go there.
The structure's too weak. .
Did you check behind the building?
- No, sir.
The principal's arrived.
He's sitting on the front seat.
You must tell everyone...
exactly what you told me.
Get it?
If you try to act smart, I'll shoot you.
Rani!
Sir!
She's run out of bullets, sir!
Quiet.
- Sir!
Come on.
Get up.
Stop!
- Manik.
Get on your knees!
Get on your knees!
Hands at the back!
Hands at the back!
Bapurao.
Stay still or else I'll shoot.
Wretch.
Leave it.
Leave her.
You should've done something when she kidnapped you.
What's the point of showing your machismo now?
Sir, do you know what happened that day?
Don't talk nonsense.
Nonsense?
I am talking nonsense?
A college student and a mad person abduct you"
...thrash you...and mess you up.
There's nothing you could do and you're showing your anger now.
I see.
Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.
Here.
Manik.
- Sir.
Your FIR report.
Two mad people stole tools from the mortuary.
And...they abducted Rajeshwar and brought him here.
By the time we got here to save Rajeshwar..
...they'd already severed his hand.
Bapurao.
And we had no other choice.
So, in order to save Rajeshwar, we had to kill these two.
Now shoot her in the forehead.
Manik...you'll do no such thing.
You cleverly slip out of every situation.
You have a gun, don't you?
You shoot her!
Shoot her!
Get your hands and limbs severed.
Why do you always ride the gun on our shoulders?
Don't be crazy..
- You've been doing crazy things from the beginning..
...and you're calling me crazy?
Don't you know how to talk to your senior?
- Hey!
You're my senior only when we're in the department.
Out here, I am senior to you in age, and you're my junior.
Bloody fool, talking nonsense.
Hey..
- Leave me!
- Be quiet...
He'll create problems with the girls..
...and ask us to deal with it.
And sit at home by himself...
"I am in Nasik."
"..in a meeting with the minister."
He talks too much.
Manik.
- Sir.
Your new FIR report.
These two kidnapped Rajeshwar and brought him here.
We followed them here.
We killed that mad person and saved Rajeshwar.
Arrested this girl.
We were taking the girl..
"When she snatched my gun and shot Rajeshwar.
Next...she tried to kill me.
That's when you"
Go back 10 feet from your position.
And shoot her.
Shoot her, Manik.
Back.
Shoot.
Manik.
Hands up!
Manik, throw down your gun.
Here she comes again.
Or else we'll have to shoot.
Rabiya, do you even know what happened here?
Don't act without knowing the facts.
I know everything, sir.
Right from the accident on Mumbai-Pune Highway..
...to sending this girl to the mental asylum, everything.
I know everything.
You can't kill her and hide the truth anymore.
And even the commissioner knows about it.
We've orders to arrest you, sir.
Please throw your guns down.
Manik.
Throw your gun down.
Sir, please.
Amar.
- Ma'am.
Get their guns.
They killed my friend.
Her body is lying somewhere at the back.
Rafiq, go check.
Yes, ma'am.
Do you know everything?
- Yes, I do.
Ma's' I go now?
It's the commissioner?
Hello, sir.
- Where are you?
Behind Holy Cross College, in the old church.
What happened?
- We've arrested them, sir.
Don't arrest them, Rabiya.
There's a problem.
Why, sir?
The guy they murdered on the highway..
...was the brother of North Indian Party's top leader, Bablu Tiwari.
Remember...he was involved in provoking riots in the city before.
This year his party is claiming to host..
...the biggest 'Chhat Puja' event in Mumbai.
Due to which there is already growing tension amongst the local parties.
That money was being brought in for that event.
If the news leaks out, that his brother didn't die in an accident..
...but in fact, a few Mumbai police officers murdered him for the money..
...then Bablu Tiwari will provoke riots again.
And so I spoke with the Secretariat..
...and the higher authorities and made this decision.
So end the case right here and close the file.
So please follow my orders.
Don't arrest them.
But sir, two murders have been committed here.
Inspector Rajeshwar and a mad person's been shot.
Look, Rabiya, they are going to prepare a fake report anyway.
I promise a full inquiry against Rane and his entire team.
They will definitely get a life sentence.
And that girl Akira..
- You're thinking about saving one girl..
...and I am thinking about thousands of innocent people.
Please understand.
This has now become a national issue.
And so...we must keep this under wraps..
...until the 'Chhat Puja' isn't over next month.
But, sir, the media's already standing outside.
I cannot lie to them.
Rabiya, give the phone to ACP Rane.
Yes, sir.
Commissioner sir.
Hello, sir.
ACP Rane, so you're above the law now?
You'll do as you want.
- No, sir, actually..
Do you have any idea..
...that your action has stirred up a law and order situation.
Now listen carefully.
- Yes, sir.
Sure.
You've to pretend before the media..
...that Akira is an escaped mental patient.
And don't mess it up.
- Okay, sir.
We'll handle it.
Understand.
Yes, sir.
Sure, sir.
Rabiya madam, you can take your team and go back.
Manik.
- Sir.
Call the hospital, and call an ambulance to take her back.
Sir.
Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.
Make that girl sit in a corner.
Yes, sir.
What happened, madam?
I can come with you, right?
We cannot handle this case anymore, Akira.
They've been asked to take charge of this case now.
Them?
But they are responsible for all this.
How can they handle it?
Bapurao, don't just sit there and stare.
Make her sit in a corner until the ambulance doesn't arrive.
Sir.
Why should I go back to the hospital?
Sorry, Akira, but I can't help you right now.
But...what's the problem?
If your case gets registered, it will turn into a communal issue.
And the riots can..
...lead to the loss of many innocent lives.
Only you can save this city from burning up again.
And so they are going to keep you in the hospital for a while..
...and then let you go.
I am sorry, but...
there's no other choice, Akira.
How can you say that?
They tried to kill a girl.
Together they tried to prove that I'm crazy.
Arrest them!
Will you send me back to the asylum too in order to cover up the truth?
I am sorry, the department will definitely give you compensation"
...and I will try..
- Bapu Rao.
- Compensation?
What do you mean by compensation?
Come on.
You mean first you gouge both my eyes out"
...and then give me an expensive walking-stick.
Please cooperate with them.
Believe me, it can..
What's more that can happen?
You should've killed me instead.
'That day my hands were tied, but not Akira's.'
Madam!
Madam!
Madam!
Madam!
Ma'am, their guns?
- Keep it.
Sir.
Let go.
- Let go.
Let go.
Let go.
Let go.
Let go.
Madam..
Please, madam.
'If your case gets registered, it'll turn into a communal issue.'
'And the riots can..'
'..
lead to the loss of many innocent lives.'
'Only you can save this city from burning up again.'
Akira.
What...what's she saying?
She's saying that she nailed herself to the cross.
'Since the report that deemed Akira mentally ill, was fake..' ...I made sure that no case was registered against her,'
'A few days later, she was fully exonerated and she went home...' '...where she began to follow the path her father had shown her.'
'I want every daughter of this country, including mine...to become like Akira.'
'Someone who learns to live on the basis of her own strength.'
Very good.

This is where these louts loiter about.
Come on.
Didn't she come today?
Exactly what I was saying?
Start the bike.
- It's okay.
How dare you reject me!
Take that, die!
Let's go...
let's go.
Drive faster!
- Sister.
Faster, faster!
Didn't anyone see him?
I saw him.
No.
No.
It was him!
You...
Get inside!
How dare you tell the police?
Take that.
Get lost!

oh my...
Greetings, my lady...!
This has become a daily routine.
Why doesn't someone take action against them?
What a gorgeous girl...
Look here.
Your sister-in-law.
- She must be your sister-in-law.
Sweetheart, look this way.
Make me your sweetheart.
Amazing.
Madam.
You see, madam.
Hello...hello.
HEY-
You..
Wait.
Someone help her.
- Anyone.
Someone help her.
Mister.
'Everyone saw what happened.'
'But the boy's father had a huge vote-bank supporting him.'
'Your Honor, this girl assaulted my client first.'
'It was an unprovoked attack.'
'But Your Honor, I have witnesses.'
'I can prove that Akira is innocent.'
'But the witness is also saying..'
'..that this crazy girl brutally assaulted three boys.'
'In light of all the evidence..'
'..the court decides to send Akira to the Child Correction facility..'
'..until we reach a verdict.'
'And this way...it took three years to prove Akira's innocence.'
Akira.
- Yes.
Listen.
- I am listening.
Go ahead.
Your brother's arriving from Mumbai today.
He called yesterday.
Why?
He's calling me to Mumbai.
I mean you and me.
To stay with him.
Mumbai?
- Yeah.
I am not going anywhere.
Look, Akira, stop arguing.
He's coming after a very long time.
Come home soon from college.
When he went against your wishes..
...and married that Mumbai-girl, you swore never to see his face again.
He's worried about his child, that's why he's calling us.
He's calling you to wash his kid's soiled pants.
He never called all these years.
And now when they can't handle the child, he calls everyday.
I am not leaving Jodhpur and going anywhere.
Akira.
We're here.
- Yes.
Thank you, Am.
- Yeah.
I'll see you in the evening.
- Definitely.
Thank you.
Grandma, how are you?
I am fine.
Ajay, you returned home after so long.
What to do, grandma?
I was busy with work.
See you later.
- Okay.
Mom.
Excuse me, madam.
- Yes.
The principal wants to meet Akira.
I'll try talking to her.
Come in.
Sit down.
- No, I am fine.
We were just talking about you.
It's a good thing that..
...your brother wants to take both of you to Mumbai.
To look after you two.
Why are you saying no?
Well...the new semester's just started.
And I've already wasted so many years.
Uncle...
I can easily get her admission in Mumbai.
I know the principal at Holy Cross Arts and Science College..
...really well.
I'm like a father to you.
There's no scope for further education in this small city.
If you go to Mumbai..
...it'll really help your higher studies.
The door's open.
Come in.
Hey"
Mom...
Akira, this is Shilpa.
Come in.
Bless you...it's alright.
Oh, sorry..
- It's okay.
Bless you.
Come, I'll show you.
Give it.
Come.
Sorry, wrong house.
You...wrong house.
Sid.
- Hi, sis.
Come.
That's my brother.
May I come in?
- Yeah.
He lives here with us.
- I see.
Sid.
Hello, aunt.
- Hello, son.
He's planning to go abroad..
...to do his Doctorate in Finance.
Doctor!
Yes.
It's really hard work, isn't it?
Doctors are highly respected.
This is great.
Now we've a doctor at home.
Son, I've got severe pain in my knee for three months.
Take a look.
- Sorry, aunt...
I'm not the kind of doctor you think.
I am doing Finance..
I mean...
I am doing a doctorate in money-management.
PhD!
It's like a degree.
Well, that's good.
Doctors don't get much respect.
You can find a bunch of them at every nook and corner.
Yes, aunt...that's why..
Actually, he also works in a Social Welfare Organization..
...along with a few of his friends.
'Raindrops.'
- I see.
He does social work.
Forget that, let's play squash today.
I don't mind, but you will lose again.
I'll let you win.
Listen..
- Stop talking.
Sid, eat.
Akira, the principal's called us at 11 am.
And it'll take around two hours to get there.
We'll get you a local-train pass.
So that you can easily commute to and fro.
I'll stay at the hostel.
Why will you stay in the hostel?
Yeah, Akira?
Why the hostel?
The hostel rent, canteen expenses...
It's unnecessary..
Ajay...
Why are you forcing her?
If she wants to stay in the hostel, then let her.
We shouldn't have a problem.
She will visit us often...during her holidays.
Akira, Ajay's told me everything.
Don't worry, you won't be wasting this year.
You...just concentrate on your studies.
Thank you.
About the hostel?
Father, I talked to you over the phone about that hostel room.
Yeah..
Yes, Father.
Sister d'Mello, is there any room available in the hostel?
No, Father.
We had four students from Nasik as well, asking for rooms.
But we couldn't help them either.
What can we do?
But we do have Room No.
17, which we never consider.
Yes...but..
- What's the problem in Room No. 17?
Last year, one of the students committed suicide in that room.
Since then...no one is willing to stay there.
It's been closed since then.
- Father, I don't have a problem.
I can live there.
Akira, someone committed suicide..
- It's okay.
Excuse me.
Dad, weren't you looking for this?
- Where was it?
You forgot it in the kitchen while talking to mom.
I'll get some privacy...
I'll live there.
But, Akira, someone committed suicide..
Don't discourage her if she wants to live there.
No, Father, I was just..
- Leave that.
Ajay, remember we discussed about a donation for the old church.
Yes.
- Here it is.
Yes.
The college campus is 55 acres wide.
Father's home is in the campus as well.
There's an old church as well, which has been closed for a long time.
Father's been collecting donations for its renovation.
There's a school here too?
- Yes.
But only for deaf and dumb children.
But it's under the same management.
Come.
Ma'am...my iPod's missing.
Missing?
- Yes.
Since when?
It was on my bed, I just went to the next room.
When I returned, it was missing.
Always lock your room.
I've told you so many times.
I am fed up of these thefts every week.
Here's the 'Missing' register.
Fill in the details.
We'll inform you if we find anything.
Here.
See...keep your belongings carefully, and always lock them away.
Yes.
This is the one.
I'll get the room cleaned up by evening.
Good stuff..
Must be from down South.
Sir..
- Yes.
Sir, should I drive?
- Why?
You're a bit..
Bapurao.
- Sir.
Give me the alcohol tester.
Yes.
Sir.
Check yourself, it's within the limit.
But, sir, this is something else.
If you lose control..
Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.
He's a new recruit, and wants to test my control.
No, sir.
Let's show him my control.
Let it be, sir.
Sir..
Sir, careful.
Rane, sir..
Rane sir, careful.
It's okay, sir.
What's this?
Oh, God!
Don't say anything, sir.
I am new, but why did you get scared?
This is the first time he hit the brakes on time.
Get in.
All his creations...
are in the form of couplets.
And his main subjects are religion, ethics and preaching.
Niki.
- Sir, it's a strike.
Sit down everyone!
Strike?
What for?
Sir, the canteen food is horrible.
Even the rats are falling sick, sir.
So everyone suggested that if we complain together..
...then maybe the contractor will change.
Do you have to do all this during class?
Can't you do it during lunch-break?
Do you want to join them?
- Yes, sir, we'll go too.
Let's go.
Strike for this, strike for that...
everyone wants to be the next CM.
So, I was saying..
From literature's point of view..
- Are you special?
Don't disturb those who don't want to join you.
You can all go.
She's crazy.
- Niki, we'll deal with her later.
So where were we?
What's going on there?
Sorry.
Madam, she still doesn't like the canteen food.
Manik.
- Sir.
Should I drive?
- No, sir.
I'll drive.
Where's my lighter?
Is it under your seat?
Watch out!
Hey"
What are you doing?
Such disregard for traffic rules.
Hey"
First you rammed a police-car.
And now you're creating a scene.
What do you mean by police-car?
Aren't there any traffic rules for you?
And you weren't even wearing a seatbelt.
Hey...
Uncle, you would've been squashed like a bug.
Say thank you and leave.
Enough of this nonsense.
Hello, sir.
I'm not talking nonsense.
He's showing me the finger.
Do you want me to explain politely?
Sir...he's a college professor, show some manners.
Oh, Professor.
What are you doing?
Sir, are you okay?
Sir, careful.
Come back, sir.
And they call themselves police officers.
They have their own rules.
- Are you hurt?
Sir...
I am telling you, it must be a mistake.
I am sure he didn't know that he was a professor.
Take my complaint right now and lodge an FIR.
Sir, it's a small matter.
Don't blow it out of proportion.
I am telling you, there's nothing I can do about it.
Come, sir.
We'll show them.
Let's go.
Everyone sign this, we'll take this to the commissioner.
The police assaulted our professor without a reason.
Everyone sign this.
The police think they can do anything.
And they refused to file a complaint.
We'll show them the power of students.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
The police must apologize!
The police must apologize!
Control Room!
Control Room!
A huge crowd has gathered here.
Please send forces immediately.
The police must apologize!
We want...
- Justice.
Step back.
Step back.
You cannot block the roads.
Please disperse.
- We won't tolerate it.
Get up...don't sit here!
- We won't tolerate it.
Clear the roads.
Get out of here.
The police must apologize!
Sir...
- Manik, are you a kid?
Don't talk to them, just kick them out before the Commissioner arrives.
Okay, sir.
Yes, charge at them.
- Sir.
Charge...phone..
Don't know.
Get them out of here.
Come on.
Come on.
Get up...get out of here.
Leave us.
The police must apologize!
Get rid of them.
Get them out.
Come on.
Sir, one of your officers assaulted our professor.
Sir, they were hurling stones at us...
uprooting rods.
Shinde was bleeding.
- And you panicked.
No, sir, that's not it.
You wouldn't have fired, if you hadn't panicked.
All you had to do was break a few bones.
It was a small matter.
Sir..
Where's the bottle of water?
Sir, Bapurao took it to the bathroom
Rajeshwar.
- Yes, sir.
I had mixed vodka in that bottle which he took.
His backside will start dancing.
Call him.
Yes..
- See if he's done or not.
Bapurao!
- Coming.
Let's go.
Bloody thing...it burns.
Manik, you know what to say in the inquiry.
- Yes, sir.
Hey"
Bloody hell, he'll definitely die.
Oh no...
He rammed the car, sir.
Hello..
Looks like he'd decided to die today.
He didn't wear seatbelts either.
The tire burst, sir.
The airbags didn't open either.
The speed at which he came in, lam sure he's dead.
Sir...
let's put him in our jeep and take him to the hospital.
Waste of time, Rajeshwar!
No point.
What happened?
Is he dead?
Seems like it.
No movement in the body.
Doesn't this area fall under Inspector Khamkar?
That baldy..
- Yeah..
Panvel-Panchayat area.
Sir.
Look what's here.
Is it full of money?
Check it.
Yes.
Looks like about 70-80 cr.
- Easily.
What do you think we should do?
Your call, sir.
All clear, sir!
- Such a lonely place and so much money!
Did you find Khamkar's number?
I say let's handle this by ourselves.
What say?
It's a gift - we can all settle down comfortably.
But, sir..
The Goddess of Wealth is knocking at your door..
...but you'd rather stand in the queue!
Don't worry, I'll arrange everything.
Manik, come.
- Sir.
Bapurao.
Yeah..
Rajeshwar.
- Yes, sir.
Keep it down.
Bapurao.
Hey, stop!
Leave the bag!
Everything's already messed up.
What...
'News about the increasing number of thefts in the city over the month.'
'And the recent news of robbery at Ghanshyam Das Jewellers in Kandivali.'
What's wrong?
Not in the mood?
Going home?
I am talking to you.
ACP sir, why are you wearing your clothes?
Take them off and come here.
I've something more important to do.
Will you please finish your drink in the hall?
I've to make a call.
It's an official call.
There is tension at many places in Maharashtra.
After the attack on North Indian auto drivers in Pune..
...many people have left the city.
'We received news of five road-accidents in and around Mumbai.
The total number of casualties is four.
Hello.
- Sir.
Manik, did you watch the news?
- Yes, sir, I did.
Our matter simply disappeared into thin air along with the other news.
The rest is a piece of cake...
easy-peasy.
Listen, we made one mistake.
When I hit him with the jack, I should've hit him on the face instead.
It would've looked like an accident.
But I hit him on the back instead.
Now...keep a close watch on the post-mortem and don't slip up.
Listen, carefully explain to Bapurao and Rajeshwar what to do with the rest of the money.
Yes, sir.
And from now on, call me on my new number.
Write it down.
Yes, sir.
988...
"...and don't slip up."
"Listen, carefully explain to Bapu Rao and Rajeshwar.."
"..what to do with the rest of the money."
"And from now on call me on my new number."
"Write it down."
"988...4205869."
"Happy Birthday to you.."
Such a big prize - and you got it so easily.
Where did you record this?
In my bedroom.
Around 11 months ago, I got caught in a hotel raid.
He took my number and address..
...but he didn't register any case.
He released me without taking any money.
But after that..
...he started coming home whenever he wanted.
At first I didn't take it too seriously.
I thought he's a police officer after all..
...someday he'll come in handy.
But then he started bugging me - romance and what not.
I wanted to get rid of him.
And just last week, I fixed this camera in my bedroom..
...so that he'd stop harassing me.
Call it fate, look what I got my hands on.
And immediately called you guys.
If we make a plan, we can extort all the money from him.
Maya, if this didn't involve the police..
...we could've handled anyone else easily.
And this guy's the ACP.
If he finds out, he'll charge us with a fake case..
...and kill all of us.
If we make a foolproof plan..
...then we could all go back to Gorakhpur and live happily.
I don't want to get into this police mess.
Maya, when you called I thought..
...maybe some college student or software engineer..
...has fallen head-over-heels for you.
Look, this is quite risky.
You won't be able to get out of this one.
Let's go.
- Come on.
Sun".
Listen...
take a day's time.
Think...
and let me know tomorrow.
Didn't I already tell you?
Look, do whatever you want.
But don't ever bring this matter up again.
Let's go.
- It's getting late.
Your bill, ma'am.
Thanks.
Where is it?
Excuse me.
- Yes, ma'am.
Those students who were here - do they come regularly?
I don't know, ma'am.
What happened?
There was a camera in my bag, but now it's missing.
They just passed by my table.
I didn't notice, ma'am.
Do you know them?
I think they were Holy Cross college students.
Holy Cross college students!
And now finally, a small speech by Akira.
Good evening.
Actually, Father and the lecturers asked me to give a speech suddenly..
...so I haven't prepared much.
But since its World Disabled Day..
...it reminded me of something my father said.
My father
We can't hear you!
I think the Mike is not working.
- We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
What's wrong?
We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
Sir, there's a problem with the connection.
It'll take a while, sir.
I'll see what's wrong?
We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
"A disabled person isn't someone who doesn't have a limb.."
"..it's someone who doesn't use the limbs."
"Hands that don't come forth to help others are 'disabled'."
"The eyes that ignore atrocities...
are 'disabled'."
"Feet that turn away and desert their parents are 'disabled'."
Niki, we must do something about her.
Stop here.
How much?
- Let it be.
It's okay.
I can't take money from you.
I see...
then come every day at 8 am.
Madam..
It's not a government vehicle.
Here you go.
Good morning, sir.
- Rabiya madam...
Back again?
Are you looking to score a century in transfers?
The straight path is often the twisted one, sir.
Did you come with family, or..
- No, sir, I've come alone.
Alone?
Okay?
- Okay, sir.
Hello.
"Manik, did you watch the news?"
"Our matter disappeared into thin air along with other news."
"The rest is a piece of cake...
easy-peasy."
"Listen, we made one mistake."
"When I hit him with the jack,..
...I should've hit him on the face instead."
"It would've looked like an accident.
But I hit him on the back."
"Now...keep a close watch on the post-mortem and don't slip up."
"Listen, what to do with the rest of the money..."
'The number you've called is currently switched off.'
We should've been more careful, sir.
I never thought she would do such a thing with me.
Her house is locked and she's missing.
Even her phone's switched off.
She's a hooker;
won't be easy to trap her.
Will she be asking for a share in the money..
...or ask for all of it?
Wonder who else is in this with her?
Don't let the word spread.
- Yes.
Sir, the call made to you was from a prepaid number.
The SIM Card...has been issued to this college ID.
First year student, Holy Cross College.
And listen...they've asked me to pay the hostel fee next week.
Please tell brother to pay it.
Yes, I..
I've to make an urgent call.
Enough!
Break her face!
Hey"
Seen a girl in a blue shirt?
So?
Are you scared now?
Please forgive me.
I've already wasted three years of my college.
Now if I thrash you people too, I'll get in trouble again.
What?
I see...you were hiding here, so you don't thrash us.
Stop talking to her.
I don't want to fight.
Listen to me.
Please tell them, was it my fault?
You were picking on me for no reason.
We'll go, just wait a minute.
David, Pooja said you were looking for me.
Nothing important..
You always used to listen to music on your phone, with the headphones.
Where is it?
I don't see it.
My phone's been stolen.
I went to wash my face and it disappeared.
I even made an entry in the 'Missing' register.
Why?
What happened?
- Nothing.
Just asked.
I'll tell you if I find it.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Okay-
The college wants to catch him red-handed, sir.
So, the call I received was from a stolen phone.
This means...whoever stole the phone is still in the hostel.
And before the hostel guys find him, we must find him first.
You two will keep an eye on Maya's home, as well as the hostel.
- Sir.
Here's your fare.
Hello.
- Sir, it's me.
She's here.
Get inside and tie her up.
- Sir, me?
I am coming!
Where is she?
What happened?
You dare record my phone calls and threaten me?
You wanted to extort money from me?
Me?
- No.
How did you record the call?
Tell me how did you record the call?
With a handycam!
Look at me..
Where's your handycam?
- Stolen.
What?
Stolen?
Someone stole it at the coffee shop.
I didn't see his face.
But I know he's a student at Holy Cross College.
What were you doing at the coffee shop?
What were you doing at the coffee shop?
Tell me the truth, or I will break your face.
You won't get another customer or a lover.
Why did you take the camera to the coffee shop?
I went to meet a couple of friends.
Did you show them the video?
Did you show them the video?
So three more people know now.
She's spoiled it all.
Messed it up!
She's messed us up!
Maya!
Maya!
Maya!
Maya!
Maya!
What was the name of the coffee shop?
Coffee shop..
Wretch.
Did she say the name of the coffee shop?
She didn't say anything.
I'm going through a real bad phase.
Go on.
Madam.
The kohl's completely smeared.
Seems she cried a lot before committing suicide.
Right, madam.
I deduced that too.
She cried her heart out.
She...
looks tense too.
This is definitely a suicide.
Her cheeks are swollen too.
Maybe someone beat her up and made her cry.
And then hung her.
But, madam, the...
door's locked from inside.
Manik, you're so naive.
Locking the door from inside...
is an old grandfather's technique.
The computer's hard disk is missing.
Her cellphone isn't here either.
There was a charger in the bedroom, did you see it?
You mean that cellphone charger.
It's not a cellphone charger, it's a video-camera charger.
There's a charger, but no camera.
Is this Plot No. 401-C?
Who is he?
- Courier, madam.
Come here.
Sign.
Thank you, sir.
What is it, madam?
- Credit card bill.
Beauty parlour, pub, supermarket, coffee shop.
She swiped her card in these four places.
Find out where she visited regularly.
Did she go alone or with friends?
Find out more details about her.
Keep this.
- Yes, ma'am.
Actually, Manik, give that to me.
I'll keep it.
Call the forensic people, ask them when they can get here.
- Yes.
I think something's wrong.
Maybe it's a murder.
Looks like it's the handiwork of at least 3 to 4 people.
Fine, you make the call until then I'll question the neighbors.
Yes, ma'am.
Bloody Rabia...always honest - that too on a police salary.
We can't shut her up with a share either.
You will only follow this case...
and no acting smart.
Rabia should never find out..
...that we're involved in this case.
Sir.
Let's see how far she Gets, with that baby in her tummy.
Manik.
- Yes, ma'am.
We couldn't locate Maya's buddies in the coffee shop, right?
Well, I just got their address.
Note it down.
- Madam?
Note it down.
- Y-Yes, ma'am.
House No. 3, Yamuna Nagar, Malad East.
Sir..
- Where are you taking us?
Don't worry.
Please, sir, we're getting worried.
- We'll tell you everything.
Sir..
- Come on, get it.
It's nothing, it will be over in 10 minutes.
Where are you taking us, sir?
Get in, come on.
Yes, Manik.
Madam, I found two guys at the address you gave me.
They willingly got in the car without any hassle.
But as soon as the car slowed down at the bend..
...they jumped out and escaped.
We tried catching them, but..
- I see.
See you there, we'll discuss this.
- Okay, madam.
Well, for now, my life-calling is to go to classes.
Going to Churchgate;
can I drop you someplace?
Thanks.
Okay.
See you.
- Bye.
Akira.
Take a seat.
How's college?
All okay?
Good.
By the way, does anyone in college know that you've been to jail..
I mean...
that you were in the Remand Home.
No!
That's a good thing.
Who knows how they'll behave once they find out.
By the way, no one from my family knows about this.
The other day, the police came home..
...just for Sid's passport verification.
And dad was very uncomfortable.
If he finds out about all this, then..
You can keep meeting Sid, talk to him, be friends..
...but if things go beyond that, it'll be a problem for all.
No?
Don't worry, that won't happen.
You won't have any problems because of me.
Hope I didn't hurt you.
It's not that easy to hurt me.
Bapurao.
Yes, sir.
The college is closed for vacations.
- Yes.
Who's going to stay in the hostel now?
We've been standing out here like madmen.
Madam, please listen.
- Who are you guys?
How did you get in?
Isn't the watchman inside?
We came here to meet a student, but didn't realize it's the holidays.
Are you alone in the hostel?
- Yes.
I see..
- Who do you want to meet?
L..
- Riya.
What's her room number?
Isn't this the model we've been looking for?
Please keep it back, it's not mine.
How much did you pay for this camera?
- I told you this is not mine.
Please keep it back.
ACP sir's number on the dialing list.
What?
ACP who?
Is this your bag?
It was lying outside.
"Listen, I made a mistake."
"When I hit him with the jack.."
Come with us.
- Where?
Who are you?
Come on!
"Don't you get it?"
"It's an official call."
"Hello..."
Sir, she's out to get us.
During the college strike, she gave the file to the commissioner.
Did you ask her, did she make more copies of this video?
We searched her room, but found nothing.
And did she tell anyone about this?
What did she say?
The same old thing..
"This isn't my bag, I don't know where it came from".
If these three spill the beans to anyone..
...then we'll lose everything we've made so far.
We must do something quickly.
Plus I've to go to Nasik..
...for a very boring session with the Home Minister.
Could take a few days.
And it could be dangerous to keep them alive for three days.
I suggest...that you end this whole thing.
Don't wait for me to return.
Remember our usual spot?
- Go.
Sir...we haven't done anything.
Come on, get down.
- Where are you taking us?
Keep walking down.
Come on..
We haven't done anything, sir..
Sir..
Trying to be a hero?
Where..
Come on.
Sir..
Come on.
Sit down.
Shut up!
- Sir..
Stop crying-
Here..
- Sir... no!
Sir, no.
- Kill them.
Take it.
Stop crying-
No...
- Sir..
Bloody dog, don't you get it?
Don't answer that now.
- ACP sir is calling.
No... no..
Yes, sir.
- You got the wrong girl, Manik.
She's not that girl.
But, sir..
Stealing stuff from the hostel, and making threat calls to me was done by someone else.
Don't shoot her.
- Sir..
Sir..
Sir, my battery's almost dead.
Call on Rajeshwar's cell.
- I didn't bring my mobile.
Sir..
- What does he want?
The phone's switched off.
No charge.
Leave it..
Let's finish the job first.
Shoot them.
Shoot.
Sir, maybe we got the wrong girl.
- What?
Yes.
That's why sir asked us to wait.
She's not that girl.
I haven't done anything!
Bloody lunatic, why does he keep changing the plan?
And he's saying this now.
Shoot her.
We'll deal with this later.
Shoot!
Sir, I am confused.
He said "Don't shoot", you're saying "Shoot".
Sir, what if this gets us in trouble later?
You're always so eager to answer the phone.
I answered only because ACP sir was calling.
To hell with your ACP!
He must be relaxing at home.
And out here, we're dealing with the mess.
Bloody..
What's he asking us to do?
Let's call him.
Go.
I need Bapurao with me.
Why?
Sir, to drive the van.
Go.
Come on, start the van.
- Yes.
Come on.
We've orders to let you go.
But you must keep quiet until they don't return.
Sir, it's Manik.
According to Bapurao's list, the thefts started last year in March.
And this girl joined now in July.
You fools got the wrong girl.
The details are clearly given in the list along with the dates.
You just make a copy, bring it to me..
...never read it, eat snacks off of it!
Let her go.
But, sir...we killed a guy in front of her.
How can we let her go?
Kill all of them.
- Okay, sir.
Now what?
What's going on?
Bloody..
The belt's broken.
What a piece of junk!
Sir... he says that the garage is six kilometers away.
Give me your walky.
- Yes.
Hello...hello, Rajeshwar sir.
Hello...hello, Rajeshwar sir.
Hello..
He's not in range.
He's all alone out there.
I think... if we travel two kilometers back..
...then his walky will be in range.
Yes.
Hello.
Hello...
Rajeshwar sir.
Rajeshwar sir, can you hear me?
Rajeshwar sir.
Hello.
What happened?
The van's belt got broken.
What do I do about them?
We've orders to shoot them all.
Hello...sir, did you hear?
Bloody..
Hello, sir.
Hello.
Hello...
Rajeshwar sir.
Hello...
Rajeshwar sir.
Rajeshwar sir.
"I've a meeting with the minister."
He said he has to go... and sent us here instead.
So that he's safe.
He's a bloody fraud.
Couldn't he check the list properly earlier?
Messed everything up by calling us in the middle of the job.
Let's get that girl before she talks to anyone.
You're saying...you saw one of the police officers before?
Yes, Father.
He was there during the strike.
Hello, Andrew, how are you?
- James, I want to meet right now.
Where are you?
I am in Pune...for a court hearing.
What is it?
There's a problem in college.
- I see...what's wrong?
Not on the phone, let's talk face-to-face.
Just get here as soon as you can tomorrow morning.
Okay-
Fine, let's meet in the morning.
- Okay, bye.
Thanks.
May I go, Father?
I am not staying at the hostel tonight.
I'll be here tomorrow morning.
Well, if there's a problem, you can stay here.
There's no problem, Father.
I am going to my brother's home.
I'll be here by tomorrow by 7 am.
- Okay.
I'll drop you at the station.
It's close by, Father.
I'll manage on my own.
Yes.
Papa, that's my sister, Akira.
Come in, Akira.
That's not the sari.
Then where is it?
There's one less.
Mom's inside.
- Count again.
But you guys must book a Cool Cab first..
...so that you all get there on time.
How's the place?
Well, it's a great place.
You?
So suddenly?
What happened?
Who are all these people?
They are Shilpa's relatives.
Her cousin's getting married.
They've come from Pune.
Something to eat?
What happened?
Did you get into a fight?
No, the door slammed on my face.
How can the door..
Wait, I'll put something on it.
- Mom!
I said it's nothing, let it be.
Akira, did you pay your hostel mess' fee?
Pay it tomorrow.
I want to talk to you.
- Say it.
Ajay.
Ajay.
- What happened?
Check this bill.
Something's wrong.
- What happened?
We selected 12 saris, didn't we?
- Yeah.
They billed us for 13 saris.
How's that possible?
Well...
I chose 5 silk saris, but I don't know about the rest.
But I..
- You settled the bill.
Yes.
- You must have counted the saris.
Maybe I checked..
- Did you count them or not?
No, I forgot.
- You didn't count the saris, Ajay.
But..
- How can you do such a thing?
- You check it.
There's no problem.
I kept telling you.
- Let me show you.
These are the ones that I counted.
These are Ritu's saris.
And I already gave aunty her saris.
Right?
There are two 'Chanderis' here..
...and those five silk saris which I packed myself.
- Okay.
What's the total?
12, Ajay...only 12-
How can you pay for 13?
Have you seen this girl?
She just left.. that way.
"Eyes have not been get wet for a long time."
"There is life from this pretext."
"Eyes have not been get wet for a long time."
"There is life from this pretext."
"Slowly slowly rain comes and fills."
Siddharth, it's Akira.
- Hi.
Can we meet now?
- No, I just finished work.
I am on my way back from Pune.
Was it something urgent?
- No.
Say it.
- No, it's okay.
Hello.
"I am desert, you fill me with water."
"There eyes clouds.."
"There eyes clouds.."
Give the fried rice to the kids standing there.
Okay-
Thank you.
Bring that plate.
Okay.
- I don't believe it, man.
- Clean that table.
He's always staring at me.
Seriously, he's crazy.
Did you keep that bag in front of my room at the hostel?
Hello...what bag?
I am talking to you, Niki.
Listen, I've been keeping my distance.
I don't know about any bag.
Then who kept that bag?
She said she doesn't know anything.
Don't touch me.
I am warning you, Niki...
don't mess with me.
Do you know the trouble you've caused me?
Wretch...how dare you hit me?
Sir, even the other clay you were mistaken..
- Shut up!
Bapurao, arrest everyone and lock them up!
Come on.
Sorry, sir.
- Come on.
What are you looking at?
Come on...get in.
- Sir...
Come on...get in.
Sujata, stop staring..
...and lock the girls up in Cell No. 2.
Get in.
I want to call home.
Make a call!
Get in..
Didn't I tell you, I'd catch her?
I ask you to get one girl;
but you get the whole college!
Botched up the game!
Sir, I thought..
- Don't think.
Please.
Now I'll do whatever needs to be done.
Bapurao.
- Sir.
Come on.
Come on.
Not you.
You stay there.
Listen, everyone.
No one talks about her outside.
Or I'll lock you all up again.
We can't kill her now.
Her college friends have seen her here.
And there's no telling what she's said to whom.
So what now, sir?
I'll tell you.
Hi...
How's your mom?
All well.
Good morning, Father.
Swipe for both the cars.
Okay, sir.
Ajay, sorry to disturb you.
Has Akira left for college?
Yes, Father, she left for the hostel last night.
Why?
What's wrong?
Her room's locked..
...and she hasn't appeared for the college's internal exams either.
What?
Did she tell you anything?
No.
Last night she was trying to tell me something..
...but, she..
Ask everyone she knows.
And let me know if you speak to Akira.
Sure, Father.
- Don't forget.
Definitely, Father.
I'll call right now.
I'll just call you back.
Brother-in-law.
- Akira hasn't gone to the hostel since last night.
What?
- Her principal just called.
I'll call my volunteers, ask them to find out.
We'll find her.
Let's file a missing complaint.
And we'll ask my advocate friend..
...how to include that Inspector Manik, whom she mentioned.
Sir, a missing complaint's been filed.
And Manik's name has been included.
I told you we'd get in deep trouble.
I just spoke with them.
But they are saying the same thing.
"We'll let you know once we find out."
Hello.
Sir..
Speak up.
Sir, we did exactly what you told us.
After this...we won't face any more problems because of that girl.
All clear, sir.
Stop.
Okay, that's enough for today.
Give her a dose.
When she's conscious again after four hours.
We'll do it once again.
Yes, doctor.
I'll never talk to you again.
Never
Understand?
How dare you take my doll?
Don't make a racket.
Come, Kamla.
It's your turn.
I won't take a bath.
Only mad people bathe every day.
You know, I have a shampoo as well.
What color?
- Yellow.
I don't like yellow.
L...
like this green.
- I've green too.
So...shall we go?
- Come on.
Let's go.
Are you a doctor?
- No, we're not doctors.
Then, are you like us?
- Yes, of course.
Then why don't you wear clothes like us?
We wear such clothes.
We like green.
Crazy girl - that's 'red', not 'green'.
Bedsheets...blanket...green shampoo.
- Okay.
And I was just..
What happened?
Mm?
What happened'?
Akira?
Akira!
Akira!
- Akira!
Hello.
But, Rane sir..
- Don't worry, Doctor.
Rajeshwar will be there soon.
Remember, no one should get suspicious until then.
Okay-
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, this is Amitabh Bachchan speaking.
- Listen.
Okay-
This is Rani speaking.
Can you ask the ten-million rupee question first?
Come here.
Come here.
Don't get me wrong, I was just kidding.
What is this place?
This is a big..
- What's the time?
Who is the in-charge here?
Get lost.
Come on..
Get back to general ward.
Madam, what is this place?
Get back.
Who are you?
Sit.
What are you doing?
- Sit down.
Hold her.
What is this?
Come on.
Get up.
Look this way.
Akira.
- Akira.
Get up.
Look this way.
Did this girl take drugs?
Drugs?
_ Yes?
Not at all.
No, sir.
And what kind of a question is that?
Hold on, Sid.
Let me talk.
May I know what Akira's done?
What did she do?
She did this.
She hurled a stone at me.
At a police officer.
It missed my eye just because I ducked.
What day was it?
And where?
Last Tuesday at around 11 pm, I was on patrol duty.
I noticed her from afar.
As soon as she saw me, she started behaving strangely.
She came up to me and asked "Are you Manik?"
Why are you roaming here in disguise?
I thought to myself that something is wrong.
I got down from my bike, and was parking it..
...when she hurled a stone at me.
Thankfully I ducked, but it hit my head and I fell down.
I arrested her immediately..
...and brought her to the police station to file an FIR.
But even at the police station..
...she kept saying to the entire staff..
"Four police officers were trying to kill me."
"They killed two boys but I escaped."
I knew it's a charade.
Or she's mentally ill.
Ma'am, did she ever hit her head when she was a kid?
Any such incident...
which could explain this behavior?
It happened long ago.
She threw acid on a boy's face.
She was sent to a children's remand home.
She even stayed there.
- That's it.
Didn't I say something's wrong?
Something's definitely wrong.
That's why I immediately brought her to the doctor..
I mean psychiatrist, for treatment.
And the tests were positive.
What's the actual problem?
She's affected by recurrent persistent delusion.
Type 2.
In simpler words, such patients..
...always gets confused between reality and fantasy.
They believe one of their fantasies to be true, and starts reacting.
Akira believes that the police are following her..
...and they'll kill her in an encounter.
Due to this imagination, she's behaving strangely amongst people.
No...no need to worry.
She'll be fine soon.
It's okay, mom...it's okay.
They're saying she'll be okay.
It's okay, mom.
Now eat.
You must finish all of it.
Come on, eat.
You'll get more, now eat.
Your sit here.
Sit here.
First finish this.
Come on, eat.
You'll get water, wait.
Eat from your plate.
Hey...go away GM. '
Akira.
Are you okay?
"Someone cast an evil eye on me, my
Hello.
Did you eat breakfast?
What's the time?
How long have you been in this hospital?
Almost two years..
I keep coming and going.
It's been going on like that.
Is it difficult to get out of here?
Well...it's very difficult to leave with permission.
But without permission...
it's less difficult.
Can you do something for me?
Hello, Father.
I am SP Rabiya.
Mumbai Crime Branch.
Please sit.
Well...there's a coffee shop, close to your college.
Around 500 meters away.
I am sure you know.
- Yes, I know.
On the 25th of last month..
...12 students from your college celebrated a birthday there.
And one of them stole a handycam..
...from a customer's bag.
Go back..
Later I saw the coffee shop's CCTV footage.
Stop.
Stop, stop, stop.
Out of those 12 students..
...that one girl could be seen stealing the camera.
But we couldn't see her face, she was wearing a cap.
So I started looking for all the students..
...whose faces could be seen in the video.
She's a 2nd year, Commerce Student.
And that's Bharat, 3rd year Mathematics student.
And he's a...2nd year Mathematics student as well.
And who's this?
This girl?
She's Ana.
The Principal's daughter.
Aha?
I want to see the handycam which your daughter stole.
Hi.
Did you go to the coffee shop with your friends?
When?
Which coffee shop?
You've been caught red-handed.
You've been caught stealing.
- Sir!
You've been caught stealing on camera.
- Sir...please..
You've ruined my name and respect.
How will I face the students?
Go get the handycam you stole from the coffee shop.
I want to see it.
- I am ruined..
In a way, I'm the one who encouraged this thief.
In every meeting in the hostel..
...I would tell the students, that..
"Whoever is committing these thefts in the hostel should mend their ways."
"And keep everything that's stolen in a bag.."
"..and leave it anywhere in the hostel."
"We won't take any action against this person."
'I didn't know that the thief's living in our own home.'
"Go, die somewhere."
'The college was shut down for holidays... '...when I discovered...' '...that my own daughter was the thief'
'All the students had gone home.
Only Akira was staying in the hostel.'
'That's why I left that bag outside her room.'
'So that when Akira finds the bag outside her room..'
'..she'd bring it to me immediately.'
Then I would've told everyone that the thief has returned everyone's stuff.
And I would've distributed everything back through the warden.
And this problem could've been solved.
But Akira didn't show up that night.
Next day when I went to the hostel, the room was locked.
That same night, Akira came home..
...and said that there was a bag lying outside her room.
As she opened to take a look, two policemen arrived.
They took the handycam and mobile from the bag, and kidnapped her as well.
And they took two boys along, whom they killed.
Only Akira survived.
After Akira left, I asked her again..
...and she admitted to stealing the handycam from the coffee shop.
And also told me about the foolishness she did by keeping it.
I study hard as well...
but it's never enough for dad.
He never missed a single opportunity to insult me.
He even hit me in front of my friends.
Finally I got fed up, and did all this to hurt him.
And unknowingly, it became a habit.
Sorry.
You said sorry so easily.
Do you how many lives your childishness has ruined?
He plays well.
He'll whack any ball.
Want to bet?
We're definitely losing.
Look, he hit the shot.
Didn't I tell you?
HEY-
Stop!
What are you doing?
Stop.
Why you...
Stop.
Hey, stop.
Stop.
Ajay...
Ajay, what is all this?
Your sister's standing outside our door in such a strange condition.
Akira!
Akira!
What are you doing here?
Ajay, I want to talk to you alone.
Akira...what are you doing here?
You're under treatment, aren't you?
How can you...
Nothing's wrong with me, mom.
- We know nothing's wrong with you.
But you must finish your treatment.
There's nothing wrong with me, so why should I get treatment?
Ajay, please listen to me.
- Fine, tell me.
Last Tuesday I came here.
- Not Tuesday, you came on Wednesday.
Yes..
- One day before the wedding.
I did come on Wednesday too.
But I came one day before that too.
You and mom were not at home.
You can ask Shilpa.
That day, when you were upset with me.
Tell them.
But, Akira, why would Shilpa be upset with you?
Ask her later, but when I went back ..
...there was a bag lying outside my room.
As soon as I opened it, two policemen barged in!
Yes, we know.
Father told us.
Because I told Father.
That day, after I escaped from that encounter spot..
...I met Father first.
And then I came here.
Akira, none of this happened.
It's just your delusion.
Why will the police try to kill you, Akira?
I mean...there's no reason.
The inspector whom you assaulted, took you to the psychiatrist.
That doctor checked you..
- That bloody doctor...is a liar.
They want to help you, dear.
- Help me?
Unbelievable, mom.
They want to drive me crazy.
Just tell me how you got here.
Catch her!
From the hospital.
She beat us up and escaped!
Catch her.
Hold on.
- No.
Akira, no.
- Akira.
They give me electric shocks..
- No.
Akira.
Leave me.
Careful.
Ajay..
Ajay, no!
Mom..
- Akira, just listen to them.
Don't let them take me!
Calm down, dear.
- Save me, mom.
All will be well.
- No!
Be brave.
- They...give me shocks...
Electric shocks...
She's calmed down.
Get the wheelchair.
Stop.
Excuse me.
I am SP Rabia.
I want to see a patient called Akira.
Where's her ward?
Thanks for saving me.
Who says thanks for something like that?
My own family doesn't trust me.
I'm sure everyone in college thinks I'm crazy too.
Giving you shocks...
and those injections..
...it's the doctor's doing.
If we catch him, everything'll be fine.
Wear this.
Wait here.
- Yes, I'll be right here.
Akira...madam.
How could you do something so cheap?
Tell me.
Forgive me, please.
Sorry?
' Sorry?
Sorry?
Sorry
You're going to say sorry?
Will your apology make everything alright?
My own family thinks I'm crazy.
No, no...no...forgive me.
Tell me...tell me the truth?
How much did they pay you?
- Madam...they forced me to do this.
That's why I had to do all this.
If you are right, why will they force you?
Few clays ago...
a patient died accidentally..
...while I was giving him shock treatment.
These cops helped me in closing that matter smoothly.
That's all...nothing more.
Come on.
Get up.
Wear your shirt and come with me.
- Where, madam?
To tell my family, the principal and the entire college that you lied.
Help me!
Someone help me!
Help me!
Please help me.
What did he say?
- He said he's at the club.
Club.
Come on.
Someone's coming.
Rani, come here.
Is this the ladies toilet?
- Yes.
Sorry.
What is this man..
He came in the wrong toilet, so we beat him up.
Sorry, I had a little too much.
I'll leave.
Rani.
- Yes.
Lift him up
Hello.
- Brother, it's me again.
Do you have any news yet?
No.
It's been three days.
I've been waiting for him.
Not yet.
Again, the same story!
Listen..
- A policeman's missing, and the police has no clue.
How is this possible?
Have faith in me.
- I can trust you, right?
Absolutely.
- Really?
Yes.
Sir...
Rajeshwar sir's wife.
She keeps calling us over and over again.
She's in the village; very frightened.
She wants to come here..
...and file a 'Missing' complaint.
I managed her for now, but..
This money mess..
I've fixed...
my daughter's marriage.
If Rajeshwar sir spills the beans..
...then I will be ruined, sir.
- Bapurao!
Get up!
Get up.
So what if he's scared?
Will he open his mouth?
You're making a mistake.
- What?
I am making a mistake?
You guys turn my life into a joke..
...and you say I'm making a mistake?
Should I blow your brains out?
Just because they sent me to a remand home as a kid..
...everyone looked down on me.
And now...this taint of being crazy.
Just being treated at the mental hospital means your life is over.
Why did you people do this to me?
Why did you people falsely accuse me?
Tell me.
Madam, these numbers match.
Good, file this separately.
Okay-
Take a picture of all this.
Okay, ma'am.
Look, ma'am.
Yes, this one too.
Get me the details of the driver of the crashed car.
Most importantly, the person who claimed the insurance.
Okay-
Since we received a complaint of Rajeshwar's disappearance..
...these three have been missing too.
No one at the police station knows anything either.
And their cellphones are off too.
We must arrest them and keep them inside.
Yeah...the TV and Press will humiliate us for a few days.
But we'll handle that.
Hello.
- Hello, Siddharth.
Akira speaking.
Where are you calling from?
- Listen to me carefully.
Go on.
The college's annual day function is tomorrow at 9:30 am.
The entire campus will gather at the auditorium.
Bring Ajay and mother along, I'll meet you there.
Inspector Rajeshwar is with me.
And he's ready to tell everyone how these policemen wanted to kill me.
Okay-
Who's call is it, Sid?
- Akira.
Akira...
Akira, where are you?
We're so worried..
- Ajay, I've told Siddharth everything.
Yeah, but..
- Bring mother along.
Don't make any excuses.
- Fine, but listen to me..
Akira...hello.
Hello.
What did she say?
She..
Yes, ma'am.
- I am SP Rabiya, Crime Branch.
"Inspector Rajeshwar is with me."
"He's ready to talk about how these cops wanted to kill me."
"When they didn't succeed.."
"..they proved that I am delusional with Dr. Santosh Tiwari's help.."
"..and locked me up at the Thane mental asylum."
"Rajeshwar has agreed to say this.."
"..in front of the media, the court and the entire college."
Agreed?
How can he agree?
I was telling you, sir.
He must be scared, right?
Sir, we've traced the location of Rajeshwar sir's mobile.
The signal was coming from the tower..
...close to Holy Cross College.
Sir... a lot of students live around the college as paying guests.
If she's hiding in one of those buildings..
...it'll take days to find her.
What time is the college function tomorrow?
- 10 am.
Is that person over there your principal?
Yes.
Who's with him?
Actually...he's the vice-principal.
Sir.
Sir, I just saw that mad person..
...head towards the building near the ground.
No one's allowed to go there.
The structure's too weak. .
Did you check behind the building?
- No, sir.
The principal's arrived.
He's sitting on the front seat.
You must tell everyone...
exactly what you told me.
Get it?
If you try to act smart, I'll shoot you.
Rani!
Sir!
She's run out of bullets, sir!
Quiet.
- Sir!
Come on.
Get up.
Stop!
- Manik.
Get on your knees!
Get on your knees!
Hands at the back!
Hands at the back!
Bapurao.
Stay still or else I'll shoot.
Wretch.
Leave it.
Leave her.
You should've done something when she kidnapped you.
What's the point of showing your machismo now?
Sir, do you know what happened that day?
Don't talk nonsense.
Nonsense?
I am talking nonsense?
A college student and a mad person abduct you..
...thrash you...and mess you up.
There's nothing you could do and you're showing your anger now.
I see.
Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.
Here.
Manik.
- Sir.
Your FIR report..
Two mad people stole tools from the mortuary.
And...they abducted Rajeshwar and brought him here.
By the time we got here to save Rajeshwar..
...they'd already severed his hand.
Bapurao.
And we had no other choice.
So, in order to save Rajeshwar, we had to kill these two.
Now shoot her in the forehead.
Manik...you'll do no such thing.
You cleverly slip out of every situation.
You have a gun, don't you?
You shoot her!
Shoot her!
Get your hands and limbs severed.
Why do you always ride the gun on our shoulders?
Don't be crazy..
- You've been doing crazy things from the beginning..
...and you're calling me crazy?
Don't you know how to talk to your senior?
- Hey!
You're my senior only when we're in the department.
Out here, I am senior to you in age, and you're my junior.
Bloody fool, talking nonsense.
Hey..
- Leave me!
- Be quiet...
He'll create problems with the girls..
...and ask us to deal with it.
And sit at home by himself...
"I am in Nasik."
"..in a meeting with the minister."
He talks too much.
Manik.
- Sir.
Your new FIR report.
These two kidnapped Rajeshwar and brought him here.
We followed them here.
We killed that mad person and saved Rajeshwar.
Arrested this girl.
We were taking the girl..
...when she snatched my gun and shot Rajeshwar.
Next...she tried to kill me.
That's when you..
Go back 10 feet from your position.
And shoot her.
Shoot her, Manik.
Back.
Shoot.
Manik.
Hands UP!
Manik, throw down your gun.
Here she comes again.
Or else we'll have to shoot.
Rabiya, do you even know what happened here?
Don't act without knowing the facts.
I know everything, sir.
Right from the accident on Mumbai-Pune Highway..
...to sending this girl to the mental asylum, everything.
I know everything.
You can't kill her and hide the truth anymore.
And even the commissioner knows about it.
We've orders to arrest you, sir.
Please throw your guns down.
Manik.
Throw your gun down.
Sir, please.
Amar.
- Ma'am.
Get their guns.
They killed my friend.
Her body is lying somewhere at the back.
Rafiq, go check.
Yes, ma'am.
Do you know everything?
- Yes, I do.
May I go now?
It's the commissioner?
Hello, sir.
- Where are you?
Behind Holy Cross College, in the old church.
What happened?
- We've arrested them, sir.
Don't arrest them, Rabiya.
There's a problem.
Why, sir?
The guy they murdered on the highway..
...was the brother of North Indian Party's top leader, Bablu Tiwari.
Remember...he was involved in provoking riots in the city before.
This year his party is claiming to host..
...the biggest 'Chhat Puja' event in Mumbai.
Due to which there is already growing tension amongst the local parties.
That money was being brought in for that event.
If the news leaks out, that his brother didn't die in an accident..
...but in fact, a few Mumbai police officers murdered him for the money..
...then Bablu Tiwari will provoke riots again.
And so I spoke with the Secretariat..
...and the higher authorities and made this decision.
So end the case right here and close the file.
So please follow my orders.
Don't arrest them.
But sir, two murders have been committed here.
Inspector Rajeshwar and a mad person's been shot.
Look, Rabiya, they are going to prepare a fake report anyway.
I promise a full inquiry against Rane and his entire team.
They will definitely get a life sentence.
And that girl Akira..
- You're thinking about saving one girl..
...and I am thinking about thousands of innocent people.
Please understand.
This has now become a national issue.
And so...we must keep this under wraps..
...until the 'Chhat Puja' isn't over next month.
But, sir, the media's already standing outside.
I cannot lie to them.
Rabiya, give the phone to ACP Rane.
Yes, sir.
Commissioner sir.
Hello, sir.
ACP Rane, so you're above the law now?
You'll do as you want.
- No, sir, actually..
Do you have any idea..
...that your action has stirred up a law and order situation.
Now listen carefully.
- Yes, sir.
Sure.
You've to pretend before the media..
...that Akira is an escaped mental patient.
And don't mess it up.
- Okay, sir.
We'll handle it.
Understand.
Yes, sir.
Sure, sir.
Rabiya madam, you can take your team and go back.
Manik.
- Sir.
Call the hospital, and call an ambulance to take her back.
Sir.
Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.
Make that girl sit in a corner.
Yes, sir.
What happened, madam?
I can come with you, right?
We cannot handle this case anymore, Akira.
They've been asked to take charge of this case now.
Them?
But they are responsible for all this.
How can they handle it?
Bapurao, don't just sit there and stare.
Make her sit in a corner until the ambulance doesn't arrive.
Sir.
Why should I go back to the hospital?
Sorry, Akira, but I can't help you right now.
But...what's the problem?
If your case gets registered, it will turn into a communal issue.
And the riots can..
...lead to the loss of many innocent lives.
Only you can save this city from burning up again.
And so they are going to keep you in the hospital for a while..
...and then let you go.
I am sorry, but...
there's no other choice, Akira.
How can you say that?
They tried to kill a girl.
Together they tried to prove that I'm crazy.
Arrest them!
Will you send me back to the asylum too in order to cover up the truth?
I am sorry, the department will definitely give you compensation..
...and I will try..
- Bapu Rao.
- Compensation?
What do you mean by compensation?
Come on.
You mean first you gouge both my eyes out..
...and then give me an expensive walking-stick.
Please cooperate with them.
Believe me, it can..
What's more that can happen?
You should've killed me instead.
'That day my hands were tied, but not Akira's.'
Madam!
Madam!
Ma'am, their guns?
- Keep it.
Sir.
Let go.
- Let go.
Let go.
Let go.
Let go.
Let go.
Madam..
Please, madam.
'If your case gets registered, it'll turn into a communal issue.'
'And the riots can..'
'..
lead to the loss of many innocent lives.'
'Only you can save this city from burning up again.'
Akira.
What...what's she saying?
She's saying that she nailed herself to the cross.
'Since the report that deemed Akira mentally ill, was fake..' ...I made sure that no case was registered against her,'
'A few days later, she was fully exonerated and she went home...' '...where she began to follow the path her father had shown her.'
'I want every daughter of this country, including mine...to become like Akira.'
'Someone who learns to live on the basis of her own strength.'
Very good.
"New paths are ahead.
New turns are ahead."
"Don't be nervous."
"Keep on going alone on your own strength."
"Determination is your companion."
"What do you care if darkness is filled in the whole world."
"Why should your evenings coax lamps for light."
"Your both eyes are filled with light."
"You are my star."
"You are my star."
"You are my star filled with light."
"You are my star."
"The whole nature is reliant on you."
"You plant moon and stars."
"The sun burns through your heat."
"You are unaware of your miracles."
"You are the ground that holds lakhs of skies.
"You are my star filled with light."
"You are my star."
"You are my star filled with light."
"You are my star."
"You are my star filled with light."
"You are my star."
"You are my star filled with light."
"You are my star."
"Star."

The Johnson family loves Christmas.
And for us, Christmas kicks off the moment Bow starts washing dishes after Thanksgiving.
From that moment on, it's a countdown to our favorite holiday of the year when a joyous and inclusive spirit runs through the house.
This year is extra special because of the pleasant surprise of my aged wife's fertility.
And to top it off, my favorite person/international pop star was coming to stay with us with the baby she'd wished for for so long.
And my least favorite person/ international mooch was leaving, but not fast enough.
Hey.
That's my...
That's my...
Okay.
All right.
But there was something bittersweet about this holiday, too.
My firstborn, Zoey, is a senior in high school, and she's about to leave the nest.
Dad, you're gazing at me again.
Please don't go to college!
Hey, what's happening, girl?
I like your new room.
Hey, what are you watching? "TRL"?
Dad, don't.
The friend thing... it's weird.
Yeah, I felt that.
Okay, look.
This is your last Christmas before you go to college, and I want to spend some quality time with you.
I was hoping we could make some memories, do the greatest hits... perfect tree, cocoa, matching PJs.
We've never done matching PJs.
This is our last chance.
It'll get weird soon.
Hold on, Dad.
If you wanted to do Christmas stuff, just tell me that.
I love Christmas.
Let's hang.
We're gonna hang?
Thank you.
Should I look away while you get yourself together?
- Yes, please!
Please look away!
- Okay, looking away.
I don't want you to remember me like this!
Tell me when you're done.
- Nope.
- Nope.
Ooh, I think this is for us.
Ooh, I bet it's a trampoline.
Without looking at it, it is not.
- What are you two doing?
- Laundry.
You don't need to lie to him.
He has no power.
Well, a certain elf watching from a distance does.
And he will be very interested in letting Santa know about these violations.
Well, the elf isn't in this room.
So by his law, none of this ever happened, so nobody saw nothing.
You won't get away with this.
You think that magical cross-legged sentry is a joke?
I only see one joke in here.
It's me, isn't it?
It's always you.
Aww.
Aren't you the cutest?
Oh, my goodness.
You're so cute,
I just want to put your foot in my mouth.
I'm gonna do it.
Ahhh!
- No, uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- She's touching...
C-Can...
Can you, um, not put my baby's feet into the dirtiest part of your body?
Oh.
Uh, maybe we just play pretend, like air bites, like, nyah-yah-yah.
- Nyah-yah-yah.
- Yeah.
Okay.
It's just as fun.
- Is it?
- Yeah!
It's even more fun because then my baby can still live.
Oh!
Okay.
Look at all the padding around the baby's head.
Looks like he's about to blast off into outer space.
- We didn't even have a car seat for Dre.
- What?
- He just rode shotgun and held my cigarettes for me. -
I've got the burns and the asthma to prove it.
Ain't nobody wheeze like my baby.
- What is that?
- Oh, it's a sleep monitor.
It lets us know if the baby isn't breathing or if his heart stops or if somebody tries to snatch him.
Ah.
It's a little glitchy, though, so seven, eight times a day, we think our baby died.
Other than that, it's awesome.
Wow.
I forgot how silly new parents are.
Silly or not, this baby has not cried once.
Well, of course you haven't cried.
With all the beeping and the blinking and the padding and the heating, you don't have any time for your own little thoughts, do you, sweetheart?
Well, we need to tell Auntie Bow Bow that Mommy has read all the blogs and knows exactly what babies need.
Maybe Auntie Bow Bow is a little out of touch touch.
- Oh.
- Oh, come on, Ruby.
Baby can't even talk, and they think he can clearly track a passive-aggressive conversation like a divorce arbitrator.
You know, I miss Gene.
Oh, yeah.
Gene was good.
All right, here we go.
Heading to the garage to find our Christmas ornaments.
2016, Zoey and Dre!
Okay, I'm gonna switch to slo-mo.
All right.
Ugh!
I can't switch to slow-mo while I'm filming, so you're gonna have to fake it.
Okay?
Go!
This is the best Christmas ever.
You guys filming?
Damn it, Junior!
Delete.
I'm trying to spend some time with my child.
Okay, then.
I'll be fast.
I'd like to bring up the twins' behavior of late.
They are making a mockery of the elf!
They're running amok!
Do you even know what they had for breakfast?
Don't listen to him!
We had a bowl of cereal and fresh fruit.
Uh, next to two slices of toast,
- and a glass of OJ to wash it all down.
- All down.
Lies!
They're just describing a balanced breakfast they saw on television!
You know what they really had?
Junior.
That cake you hid in the vegetable crisper.
Hold on.
My shame cake?
- Torched it.
- Ah.
Get out of my sight.
And if you even look at my sadness cookies...
You fix this, Junior.
You fix this now.
I swear to God.
You better not let them two ruin Zoey's Christmas.
You mean all of our Christmases, ri...
You heard what I said.
How long do I need to keep my finger here?
What does it matter, Earl?
Your drinking hand's still free.
Yeah, well, when you're right, you're right.
What the hell is this?
Earl, why is this happening?
I don't know, but it's making me want to beat somebody up.
Knock, knock.
Isn't this great?
Huh?
I'm giving you guys a sample of the CD I made so I could exchange gifts without participating in the Christmas industrial complex.
Why are you connected to my Sonos?
Aren't you supposed to be leaving?
Yeah, yeah.
I'll give you a ride.
Oh, no, no.
My flight's not until later.
Here.
Have a CD.
This is track four.
It's an Irish dystopian vision of Christmas in a drunk tank.
You are also going to love "Do They Know It's Christmas?"
Let me see that.
Aah!
Now, I'm going to make a real holiday playlist.
I'm talking about roasted chestnuts, angels singing, little drummer boys.
All of that magnificent
Hey, is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm just preparing his bath.
I've got to hydrate this bath flower and then I got to get that music going and then I have his massage oil that I'm preparing.
Oh, my God.
Mm.
- And then I'm almost ready to go.
- Okay.
You know, Dre and I used to just wash the babies in the kitchen sink.
So the same kitchen sink where you clean raw chicken.
- Yeah.
- That's the one.
- That's interesting.
- Uh-huh.
You know, Gigi, germs are actually really good for a baby's immune system.
I know that 'cause I've had four children, and I got another one on the way.
And I'm, uh...
I'm a doctor, so...
- Yeah.
- Yeah, she likes to say that.
Well, I'm...
I am, and everybody seems to forget.
What are those?
These are temperature beads.
And we just sit, and we wait for 10 minutes until the smile appears.
Okay.
What?
Gigi, you can use your elbow, and you just go like this.
And ooh, whoop!
Yep.
Bath is ready for the baby.
- Should I...?
- Yeah.
See?
It's delicate skin, so if it's comfortable for your skin, then it's comfortable for the baby.
Yeah, I still want to wait for the smiley face to come, though.
- Okay.
- I want to be safe.
Yes, you, uh...
That makes sense.
So you wait for the beads to smile.
I got another gadget for you there, though.
You just look right in here, look in there, and you see that you're doing too much.
Touché, boo.
Oh!
Found 'em!
Oh!
Sadness cookies.
The man does know his cookies.
100% pure uncut Double Stuf.
Wow.
Eating stolen cookies right in front of Bear on the Chair.
- What is that?
- Santa's eyes and ears.
What happened to the elf?
You've aged out of his jurisdiction.
You're on Bear on the Chair's turf now.
What are you talking about?
This isn't a thing.
Zach Labich didn't believe, either.
10-year-old punk did whatever he wanted.
He crossed Bear on the Chair, and let's just say that was his last Christmas.
- He died?
!
- He's dead to Santa.
But go ahead.
Have another stolen Oreo.
I'm not afraid of that bear.
Am I, Diane?
Um... no.
We are just going to put these away because we are full.
Hmm.
We are just fine.
I am so sorry we are running out on you like this.
Oh, no, it's fine.
Please, enjoy yourself.
Get out of here.
Go.
You know I got this.
Where you guys going?
Cher was supposed to perform at this charity event, and she pulled out at the last minute, and so they asked me to fill in.
Okay.
Who's going to watch the baby?
- I am.
- Oh.
Are you sure about that, Bow?
'Cause, you know, my mom's here.
Mama!
Can you come down here and help...
- Shh!
- Go.
Just go.
And I've got this.
I've got it.
- You sure?
Yeah.
- Yes.
And if she doesn't, my mom's here.
Well, look, if he gets fussy, just throw him in the mamaRoo and he'll conk right out.
And if that doesn't work, you just play "Rump Shaker."
I don't know why, but it works.
Guys, I have been a mom for 16 years.
I got this.
And my mom's here.
Thank you guys so much.
- I got it.
- Okay.
You be a good boy.
You got this, Bow?
I got this.
So, Zoey and I spent the afternoon sorting through all the Christmas ornaments she'd made as a kid.
Oh, this is my favorite one right here.
Santa's Little Zo-Zo.
I just get cuter with age, huh?
I'm not even being conceited.
This is hard proof.
Yeah, I can't believe your mother wanted me to throw all this out.
"Dre, it's a fire hazard.
Dre, it has lead in it.
Dre, the babies will choke on this."
How do you even deal with her?
You know, I'm barely hanging on.
Oh, remember that?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey!
The baby's crying!
Is he, Junior?
Why don't you use the fancy egg-shell thing?
Junior, I do not need gadgets to put a baby down.
I am a mother of four, and I have another one on the way, okay?
I'm a doctor, sweetheart.
- Okay.
- A doctor!
Damn it.
I really need to lead with that.
Okay, sweetheart.
I'm sorry.
This.
This is Christmas music.
The birth of our savior inspired the people who wrote classics, like "White Christmas" and "Silver Bells."
They were Jewish.
Well, all of these songs were written by Jewish composers.
Very musical people.
Also know how to finely slice a meat.
Even Nat King Cole's song?
Especially Nat King Cole's song.
You know what?
I'm gonna make my own Christmas playlist that'll blow both of yours out the water.
Mm.

Earl and I first made love to that song in 1971.
Didn't we, baby?

- Sure did.
- Hey!
You two are crazy.
Mariah Carey wrote that song in 1994.
Well, then, you're telling me that five-octave superstar Mariah Carey is a time traveler.
'Cause I heard that song when I was a child.
Trust me.

Hm.

Damn it, Junior!
You got it on the chair!
That was the first chair that I bought!
The best chair ever!
Your grandmother held you for the first time in that chair!
You owe your grandmother an apology!
And damn it, you owe us all an apology!
Oh, please, Dre.
You did it.
After years of trying, you finally burned the house down!
What were you thinking?
Popsicle sticks, tissue paper... it's just a pile of kindling.
And any idiot knows you're supposed to check the lights first!
No, this issue wasn't electric.
That tree was bone dry... a reminder that we cannot tame nature.
Shut up, Johan!
It wasn't that big of a deal!
Seems like a pretty big deal.
T-T-To be honest, we're lucky.
No one was injured.

No, Dre.
I don't think you ruined Christmas at all.

You're my family now.

No.
This is who I am.
I'm sorry I let you take the fall back there.
I deserved it.
I'm stupid.
I got too caught up in wanting to have one last perfect Christmas.
But instead,
I burned up all our memories.
Are you kidding me, Dad?
Those weren't all our memories.
Besides, this will be the most memorable Christmas we'll ever have.
You almost killed us.
I did, didn't I?
And this isn't gonna be our last Christmas together.
Next year will be the baby's first Christmas.
Do you think I'd miss that?
Come on.
Ohhhh.
I'm here, too, Dad.
Bring it in, son.
Bring it on in.
Aw, I love you guys.
Love you, too.
Love you, too.
Mm.
I'm so sorry I had to call you.
Bow, your house was on fire with my baby inside of it.
I think you may have legally had to call me.
I know, but the charity event and all the kids.
Oh, Bow, stop, stop.
I didn't go.
What?
What do you mean?
Did it get canceled?
Bow, Kids Town Help USA is not a real charity.
Me and Napoleon got the most expensive hotel room that we could find, and we took a nap.
So you made up a charity event so that you could take a nap?
No, I made up a charity because I am struggling being a mom.
What are you talking about?
Gigi, come on.
You're killing it.
I mean, you have everything.
You got the mamaRoo and the... the bath pearls that smile and...
I have everything because I am hoping that I will buy something that makes me feel like I know what the heck I'm doing.
Sweetheart, why didn't you just ask if you needed help?
Because when you try this hard to have a baby, you feel like you have no right to complain.
- Mm.
- Especially to "the" Rainbow Johnson.
Uh, are you talking about this Rainbow Johnson?
Oh, yeah.
Because Gigi, Luca cried the entire time that you were gone.
- Oh, no.
- Yes.
I was actually a little bit relieved that the house caught fire.
Just saying.
Yeah, okay.
I'm scared.
I'm scared.
It's been 10 years since I've had a baby in this house.
And I don't know what I'm doing.
You have four amazing kids.
They're fine.
Okay, so, if you don't have this down, what the hell am I supposed to do?
You're the perfect mom.
I hate that expression so much.
What, everybody else gets to have flaws, and moms have to be perfect?
Oh, God.
It's been so long.
My God.
And I'm older, and kids are...
Babies.
Babies are stronger now.
Like weed.
I'm really sorry I was so judgy.
Yeah.
Here is the deal.
Okay.
From now on, we are gonna support each other.
I like that.
- Because we are amazing.
- Mm!
We should all support each other, but we can't.
'Cause you two are failures.
Come on with Grandma.
Every day, Gigi.
Every day.
Things are rarely perfect.
Whether you're trying to find the perfect song worrying about the perfect behavior missing the perfect flight.
And sometimes, you get scared you're not the perfect parent.
Point is, you hardly remember the perfect things.
But when perfect goes wrong, those are the memories that last forever.
Dre.
This has got to stop.
This is my insomnia cupcake.
Really, Dre?
Those are my sleepy-time Cheetos because the sugar in my cupcake keeps me up at night.
That's disgusting.
What else do you have hidden here, huh?
- Nothing.
- What else?
Uh, that's soap.
And that's floss.
Okay.
Okay.

Dre:
The Johnson family loves Christmas.
And for us, Christmas kicks off the moment Bow starts washing dishes after Thanksgiving.
From that moment on, it's a countdown to our favorite holiday of the year when a joyous and inclusive spirit runs through the house.
This year is extra special because of the pleasant surprise of my aged wife's fertility.
And to top it off, my favorite person/international pop star was coming to stay with us with the baby she'd wished for for so long.
And my least favorite person/ international mooch was leaving, but not fast enough.
Hey.
That's my...
That's my...
Okay.
All right.

Besides, this will be the most memorable Christmas we'll ever have.
You almost killed us.
I did, didn't I?
And this isn't gonna be our last Christmas together.
Next year will be the baby's first Christmas.

Bow, your house was on fire with my baby inside of it.
I think you may have legally had to call me.
I know, but [sighs] the charity event and all the kids.
Oh, Bow, stop, stop.
I didn't go.
What?
What do you mean?
Did it get canceled?
Bow, Kids Town Help USA is not a real charity.
Me and Napoleon got the most expensive hotel room that we could find, and we took a nap.
So you made up a charity event so that you could take a nap?
No, I made up a charity because I am struggling being a mom.
What are you talking about?
Gigi, come on.
You're killing it.
I mean, you have everything.
You got the mamaRoo and the... the bath pearls that smile and...
I have everything because I am hoping that I will buy something that makes me feel like I know what the heck I'm doing.
Sweetheart, why didn't you just ask if you needed help?
Because when you try this hard to have a baby, you feel like you have no right to complain.
- Mm.
- Especially to "the" Rainbow Johnson.
Uh, are you talking about this Rainbow Johnson?
- Oh, yeah.
- Because Gigi, Luca cried the entire time that you were gone.
- Oh, no.
- Yes.
I was actually a little bit relieved that the house caught fire.
Just saying.

- Yeah, okay.
I'm scared.
I'm scared.
It's been 10 years since I've had a baby in this house.

You have four amazing kids.
They're fine.
Okay, so, if you don't have this down, what the hell am I supposed to do?

The Johnson family loves Christmas.
And for us, Christmas kicks off the moment Bow starts washing dishes after Thanksgiving.
From that moment on, it's a countdown to our favorite holiday of the year when a joyous and inclusive spirit runs through the house.
This year is extra special because of the pleasant surprise of my aged wife's fertility.
And to top it off, my favorite person/international pop star was coming to stay with us with the baby she'd wished for for so long.
And my least favorite person/ international mooch was leaving, but not fast enough.
Hey.
That's my...
That's my...
Okay.
All right.
But there was something bittersweet about this holiday, too.
My firstborn, Zoey, is a senior in high school, and she's about to leave the nest.
Dad, you're gazing at me again.
Please don't go to college!
Hey, what's happening, girl?
I like your new room.
Hey, what are you watching? "TRL"?
Dad, don't.
The friend thing... it's weird.
Yeah, I felt that.
Okay, look.
This is your last Christmas before you go to college, and I want to spend some quality time with you.
I was hoping we could make some memories, do the greatest hits... perfect tree, cocoa, matching PJs.
We've never done matching PJs.
This is our last chance.
It'll get weird soon.
Hold on, Dad.
If you wanted to do Christmas stuff, just tell me that.
I love Christmas.
Let's hang.
[Exhales sharply]
[Voice breaking] We're gonna hang?

Let's hang.
We're gonna hang?
Thank you.
Should I look away while you get yourself together?
- Yes, please!
Please look away!
- Okay, looking away.
I don't want you to remember me like this!
Tell me when you're done.
Nope.
Nope.
Ooh, I think this is for us.
Ooh, I bet it's a trampoline.
Without looking at it, it is not.
- What are you two doing?
- Laundry.
You don't need to lie to him.
He has no power.
Well, a certain elf watching from a distance does.
And he will be very interested in letting Santa know about these violations.
Well, the elf isn't in this room.
So by his law, none of this ever happened, so nobody saw nothing.
You won't get away with this.
You think that magical cross-legged sentry is a joke?
I only see one joke in here.
It's me, isn't it?
It's always you.
Aww.
Aren't you the cutest?
Oh, my goodness.
You're so cute, I just want to put your foot in my mouth.
I'm gonna do it.
Ahhh!
- No, uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- She's touching...
C-Can...
Can you, um, not put my baby's feet into the dirtiest part of your body?
- Oh.
- Uh, maybe we just play pretend, like air bites, like, nyah-yah-yah.
- Ah-yah-yah.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- It's just as fun.
- Is it?
- Yeah!
It's even more fun because then my baby can still live.
Oh!
Okay.
Look at all the padding around the baby's head.
Looks like he's about to blast off into outer space.
We didn't even have a car seat for Dre.
- What?
- He just rode shotgun and held my cigarettes for me.
I've got the burns and the asthma to prove it.
Ain't nobody wheeze like my baby.
- What is that?
- Oh, it's a sleep monitor.
It lets us know if the baby isn't breathing or if his heart stops or if somebody tries to snatch him.
- Ah.
- It's a little glitchy, though, so seven, eight times a day, we think our baby died.
Other than that, it's awesome.
Wow.
I forgot how silly new parents are.
Silly or not, this baby has not cried once.
Well, of course you haven't cried.
With all the beeping and the blinking and the padding and the heating, you don't have any time for your own little thoughts, do you, sweetheart?
Well, we need to tell Auntie Bow Bow that Mommy has read all the blogs and knows exactly what babies need.
Maybe Auntie Bow Bow is a little out of touch touch.
- Oh.
- Oh, come on, Ruby.
Baby can't even talk, and they think he can clearly track a passive-aggressive conversation like a divorce arbitrator.
You know, I miss Gene.
Oh, yeah.
Gene was good.
All right, here we go.
Heading to the garage to find our Christmas ornaments.
2016, Zoey and Dre!
Okay, I'm gonna switch to slo-mo.
All right.
Ugh!
I can't switch to slowmo while I'm filming, so you're gonna have to fake it.
Okay?
Go!
This is the best Christmas ever.
You guys filming?
Damn it, Junior!
Delete.
I'm trying to spend some time with my child.
Okay, then.
I'll be fast.
I'd like to bring up the twins' behavior of late.
They are making a mockery of the elf!
They're running amok!
Do you even know what they had for breakfast?
Don't listen to him!
We had a bowl of cereal and fresh fruit.
Uh, next to two slices of toast,
- and a glass of OJ to wash it all down.
- All down.
Lies!
They're just describing a balanced breakfast they saw on television!
- You know what they really had?
- Junior.
That cake you hid in the vegetable crisper.
Hold on.
My shame cake?
- Torched it.
- Ah.
Get out of my sight.
And if you even look at my sadness cookies...
You fix this, Junior.
You fix this now.
I swear to God.
You better not let them two ruin Zoey's Christmas.
You mean all of our Christmases, ri...
You heard what I said.
How long do I need to keep my finger here?
What does it matter, Earl?
Your drinking hand's still free.
Yeah, well, when you're right, you're right.
What the hell is this?
Earl, why is this happening?
I don't know, but it's making me want to beat somebody up.
Knock, knock.
Isn't this great?
Huh?
I'm giving you guys a sample of the CD I made so I could exchange gifts without participating in the Christmas industrial complex.
Why are you connected to my Sonos?
Aren't you supposed to be leaving?
Yeah, yeah.
I'll give you a ride.
Oh, no, no.
My flight's not until later.
Here.
Have a CD.
This is track four.
It's an Irish dystopian vision of Christmas in a drunk tank.
You are also going to love "Do They Know It's Christmas?"
Let me see that.
Now, I'm going to make a real holiday playlist.
I'm talking about roasted chestnuts, angels singing, little drummer boys.
All of that magnificent [bleep].
Hey, is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm just preparing his bath.
I've got to hydrate this bath flower and then I got to get that music going and then I have his massage oil that I'm preparing.
Oh, my God.
Mm.
- And then I'm almost ready to go.
- Okay.
You know, Dre and I used to just wash the babies in the kitchen sink.
So the same kitchen sink where you clean raw chicken.
Yeah.
That's the one.
- That's interesting.
- Uh-huh.
You know, Gigi, germs are actually really good for a baby's immune system.
I know that 'cause I've had four children, and I got another one on the way.
And I'm, uh...
I'm a doctor, so...
- Yeah.
- Yeah, she likes to say that.
Well, I'm...
I am, and everybody seems to forget.
What are those?
These are temperature beads.
And we just sit, and we wait for 10 minutes until the smile appears.
- Okay.
- What?
Gigi, you can use your elbow, and you just go like this.
And ooh, whoop!
Yep.
Bath is ready for the baby.
- Should I...?
- Yeah.
See?
It's delicate skin, so if it's comfortable for your skin, then it's comfortable for the baby.
Yeah, I still want to wait for the smiley face to come, though.
- Okay.
- I want to be safe.
Yes, you, uh...
That makes sense.
So you wait for the beads to smile.
I got another gadget for you there, though.
You just look right in here, look in there, and you see that you're doing too much.
Touché, boo.
Oh!
Found 'em!
Oh!
Sadness cookies.
The man does know his cookies.
100% pure uncut Double Stuf.
Wow.
Eating stolen cookies right in front of Bear on the Chair.
- What is that?
- Santa's eyes and ears.
What happened to the elf?
You've aged out of his jurisdiction.
You're on Bear on the Chair's turf now.
What are you talking about?
This isn't a thing.
Zach Labich didn't believe, either.
10-year-old punk did whatever he wanted.
He crossed Bear on the Chair, and let's just say that was his last Christmas.
- He died?
!
- He's dead to Santa.
But go ahead.
Have another stolen Oreo.
I'm not afraid of that bear.
Am I, Diane?
Um... no.
We are just going to put these away because we are full.
Hmm.
We are just fine.
I am so sorry we are running out on you like this.
Oh, no, it's fine.
Please, enjoy yourself.
Get out of here.
Go.
You know I got this.
Where you guys going?
Cher was supposed to perform at this charity event, and she pulled out at the last minute, and so they asked me to fill in.
Okay.
Who's going to watch the baby?
- I am.
- Oh.
Are you sure about that, Bow?
'Cause, you know, my mom's here.
- Mama!
Can you come down here and help...
- Shh!
Go.
Just go.
And I've got this.
I've got it.
- You sure?
- Yes.
And if she doesn't, my mom's here.
Well, look, if he gets fussy, just throw him in the mamaRoo and he'll conk right out.
And if that doesn't work, you just play "Rump Shaker."
I don't know why, but it works.
Guys, I have been a mom for 16 years.
I got this.
And my mom's here.
Thank you guys so much.
- I got it.
- Okay.
You be a good boy.
You got this, Bow?
I got this.
So, Zoey and I spent the afternoon sorting through all the Christmas ornaments she'd made as a kid.
Oh, this is my favorite one right here.
Santa's Little Zo-Zo.
I just get cuter with age, huh?
I'm not even being conceited.
This is hard proof.
Yeah, I can't believe your mother wanted me to throw all this out.
"Dre, it's a fire hazard.
Dre, it has lead in it.
Dre, the babies will choke on this."
How do you even deal with her?
You know, I'm barely hanging on.
Oh, remember that?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey!
The baby's crying!
Is he, Junior?
Why don't you use the fancy egg-shell thing?
Junior, I do not need gadgets to put a baby down.
I am a mother of four, and I have another one on the way, okay?
I'm a doctor, sweetheart.
- Okay.
- A doctor!
Damn it.
I really need to lead with that.
Okay, sweetheart.
I'm sorry.
This.
This is Christmas music.
The birth of our savior inspired the people who wrote classics, like "White Christmas" and "Silver Bells."
They were Jewish.
Well, all of these songs were written by Jewish composers.
Very musical people.
Also know how to finely slice a meat.
Even Nat King Cole's song?
Especially Nat King Cole's song.
You know what?
I'm gonna make my own Christmas playlist that'll blow both of yours out the water.
Mm.
You do that, Earl.
So... it's just us.
And it appears we're... under the mistletoe.
Uh, I have a cold sore.
So do I, darling.
So do I.
Ooh.
Oh!
I got you in my cross hairs!
Die!
Die, you dirty...
Um, I mean, pass away after a long, fulfilling life in your sleep on your own terms.
- Yeah.
- Do you think he bought it?
Just turn and walk away.
It's almost too easy.
Damn.
Yeah.
Soul Glo needs to put that on his playlist.
Mm-hmm.
- I grew up on songs like this.
- Mm-hmm.
Like, uh, "Every Day Will be like a Holiday"
or, uh, uh, "All I Want for Christmas is You."
You did not grow up on a Mariah Carey song from 1994.
Shut up, boy.
You don't know what the hell you talking about.
That song came out in the '50s.
He's right!
Earl and I first made love to that song in 1971.
- Didn't we, baby?
Remember?
- Sure did.
- Hey!
- You two are crazy.
Mariah Carey wrote that song in 1994.
Well, then, you're telling me that five-octave superstar Mariah Carey is a time traveler.
'Cause I heard that song when I was a child.
Trust me.
If she was a time traveler, she'd go back in time and tighten up that prenup with Nick Cannon.
Okay, come on.
You're...
You're in your egg.
You had a bottle.
I-I put you in the bath.
I even waited until the pearls smiled.
Okay, are you seriously gonna make me do this?
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay.
I'll try anything.
Seriously? "Rump Shaker"?
Are you kidding me?
Okay, okay.
I'll put it back on.
I'll put it back on.
It's coming back.
Here it is.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Okay.
Okay.
Hold on.
Hi.
Gigi.
How's it going?
Oh, great!
Can you believe it?
Luca actually fell asleep in my arms.
- Sounds like he's crying.
- Nope, nope.
Uh, it's just, uh, um, a documentary that I-I'm watching about helicopter parenting and how the the kids get so sad that the parents are always calling and checking up on them.
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Everything is totally fine.
Everything is fine.
He doesn't even know you're gone.
Okay.
Can I at least say goo...
I'll tell him for you!
Okay.
Bye, girl!
You're a monster.
No.
No, I-I-I...
Wow.
I think we put up every single one of my ornaments since kindergarten.
- Mm-hmm.
- So, should we light this baby up?
Let's do it.
Hey, everybody!
Come down!
We're about to light the tree!
You extinguished that tree's light the moment you cut it down.
And why are you still here?
Hm.
My favorite.
Mm!
I mean, why do I need a will?
All I ask is that you're fair and give your siblings whatever it is you don't want.
Okay?
Oh, got to go.
Got to go.
You guys ready to see this?
Oh, my God.
Really?
He is listening to a TED Talk, not "Rump Shaker."
Are you good at anything?
All right, get your cameras ready for Zoey and Dre's...
and no one else's...
Perfect Christmas 2016.
Hurtful.
- What the...
- What is that?
My baby!
So, so hurtful!
Whoo!
That's the last of it.
I saved the house!
Damn it, Junior!
You got it on the chair!
That was the first chair that I bought!
The best chair ever!
Your grandmother held you for the first time in that chair!
You owe your grandmother an apology!
And damn it, you owe us all an apology!
Oh, please, Dre.
You did it.
After years of trying, you finally burned the house down!
What were you thinking?
Popsicle sticks, tissue paper... it's just a pile of kindling.
And any idiot knows you're supposed to check the lights first!
No, this issue wasn't electric.
That tree was bone dry... a reminder that we cannot tame nature.
Shut up, Johan!
It wasn't that big of a deal!
- Seems like a pretty big deal.
- T-T-To be honest, we're lucky.
No one was injured.
Except the chair that Junior ruined.
Boo, Junior!
Boo, Junior!
Come on, everybody!
Boo!
No, Dad!
Not this time!
You ruined Christmas.
What?
- That's my...
- Yeah, you tell him, boy.
Mother Nature wins again.
You broke my heart.
Unbelievable.
It's a waste of a perfectly good tree, son.
It's gonna take a while to come back from this one.
My God.
Hi, backup shame cake.
You don't think I ruined Christmas, do you?
No, Dre.
I don't think you ruined Christmas at all.
I love you.
I love you, too.
You're my family now.
Do you need a minute to pull yourself together?
No.
This is who I am.
I'm sorry I let you take the fall back there.
I deserved it.
I'm stupid.
I got too caught up in wanting to have one last perfect Christmas.
But instead,
I burned up all our memories.
Are you kidding me, Dad?
Those weren't all our memories.
Besides, this will be the most memorable Christmas we'll ever have.
You almost killed us.
I did, didn't I?
And this isn't gonna be our last Christmas together.
Next year will be the baby's first Christmas.
Do you think I'd miss that?
Come on.
Ohhhh.
I'm here, too, Dad.
Bring it in, son.
Bring it on in.
Aw, I love you guys.
- Love you, too.
- Love you, too.
Mm.
I'm so sorry I had to call you.
Bow, your house was on fire with my baby inside of it.
I think you may have legally had to call me.
I know, but the charity event and all the kids.
Oh, Bow, stop, stop.
I didn't go.
What?
What do you mean?
Did it get canceled?
Bow, Kids Town Help USA is not a real charity.
Me and Napoleon got the most expensive hotel room that we could find, and we took a nap.
So you made up a charity event so that you could take a nap?
No, I made up a charity because I am struggling being a mom.
What are you talking about?
Gigi, come on.
You're killing it.
I mean, you have everything.
You got the mamaRoo and the... the bath pearls that smile and...
I have everything because I am hoping that I will buy something that makes me feel like I know what the heck I'm doing.
Sweetheart, why didn't you just ask if you needed help?
Because when you try this hard to have a baby, you feel like you have no right to complain.
- Mm.
- Especially to "the" Rainbow Johnson.
Uh, are you talking about this Rainbow Johnson?
- Oh, yeah.
- Because Gigi, Luca cried the entire time that you were gone.
- Oh, no.
- Yes.
I was actually a little bit relieved that the house caught fire.
Just saying.
Yeah, okay.
I'm scared.
I'm scared.
It's been 10 years since I've had a baby in this house.
And I don't know what I'm doing.
You have four amazing kids.
They're fine.
Okay, so, if you don't have this down, what the hell am I supposed to do?
You're the perfect mom.
I hate that expression so much.
What, everybody else gets to have flaws, and moms have to be perfect?
Oh, God.
It's been so long.
My God.
And I'm older, and kids are...
Babies.
Babies are stronger now.
Like weed.
- I'm really sorry I was so judgy.
- Yeah.
- Here is the deal.
- Okay.
From now on, we are gonna support each other.
I like that.
- Because we are amazing.
- Mm!
We should all support each other, but we can't.
'Cause you two are failures.
Come on with Grandma.
Every day, Gigi.
Every day.
Things are rarely perfect.
Whether you're trying to find the perfect song worrying about the perfect behavior missing the perfect flight.
And sometimes, you get scared you're not the perfect parent.
Point is, you hardly remember the perfect things.
But when perfect goes wrong, those are the memories that last forever.
Dre.
This has got to stop.
This is my insomnia cupcake.
Really, Dre?
Those are my sleepy-time Cheetos because the sugar in my cupcake keeps me up at night.
That's disgusting.
What else do you have hidden here, huh?
- Nothing.
- What else?
Uh, that's soap.
And that's floss.
Okay.
Okay.
Those are my marshmallows for my morning time s'mores.
And that is it.
Aw, man, you have a problem, dude.
- I do not have a problem.
- Yes, you do.
I do not have a problem.
She will never find you.
Previously on The Affair...
Those of you who knew my dad will-will know that we didn't always get along so well, but I-I loved him.
- That was a lovely service.
- You're coming back to the house though, aren't you?
I don't know.
Do you think we should come back to the house?
Only if you want to.
How was teaching this week?
You have any fun?
Not really.
I thought it was really elegant, Audrey.
I thought it was very dull, unless it was supposed to be a satire.
Was it?
Hello.
You just popped up out of nowhere.
Bienvenue, Monsieur Solloway.
Je suis Professeur Le Gall.
I'm just so pleased to finally meet you.
I feel that you and I are kindred spirits.
- Silence is violence!
- Silence is violence!
- Was there a rape?
- I'm not sure.
I thought I'd come to America and have a grand adventure, and instead it's...
Instead, it's New Jersey.
Noah, are you all right?
Yeah.
I'm okay.
Officer Santos, who knows I'm here?
What do you mean?
I'm just wondering if it's possible for anybody still inside Fishkill to find out my current address.
Why are you asking, Solloway?
Never mind.
It's... it's not important.
Aah!
It's a lovely day, Professor.
Do you have anything planned?
Just preparing dinner for a few people tonight.
Coq au vin?
We shall see.
Professor Le Gall?
We don't want to bother you.
We just wanted to say that we're loving your class.
Yeah.
I thought medieval French literature was gonna be boring, but you're not boring at all.
Well, thank you.
I believe love is never boring, even 900 years ago.
What are you reading, Professor?
This I'm afraid is very boring.
Andreas Capellanus.
It's part of my research.
Are you enjoying your time here?
Are you glad you came?
It's very exciting to be in America.
"Lancelot, ou le Chevalier de la Charrette."
Come prepared with questions.
- Okay.
- Of course.
Bye.
Speaking French.
How can you possibly call this an ambiguous case?
She got into bed with him of her own accord.
It doesn't matter.
She did not want to give Nicholas Perry a blowjob.
Are you saying that you're okay with forcing a woman against her will to give you a blowjob?
For fuck's sake, Audrey.
Of course I'm not saying that, but this specific lady gave no indication that she didn't want what he was giving her.
I'm sorry, Mike.
Were you there?
She admits it herself.
She does.
She admits she swallowed.
What?
Come on.
Grow up.
Could we not just at least maybe... maybe consider the idea that she was on board here?
Mike, every two minutes someone is sexually assaulted in our country.
Do you know how often the perpetrator is punished?
- Less than one percent.
- Thanks.
Thank you.
Yes.
And do you know why?
Because it's because of this exact conversation, because we don't believe our victims.
We make them feel like they asked for it.
Okay.
I'm just trying to have a dialogue, but if you're just gonna recite a Planned Parenthood pamphlet at me...
My God.
What's the point to it?
I can't believe I ever slept with you.
Okay, all right.
So that's what this little tirade is really about, right?
Right, Audrey?
Admit it.
What I will admit, Cornwall, is that I wanted to fuck you at the time, and I regretted it after, but because I'm a cognizant human being who is able to determine and articulate my own desire,
I did not bring rape charges against you, even after I found out what a giant turd you are.
But if we had had sex against my will, that would have been different.
Do you understand that distinction?
Yes.
I understand the distinction.
Do you think I'm capable of understanding that distinction?
Frankly, right now I'm just terrified of you, Audrey.
My God.
You're a fucking dick.
Whoa!
Come on.
It's the coq au vin.
I'm sorry, Professor.
I'm sorry.
I just... he's...
I-I can't.
I can't... please tell me it's not like this in France.
It's not at all like this in France.
It's much worse.
- What?
- Yes.
I'm afraid the whole topic is still not taken seriously.
Oui?
C'est bon.
You're very lucky to be surrounded by such enlightened chaps such as myself and Blake.
Professor.
It's curious, though.
In this case, the two parties agree on what happened.
She gave him a blowjob.
He didn't force her to.
- No, he didn't.
- But they don't agree on the meaning of the act.
He said she wanted to.
She said she didn't.
Is that right?
- She didn't consent.
- But he didn't force her.
- No.
- But she didn't consent.
That's very confusing, isn't it?
- No.
Not to me.
- Yes.
I see that it's quite clear to you.
But I live some decades now, and there's a lot about what I want that I don't understand and that I don't expect a lover to understand.
Professor Le Gall, please tell me that you see the problem here.
I see problems, I do.
But I think we all live in our own version of the truth, and thus we are prone to terrible miscommunications.
Perhaps she was trying to communicate one thing, and he read something else.
That's possible, isn't it?
Yes.
Of course it's possible.
That's why the university needs to establish and enforce a mandate of verbal consent.
I understand how such a thing would protect the university, but I don't see how sex itself would survive.
Why not?
Because I am afraid the articulate is the enemy of the erotic.
Isn't the whole point that you don't know what your lover will do next?
That you give yourself over to a sensory experience that you haven't planned and can't control?
The reason I like sex is that I can finally, for a moment, turn off my neurotic mind and just be consumed.
If I give my lover permission... yes, no, touch me, not there... don't I undermine the potency of his desire?
I'm sorry.
You're all looking at me like I'm crazy.
Do I sound crazy?
No.
Well, Professor Le Gall is a love expert.
Professor Le Gall is a courtly love expert.
What's your point?
Besides the fact that this manner of thinking has been out of date for 600 years, was written entirely by men wherein the women served as the object of male desire, but had no voice of her own.
So perhaps we can forgive Professor Le Gall for assuming that the articulation of female desire is somehow anathema to sexual satisfaction.
But with all due respect, Professor, I would argue that she simply never learned the appropriate language, because I can tell you exactly how I want you to fuck me.
- Believe me, I remember.
- And Lila can tell you exactly how she wants you to fuck her.
Hard.
And if you give me 45 minutes,
I can teach Professor Le Gall to tell you exactly how she would like you to fuck her, though you would not be given the opportunity in a million years.
Forgive me.
I think I hear the soufflé falling.
- I have to have you right now.
- Mike, no.
Speaking French
- No, no, no.
- No, no.
- Anybody could walk in.
Who gives a fuck?
Come on.
No.
Mike, no.
Professor...
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.
You... you didn't.
Yes, I did.
Of course I did.
I behaved like a total asshole.
I just... it's Noah Solloway.
He just makes me so agitated.
I mean, I didn't know he was gonna be here.
I mean, why did you invite him?
We bumped into each other on the quad, and he seemed rather lonely, so...
I'm taking his class.
Did I tell you that?
- You didn't.
- Well, I am, and he's a complete dick.
I mean an utter asshole, and all I can do is think about fucking him.
So do it.
Seriously, Audrey.
What's stopping you?
- Jesus!
- That he's your professor?
That he's twice your age?
That he's an ex-felon?
But you're so liberated.
My God, Mike, why are you so obsessed with me?
- Obsessed with you?
- Yes.
I'm trying to have a private conversation with my professor.
Do you mind?
Yeah, I do mind, Audrey, because I was here first.
Today romantic love has replaced Christianity as a doctrine for enforcing the ideal of monogamy, and the French realize all this is unrealistic.
What happened to Noah?
Did he leave?
No.
He went upstairs.
He said he wasn't feeling well.
Lila, tell me you agree with me.
The French recognize marriage for what it is:
A social construct created to protect property.
I agree with that...
with that one statement out of everything you said tonight.
Just don't be that happy.
You... you like... you just like disagreeing.
Hi.
Hello.
I was...
I was looking for a quiet space.
I hope you don't mind.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
I haven't been around that many people in a long time.
Takes some getting used to again.
Are they always like that?
The students?
You tell me.
It's your country.
I am just a visiting professor.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
I'm here because the library claims to have unearthed certain pages from a rare manuscript that I happen to be an expert on.
Really?
What is it?
Les Esches d'Amour.
The Chess of Love.
It was written in the 14th century.
And this library thinks they have some missing pages.
Do they?
I'm not sure yet, but if I had to wager a guess,
I'd say no.
How long have they got you for?
I'll teach until the end of the semester.
I've promised my husband I'd be home for Christmas.
- Long time to be away.
- Yes, but they gave me this generous residency, and this house, and the cutest little red car.
I love that car.
Is this your...
Yes.
C'est Etienne.
With my daughter, Sabine, many years ago.
She's all grown up now.
She a medievalist, like her mom?
No, but my husband is.
A very famous one.
A famous medievalist?
Yes.
In certain circles.
That's how we met.
I was his student.
Do you think it's true what Audrey was saying downstairs?
What was Audrey saying?
That she knows exactly what she wants from her body.
From men.
From everything.
I think Audrey is...
I think Audrey is very young.
Yes.
But I don't ever remember feeling that confident, even when I was her age.
Maybe she really does know exactly what she wants.
Maybe this younger generation simply understands themselves better.
Maybe the uncertainty that I've always assumed is integral to eroticism... doesn't exist for them.
Are you asking me if I think the kids downstairs are having better sex than you or I?
Do you?
No.
But they may be having more of it.
- I'd...
I'd better go.
- No!
Stay.
What?
No, no.
I-I'm sorry.
I'll let myself out.
Where were you, Julie?
I still don't know what to do about Noah Solloway.
I'm just gonna fuck him and get it over with, and then I'll stop thinking about him.
But if you sleep with him, you'll never actually know what he thinks of your work.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Both speaking French.
Yeah, of course.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Noah?
Noah?
Noah?
Noah?
Speaking French
murmuring in French
Noah, I'm here.
Any medical history?
Any allergies?
- No.
I don't know.
- Is he taking any medication?
I don't know.
I'm not his wife.
- Hello.
- Sabine?
Oui, ma cherie.
Mon amour.
Noah!
Noah!
Noah!
Noah!
Hey.
Come on.
Come on.
Stay with me.
Stay with me.
Hey, come on.
A 50-year-old male with penetrating trauma to the left neck.
Six-inch blade.
He's 80 over 40 and tachy.
Coags and CBC are pending.
He's typed and crossed with four units on standby.
We're prepping OR 4.
We're still trying to reach his next of kin.
All clear.
Shocking.
All clear.
Solloway?
Hey.
Sorry it took me a while to get here.
They never let us know who's coming through.
I hope that Warden Hagan wasn't too much of a hard-ass.
He can really lay down the law, but, he's actually a good guy, once you get to know him.
- No.
He was fine.
Thanks.
- Good.
You don't remember me, do you?
You... you look...
you look familiar.
- I...
- No, I don't.
John Gunther.
I'm from Bloomsburg.
Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania?
No shit.
We've actually met.
It was high school.
Yeah.
Swim meets.
Remember All-County '85?
You took the whole thing.
It was impressive.
I was just in the back somewhere drowning.
Sure.
Yeah.
I...
Yeah.
You don't remember me.
It's okay.
I've been following your career.
Pretty impressive stuff.
Well, it hasn't exactly worked out that well for me.
Shit happens.
Hey, look.
I'm, gonna keep an eye out for you, all right?
Thank you.
You know, over the years, I've wanted to reach out to you, but I just never really... but here you are.
Fucking Noah Solloway.
Okay.
Mr. Solloway?
Mr. Solloway?
- How do you feel?
- Terrible.
Well, these should help with that.
That's one Zofran plus two Percocet for pain.
Here.
Let me lift your head up.
There you go.
Can you tell me what the date is today?
September 24th.
That's right.
Do you know where you are?
- In the hospital.
- Do you know why?
- I had surgery.
- Very good.
Well, you're lucky to be alive, Mr. Solloway.
Wait.
What happened?
What... wh...
- How did I get here?
- I don't know all the details, but your wife may be able to tell you.
My wife?
She just stepped out to use the ladies'.
She'll be so happy to see you awake.
Wait.
Who... who are you...
who are you talking about?
Can you tell me your wife's name, Mr. Solloway?
Alison Bailey, but she... we're not together.
- Is she here?
- No.
I believe she said a different name.
- Helen.
- You're awake.
- Told me you were sleeping.
- I just woke up.
- You look okay.
He looks okay.
- Feel like shit, actually.
- Who told you I was here?
- Nina.
I couldn't believe it.
- I'm sorry.
- I almost thought that she
- was joking.
- You said you were the wife?
- She's my ex.
- Have the police arrived yet?
- Police?
- They really
- should have been here by now.
- Why?
- Who did this to you?
- Who did what to me?
Who stabbed you, Noah?
What... what is she talking about?
- Did I get stabbed?
- Why doesn't he know that?
I'm-I'm very sorry, Mr. Solloway.
You were attacked by someone with a knife.
You bled profusely.
They took you to surgery where Dr. Quittner closed the artery off.
- Jesus.
- You were very lucky.
The blade missed your airway, and your jugular vein, and just nicked your artery.
- Who did this to you?
- I don't know.
I-I-I don't remember.
- You can't remember anything?
- No.
Well, why not?
I mean why can't he remember?
I'm not sure, Mrs. Solloway.
When is the surgeon coming back?
'Cause I'd like to speak to him.
They found you in some student's apartment?
I'm renting it.
And you really don't remember anything?
I remember washing dishes late at night...
Well, why were you washing dishes so late?
Could this have been an accident?
- Maybe I f-fell or something.
- It was a knife, Noah.
A fucking knife sliced into your throat.
- Okay.
- Are you sure that he doesn't have any brain damage or something?
He had a CAT scan, and the result came back normal.
Somebody tried to kill you.
Do you understand?
Can we come in now?
Shit, Dad.
Are you all right?
Hey, kids.
I've been better.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Does this thing have a massage feature?
Your dad's right.
He's going to be fine.
He should be home in a couple of days.
He doesn't live with us.
Um, Mr. Solloway, I need to ask you a few more questions.
I'm sorry.
And then I'll let you rest.
Can you tell me, do you have a history of any previous surgeries?
He had his appendix out ten years ago.
That's it, unless you count his wisdom teeth.
- No.
- I think you were what,
- 25 or 26?
- It's not relevant.
- What about medications?
- No.
He doesn't...
- Are you currently taking any?
- He hates medication.
He won't even take Tylenol when he has a fever.
- I'm on Vicodin.
- What?
- Dosage?
- 7.5 milligrams.
I had a shoulder injury.
I'm... the pain gets pretty bad.
Is that getting worse?
Who's treating you?
- I have a prescription, Helen.
- From who?
That's all I need for now.
Is there anything I can get for you, Mr. Solloway?
- No.
Thank you very much.
- Can we go now?
That's a good idea.
Your father could use some rest.
Can you bring your sister down to the cafeteria and get her something to eat and I'll meet you guys there, okay?
But I don't have any money.
Nothing too sweet.
Could you get a few more blankets?
It's freezing in here.
Sure.
- What happened to you?
- Helen, I really need to sleep.
You can stay, but just please stop talking.
And I'll kill you!
I'll show you!
Hey, hey, hey!
Break it up!
Break it up!
Split it up, all right?
You're both going to the hole next time!
Relax!
- Hey, Solloway.
- Hey.
Congratulations.
Happy six months.
Thanks.
It's transparent.
Right.
Yeah.
See if you got a shank, or contraband, or whatever, you know.
It's good, right?
- It's great.
- Yeah.
Can you believe it?
There's a place in Jersey imports these things.
Takes, like, months to get here.
Prisoner got out last week and just left it behind, so I thought that maybe, you know, you could...
I don't know how to thank you, man.
Use it.
- I will.
- All right.
Yeah.
Hey, I ordered your book.
Am I gonna like it?
Let me know.
I will do.
What, you thought I forgot you?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Mr. Solloway.
- Yeah?
- I'm Detective Stanton.
- Detective Romero.
How you feeling?
You all right?
Not really.
My head's pounding.
Is that nurse anywhere?
Um, she'll be back in a few minutes.
Do you feel up to answering a few questions in the meantime?
Go ahead.
Ask.
Don't think I'll be able to help you much.
I don't remember a thing.
Well, can you say what you do remember?
I was at the sink washing dishes, and then I'm here being told someone stabbed me in the neck.
And you have no idea who might have done that to you?
- No.
- Look.
We've been by the apartment, and we got our guys over there now.
And so far we've seen no signs of a forced entry, so would you happen to recall whether or not you locked the door?
I might have or not.
I couldn't... why?
Do you think this was a robbery?
- Unlikely.
- Yeah.
Not with the nature of the injury.
The fact that he went for the neck, I mean, that tells us that the assailant meant to do real harm.
- Yeah.
Well, he succeeded.
- Mr. Solloway, we're treating this attack as an attempted homicide.
Jesus.
What the fuck?
What about the kid?
- What kid?
- The frat guy.
Regers or the guy I sublet...
- Dan?
Dan Regan?
- Right.
Could they have been after him?
Mr. Regan's at the station.
He's cooperating.
Yeah, I mean, plus, you know, like you say, he's a 20-year-old Delta Phi kid, and you just finished three years at Fishkill.
You're a public figure.
So if either one of you was gonna be targeted, we're gonna lean towards you.
I mean, would you agree with that?
- Fine.
- Try to think then.
Is there anyone out there that's got a gripe with you?
Might want to harm you?
What's your relationship like with Cole Lockhart these days?
- We don't have one.
- When's the last time you had any contact with Mr. Lockhart?
I don't know.
Years ago.
The trial, I guess.
- Brother's murder trial?
- Right.
Yeah, well, between what happened to his brother and the affair with his wife,
Cole is definitely a person of interest.
But, um, what about Alison Bailey?
What about her?
You're still married.
- Yes.
- But estranged.
Wow.
You guys know everything about me, don't you?
Does she still have any feelings left for you?
How the fuck do I know?
Well, what we're trying to figure out is if she'd have a problem with you seeing other women.
Lucky for her, I've been incarcerated the last three years, and since I got out I've been a fucking monk, so...
So, um, Ms., um, Le Gall?
Ms. Le who?
Yeah.
Juliette Le Gall.
The woman who found you and brought you in.
- Juliette found me?
- Yeah.
Juliette found you at 1:38 a. m.
What's your relationship with her?
Well, we met yesterday.
I barely know her.
And yet she was at your house at one...
No, no, no.
She wasn't at my house.
I was at her house with several other people, and then I left.
Everything okay in here?
Yeah, we're good.
Yeah.
We'll be done in just a minute.
Look, Mr. Solloway, we're all on the same side here.
If you just relax...
Relax?
Someone tried to fucking kill me, and you got nothing.
You have no fucking clue who might actually have done this.
- And when you say "actually"...
- Can you ask them to go?
Just go and do their jobs?
Will you do that for me, please?
I... maybe you can come back later?
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.
Get some rest, Mr. Solloway.
Buzz me when it's filled up.
Thanks a lot.
You're coming home with me.
- Nina, no.
- And why not?
'Cause for all I know your husband's the one
- who tried to kill me.
- Please.
JP's not smart enough to get away with murder.
Who the hell lives here?
A friend.
Really?
You just got stabbed.
Now you want to go get a booty call?
Apparently she... apparently she saved my life.
What was she doing at your apartment at midnight?
I don't know.
I'll wait.
I'll take you home after.
No, no, I'm gonna be okay.
You just go home.
I'll...
I'll call you tomorrow.
Nina, what are you doing?
I'm crying, you asshole.
Come on.
You don't cry.
You're the tough one, remember?
Fucking take them, Noah.
Take them.
He left the house to you.
- I don't want it.
- I don't either.
- Well, then fucking sell it.
- I can't.
- Why not?
- You know why.
Nina, I am 50 years old.
You can stop apologizing to me now.
Right.
Well, that's...
that's your psychosis.
I'm fine.
- Really?
- It was 30 years ago.
Let's move on.
Well, you're certainly really good at that, aren't you?
I thought you were the detectives with more questions.
- They've already been here?
- Just like a TV show.
The younger one even carried a cup of takeout coffee.
That must have been exciting, right?
Didn't you say you were bored?
Ha.
This is okay?
You must have been frightened.
I actually don't remember it happening.
Strange.
I'm afraid I've also forgotten... why you were there.
You didn't forget.
You weren't expecting me.
I'm sorry to have scared you.
Honestly, I wasn't scared.
I was angry.
- Why?
- I don't know.
I guess I was hoping that you... that this wouldn't be so complicated.
Are you all right?
Oui.
Bonne nuit.
I imagine the doctors told you not to strain yourself.
They say that to everybody.
I make it a rule never to sleep with a man after being interrogated for his attempted murder.
After all, I'm a suspect.
It would look very bad if you were to drop dead at my home.
Bonne nuit.
Bonne nuit.
- Hey, man.
- Hey.
- How'd you like it?
- I'm really enjoying it.
I wrote it a long time ago.
Hey, would... would you sign this for me?
Sure.
- To John?
- Gunther's good.
- Here you go.
- Nice.
"To my old friend, Gunther."
Who is that?
That's my wife.
"Lana"?
Yeah.
No, n-no.
The... the... the book's not...
I'm divorced.
Sorry to hear that.
You know, what you got there is an inmate violation.
You can't hang a poster on the wall.
It's... it's not a poster.
It's a photo.
It's...
I'm gonna hang on to this for safety.
- Come on, don't...
- Hey!
Fuck.
I'm gonna keep this nice and safe.
Have a nice day.
Fuck.
Detective Stanton?
Hi.
It's Noah Solloway.
I think I know who attacked me.
He's a guard at Fishkill named John Gunther.
He's been following me since I got out.
The guy's a real monster.
NOAH:
Previously on The Affair...
Those of you who knew my dad will-will know that we didn't always get along so well, but I-I loved him.
- That was a lovely service.
- You're coming back to the house though, aren't you?
Oh, uh, I don't know.
Do you think we should come back to the house?
Only if you want to.
How was teaching this week?
You have any fun?
Not really.
I thought it was really elegant, Audrey.
(SCOFFS)
I thought it was very dull, unless it was supposed to be a satire.
Was it?
JULIETTE:
Hello.
You just popped up out of nowhere.
Ah, bienvenue, Monsieur Solloway.
Je suis Professeur Le Gall.
I'm just so pleased to finally meet you.
I feel that you and I are kindred spirits.
- WOMAN:
Silence is violence!
- ALL:
Silence is violence!
- Was there a rape?
- I'm not sure.
I thought I'd come to America and have a grand adventure, and instead it's, uh...
Instead, it's New Jersey.
Noah, are you all right?
Yeah.
I'm okay.
Officer Santos, who knows I'm here?
What do you mean?
NOAH:
I'm just wondering if it's possible for anybody still inside Fishkill to find out my current address.
SANTOS:
Why are you asking, Solloway?
NOAH:
Never mind.
It's... it's not important.
Aah!

It's a lovely day, Professor.
Do you have anything planned?
Just preparing dinner for a few people tonight.
Oh.
Coq au vin?
We shall see.
(CHUCKLES)
Professor Le Gall?
We don't want to bother you.
We just wanted to say that we're loving your class.
Yeah.
I thought medieval French literature was gonna be boring, but you're not boring at all.
Well, thank you.
I believe love is never boring, even 900 years ago.
What are you reading, Professor?
Oh, this I'm afraid is very boring.
Andreas Capellanus.
It's part of my research.
GIRL:
Are you enjoying your time here?
BOY:
Are you glad you came?
It's very exciting to be in America.
Tomorrow:
"Lancelot, ou le Chevalier de la Charrette."
Come prepared with questions.
- Okay.
- Of course.
Bye.

AUDREY:
How can you possibly call this an ambiguous case?
MIKE:
She got into bed with him of her own accord.
AUDREY:
It doesn't matter.
She did not want to give Nicholas Perry a blowjob.
Are you saying that you're okay with forcing a woman against her will to give you a blowjob?
For fuck's sake, Audrey.
Of course I'm not saying that, but this specific lady gave no indication that she didn't want what he was giving her.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mike.
Were you there?
She admits it herself.
She does.
She admits she swallowed.
- (GIRLS GROAN)
- MIKE:
What?
Oh, come on.
Grow up.
Could we not just at least maybe... maybe consider the idea that she was on board here?
AUDREY:
Mike, every two minutes someone is sexually assaulted in our country.
Do you know how often the perpetrator is punished?
- Less than one percent.
- Thanks.
AUDREY:
Thank you.
Yes.
And do you know why?
Because it's because of this exact conversation, because we don't believe our victims.
We make them feel like they asked for it.
MIKE:
Okay.
I'm just trying to have a dialogue, but if you're just gonna recite a Planned Parenthood pamphlet at me...
- AUDREY:
Oh, my God.
- what's the point to it?
I can't believe I ever slept with you.
(CHUCKLES) Okay, all right.
So that's what this little tirade is really about, right?
Right, Audrey?
Admit it.
What I will admit, Cornwall, is that I wanted to fuck you at the time, and I regretted it after, but because I'm a cognizant human being who is able to determine and articulate my own desire,
I did not bring rape charges against you, even after I found out what a giant turd you are.
But if we had had sex against my will, that would have been different.
Do you understand that distinction?
Yes.
I understand the distinction.
Do you think I'm capable of understanding that distinction?
Frankly, right now I'm just terrified of you, Audrey.
Oh, my God.
You're a fucking dick.
Whoa!
Come on.
It's the coq au vin.
AUDREY:
I'm sorry, Professor.
I'm sorry.
I just... he's...
I-I can't.
I can't... please tell me it's not like this in France.
It's not at all like this in France.
It's much worse.
- AUDREY:
What?
- JULIETTE:
Yes.
I'm afraid the whole topic is still not taken seriously.
MIKE:
Oui?
C'est bon.
You're very lucky to be surrounded by such enlightened chaps such as myself and Blake.
Professor.
JULIETTE:
It's curious, though.
In this case, the two parties agree on what happened.
She gave him a blowjob.
He didn't force her to.
- No, he didn't.
- But they don't agree on the meaning of the act.
He said she wanted to.
She said she didn't.
Is that right?
- She didn't consent.
- But he didn't force her.
- MIKE:
No.
- But she didn't consent.
That's very confusing, isn't it?
- No.
Not to me.
- JULIETTE:
Yes.
I see that it's quite clear to you.
But I live some decades now, and there's a lot about what I want that I don't understand and that I don't expect a lover to understand.
Professor Le Gall, please tell me that you see the problem here.
JULIETTE:
I see problems, I do.
But I think we all live in our own version of the truth, and thus we are prone to terrible miscommunications.
Perhaps she was trying to communicate one thing, and he read something else.
That's possible, isn't it?
Yes.
Of course it's possible.
That's why the university needs to establish and enforce a mandate of verbal consent.
I understand how such a thing would protect the university, but I don't see how sex itself would survive.
Why not?
Because I am afraid the articulate is the enemy of the erotic.
Isn't the whole point that you don't know what your lover will do next?
That you give yourself over to a sensory experience that you haven't planned and can't control?
The reason I like sex is that I can finally, for a moment, turn off my neurotic mind and just be consumed.
If I give my lover permission... yes, no, uh, touch me, not there... don't I undermine the potency of his desire?
♪♪♪
I'm sorry.
You're all looking at me like I'm crazy.
Do I sound crazy?
No.
Well, Professor Le Gall is a love expert.
Professor Le Gall is a courtly love expert.
MIKE:
What's your point?
AUDREY:
Besides the fact that this manner of thinking has been out of date for 600 years, was written entirely by men wherein the women served as the object of male desire, but had no voice of her own.
So perhaps we can forgive Professor Le Gall for assuming that the articulation of female desire is somehow anathema to sexual satisfaction.
But with all due respect, Professor, I would argue that she simply never learned the appropriate language, because I can tell you exactly how I want you to fuck me.
- Believe me, I remember.
- AUDREY:
And Lila can tell you exactly how she wants you to fuck her.
Hard.
AUDREY:
And if you give me 45 minutes,
I can teach Professor Le Gall to tell you exactly how she would like you to fuck her, though you would not be given the opportunity in a million years.
Oh, forgive me.
I think I hear the soufflé falling.
Ahh.
- I have to have you right now.
- Oh, Mike, no.
- speaking French
- No, no, no.
- No, no.
- Anybody could walk in.
Who gives a fuck?
Come on.
No.
Mike, no.
Professor...
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.
You... you didn't.
Yes, I did.
Of course I did.
I behaved like a total asshole.
I just... ugh, it's Noah Solloway.
He just makes me so agitated.
I mean, I didn't know he was gonna be here.
I mean, why did you invite him?
We bumped into each other on the quad, and he seemed rather lonely, so...
I'm taking his class.
Did I tell you that?
- You didn't.
- Well, I am, and he's a complete dick.
I mean an utter asshole, and all I can do is think about fucking him.
MIKE:
So do it.
Seriously, Audrey.
What's stopping you?
- Jesus!
- That he's your professor?
That he's twice your age?
That he's an ex-felon?
But you're so liberated.
Oh, my God, Mike, why are you so obsessed with me?
- MIKE:
Obsessed with you?
- AUDREY:
Yes.
I'm trying to have a private conversation with my professor.
Do you mind?
Yeah, I do mind, Audrey, because I was here first.
Today romantic love has replaced Christianity as a doctrine for enforcing the ideal of monogamy, and the French realize all this is unrealistic.
What happened to Noah?
Did he leave?
No.
He went upstairs.
He said he wasn't feeling well.
Lila, tell me you agree with me.
The French recognize marriage for what it is:
a social construct created to protect property.
I agree with that...
with that one statement out of everything you said tonight.
LILA:
Just don't be that happy.
BLAKE:
You... you like... you just like disagreeing.
(MUFFLED CONVERSATION CONTINUES)
Oh, hi.
Hello.
I was...
I was looking for a quiet space.
I hope you don't mind.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
I haven't been around that many people in a long time.
Takes some getting used to again.
Hmm.
Are they always like that?
The students?
You tell me.
It's your country.
I am just a visiting professor.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
Uh, I'm here because the library claims to have unearthed certain pages from a rare manuscript that I happen to be an expert on.
Really?
What is it?
Les Esches d'Amour.
The Chess of Love.
It was written in the 14th century.
And this library thinks they have some missing pages.
- Mmm.
- Do they?
I'm not sure yet, but if I had to wager a guess,
I'd say no.
How long have they got you for?
I'll teach until the end of the semester.
I've promised my husband I'd be home for Christmas.
- Long time to be away.
- Yes, but they gave me this generous residency, and this house, and the cutest little red car.
I love that car.
Is this your, uh...
Yes.
C'est Etienne.
With my daughter, Sabine, many years ago.
She's all grown up now.
She a medievalist, like her mom?
No, but my husband is.
A very famous one.
A famous medievalist?
Yes.
In certain circles.
That's how we met.
I was his student.
Do you think it's true what Audrey was saying downstairs?
What was Audrey saying?
That she knows exactly what she wants from her body.
From men.
From everything.

I think Audrey is...
I think Audrey is very young.
Yes.
But I don't ever remember feeling that confident, even when I was her age.
Maybe she really does know exactly what she wants.
Maybe this younger generation simply understands themselves better.
Maybe the uncertainty that I've always assumed is integral to eroticism... doesn't exist for them.

You were attacked by someone with a knife.
You bled profusely.
They took you to surgery where Dr. Quittner closed the artery off.
- Jesus.
- You were very lucky.
The blade missed your airway, and your jugular vein, and just nicked your artery.

Shadow.
- Huh?
- Why did you become the shadow?
Okay, since yesterday, you keep calling me that. "Shadow" this, "Shadow" that...
But what does it mean?
When you appear secretly, like a shadow, to protect the weak and bring justice?
Do I look like such an incredible person?
What made you lurk around the culture district?
What do you mean, lurk?
Do I remind you of a monster?
Or do you have a specific reason for being in the culture district?
Excuse me.
I don't have any reason to be in the culture district, and I'm not the shadow.
Then, how do you explain your hat and your mask?
And, why are you here every day?
Well... that's...
Oh...
This place is really quiet, so it's perfect for studying.
To become a police officer?
But the reason behind this aspiration, is to bring justice into this world.
You're very good at asking these leading questions.
Or this could just be the sharp analysis of a screenwriter.
To be honest, I wish I was the shadow too.
Why?
Because if I really was, then you would continue to show interest in me.
Do you want me to have interest in you?
In my eyes, you're very beautiful.
Oh my...
That's not what's important here...
What's important, is whether or not you're the shadow...
So out of what you're saying, what's true and what isn't?
Good question.
Normally, I'm not a deceitful person.
But I end up lying quite often these days because of work...
It's okay if you are the shadow.
And it's okay if you aren't.
- But I wish you wouldn't lie.
- Why?
Because I hope that my first impression of you was correct.
You seemed like a good person, in my eyes.
No!
Jin Woo!
Excuse me.
Who... are you?
I was Jin Woo's senior colleague.

- Are you his mother?

Please have a seat.

So that job was perfect for him.
And, has it been a long time since you owned this restaurant in the culture district?
It's been three years.
There was a team leader who was in charge of Jin Woo before he died.
Yes.
When that incident occurred... he told me that I needed to cheer up and lead an active life...
So he looked for a business for me.
He said that he collected the money with his colleagues and paid the deposit.
I'm very thankful to him.
- Mother...
- Yes?
What is it?
I just remembered something that Jin Woo told me...
That your 70th birthday was coming up.
How did you... spend your 70th birthday?
What could I possibly do for my birthday, after my son passed away before me?
I went to where Jin Woo was put to rest, and had some soju with him.
One by one...
I poured him a shot, and I had a shot...
"Jin Woo... are you doing well?"
"Have a shot of soju, Jin Woo."
"Jin Woo..."
"Isn't it cold over there?"
"Have a shot, Jin Woo."
Were you... working in the same department, when Jin Woo passed away?
I know there are lots of secrets, working for the intelligence agency...
But no one would tell me what kind of incident caused my son's death...
Did you work in the same department?
No... no...
Why aren't you eating?
Is it because I'm here?
I'm so senseless sometimes...
Why am I sitting here?
Jin Woo.
Your senior colleague didn't forget you and came to see you.
Are you happy to see him here?
Just a moment.
Hello, Mr. President.
Shall we sit for a minute?
I have something to ask you.
Wait a moment, please.
Can we have a word?
He's going to the kitchen with the new president.
The world has become such a good place.

Why did you tell me to go to that restaurant?
So my intuition was right?
Her son is the one who worked with you three years ago.
Are you trying to control me?
What kind of reaction did you want me to show after seeing her?
Control?
What do you mean by that?
Is it wrong to pay respect to the mother of your former colleague?
I'm asking you why you intentionally sent me into a state of distress!
What did you think, after meeting his mother?
Did it seem like she wanted you to take revenge for what happened to her son?
Did you send me there to teach me that lesson?
To tell me to forget about revenge?
No, now I want to do it more.
I'm not sure how his mother feels, but I want revenge.
You just lit the flames to the fire that is my desire for revenge!
- Are you satisfied?
- Did you ask her yourself?
Did you ask her if she wants revenge?
Didn't you say you were going to help me?
Is this your way of helping me?
Why are you lying to someone who is already under pressure?
Mr. President!
No, the new Mr. President!
You don't think you're crossing the line with our president?
It's okay, Writer Bae.
I've worked here for a whole year now.
But you are the first person who has ever yelled at our president who is the nicest man!
And, what lie are you talking about?
The president that I know would never lie.
As for who the constant liar is, and who has the most secrets...
Why don't you think about who that really is?
The only president of this bar is me.
Oh, Mr. President.
Please don't forget that I'm an officer at the Gangjoong police station.
From the way you helped me with the robbery case last time it seems that you're quite skilled.
I'm actually currently investigating a murder case, in secret.
Could you take a look, and tell me your thoughts on it?
This person came to this bar as a customer, before his death.
Are you leaving?
I don't feel very comfortable being here.
Oh, by the way.
I suddenly remember something he told me when he visited us here.
He said he was meeting some famous civil rights lawyer.
He said he was unfairly discharged from his company and wanted to make it right.
That lawyer, is this man here.
Yes... but this man is currently reported as missing.
The client dies, and the lawyer goes missing.
Any thoughts, Mr. President?
What about you, Mr. President?
My heart aches for him.
Why does this keep happening?
I'd like to pay.
Why are you leaving so abruptly?
I thought you were going to study.
Something important came up.
I'll probably be back.
Every day.
But, how do you two know each other?
- You know the work that I'm doing...
- Hey... why are you so curious?
I'm a police officer.
Happy?
What is it?
What would I know about a murder case?
Wait a second.
We were still talking.
What do I do if you just leave?
Take care of this case on your own.
Isn't this an obvious one?
He was discharged, so he protested.
So, the agency killed him and the lawyer.
In this world, how could a disastrous accident just happen, right?
Why don't you look around?
Hey!
Come here.
Who do you think you are, to treat an officer like this?
- I'm not in a good mood.
- Your mood is your problem.
And my mood is much worse.
Are you a former agent too?
- What?
- I have my fair share of resources.
I know that the previous president of this bar is also a former agent.
Did you take over this bar as an agreement between two former agents?
Officer.
I hate public officials.
I used to be in prison.
I was there for three years before my recent release.
Show me your identification.
I liked my first impression of you...
But I forgot all about that now.
People who can't control their anger, and lie, are the ones I hate most.
But your impression right now, tells me that you possess both of those qualities.
That's why I'm speaking to you informally.
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
I'm sorry, but could you get two glasses of cold water to that man over there?
Did you start working here so you could get this stressed?
This place wasn't always like this.
It's too early for everyone to be talking about lies in this place.
When did it become so depressing in here?
At 3:25 p.m., he is on his way home...
A drink...
Does he live around here?
Thank you...
for taking care of Jin Woo's mother.
It's a part of my job now.
But why did you put her in the culture district?
That area is getting noisy because of the Hallyu Core Mall project.
It wasn't like that three years ago.
Oh, what am I supposed to do now?
What a headache...
And you...
I told you to come here for a drink when you're feeling down.
Did I ever tell you to buy this place?
I need to make money too.
- Team Leader.
- What?
When our operation ceased all of a sudden, in Macau you told us that those were direct orders from the director.
That's right.
But the director from back then isn't there anymore.
Weren't you... curious over the years?
About what caused that decision.
Hey, Shi Yoon...
My kid is in college now.
I'm no longer at the age where I search for truth and chase after justice.
Just like that man said...
What happened to the mood in this place?
Is it because of one specific person?
With Jin Woo's mother...
should I keep visiting her?
Did you tell her everything about what happened three years ago?
- No.
- Good.
What's in the past is in the past.
Sometimes a strong-willed white lie is important.
It won't make much of a difference.
Oh, and by the way.
I almost forgot.
The higher-ups wanted me to ask you this.
When you were on trial, they said you didn't formally return your firearms.
My mother told me that they collected all of them from our house.
And I was locked up, so I took her word for it.
Yeah?
Okay.
I'll go back and tell them to double-check.
- I'll go then.
- Yes.
I'll see you again.
Yes, hello, sir?
Have you eaten yet?
Yes...
I'm going to eat soon.
Sir.
You know the subcontractor who works for you?
Does he have some trouble understanding your orders?
Da Bin!
Da Bin!
You keep speeding up.
One, two, three, four...
Keep that tempo.
Okay.
One, two...
Im Yoo Bin!
I told you to stop stomping around!
- Sorry.
- Did you do your English homework?
- No!
- Go and finish it.
Yes.
Hey, hey, hey!
Too fast again.
One, two, three, four.
Don't bother cleaning my room.
I like it messy.
But why won't you eat the food that I cook?
I said, I'm on a diet!
- Where are you going?
- The ccademy.
But you don't go to the academy!
Why do you have to know where I'm going?
Make sure you're back by ten!
Wait, did my daughter play the piano at 9 p.m. or at 1 a.m.?
She only plays when it's bright out!
She doesn't even play well, so it's noisy!
Who are you to judge who can't play?
You just don't know music!
Our daughter is a piano prodigy!
A prodigy!
Then make her play 30 minutes per day!
How do you train a piano prodigy for 30 minutes per day?
Do you think Park Ji Sung practiced his soccer skills for 30 minutes a day?
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you.
Eat another spoonful of vegetables!
They're good for you.
Okay...
Da Bin, watch TV for 15 minutes and then do your math homework.
- 30 minutes.
- 15 minutes.
Were you angry because you felt like I was playing around with you?
Try to ease up.
Okay...
How would I know... how you really feel?
I won't disturb you ever again.
Since I can't even help you with it.
Did you come to say that?
The two of us... will need to work together, from now on.
You said you won't help me.
Regarding your revenge... you can make those decisions on your own.
Think about the current situation.
Our former customer, Seo Jun Suk died.
And his lawyer has been reported missing.
And the young man who monitored Seo Jun Suk is now monitoring me.
And the one who ordered that young man to monitor, is the officer from today.
- Detective Im?
- You didn't know?
Anything and everything suspicious is finding its way into this bar.
If we want to survive all of this...
it's important to work together.
By sharing what we know.
You opening up to me, is all it takes.
And one more thing.
The powerless residents of the culture district are losing their properties.
I have no interest in that.
- Shi Yoon.
- Yes.
Do you hate the idea of becoming the next shadow, after me?
I never liked to follow in anyone's footsteps.
I always won first place in races, when I was in school.
But you've already started becoming the shadow...
I just happened to find a hat and a mask that day.
Baek Shi Yoon...
You are a man of justice.
Hearing that makes me a little itchy.
Then... are you a good person?
- Honey.
- Yes?
Did we find a solution to paying off our loans for this house?
I'm working on it, but don't worry about it.
You know me.
I can do anything with nothing.
I'm the reliable, Im Tae Ho.
It sounds like we have money coming in...
I can feel it in your confidence.
I said I'm working on it.
Why?
Will you keep hiding things under the bed?
Like a child?
You can't even quit smoking, but you call yourself a man?
I just found them somewhere...
I think about it sometimes.
So I smoke one every two months or so.
If you're going to smoke, you should do so confidently.
Like always...
you're hiding them under the bed.
So... did you see anything else under the bed?
What?
Oh, just... anything?
Is there something else you're hiding from me?
Hey, of course not.
Oh... my goodness...
- I'm sorry.
- For what?
- Everything.
- Give it to me.
I have it.
There is a company called Yong Moon Plan, that my friend, Park Seon Woo...
- I know, I talked to him today.
- You did?
With my senior partner?
You don't have to be an officer to investigate.
But, you didn't really have to...
bother him like that...
- Is this all of it?
- Yes.
I deposited two million won yesterday, so we made that interest payment.
- Will you stop lying?
- Wait, what?
Do you expect me to believe that you put all of what you got into the account?
Really...
Hey... these 50,000 won bills fit so well into my wallet.
Here you go.
Come on...
- Three million won, total.
- Yes.
Honey, what kind of work do you do, that you earn three million won a month?
Oh... it's not three million won a month.
It's three million a week.
You're lying again!
It's true!
I get three million won a week.
Wait a second.
Oh my.
Oh my...
What in the world...
- You're amazing, honey.
- Right?
Three million won in one week!
I managed to maintain some strong interpersonal relationships.
I think I should start golfing.
Golfing is fine, but more importantly, we need to prepare for the future.
Savings installments are the best.
And honey, you don't know how long this company will last.
So you always have to keep that in mind.
Don't piss off the boss!
The one in power is always right!
Make sure you ingrain this into your brain, okay?
Repeat after me.
"The one in power is always right."
Hey, why do I need to repeat it?
Repeat after me!
We have to make sure you remember this!
"The one in power is always right."
Oh, really...
The one in power is always right?
Your lips are so beautiful.
What do I do?
- Are they?
- They're so sexy.
Shall we?
- Are the kids sleeping?
- They must be.
Oh, hello!
You look like you're in a good mood.
Oh, yes.
But what brings you here?
- Do you use public transportation?
- Yes.
Oh, really?
Get in, I'll take you to work today.
I'm sorry, sir.
My wife called you out of the blue yesterday...
You must have been upset.
Representative Im...
I heard you did something out of the ordinary yesterday.
Are you talking about my wife and I?
It's been such a long time...
But it's not like we've never done it.
Are you doing what I told you not to do?
I did go to the Neighborhood Bar that was listed in the information you gave me.
And what did you do there?
Investigate the murder case?
No.
My employee, Choi Chan Gyu, is working there.
So I was checking up on him.
You wanted to catch the bad guy to pad your resume?
I guess that's more important than a 1.5 billion won agreement.
Um... it's really not like that...
Wait, sir.
Over here, isn't it?
Attention!
Salute the flag!
Okay.
Oh, sir.
What are you trying to do?
Hey, Im Tae Ho.
- How old are you?
- I'm 43.
Are you not going to listen to me?
Oh, no, I'm listening...
What did I tell you?
I told you not to investigate independently!
I told you to just assist them, as if you know nothing like a clean slate.
But I didn't even go as far as investigating...
Take off your clothes.
- Excuse me?
- Take off your clothes, you bastard!
If you don't want to, leave.
But that will be the end of our agreement.
- Get on your knees.
- Sir...
Get on your knees, you bastard!
You don't want to?
Then leave!
If you don't need three million won per week, then leave!
The intelligence agency knows everything and they're handling it.
So do you really need to get involved and mix things around for them?
Hands behind your back.
Just don't do what I tell you not to do!
Is that difficult?
- No, it's not!
- Will you listen to me?
- Yes, yes!
- If I tell you not to, don't do it!
Don't you hate singing the national anthem?
If you're a public worker, shouldn't you have it memorized?
You don't want to sing it?
Then leave!
Start singing now!
With this spirit and this mind...
Let us give all loyalty...
In suffering!
Or joy...
To love our nation!
Our nation!
Help me!
Please, try not to bother girls.
I'm not just looking into the solutions in the book, but the alternatives too.
So, I find it unfortunate that you're expecting a negative result.
Please accept my apologies.
- I see it very well.
- Huh?
Your bruised eye.
It's taking a while to heal.
I will make sure that the tenants are all gone.
And the shadow, will be caught soon.
I guarantee it.
And my plan is... if you look outside...
I've made up for what is lacking.
So the shadow...
Enough.
What did you say?
The shadow?
That's what the residents of the culture district are calling him.
After calling him a cool name... and then getting beat up by him, have you started to like him too?
What do you mean, I like him?
Hey, I don't mean anything by it.
Whether he's the shadow or the bastard it doesn't matter.
While the investigation is going on, you'll be working behind the scenes.
That's what my friends and I do.
And don't ever make me take take charge.
Yes.
I will do a good job.
- Get back to work.
- Yes.
But, Representative...
When you said friends, I assumed you were talking about our main investors.
But aren't Lockfield Infra Investment and Bay Star Hong Kong, foreign investors?
Then does that mean that your friends are all foreigners?
But when you talk about them, I get the feeling they're Korean too...
They're foreign.
I'm just asking, out of curiosity.
I'm curious what kind of people I'm working so hard for...
And as for Bay Star Hong Kong, if they sell Korean Commerce Bank
I heard that they'll make two or three trillion won off of it.
Wow... isn't that impressive?
- I'm jealous of your friends.
- Don't worry about it.
- Because it's not your money.
- Yes.
It's not my money.
That's right.
I'll go back to work.
You look good with your horse.
- Sir.
- What?
What if the shadow shows up again?
Does that mean we're getting beat up?
Hey, look at how many men we have!
No matter how good he is at fighting...
is he a machine?
And what?
The shadow?
I hear some admiration in your voice.
Sir, I'm just implying that we should be careful.
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
- Hello.
- Hello.
What...
- What do you think you're doing?
- We're here to eat.
Let's see...
Give me one bowl of soft tofu stew.
We'll order more if we like it.
My goodness.
Oh, no...
Oh no, why don't you finish your food?
Oh, no...
They're just leaving...
Hey, you shameful bastards!
Do you think I'll leave because of this?
Don't underestimate me.
I have nothing left to lose.
Oh!
Give us some spicy pork to go with that.
Just one.
- Can we order some fried squid too?
- No.
I never imagined that I would own and operate a library.
I hope everyone has a productive time here!
You know that I want to have a serious talk with you, right?
Then that young fellow will report it.
That we are planning something.
And once he becomes curious of that plan, he will reorganize his strategy.
Sitting closely with the president, contemplating something deeply.
Do you think we really need to lie out of good will?
It was always a part of our jobs to lie.
That was for our jobs, but do we need to do that in our daily lives as well?
Isn't that what everyone does?
People twist around what they don't want to say.
And often, they lie out of good will.
I keep getting a really weird feeling.
Sometimes I feel like the new president is threatening our old president.
You're right.
But I can't bring myself to do that.
I have to tell Jin Woo's mother everything I know.
What happened three years ago...
everything that happened.
I feel like that's what I need to do, if I want to be a decent human being.
I'll be back.
- Two!
- No!
- Come over here.
- Sir, sir!
You must be upset!
Hello.
- You're back.
- What's going on?
Service workers.
They're here to kick me out.
Do it hard.
You should have flicked him harder!
- Isn't it him?
- I don't think so.
I called the police, so I'm sure it'll be resolved somehow.
No, no, no.
We can't send the guys in.
You have to go in alone.
What do you mean, why?
I already told you.
Everything you don't understand... is a special order from the director.
Call Joon Hee and get on it, immediately!
But I heard that there are impressive, highly-skilled individuals involved in the development of Hallyu Core Mall.
How skilled are they?
What's more impressive than those individuals, is the network.
But the way you speak is very unique.
Very clear and well-spoken.
Did you say that you're a Korean from abroad?
Yes.
It must be a little tight, with the official expenses budget.
Here.
Check card?
- Is it yours, Representative?
- Please use it as you please.
- It is under my name.
- Really?
- And what is the limit?
- As long as you don't buy a house.
Excuse me?
Oh, thank you so much!
And Team Leader...
Yes?
You're doing this for someone like me?
He is fully capable of becoming a sergeant, or even a president.
- But the limit...
- There is a difference in the limit.
It's okay as long as you don't buy a car.
Excuse me?
Oh, my... thank you!
Since I already have a car, what about a golf club...
I'm just joking.
How can a public servant have the luxury to golf?
- Did you take care of it?
My request.
- Yes.
We just sent the officers.
Which officers?
Did you send the ones who obey properly?
Yes.
If we want someone who obeys, it's Detective Im Tae Ho.
Even if he can't catch the criminal, he picks up on hints and he's very witty.
- Please, have a drink.
- Oh, yes.
Hello, we're here from the Gangjoong police station.
Oh, yes.
Please come in.
Please do something about them.
They are very stubborn subcontractors working under the development enforcers.
They're trying to kick us out quickly...
Thank you for the meal!
- Thank you.
- Let's go.
- Thank you!
- Thank you!
Weren't they just here to eat?
They're service workers!
They were taking up all of the seats and disrupting business!
Did they show any acts of violence, harassment or illegal activity?
Even if they didn't, what customer would come to a store full of thugs?
So you agree that they were not violent and they were not doing illegal acts?
Excuse me?
Detective.
What do you want?
Do you only bust someone if they're breaking laws?
Shouldn't the police try to help if someone has been victimized?
Who is this bastard, staring at me like that?
Get yours eyes off of me.
The way I'm looking at you is not the point!
To me it is!
Then, are you saying that everyone in the culture district won't get their money?
If you're so bothered by it, why don't you help them?
Sir.
What do you think, it's because we lack human empathy?
Honestly, what can we really do for anyone in the culture district who ask for more money to leave, during the preparation for Hallyu Core Mall?
We're not asking for more compensation!
We're just asking for a way to live!
That's the same thing.
They're not going to grant it to us.
What are we supposed to do with such small amounts of money?
How can we start shops like these with this sort of money?
So...
What do you expect me to do?
Are you asking a civil servant to take your side?
Huh?
Without even discussing what is legal and what isn't?
Is bringing justice the only job of a civil servant?
If I ever catch you...
Why are you screaming like that in someone else's restaurant?
Sir, why didn't you just listen to what they had to say?
Maybe if we just listened...
My mom owned a restaurant when she was alive.
You never win from listening to other people's problems.
And...
Don't bother me today.
I'm in a bad mood.
Those guys will be back to hang around here.
When that happens, please contact me.
This is my contact.
Thank you.
But did you come here to eat?
No, I didn't.
Then, did you have something you wanted to say?
I'll speak to you next time.
Is something wrong?
What do you think is more difficult?
Lying, or telling the truth?
I would say telling the truth is more difficult.
You think so too, right?
We're living difficult lives...
You and I.
Excuse me?
Me too?
Eat something while you study.
Are you just going to live on coffee and water?
Nothing is black and white in this world.
We can all be a shadow for each other.
Shadow...
I don't think there is a shadow in this bar.
Maybe that's because you're outshining the shadows.
The word is spreading.
That you can meet a handsome owner if you come here.
If you had the option of meeting briefly meeting for a long time, or meeting far into the future, which would you choose?
Um...
What about the option of a passionate meeting?
Passionate...
Let's go!
Okay, your cool and wealthy dad will buy you dinner tonight.
Yes, I'm a cool and wealthy dad who also obeys very well.
- Can we have pizza?
- No, Hamburgers!
Hamburgers!
Okay, let's go somewhere where we can have both!
Okay, let's go, let's go.
Come on.
- What about Soo Bin?
- She said she's not coming.
Why not?
Hey, Im Soo Bin!
No, just let her be.
She's not the type to listen.
Let's go have something delicious!
Oh, geez...
Her puberty is difficult and it's taking forever.
Oh, my...
Hey, there...
I enjoyed the sandwich.
But I have somewhere I need to go.
Where?
I may not be the shadow, but I want to see what it's like to be one.
I'm going to put this on and go do a good deed in the culture district.
Why, so suddenly?
If the shadow that you're looking for doesn't show up
I want to take his spot.
Writer Bae's shadow.
Nice to see you!
There's a lot of people!
Over there.
Let's eat, let's eat.
The stew is good here.
These... these rotten bastards!
Give me the soft tofu stew and the spicy pork that I couldn't eat today.
As you probably know, one of each.
Coffee shop, or your house?
Which do you prefer?
My house is very close to here.
Really?
One moment, please.
Yes, hello?
Again?
Yes...
You told me to call you if they did.
Okay.
What?
Is it your girlfriend?
A significant other?
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can walk you home today.
I'm sorry.
I failed the mission.
Okay... this fight will last a long time anyway.
So, let's see who wins!
I'm not the least bit scared of guys like you.
I'm a mother who raised her son to be an agent in the intelligence agency.
If Jin Woo was still alive, you wouldn't have stood a chance!
If my Jin Woo was alive...
Didn't we see him earlier?
Mr. President...
You agree with me too, right?
That the new president is a bit gloomy, with secrets and things to hide...
It does seem that way.
I really want to find out.
What is it that he's hiding?
The one thing I know for certain, is that he's hiding a very important object.
- He's hiding an object?
- Yes.
- It could be something dangerous.
- Where?
You scared me!
Who are you?
Wait, are you the shadow?
Yes, why?
Where are you?
Okay, stay where you are.
The shadow has returned.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Shadow...
Stop it!
Stop chasing me!
Stop him!
Wait, hey.
Hey...
Don't...
Excuse me!
Hey, cut it out!
Stop it!
Hey!
You made it worse for yourself...
Why did you run away?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Min Ki...
Who are you?
Hey, what are you?
Follow me if you can.
I'm pretty good at running.
- Oh...
- Hey, get him.
Yoo Bin and Da Bin.
I was thinking...
Instead of burgers or pizza, should we get some traditional Korean?
- What are you talking about?
- Why Korean, all of a sudden?
I know of a really good place!
Where's that?
There's a hidden restaurant I know.
Do we have a baseball cap in this car?
What is it?
Okay... try this.
Say ah.
Ah.
Good...
Okay, honey, you too.
Ah...
- It's good...
This place is really good.
- Isn't it?
- Isn't it good?
- Yes.
You wouldn't have been able to eat if you came any earlier.
What a relief.
Don't you think you ordered too much?
Our family eats really well.
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.
Wow... this looks really good.
Try the spicy pork.
Here you go.
The spicy pork looks really good...
Here, with the rice.
That's right.
- Sir!
- Yes!
Did he tie you up?
Where is this bastard?
Where is the shadow?
The shadow!
You haven't figured out who he is?
What's with the mask?
Take off that mask.
What are you doing?
- Sir, it's the shadow!
- What are you bastards doing?
- Sir!
- Get up.
Come over here!
Come here!
Let's put an end to this.
Stab him.
This is really rare...
I guess that's why he hid this here...
Writer Bae...
I think it's human nature to lie, from time to time.
In order to help someone...
In order to be a good person.
[Neighborhood Hero]
I respect you very much, Shadow.
Please teach me some martial arts.
Chan Gyu wants to date Writer Bae.
Would you go on a date with me?
I heard that Lawyer Jo's computer was stolen.
What do you plan on doing with the evidence?
You have to find out what President Hwang remembers.
I didn't know you'd find me so soon.
Stop it!
I think I really want to become the shadow.
I think this is destiny.
I better find the shadow myself.
A path
We often think it's the passage to commute
But here..
behind every path there is a history
That history tells us about the caste and the inequalities
Sometime back streets were named as big street, small street and crossroads
Later slowly they started incorporating caste names in it.
When they separated paths based on caste
It's when violence and hatred started brewing
One such village is this Pudhur village
Opposing this bias is this senior Kalimuthu
He has staged several protests and written many book regarding this
If people from Kalimuthu's caste die
They have to take them through this path to the crematorium
If the rain fills the well then they have to walk around the village for 6 miles
If they take this path, it's much shorter
But the village head does not permit it.
This man Kalimuthu who protested against this
Died 3 days back
His comrade Chinnarasu wanted him to be carried on this path
For which he filed a case in the Court of Madurai
Grandma have some tea
How long will you keep him like this?
Shouldn't you be cremating him soon?
We will do it soon, have your tea.
What time is the verdict?
It's around 10 am.
If it's in our favor
We can cremate him by noon.
This Court orders that the mortal remains of Kalimuthu of Madurai district, Pudhur village
Shall be taken through the common pathway and the police should provide due protection.
Just because the Court orders, can they use this path?
All along they have only used the other way
Why suddenly they want this path?
Just because the rain water has filled the wells, can they enter the village?
Inferior people.
Now they want to go with the corpus
Then they will want to come and seek an alliance with our girls
Can we spare them like this?
Kananavelu, since you refused they sought the help of the Court
Now how can you retract?
The village is for everyone not just you.
Even the cattle go through that path.
Why can't they go?
Why should it be reserved for you?
When we are born are we differentiated on caste and creed?
After death it's all just mortal remains.
So you want us to be like you, without any norms?
You want me to eat the food here and clean the hands there?
I follow everything.
I am like this
Your slipper is meant for the feet.
You can't take pity and carry it on your head
You will become the laughing stock then.
Those who can't get a square meal are talking about socialism.
Subramaniam, you are born in our caste right?
Lawyer, won't your creed criticize you?
We came here, because you called us
I don't think this will come to a conclusion.
You continue talking, we will leave.
See the Court has only directed that the corpus can go through the common path
It's not said that they should carry it.
Selvaraj, talk like a policeman!
Then what's the difference between both of you?
No Sir, this is solution to solve it without any problem
Sir!
To take that one man, they might have to let go of 10 other lives
Tell that man, Chinnarasu.
What?
We should hand him over to you?
Is he some orphan?
He was one amongst us and gave his life for our well being.
We will perform his rites and will not give him to you.
Chinnarasu don't create problems, you should let go.
We are letting it go we don't know when they will give.
You are not cooperating.
we have a verdict in our favor.
The Court has only directed that the corpse can go on the common path,
It does not say you can take it.
Can you see how they are interpreting the order!
- Yes.
Chinnarasu, if you take him, they are threatening that they will engage in violence
Cut us!
Will our weapons be still till they slit us?
Muthu!
If you want go back to the Court and get a revised order, then we will cooperate.
Fine Sir.
Do it as you say!
Thanks, Chinnarasu.
Even if we didn't carry, our leader's body came through their path.
There will be a day when we can carry it ourselves through their path.
(chattering)
Don't go near the cow
(chattering)
Look at Kittu!
It's such a big moment and look at him.
Come here!
Kittu!
Kittu come.
Why is everyone here?
- I don't know.
What is it?
- Come here
What is it?
Come here.
What is it?
You have scored the first mark in Tamil Nadu
You photograph is on the newspaper.
Hey.
This is great!
Congratulations.
We are very happy.
We only read news that someone was killed or burnt alive from this region.
To see a news like this
It feels like we have conquered the world.
Don't let go.
You should aim higher.
You should gather a huge following that will come with you.
Academics is knowledge.
It's external.
There is something more important.
Love and selflessness.
Living for others.
Don't forget that.
I won't forget anything that you have taught.
Alright what are you going to do after this?
Chinnarasu, what are you asking?
You are behind the education of both of them.
You tell him please.
Yes, brother.
What mother says is true.
You tell me what I should do further.
Why are you asking me?
Well.
You should become a Collector.
As you are in college, prepare for your IAS.
Also tomorrow we have planned a felicitation for you in our school.
The District Collector is coming down to felicitate you.
We request the esteemed chief guest- the District Collector
To say a few words.
My greeting to all.
My hearty congratulations to Krishnakumar for securing the highest scores in the State
Thank you, Sir.
- Welcome.
It's no easy task to secure the State first, hailing from a small village like Pudhur
That too from a Government school.
More than the wealth one has earned
One should show how much knowledge they have gained
I heard that Chinnarasu was instrumental in his education.
I am delighted.
My congratulations to you as well.
Thank you.
After 2 Years
Aunty can I spin it!
Sir, we had asked for 10 women for transplanting paddy
Sir today, it's totally 8 women working.
Mariamma has fallen sick.
So...
Father!
I will leave now.
Be careful.
I will manage with this work force.
If you can be liberal about the money...
To review the water scarcity in Chennai the Chief minister of Tamil Nadu M G R will hold talks with
The chief minister of Andhra Pradesh MR. N T Rama Rao
They will hold joint discussions
- That's good.
The bus is here - Why are you late?
My mother delayed packing my lunch.
Make it fast.
How are you?
- Fine!
Let's leave.
Hey!
The bus is not here yet!
- Can we go by cycle?
Are you so studious?
- He's looking for something
Don't trouble him.
- It's the only option we have.
The bus has arrived.
He's looking at you.
Rani!
Wait for a minute.
For what?
What's this?
Take this Rani.
You know we are from different segments.
You know what will happen if my father knows!
What!
Your problem is that I am not from your caste?
Yes.
Look Rani.
If you say you don't like me I will go away.
Till death I will love you
You will be my wife.
I can't handle him.
I am wondering if I should complain to my father about him.
What!
Rani enrolled in your college
What are you saying?
- Yes.
Fate.
Then Subash will start again.
He already has.
Surprising!
You both are going out!
Yes after 3 years he's taking me for a movie!
That's the fate of people's man.
Have some tea.
Ask for two!
Two..
He's some silly guy offering you tea, you should politely refuse!
I feel like..
Always erring.
You take brother and go for the movie.
Move!
How much do they owe you?
Rupees 61.
For this!
Tea for the two of us.
and one more round of tea for all of them.
One tea for you?
Have you told the Senior!
It he who told me to see you.
My stomach is churning.
Don't mess up this place.
Hold on till brother is here.
We can we handle the police
But I can't handle this!
Fine I will come during lunch.
Thanks.
Come Chinnarasu.
I was wondering why you are not here as yet!
What's the reason today?
Your people have pelted stones on the bus.
I have arrested them on suspicious grounds.
Towards the end of every month as you want to close your case files
You arrest our people
I will have to come and seek justice.
Your arguments are unjust.
This is an ongoing process.
Don't think we will keep bending to atrocities.
One day we decide to stand up, you will not be spared.
What Chinnarasu, your views are strong.
Your father worked as a servant for us.
It's from the wages that we paid, you are sitting and talking.
My father was your servant.
Now you are a servant for all of us.
You don't understand?
This uniform makes you a servant.
A government servant who works for the us.
Your salary is from the tax payers money.
Meaning, we pay you the wages
Selvarasu!
You need to delete that your father is a landlord.
You should stop working for your clan.
Hereafter work for the people.
Attitude because you are educated?
Pay the fine and take them.
Leave.
- Okay, brother.
Wear your shirt.
They tore it.
Chinnarasu!
Today you are there to save them.
There might a time when you might be here.
As you point fingers at me, you might have to fold hands and talk to me that time will come.
I will sit inside you sit in the corner.
Okay.
You ask her to go there.
- Why?
I am telling you.
You go there Rathi, come here.
Why?
- I am telling you.
Why did you say that?
She's from the lower strata, we can't allow her to sit with us.
Where will I go?
It was Friday.
so I went to the temple.
Did you come to the temple yesterday?
Leave it!
Why do we create a problem?
We should not leave it.
What's he doing?
- You know about him.
Hey!
Get up
Why?
- I am telling you!
You have studied till 12th?
Haven't you read this?
UNTOUCHABILITY IS INHUMANE.
What are you staring at?
Keep your caste out of the college
Else will thrash you.
After paying so much now you are refusing to go to college?
I don't like it, why are you bothering me?
Why are you angry with mother?
You are the first one in the family to study in a college.
Now what do we do if you resist?
Why are you scolding her?
Come here, dear.
Sit down.
Did the lecturer say something?
Did some boys scold you?
No.
Don't hold your emotions, tell me dear.
Father.
I am scared to go to college.
I want to know the reason.
She says she's scared.
I will take you dear.
Hey!
That girl
- Which girl?
You didn't know it was his daughter!
Didn't you know it?
It's going be a huge mess.
- Get down.
Kittu someone has scolded her in college.
Gomathi, show him who that is.
Don't worry.
Kittu will take care of everything.
Give way.
See how he's staring.
Forget your ego and apologize to her.
If Chinnarasu brother know, it will become a huge issue.
Gomathi.
- Pardon me.
She saying what I wanted to say.
I listened to my friend and said that.
Please don't tell this to my father.
My father will kill me.
So you are not apologizing form your heart.
You are doing it because you're scared of your father.
No.
- Look..
Happiness or sorrow
Tears are the only witness.
If you shed a drop of tear then all the pain and negativity will vanish from you heart and you will feel light
Don't be scared I won't tell your father.
Kittu!
Principal is calling us.
Try to change for real.
Krishnakumar.
compile the list of students coming for the dam trip.
Okay, sir.
Hello!
Palani Murugan college.
Good morning sir!
When Sir?
Okay, sir.
Okay, sir.
As we have the exams next month
- An important announcement.
It's with great sorrow we announce that
Our Honb'le Chief Minister M G Ramachandran died this morning.
I ask all of you to stand for a moment in silence.
Today and tomorrow are declared as holidays for the college.
I request you all to disperse in peace.
They say the buses are not plying.
Then we have to rely on our feet.
Sister!
Let me carry the child It's alright
It's alright.
- No give the child to me.
Hold this.
Go with uncle.
Lift her.
You should tell us when you want to urinate.
Don't do it on him.
Don't give her ideas.
Listen
- Tell me.
Why can't we let the women walk ahead and we trail them?
Don't invite trouble.
Just come.
- That true.
Carry my books too.
You need assistance for that?
I am scared to come on this path alone
- Are we alone!
What happened?
A snake!
Grandma!
she is bit by a snake.
Someone is bit by a snake.
Move..
Come soon.
What do we do now?
Someone give me your waistband.
I have mine.
Take it.
Tie it hard.
Tie it a bit high.
Then it won't spread.
It's a very venomous snake.
The venom will creep to the head soon.
If you can take her to the hospital in an hour, you can save her.
That soon!
It's over 6 miles to the hospital from here.
Don't waste time let's carry her.
They will condemn if we see her
You want us to carry her?
Let's carry her.
Be quite.
They should consent first.
If we keep aside our differences and unite we can save this girl's life.
Ask them to carry.
Carry her.
Come on.
How will you carry this young girl for 6 miles?
All life is one.
Let's unite today.
The crows and sparrows are my caste
Said the great poet Bharathi.
To win this world with love
Let's redefine destiny
If you have humanity
That will heal all the wounds..
it will heal.
Let's unite, let's unite
Till our hearts bloom.
Let's unite, let's unite
To break the barriers.
Let's unite, let's unite
To save mankind.
Let's unite.
All life is one.
Let's unite today.
What's high and what's low.
Why should we have this division?
With kindness and love
This boundaries will blur.
Fragrance is the beauty of the flower
Love is the wish of this world it's the wish.
Let's unite, let's unite
Till our hearts bloom
Let's unite, let's unite
To break the barriers
Let's unite let's unite
To save mankind.
Poor, downtrodden
The rain does not discriminate when it pours.
Are you bigger or me
The earth does not revolve fighting around this
Trees symbolise breeze
Land symbolise abundance
Nature does not know division.
It only seeks harmony.
Let's learn everything Mankind mankind
Let's help as much as we can Let's banish sorrow..
sorrow..
Let's unite, let's unite
Till our hearts bloom
Let's unite, let's unite
To break the barriers
Let's unite, let's unite.
To save mankind
Let's unite.
It's alright.
Lives become one.
A new bond is formed.
When the heart is filled with love
Even the stone becomes a God.
To show the true affection
Tears are sufficient.
Everything will change one day.
Time will show us the way..
will show us the way.
You lower clan fellow!
How dare you touch our girl?
Uncle!
If he hadn't carried her, Rani would have been dead by now.
Let her die.
Who are you to touch her?
Will kill you.
I am telling you.
Keep quite.
I did it unintentionally.
Please pardon me.
Uncle, these boys were scared to even look at our girls.
Now they have the audacity to touch and carry them.
Where did they get this courage?
Even when the bus route was extended, so many of the, didn't go for higher education.
Speak to the MLA and tell him I seek him assistance
Stop the bus service for their path.
Sure, sir.
Will do.
Without the bus, how long can we walk every day for the school?
If you want me to be specific about this scheme
It's for the housing and welfare of the underprivileged.
It comes under the Central Government.
If your village President does not corporate you can individually or collectively join and avail the scheme and build houses.
You must have heard about it.
The Government is coming forward to build houses for us.
We must utilize it.
In some villages the Village President is coming forward to do this.
You know the fate of our village.
So we are coming forward to build it ourselves.
It's a good scheme Chinnarasu.
But if the Government has the real intention of uplifting us
They will give us the sum of money in advance and let us built it.
If they give us the money in advance, with our poverty and crisis we might spend it for something else.
This could be the views of the Government.
If you ask us for RS 25,000 suddenly how can we manage?
Can't you take a loan from the society group?
Who will trust us and give loan?
Here's an old proverb that says the God will shower breaking the roof
We are the ones with no roof over our head so who will give us?
For her marriage
I saved..
RS 8700 in the society.
That's all that I have.
When it rains the house leaks all over.
Somehow I will manage to get the money, please help me build the house.
I am delighted.
as my daughter comes I will tell her about this.
These unreasonable people have stopped the bus service.
It's dark by the time the girl reaches home.
My heart is pounding until she reaches home safe.
It's time for her delivery.
I have asked for the bullock cart, he told he will spare it.
I am going there to fetch it
How can you take a woman in labour on the bullock cart?
What to do?
They have stopped the bus service
We just have to lamenting.
Rest the housing plan, the children are struggling without the bus.
Every day there need to walk 9 miles one way to go to school.
First help us with that.
Brother, tea.
The have stopped the bus deliberately.
We can give a petition to the RTO.
If they are unaware we can do it, they are totally aware of it.
The RTO will say that he'll look into it.
Nothing will come of it
Why can't we buy an old bus?
How?
Let's seek help from all whom we know.
Our relatives, those who have settled in the city
Those in Government jobs..
Some of your friends..
Through Kittu we can reach out to some students
If there is some shortfall
I will fill it for you.
Thank you so much.
Write is as RS 51 from pest control shop
Thanks.
How much?
- Write is as Rs. 21
Thanks.
Here
- Thanks.
Do it well.
Thanks.
That's all you have?
- Yes.
Don't give me the change, give me the notes
After giving you everything what will I do?
Forget about bus, with this money you can buy a ticket.
It's after a long time that we have all come together.
I feel very happy.
Next we should all go like this for the Principal's daughter's wedding.
Let's tell everyone when we leave.
Those interested will join.
Kittu
One minute.
Sorry.
I didn't expect my uncle to behave like this.
It's alright.
Also..
I am in love with you and will only marry you.
Gomathi!
Rani wanted to say this to Subash.
My heart stealer tell me what you want
I will give you my heart.
Looking at you I feel like conquering
Just consent and it shall do.
Just a gentle touch and I will surrender fully.
Without coming near me you husk me
My heart stealer tell me what you want
I will give you my heart.
Looking at you I feel like conquering.
Just consent and it shall do.
I like you a lot.
Listen to me.
As I wake up and think of you
My legs go in search of you.
Like the minced meat why do you Engulf me?
Like rain drops on the haystack Why do you stay that way?
Like the crow that encircles the dried fish
My life revolves around you
Take me as your eternal love.
My heart stealer tell me what you want
I will give you my heart.
Every day and night I see you within me.
As I grind I want you to embrace And kiss me on my forehead.
Without sleeping on the bed
Show me your charm.
I will hold you Till the lines on my palm fade.
It's for you that
I feed myself with spices.
Spread the plantain leaf..
Sprinkle it with water and keep it ready.
My heart stealer tell me what you want
I will give you my heart.
Just a gentle touch and I will surrender fully.
Without coming near me you husk me
My heart stealer..
I will give..
My heart stealer..
Is it clear now?
The glass looks great.
Really?
- Yes.
You look like actor Bhagyaraj
- Really?
What have you named the new bus?
We have named it after Kalimuthu Sir!
Fast.
Go.
Hey.
Why are you leaving me?
Move, Kittu.
Stop.
Now that we have a new bus, we don't have to walk so much
Get in.
Get in.
Fast.
Look.
Kalimuthu Sir Chariot!
These boys used to pee on their pants
Just see how they have transformed.
It's because of Kamaraj leader.
Giving them education has made us a pack of fools.
These guys used to come home begging for meals.
Now they have their own bus transportation
What bus?
What's the big deal?
If you paint some tin sheets is it a bus?
Whether it's a tin sheets or a luxury bus..
They have a bus of their own now.
That Chinnarasu is like a stone on a plate of rice.. disturbing us constantly.
We should have killed him when we wanted to take the corpse.
It's still not too late.
If we do something now they will call it anguish.
Let's wait for sometime and plan a mass destruction.
It's only an engagement.
Don't worry we will take care of it.
Listen to me.
Don't cry.
In world history the role of Hitler is very important.
Madam, one minute please.
Please call Krishnakumar.
The Principal wants to meet him.
Krishnakumar.
Madam
- Go please.
Why suddenly?
- I don't know.
Why is the police there?
What's this?
- Krishnakumar.
You're probably the best student in this college.
If you do like this?
- What did I do?
Where's Rani?
I don't know.
If you don't tell me I will just strangle you to death now.
Selvaraj.
Take your hands off.
Take your hands off.
Why are you doing this?
He has kidnapped the girl studying with him.
The girl's has lodged a complaint.
We haven't kidnapped.
She didn't like the groom they have fixed by her parents
She married Subash.
Your Collector has solemnised the wedding.
It's because of rogues like him that we have crimes.
What's the crime?
Is it a crime that the law permits two adults to marry those they like?
Or is the right to seek their partner a crime?
What's the mistake here?
Half baked idiots like you appear for everything.
That's the mistake!
Because you have power and using it for gains
Are you half baked or is it us?
For you all those in Authority are all incorrect.
We don't detest those in Authority
We detest Authority.
It's 4 days since we saw our daughter.
We don't know if our daughter is alive.
If you want I will withdraw my complaint.
Please ask them to show me my daughter.
Bring that girl and Subash to the printing press.
Here's the key.
- Okay.
Only the girl's parents come with me Rest of you stay here.
It has become such a big issue.
I can pay whatever they want.
Ask them to leave my daughter.
Keep the cash inside.
My daughter does not know anything.
The have mesmerised her and cheated her and taken her away.
.Please keep the cash inside first
No one can mesmerise anyone here.
She was probably afraid to tell you she was in love
Don't use terms such as cheating for that.
Saying that they were mesmerised and taken away is
Degrading our own children.
You think our children are so weak?
Even if her father agree, relatives won't.
Subash is here.
My dear!
Where did you go?
Subash her father wants to talk to her.
Let her go
- No need brother.
Her father might say something and change her mind.
If that girl really loves you
Even if the whole world is against her she won't leave you.
He's your father.
He has brought you up for 20 years and been through your good and bad.
Don't hurt him even if he's angry with you.
Go.
What is this?
Why have you done this?
If you didn't like that groom, you should told me then.
No, since he's from a different clan
I thought you won't agree.
What do you mean!
How can I go back to our clan and participate in our rituals?
Did you think of your sister who is married there?
Do you know all that she has to go through?
You...
Forgive me, father.
Even now I can't believe it.
My daughter has broken the norms.
Hey what happened?
What's that?
(screaming and loud crying)
Rani.
You are gone!
It's all gone!
It's all gone!
Leave me.
Brother!
She's dead, she's gone,
Rani!
You left me alone!
AFTER SOME DAYS
Kumar.
- What Gomathi?
How's Subash?
He looks like he's insane.
He tried killing himself twice.
We saved him.
His mother thought he will really go insane if he's here
So they took him to his aunt's house in another place.
What document?
- It's that of the farm.
I have got it with my wife's consent.
Don't worry
- Hello
Hello, is Kittu there?
Yes.
Kittu, there's a call for you.
At this time?
Who is it?
- Gomathi here.
When you receive money from the Government, you are going to repay it.
Use it till then.
Yes..
Can you come to college around 8 tomorrow?
I want to talk to you in private.
I will come.
You know why I called you.
I don't know how I can make you understand.
I need to become a collector first.
I need to do a lot for these people.
Just as how Chinnarasu brother helped me with education
I need to educate several others.
My sister's wedding, a house for my mother, jobs for my friends.
I have planned my life in a different way, Gomathi.
It will be long way before I can get married.
It's alright.
You want to have the same fate as Rani?
Kittu
I am mad about you.
Don't try to change me.
Listen, your father has helped us a lot.
He's continuing to help us.
Gomathi is like betraying his trust.
Try and understand.
My father will definitely agree.
He likes you a lot.
Gomathi!
Why don't you understand my situation!
You like me, don't you?
I can't Gomathi.
I can wait till you are ready.
Don't give me No for an answer.
I will die.
I can't forget you.
Gomathi.
Take this.
Look!
If you want me to get married to you, be direct about it.
Don't come up with some false tales.
If you do this, then even if my parents agree I won't settle down with you.
He's not able to live with your sister, you want me send my other daughter to that hell?
I am not here to seek your daughter's hand.
I here to warn you that your daughter is going astray.
He's from the lower clan.
Your brother doesn't mind a mistress from the lower clan!
It's three months since he left her.
The elders in the family want to talk to you about it this Sunday.
I am not coming anywhere with my daughter.
No one needs to talk to me about it.
Come.
- You leave.
No it's a girl.
For me I respect my daughters.
I won't listen to those like you who mince words.
Tell you brother
To at least live well with his mistress.
Please leave.
They started with the crematorium and then it's bus, education, competition..
and now they have come up to the bed.
If we let them live we will have to go.
It's because of Chinnarasu that they are so overt in their moves.
We should not touch Chinnarasu but he should be reduced to nothing.
What are you saying?
State first student, Collector Kittu.
He's the pride of the village?
Forgive me for twisting things in front of uncle
Tomorrow everyone should come here by 6.
Definitely.
Tomorrow bring your wife to sign for the witness.
I'll leave.
- Kittu!
Let me drop you.
Sure, Chinnarasu.
Let me leave.
Will bring her tomorrow morning.
How's your education?
It's going well.
(Chattering)
I will get dropped here.
Fine will see you tomorrow
- Okay.
That's Ramadoss house isn't it?
Yes.
- It's his daughter Malathi's marriage tomorrow
It's his daughter Malathi's marriage tomorrow.
Yes.
Malathi and Gomathi studied together until 10th.
This morning as I left she told she wanted to go for the function.
I forgot about it.
Fine will see you in the morning during the marriage.
- Sure.
Kittu, one minute.
I brought you here to talk to you.
I am talking about other things instead of what I wanted to talk.
My daughter told me that she loves you
Kittu, there can't be a better match for my daughter than you.
Fulfill your dreams, me and my daughter will wait for you.
I will take leave.
Help!
Come
Take the vehicle.
Come soon Get in.
Move!
Quick!
Brother!
It's the postman here.
Someone has hacked Subramani brother to death.
What?
Yes, he's dead.
Please rush to the hospital.
Chinnarasu stop here You can't go in.
I want to see him.
I have information that your men are behind this.
Subramani was murdered in your area.
His people are very angry.
You better ask your people to surrender.
What's the proof that our people did this?
- Brother!
Brother!
They have burnt our bus down on the village outskirts.
Four of our people are battling for life.
Hey stop!
What are you doing?
- Listen.
Selvaraj, why are your arresting them?
You know it Chinnarasu.
Your comrade Subramani was murdered by them.
We didn't do anything.
Selvaraj.
You are crossing your limits.
Get into the vehicle.
See what they are doing to us Hey!
Start the vehicle
Get into the vehicle.
Chinnarasu if found guilty..
14 years..
Forget the dreams of him becoming a Collector.
Ramu!
Start the vehicle.
CENTRAL JAIL
- MADURAI
The 4 accused Kittu, Logu, Kumar and Pandi are ordered conditional bail by this Court.
Brother!
That SI says this case will drag for at least 10 years.
Is it true?
So my dreams of becoming a Collector
Will remain only a dream?
Through you our people with have better times,
Things will change.
What I like about you, is your confidence and endurance.
Under no circumstances let go of that.
Kittu!
Even if the law and authority is common..
They use in their favor.
We don't have the backing a big politician or political party.
Our people..
don't have the strength to stand up together.
We only have..
truth and dreams with us.
They have been fed this poison of caste for several years.
To negate this venom..
several people have struggled and given their lives.
It's through their death..
that you and I have emerged to question them.
Those who were only listening... are now questioning.
It's not acceptable for them.
Other than the right to vote...
We have no other rights for our existence in this country.
Those who are hitting, are continuing with it.
If we hit back, they call it audacity.
The evil eyes of the people..
The evil eyes of the strangers..
All the evil eyes around...
Let all these get away from you.
Spit it up.
Let all the evil spell get away from today.
I need to lodge a complaint.
Should we sign even in the evening?
Yes, both morning and evening.
Sign here.
Where should I sign?
Collector Sir!
One minute.
Satish that's the file for pickpocket cases.
They are murderers.
What are you staring for?
Want to go in again?
Sign and get out.
Change the file and get it signed
- Okay, sir.
Just sign.
Let's leave.
Sign here.
It's difficult.
But what can we do?
Sivagami.
Gomathi didn't come?
They stopped her from college.
Without committing any mistakes..
our lives are ruined.
The SI has deliberately pulled us into this case.
We need to do something.
Let's do something.
Really.
In our harsh!
One single hit..
We will bury you dead!
You will plead endlessly..
We will continue to pin you down..
We will cover your eyes!
Will chop your legs..
We will continue to torture you.
We will come in front of you Pulp your face..
We will hunt you down till the end.
We will make you repent Will burn you..
And will finish eating you.
Will count Every single bone..
Will hang them and break them to pieces..
Will break your teeth Will spare no effort to make you teeth less..
Will punch you hard Till you tame down.
You can take back..
everything with interest.
We will rise and give what we have to give back.
We should discard you like a trash cloth.
Should burn you like a log of wood.
Should shoot you in the middle of the road.
You should just rot.
Your tail shouldn't wag..
Shut up, shut up.
Don't show your strength..
Run, run away..
Join in clusters.
Get together and..
Wade the evil of caste..
Just remove the bigwigs..
Let's this place Prosper.
With this violence the creepers and climbers.
will not wilt..
You can't you can't.
Run away.
He has a gun.
Why is he hitting him so much?
What if he dies?
- He does not listen to us.
Sir, please stop.
What will be do if he dies?
Let him die.
Sir!
What?
- Our region postman has come.
Greetings, Sir!
What are you doing at this time?
I know this lady, wanted to take her husband.
You have to come and pay the fine tomorrow morning.
Do you understand?
- Got it.
Take him.
Thanks, sir.
- Get lost.
Come in the morning.
Got it?
Mom, brother would have slept at the Press.
Don't be scared, he will be back.
Selvaraj, why did you arrest Kittu last night?
No!
I didn't arrest anyone like that.
Yes I arrested.
I hit him.
How dare he!
Tried assaulting me?
He was spared because this man came.
Else would have beaten him to death.
Where's Kittu now?
Let him out at 6 AM.
He has still not come home.
Try searching for him in some hospital.
Will see.
He went to the station to sign last evening at 6.
Till this evening he has not come home What does that mean?
From the time he scored the state first they are eyeing him.
That's why they framed false charges on him and sent him to jail.
Chinnarasu, what if something happened to Kittu in the lockup With the SI hitting him so much.
What are they saying..?
It's possible.
In another village..
they did something to one man then claimed that he's absconding.
Don't be idiotic.
- What's all this?
I am very scared.
What happened to my son?
- Don't be scared.
Kittu will come
- Nothing would have happened.
That SI is trying to threaten us through Kittu.
Nothing would have happened
Don't be scared.
Don't cry.
We should not be quite beyond this.
Mani, what?
Chinnarasu brother wanted me to pass on a message.
SI Selvaraj had taken Kittu to the station and beat him.
This unscrupulous man.
He should not be spared.
We will come.
Let's see if it's them or us tomorrow.
Bring your parents as well.
What time should we come?
Come to the station before it dawns.
Hello.
Sir, this is Constable Satish.
Chinnarasu has gathered several of his people and sitting infront of the station.
All of them have a fuel can with them.
I don't understand what they are planning.
What you're doing is incorrect Chinnarasu.
It's against the law to gather this as a mob.
If there's a complaint against him, give it in writing.
I will take action.
We can talk about it.
Ask them to disperse.
It's disrupting mobility.
They will listen to you.
Hey!
Better disperse.
Else will shoot you all.
Shoot us?
Will you?
Are you trying to threaten us?
We will burn you along with the station.
If Kittu does not come back alive..
We won't spare you.
We are being calm because of Chinnarasu brother!
Selvaraj, come here.
Is this how you talk in public?
The student of the arts college was taken by the police..
for under the pretext of questioning By the SI..
to the police station the day before yesterday.
As the student taken for enquiry..
did not return until last evening..
The people of the village have laid seize to the police station.
This has completely crippled the road transport along that route.
That SI claims that boy came to hit him so he took him into custody to enquire.
Around 10 of us can beat the SI..
and claim that we went to enquire something.
What do you say?
If some valuables are missing we can complain to the police
But what do we do if a person is missing?
That's too because of the police!
Just imagine that Kittu has murdered Subramani.
Without enquiring properly..
How can you claim that the person is missing?
Assume that he has committed a crime..
Can they kill him for that?
That policeman should be shamed in public..
We should hit with broom sticks.
If we are educated they will hack us to death..
Knowing this our forefathers didn't go to schools.
Kittu brother is a very nice person.
When we ask him some doubts he always answers it with a smile.
See what they have done to him.
If my son commits a mistake..
I ask him to take Kittu as a role model.
I want my son to be like him.
See what they have done to a boy like that.
The SI will definitely die a painful death.
He knows the value of life and saved that girl Rani.
For that also they beat him.
Even if you work tirelessly in their farm They will only give the frugal remains.
They think endlessly to give out spoilt food.
Will they spare us if we seek hot meals?
Just like this..
they took my son for an enquiry.
Till now I don't know what happened to him.
We are not after money and live in poverty.
Now these demons even want our lives.
Now you don't respect us after the Governor rule is imposed.
Not like that sir.
That's fine.
Is that boy really alive or not?
I am sure they have killed him.
He was bathing the cows..
he aimed at being the District Collector.
So they killed him!
Greetings!
- Greetings!
I am Nellai Varathan.
- I know you very well.
I am very happy.
The people who were scattered all over have united through your speech.
An educated man like you..
should head our clan.
I am behind you.
Our agitation will succeed.
- Thank you very much.
Hello.
This is Thangarasu.
Okay.
Let me just call him.
Hello
- This is Vadivel.
How are you?
Doing well, brother.
Brother wants to talk to you.
Pass it to him.
- Okay.
Kittu, an idea.
For you to come out of this case..
there's just one way.
What is it?
To damage us... they have used deception against us several times.
Once for your benefit..
For the benefit of those dependent on us..
Let's use the same deception just once.
You are the witness who saw Kittu being hit by the SI.
That's all.
Tomorrow you call the police..
and inform where the brewed illicit liquor.
Brother, how are you?
I am fine..
How are you doing ?
- I am fine.
No problem here.
Saw the newspaper .
I am delighted.
Everything is happening as we planned.
Not just what we planned..
Things beyond that is happening.
We just set the stage for an agitation.
That agitation has grown enormously..
and now I am of the faith that our dreams will soon be a reality.
Just wait for 5 more days.
I believe things will be in our favour.
Till then you be careful.
Okay, brother.
Shall I hang up?
You call me on Saturday.
I will tell you what should be our next move.
- Okay.
Hello.
Hello!
Hello, who is this?
Who was it?
Don't know, they just hung up!
Good morning, Sir.
- Morning.
What's the status now?
Sir, they have a strong eye witness who saw Kittu being beaten up in the station.
Did you enquire those in the station?
I enquired all the constables.
The SI has released Kittu.
Chinnarasu, one minute.
I have also enquired will all the police here.
The SI had released Kittu.
Kittu probably got scared with all the beating and has gone somewhere.
He will definitely come back.
Sir, excuse us.
Till we kind Kittu alive..
We will wait.
Chinnarasu!
Don't try to become a leader overnight.
If your people know your true colour..
You will be reduced to nothing.
Selvaraj!
- Sir!
'As you point fingers at me..' 'you might have to fold hands and talk to me.
That time will come.'
Greetings!
The news is read by Saroj Narayansami.
In connection with the missing youth of the arts college of Pudhur..
The SI of that police station is suspended.
Brother.
If I don't find that Kittu and cut in to pieces and bury him right here..
I am not born for one father.
If you don't tell me where Kittu is..
I will kill you and bury you here.
I really don't know where he is.
Believe me.
Pretending?
You think I am a fool?
Tell me where's Kittu?
I swear on my children.
I don't know where he is.
Leave him.
He's just the arrow.
I am telling you, leave him!
.
I will kill that Kittu who humiliated me.
It's not vital that you kill Kittu now.
We can always reduce him to nothing.
Now we need to prove that the agitation by Chinnarasu is a mere lie.
It's only then his own..
people will turn against him.
That Chinnarasu should be humiliated.
If their agitation succeeds...
The we all should die in shame.
Any decision taken by you in rage will be incorrect.
Don't worry.
I will take care.
How do we bring him here?
This love won't let them stay idle.
Wherever he is, he'll call Gomathi.
Using her as a bait we should catch him.
That boy Kittu is a nice boy.
Only this Chinnarasu motivated him to do something.
Isn't there a difference between anger and rage?
Heard they sold your farm without your husband's knowledge.
No it's in my name... he pledged it to help them build houses.
Your father has done so much for them.
Unfaithful people.
Merciless.
Do you know where that boy Kittu is?
Gomathi, if you know tell us.
We should not spare him
Pick it up.
Hello?
Gomathi ?
Kittu.
- Talk, find out where he is
How are you ?
I am fine.
I have no problem.
I called to tell you that.
Ask him where he is?
Where are you now?
Kittu, I want to meet you.
No, I won't tell anyone.
I think I will go mad without seeing you.
Fine.
I will come tomorrow morning.
Where is he?
In a hill station near Theni , he says.
He is trapped.
Yesterday, your sister tricked us saying it's near a hill in Theni.
Today, the mother and daughter are tricking us that the girl is missing
Hey!
Tell me truth where she has gone.
Else I won't be a human anymore.
Why are you panicking now?
We should panic that my sister is missing.
We really don't know where she has gone.
My dear wife...
Tell me a convincing lie.
Why are you staring?
After all this..
She's going behind that murderer?
We don't know if she has gone in search of him.
But we know he's not the reason for my father's death.
How do you say so?
You fulfill your dreams and come.
Me and my daughter will wait for you.
I'll leave.
Gomathi met Kittu during her friend's engagement.
It during that time when they were talking..
My father was murdered.
There's no connection between Kittu and my father's death.
She has acted in front of us.
She has gone in search of him.
KODAIKANAL
- PERUMPALLAM
Gomathi, don't cry.
Gomathi. why are you crying?
I was so worried..
that something happened to you.
Nothing happened.
It's the God that I prayed to..
that has brought you in front of me.
Not your deity..
Its Chinnarasu brother, who brought me here.
You could have told me.
I was so worried.
No, Gomathi..
My mother, sister, friends..
I was told by Chinnarasu brother not to tell anyone.
Where are you staying now?
With a friend of Chinnarasu brother.
Take me with you.
I won't go back there.
Gomathi, are you aware of what you are talking?
Kittu!
Every minute I am there..
I am terrified that they will kill me Like what they did to my father.
Please take me with you.
I should come..
along with you.
I should seek joy from that.
I should come..
As I search, without realising you should give
I should be elated with that.
As I near you day and night becomes beautiful.
Learn to love till life melts.
That's all I want.
I should not be away from you.
Even for a day.
We will unite.
I should come with you..
as your partner.
Should seek solace from that.
What that girl says is true.
It's not safe for her at home.
Let her be with you.
Like a tender climber..
I like to envelop you in this hill forest.
Without a glimpse of sorrow..
I will shield you till the end of my life.
Even if the whole place is against me
I will survive to live with you.
I your hand I will be hidden as your palm lines.
Will forget the whole world.
I should come with you..
Till it dawns..
Will float as the moon Will shoulder you.
Even after it dawns..
Will refuse to leave as the day dream..
to hear your stories.
Even if I scout for my whole life..
There is none other than you for me.
Don't try to leave my eyes.
Don't move away from me My life will be still.
I should come..
along with you.
I should seek joy from that.
As I near you day and night becomes beautiful.
Learn to love till life melts.
That's all I want.
I should not be away from you.
Even for a day.
We will unite.
I should come with you..
I don't know what you will do.
Before dusk, not a single person should be there before the police station.
Govind, really our boy didn't do anything right?
He didn't do anything.
Alright.
You hang up.
I will take care.
Greetings!
- Greetings!
Hey, look there.
- What?
See the MLA is here.
Chinnarasu you should have come to me.
I heard about it.
Give your concerns in writing
I will try to resolve this.
For that you can gather in public..
and create an agitation..
It's against the law and order.
If the law is in order why should be protest?
You are asking it in writing?
How many times we write?
We have written petition after petition and only left with sore fingers and dried ink.
If we gather in groups it's against the law..
If we say that the law is against us, will you listen?
- Chinnarasu.
Don't gather a crowd And don't trigger their emotions.....
Address your concerns in writing.
I will pass it to the Governor and will try..
to have whatever is possible implemented for you.
You only say you will do what's possible for you.
You are not positive that you can do something to address our needs
Don't play with words, Chinnarasu.
We can only go by what records we have.
Of course, what's on the record.
Are we asking you to implement a new law?
We are asking you to implement the law properly.
The concerns that we put forward are not against the law or off the record.
Our first demand is to bring Kittu back alive.
They should permanently relieve Kittu and his friends from the false cases frame against them.
In our well wisher Subramani's murder..
The four real culprits Gunasekar,Ramanathan, Palaikumar and Srinvasan... should be arrested.
Without any caste bias..
The dead should be carried..
on the common path, as ordered by the Court.
SI Selvaraj who is constantly working against us should be dismissed.
It's like a provision list.
They won't listen to us.
Disperse them using force.
We can't do that without Collector's order.
I am the MLA.
Just do as I say.
We definitely need the Collector's order.
Is it?
Then ask the Collector immediately.
Okay, Sir.
Balaguru (Chief Secretary)
What's happening there?
We are already have a President rule.
In such a situation a boy is missing in a village
How do we face the public and the media?
Actually they are staging a drama.
I don't think they are staging a drama.
I have my doubts on the police.
I don't know what you will do.
Take immediate action.
If Home Ministry and Human Rights commission are involved..
Then I will have to dismiss you.
Murthy!
- Sir.
If someone utters the truth on Kittu's whereabouts..
This case will be resolved.
Balu!
I know you are a very nice person.
You are not running after money.
But for how long will you Shuttle between the Lower and Higher Courts.
I will speak to the Law Minister..
Will get you the post of the Public Prosecutor.
Just one thing.
Let me know where that Kittu is?
Hey!
Come here.
Look!
No one other than us will know about this.
Take the cash.
Just let me know where he is?
Come here, ask your husband to say it out!
Come inside for a minute.
Come take the cash.
He is such an eminent person
- Just tell him.
Just tell him.
They have given the money.
Tell them if you know.
My father in law called me saying he wanted to talk to me.
When I went there I saw them all there.
Are we the clan lusting after money?
I told them to get out with money.
Else will chop.
Only then they left.
They are scared.
They are trying all tricks that they can.
First..
I was firm..
that I should not say anything even if they insist.
Then..
my wife and mother in law..
took me aside..
and spoke to me.
Then...
You told them where Kittu is?
- No..
No I didn't tell.
Then?
But..
for a minute I was scared that I will tell them everything.
I don't think I deserve to..
stay with you.
I am leaving.
Hey!
Why are you talking about all this?
You didn't say anything.
I didn't.
But, I was lusting for money.
I am leaving.
But one thing.
I will never think against you, ever!
All fighters have lost due to deceit.
Please don't make us lose this agitation.
Greetings!
Headlines.
The Arts college Student Kittu alias Krishnakumar is missing..
Under mysterious circumstances for over 5 days
To review the situation..
the Collector visited the Police station of Pudhur today.
He's here.
Hello.
- Greetings
I heard about this.
Give me your petition formally.
I will take immediate action.
- Thanks
Kiitu.

Everything is going as we planned.
The Chief Secretary directly spoke to the Collector.
Our concerns will be addressed in 2 to 3 days.
Really?
- Yes.
After everything is done.
On Friday, I will send Balu there.
You surrender in the Court of Madurai.
- Okay.
Till then be careful.
Okay.
- Listen.
Take good care of that girl.
Sure.
What did he say?
All these problems are coming to an end.
He says what we wished for will come true.
After it comes true?
You should tell me.
Marriage?
It didn't wink.
It didn't hold hands.
It just came inside and love has engulfed.
It sings its lullaby.
It gently wags its tail.
It didn't wink.
It didn't hold hands.
It just came inside and love has engulfed.
It sings its lullaby.
It gently wags its tail.
You will listen to my song, Every day.
It didn't wink.
It didn't hold hands.
It will just seek plain lies.
It will appreciate.
With you my bundle of colourful flowers.
It didn't wink.
It didn't hold hands.
It will just seek plain lies.
It will appreciate.
With you my bundle of colourful flowers.
You will not leave my nest.
It's only you that everyday
That her heart swirls Like a dust.
There's a joy..
That springs easily with this.
It will take the sword with love With lots of love.
It didn't wink.
It didn't hold hands.
It just came inside and love has engulfed
It sings its lullaby.
It gently wags its tail.
The bells on the feet will Hear the tune of the drums.
The Gods descent down to look at you.
The bells on the feet will Hear the tune of the drums.
The Gods descent down to look at you.
I have come in your dreams without telling you.
I will not be away from you in this life.
I have come in your dreams without telling you.
I will not be away from you in this life.
This struggling life..
Will be sheer joy hereafter.
Even if we shower abundant wealth
Won't get a person like you.
You dived deep to emerge with the pearl
My life!
It didn't wink It didn't hold hands.
It just came inside and love has engulfed.
It's sings its lullaby.
It gently wags its tail.
Wags its tail.
You will listen to my song, every day.
Sir, as I told you Kittu is near a small place in Kodaikanal.
My relative a young girl is also with him.
If you send the police and search for him there..
You will understand that I am telling you the truth.
Okay.
I will take immediate action.
Balu!
I want Kittu alive.
Go!
Make some tea!
Quick!
Sir has to leave.
You want sugar or palm sugar?
Bala Brother!
- Palm sugar.
When did you come?
Come.
I just came.
Chinnarasu Brother told me that you will come tomorrow.
The Collector signed this morning.
All your hardships will reap its benefit.
I am so happy.
Come.
We have to be in the Court before 4 PM.
Give me five minutes.
Be safe.
Bye.
Let's go, brother.
Which route are we taking for Madurai?
From here Vathalagundu..
Sempatti, Vadipatti and then we will reach Madurai.
What happened?
Brother!
Gopi..
Raja..
Ask him to take the Vehicle.
Brother, take the vehicle.
Ask him to take it.
Balu brother.
Ask..
Balu Brother..
Vehicle..
Get into the vehicle.
I am telling you to get into the vehicle.
Catch him alive.
Catch him alive.
- Don't leave him.
Catch him.
Don't spare him.
Catch him alive.
Don't leave him.
Catch him.
Run..
Kittu.
Surround him.
Gomathi.
Lawyer Balu betrayed us.
Lawyer?
Yes.
What happened?
Police.
Come.
I had my doubts, when the Collector said let it rest for two days, he was supposed to sign today.
What do you mean?
- But I least expected Balu to do this.
It's because of traitors like him..
that we have lost several times.
Under no circumstances should the police catch you.
Then all entire efforts will go in vain.
Alright!
You don't panic.
What we wished for will come true.
I'll never get caught to the cops.
I will hang up now.
You be alert.
We need to print posters
And paste it across the entire State.
Gomathi has come.
Kittu!
Did you think about what you are saying?
I thought about it.
Our people for ages have been suppressed and deprived..
and were hoping that someone will voice their concerns.
Now the entire group is seeing Chinnarasu Brother as their leader.
They believe there is truth in this agitation.
I don't want to go back..
and make it a lie.
Look Gomathi!
I wanted to do so much after becoming a Collector
If that has to come true..
I will have to really disappear.
Imagine what a lot of good can happen through Chinnarasu Brother.
I am leaving.
Then take me with you.
Gomathi!
If I take you with me..
Then the entire effort will become meaningless.
Everyone will talk ill that I eloped with a girl.
Try to understand.
In sometime..
all our needs will be fulfilled through the efforts of Chinnarasu Brother.
I have faith in that.
Wait till then.
I will call you after that.
This is the solution to avenge the death of your father as well.
Alright!
Leave.
Where did he go?
He didn't tell me where he's going.
He told me to give you this letter.
Chinnarasu Brother!
I am writing this letter with great joy
Our people will have to even beg for the water they drink.
they have to bend down and remove their footwear and can't even use the common path
Don't have access to education.
The struggle of our people go through should change Brother!
Every time someone asks me about my caste
I have hesitated
I was unable to say the caste
I have withered in pain and cried several times Within me!
No life born after this should go through this embarrassment
There are several struggles that have been defeated because of traitors.
Inspite of it several struggles have won because of sacrifice.
For our struggle to succeed
I should die.
Tell my mother, sister and Gomathi
That I seek their pardon.
Our struggle should succeed.
What happened?
Why are you crying?
What's written in that letter?
Tell me.
Tell me!
Greetings!

The student Kittu missing for over 15 days
'Was found dead and in a decomposed state'
- Sir!
Look there.
'in a hill near Kodaikanal.'
In continuation of this...
The District Collector fulfilled the concerns of Pudhur village people.
For weeks we were now on our way to our new home.
My margrave had been assigned to me by Meissen for my war.
In Franconian I had recruited craftsmen, peasants, maids, and servants.
I promised to protect them.
No one should bear more violence.
I had seen too many dead in battles.
I just wanted to get one.
I would build a village far from any arbitrariness.
Where we could live in peace.
I do not know if I could have done it,
If our path had not crossed with her.
(A horse is beating.)
Do you live with a girl who understands birth?
I'll lead you to her.
It also heals furuncles, ulcers, and abdominal cramps.
She is a child of the Lord.
Your prayer cord is quite thin.
So often she talks to him and asks him for mercy.
Stand up!
Go with her!
Mistress, a birth may take a long time.
It will be wanting us as a labor force.
Hop in!
(A woman screams.)
Where were you so long?
You are there to help your sister at birth.
I got help.
By bringing you to Bauerpack?
This girl understands herself at birth.
She lives with the shepherd at the river.
(Pain cries of woman)
I know who you are.
You have the muteness of your mother.
Make sure that the whine has an end!
And finally help me to a son!
Otherwise I'll cut off your hands and feet.
"Our Father, who art in heaven.
Blessed be your name..."
The girl understands herself on birth.
She can help you.
(Loud moaning)
Leave us alone!
I get fresh towels.
(Sob)
The baby is dead.
It poisoned her body.
She will also die.
I can do nothing more for her.
Wait!
To the right, you come straight into the yard.
Guard!
What do you want?
Where is the girl?
What girl?
Help!
(Bleating, hoofing)
Hildebrand!
Will you bring me my little bowl and my spoon, please?
Who's got my bowl with the mash now?
That's not funny.
You ate upstairs.
But there she is not.
Karl, do you have it?
Hedwig!
Father!
Nice to see you again.
Where is your husband?
Otto is on the hunt.
But he'll be back soon.
Come in.
- Follow me!
If Otto joins our covenant, Henry the lion roars.
Otto hunting better wild boar.
They taste better.
Lions are tough.
Come with the wine!
Was a long day.
Meat!
- Me too.
Albrecht...
Albrecht!
Why did not you send a messenger?
I expected you tomorrow.
We've ridden through.
The circumstance does not tolerate a delay.
I've heard of it.
Heinrich attacked Bremen.
The bastard kills and burns everything.
And we?
We hide.
The lion roars, and we do nothing.
Yes, cholera is to bring the lion!
What must still happen before the Emperor stops,
His protective hand over him?
Otto, it's up to you.
We need a sign from you.
I beg you.
Yes / Yes.
That's a good idea.
Eat and drink, strengthen yourself, then we'll see more.
Do not rush, we'll do something.
We need you together.
Otto!
- Slow, slow, friends.
Have you no influence on your husband?
Would you just give him the bed?
It was not my idea to take Otto to the consort.
But he will join the alliance.
We've heard that many times.
The lion plunders the whole country.
This time it is different.
It should be like in Altenburg.
He believes he can only win if Knight Christian is with him.
He's leading the plow rather than his sword.
Right.
Christian will build his own village.
Otto will give him a fief.
But then Christian must go to war with him.
And you will finally get what you want.
To your well-being, father.
On the Eure.
Let's hope that Christian is here soon.
What do you think, Father, do we create it before dark?
There are to be many robbers.
Trust only the Lord.
He is at our side.
Come, stay together!
Hildebrand!
You steal dinner.
Got you.
A thief!
(Cries)
What's going on here?
- She wanted to steal an apple.
This bitch.
What did you want?
Steal what?
Let's cut our hands!
- What's going on here?
We have a thief, sir.
She wanted to steal apples.
Sir.
Is that true?
Did you steal us?
Hack your hand!
Come here, you!
Hildebrand!
This is not our country.
It is not up to us to decide.
We will hand them over to the Landvogt.
Bind them to the car!
Come here!
(Cries)
Hold still!
Come, stay together!
Here you have your things back.
Stop!
Stay together!
(Cries)
Armed yourselves!
Hide!
Go to the others!
Go away!
Go away!
Are you going away?
(Primal)
Oh my God, he does not move.
Hildebrand, he does not move.
Is he dead?
Small swallows.
Are you?
Father.
Where is the girl?
I cut them off.
They would have killed her.
Clear the dead!
(Woman screams)
The child comes too early.
Wiprecht, we must go on.
Horrible, poor boy.
Let us pray.
"Lord, hear my voice, and pay attention to my loud plea.
Would you pay attention to our sins, Lord, who could stand?
But with you is forgiveness, so that you may serve in reverence.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Amen."
(Woman screams)
It can not get out, it's stuck.
We have to pull the child out.
No, she has lost too much blood.
If we do nothing, both will die.
Lord, we must do something.
The next village is still wide.
Do what you have to do.
Did you hear?
Keep your legs up!
Griseldis, take your time!
No!
Are you ready?
- She will not survive that.
What are you doing here?
Cut to the devil, where you belong!
Come, Hiltrud, come.
- No!
Why does not she survive this?
- She loses her last blood.
Can you help her?
She is a child herself.
Come on!
The child is wrong.
I have to turn it.
Where do you want to get that from?
You're fooling us.
(Whimper)
She will kill both.
And you allow this?
Murderess!
I told you.
Set them up!
Set up, whole.
And hold it firmly on each side!
You have to press.
OK?
- Yes.
Press, go!
Press, press!
Pressing, pressing!
I feel my head.
It is there.
Done, done!
(Baby cries)
It's full.
- He's quiet now.
Can you fix this?
- Yes, but it will take.
Luke helps you.
Sir?
I must speak to you.
What do you want?
(To whisper)
She stole.
The Lord wants to speak to you.
What is your name?
- Marthe.
And how can you do that?
My mother was a mother.
Why are not you with her?
- She's dead, it's been a long time.
We come from Franconia and move to Meißen.
Markgraf Otto needs efficient people there.
Are you a good man?
Yes.
You heard it, Marthe will accompany us.
We can use someone like her well.
If she wants.
Then take something to eat.
Come over.
Thank you Mr.
Who was this girl?
I felt that she hid a secret.
It scared the settlers.
But in those days I had no time to think about it.
We had to go on.
It's getting better.
Come, sit down!
The skull has broken through.
I have to wash out the wound.
This can hurt.
I need a piece of silver.
I need a piece of silver.
Hildebrand, you have a piece of silver.
Yes.
- She needs it for the boy.
Now she can pay herself.
I must close the skull with it.
Closing...
Get up!
But be careful!
When will I get it again?
Not at all.
It grows with the bone.
What?
Not that you'll be bothering Bertram.
Oh Jonas, that's so funny.
(Laughter) Very funny, ha ha.
Thank you, Grete.
- You are terrified by your avarice.
Emma, can you take him short?
Thank you very much.
Does Jonas already know?
What?
- That you expect a baby.
Is it from him?
I dont know.
There are riders.
Rider, rider!
There are riders.
Greetings.
Have you seen a girl?
A small savage.
We have not seen anyone for days.
The girl has the consort of our Lord and her unborn child
Miserably.
As I said, we have not seen anyone for days.
Hopp!
We move on.
Pack your things!
We break up.
Come on, grab your wagons!
Father is worse.
Stop!
Hold on!
Emma, help him!
Here, Father.
You must drink.
- Thank you.
(Voices) "She has the devil in her body.
Kill her!"
"Look carefully, Marthe!" "The woman is evil."
"Marthe shall not be like her."
What is she giving him to drink, sir?
Why does not she burn his wound?
Does he have temperature?
Can you help him?
You know why she does not help him.
Because he is a man of God.
Griseldis, stop the chatter!
I've seen it.
She has turned away from him.
Is that correct?
- No.
He is sick.
No one can help him.
It is not the wound.
- You lie.
You let him die like the child of the fortress.
No, it was already dead.
It died unbaptized.
A soul more for the devil, her master.
It's enough, Griseldis.
- Stop doing that!
My wife is already right.
It is true.
A bone that is supposed to grow with a coin!
She just wants to help.
It's enough, stop it!
You should stop.
He does not breathe anymore.
Marthe, Marthe!
No, my God.
"... and forgive us our guilt as we forgive our..."
"Fiat voluntas tua, sicut in caelo, and in terra." Amen. "
Come on, we have to talk.
My friends, you know what it's all about.
This girl is a danger to us.
She has a child on her conscience.
Since she is with us, things happen here...
We will soon reach Schüppchenberg.
And we are without spiritual assistance.
I tell the Lord to leave the camp...
Why is the ox not clamped?
I speak in your name.
We do not move until she leaves the camp.
She travels with us, she helped us.
It is salvific.
This can be of benefit to us.
The riders did not search for it without reason.
We are cursed when she travels with us.
It belongs to us, and no one sends them away.
But whoever wants to repent should do so.
Good.
Then we take the seed and the sheep with us.
We paid for it.
With the silver of the margrave.
Listen, that's all we have.
We left everything else.
That comes with us.
Take what you need.
But the cars stay here.
You have nothing to say to us.
We went along voluntarily.
So.
Do not take any consideration!
Without a car we can not make it.
Have you all lost your mind?
Without Marthe Hiltrud would have died.
Our former masters have hurt us.
Instead of wages there was beating.
Knight Christian is different.
He was born without land.
Everything he is, he has worked out.
If he wants to take Marthe, we should do that.
I trust him.
We made it.
On the other hand is our country.
Come!
Herewith I take you as a lieutenant.
And swear to be a righteous judge and judge
And to protect thee and yours from mischief.
Take the land I promised you as a fief
To legitimate possession and bring it to flourishing.
I want you to accompany us.
- To Meissen?
Yes, a blacksmith has a suffering.
I want you to look at this.
I hereby take you to the feudal lord.
I swear to God to serve you,
To protect you and your friends, both in war and in peace.
N / A?
Do not you want to see the banquet?
Come over!
(Music)
We can not do that.
- Whom should it disturb?
Come over!
This is the Markgräfin Hedwig.
And this is the margrave.
Randolf is also sitting there.
Otto's strongest vassal and Christian's worst enemy.
It is said that Randolf had murdered his wife.
I raise my cup to our new feudal lord.
As you know, I owe Christian my life.
Without him I would be terribly dead before the gates of Altenburg.
On Christian!
One of us.
The castle was once my home.
Now I felt strange.
Too many of the feudal men sought salvation in battle.
Above all Randolf, who did not shrink back in his greed.
Christian!
Good to see you.
Is the dry thing all following?
Well, do not go too hard with our hero!
Otto should be grateful for everything.
Should not we cross the blades again?
Eieiei, swords can also rust.
Beautiful rub with linseed oil, then it does not break.
I thought you would not let you see.
Come here!
This is Marthe.
Marthe will look at your leg.
That hurts?
I do not think you can hurt me.
Oh, that hurt.
Lie down!
You should not contradict what?
It is not the leg.
It is the back.
(Scream)
Au, au, au, girls, girls!
Girl!
Do you want to kill me?
Is better.
You will have to spare the leg.
Is no longer stiff.
The Markgräfin sends me.
She wants to talk to her if you can.
What is?
Come over!
Come over!
Mistress?
I can not remember anyone who is our gun master
A scream.
How did you heal his leg?
- It was not the leg.
The pain came from his back, he was crooked.
Crooked...
You know, one of my sons is sick.
He has a fever that nobody knows.
And sometimes he becomes unconscious.
Would you look at him?
Good.
But you can not go.
Susanne, prepare her a bath and get her something to wear.
This is the best place to burn.
And then get me when she is so far.
Look, there is a beauty among all the muck.
It's enough.
Now we'll see Dietrich.
Dear.
This is Marthe.
She will examine you.
Was he left behind?
- Mhm.
I need salt.
Throw it to the ground!
What are you doing there?
Oh, Master Lehnhard.
This is Marthe.
She came with the settlers and is healed.
This is a girl.
- Your judgment is important to me.
It's about Dietrichs Wohl.
- Such a treatment is complex.
It weakens him.
How are you talking to me?
Leech is the safest means of attack.
If you do not want someone to investigate Dietrich,
Wait outside!
Go on.
I need rosemary tincture.
Or the strongest wine you have.
And I need more blankets and a warmer.
You came with the settlers.
Do you know Ritter Christian?
Yes.
And his horse?
- You mean Drago.
Drago belonged to my father.
But they could not ride him, he was too wild.
They wanted to kill him, everyone was afraid of him.
But then Christian knightly tamed him.
No one else did that.
Drago is the fastest horse I know.
What is he lacking?
I can lower his fever, but it comes back.
He has the disease of travelers.
Ague?
How do you know all that?
The Margrave would like to see you.
- Equal.
Immediately.
And the girl you will bring.
Is this Marthe?
I was told that you were at my son's bed.
What do you allow yourself?
I asked them to.
- I did not ask you.
What is your name?
- Marthe.
What?
- Marthe.
The Medicus is a learned man, he is in my service.
Why do you question his judgment?
I should have you whipped for it.
Forgive me, sir.
She travels with me.
If she did something wrong, I'm guilty.
Then you better take care of your rabble, huh?
And hold on to you, soon we will go into the battle together.
Yes Mr.
I count on you, Christian.
They come back.
Sir!
Welcome, sir.
- Great!
Lord, as we have discussed.
This leads to a straight road.
We divided everything into parcels.
The smithy comes to the left.
See what we have done!
Here please.
Everything as you wish.
The gateway to our new village.
Large, powerful, with a real fall lattice.
To keep enemies if we have any.
Here is the market square.
On the market square, our Mother of God.
Then the well.
And next to it the taverns.
Thanks.
- Thank you Mr.
It was a long and arduous journey.
And some of us have been sacrificed.
A lot of work is coming to us.
But look at the country!
It will reward us richly if we know how to use it.
Christian village!
Yes, Christiansdorf!
Our village grew and grew.
Every day he did what he could.
Here I was no knight, no warrior.
I was one of them, just as I wanted.
Our dream of a peaceful life was close at hand.
The wound looks good.
You are rich.
I often let my head go.
A horse team and rider!
My mistress.
- Please stand up.
I regret that your coming was not announced to me.
This was not my intention either.
I want to talk to Marthe.
Comes.
I want you to come along.
He is in very bad shape.
(Voices) "...
Disaster over you!"
"Shut up!" "The devil's wife!"
"Kill her!"
"Marthe shall not be like her."
And?
I'll prepare a Sud for him.
(Neigh)
Dietrich, he feels that you are not doing well.
I will never ride on Drago.
But once you get well again.
Come, jump on it!
Why did you get stuck?
I do not know what you mean.
When you examined him, you were frightened.
Why?
You have to tell me he's my son.
He will die.
When?
- Not now.
But I do not think he'll be up next summer.
His body is too weak.
Where do you want to get that from?
Forgive me, you are right.
Nobody can know that.
I want an answer.
I can not talk about it.
- Why?
I want it from you.
Dietrich means everything to me.
You should experience him if he is better, how clever he is.
I could not stand if he died.
Do not force me, I do not want that.
I'm sorry, I did not want to push you.
What you say remains among us.
You're welcome.
I can see it.
It's like a light.
It is cold.
Dark.
I can see when it goes out.
And there's nothing you can do for him?
May I help you?
Karl!
Forgiveness.
Luke, with strength alone you will not win.
Use your mind!
Lord, forgive me!
- What's up?
Marthe needs someone to look after her.
She must get married.
Wiprecht would take her, even without a dowry.
He needs someone to take care of the household, the children.
What does Marthe say?
Get them!
Marthe, come on!
Christian wants to talk to you.
With the head, mind over force.
Marthe, do you want to marry?
Would you like to marry Wiprecht?
He needs a woman.
No, I do not want to marry.
Well, then I see no reason to hurry.
Emperor Frederick sent messengers far out of the country.
All princes are asked to travel to Würzburg.
There will be the court day in six weeks.
All right.
The Emperor needs us.
(Whispering)
And?
What does the messenger say?
The Emperor wants to hold a court day in Würzburg.
All princes united.
The feud is to be ended.
He wants to force the lion to make peace.
Whereupon do you want to go?
The Emperor is on Henry's side.
Do not you understand that now is the time to strike?
Everyone is ready.
And also Knight Christian goes with the battle.
This is the opportunity.
If we defeat the lion,
We can make peace ourselves.
How do you speak to me?
Where is your place?
Here in Meissen at my side, or at your father's court?
You have the hatred of your father.
What do you know about the war?
When we go against Henry, the blood will soak the fields.
I am ready for it.
But I am also ready to make peace.
How kindly you are.
When you speak to our son, you are hard.
But before the lion you hide like a coward.
So it is true what one is telling.
You were with the Benedictines.
As a child.
But then my brother died.
And my father needed an heir.
Forgive me for invading you so immorally.
But I have to speak to you.
Your men are ready to go to war for Otto.
And now they are disappointed.
What do you mean?
- There will be no rich prey.
The Emperor invites to the court day, he wants to make peace.
And Otto will follow.
Somebody has to make sure that Otto can not go back.
It is not enough for you to be the wife of the margrave.
You have higher goals.
We have something in common.
What do you think,
What happens when Henry's men attack a village?
Here with us.
At this time.
Then Otto could no longer hold out.
Let us pray.
(Cries)
Henry's men attacked the Mark Meissen.
They attacked peasants and burnt down a village.
Markgraf Otto demands your feud.
You shall come to Meißen.
Brecht still today!
Thanks.
Let the village have something to eat and drink.
Otto von Meissen calls for the feudal lordship of our Lord.
Knight Christian must go to war.
Henry the Lion attacked Otto's country, and he strikes back.
We are placed on our own, without the protection of our Lord.
You called for me?
Drago has broken the shackles.
I need something on the road, so it does not get any worse.
I make an ointment, camphor, and rosemary.
It's wrong what your doing.
You are going to war, though the seeds are missing in the fields.
Hildebrand will fix everything as long as I am gone.
And you think that's enough?
Without you, it will not be possible.
Marthe, others also have to leave their villages.
But their villages are many years old.
And the first winter will be the hardest, you have said.
That's what my father gave me.
He got it from a nobleman because he saved his life.
If the need is great, bring it to the chamberlain in Meissen.
From what you get for it, you can buy what you need.
Are you serious?
This is from your father.
How should I sell it?
Marthe, I'll be back.
Do you need anything else, sir?
No thanks.
Finished?
We have to go.
Take good care of my people, Hildebrand.
I'll be back soon.
We wish you a happy hand and an early return.
We need you here.
Thank you.
- Farewell.
The Lord be with you!
Heinrich went too far.
He believes he can do what he wants.
But we will show him where his place is on earth.
He will bite his teeth.
Before Magdeburg, we encounter Albrecht's troops.
There we join them.
So, let's determine our army leader.
(Calls) Randolf!
Randolf!
Randolf!
Randolf!
Ritter Randolf is a brave man.
But I tell you, courage alone will not lead us to victory.
In Altenburg the victory was ours.
And why?
Because we fought together and wisely.
And there was one among you,
Who has distinguished himself by more than just his courage.
Knight Christian, stand out.
Christian, just to.
Yes, come!
He is an unfreier, his father was a farmer.
Would you like to deny Christian honor?
Has he ever denied you or your companion the escort?
Is one here in the hall, only one,
The bad thing about knight Christian?
He should say it now.
Come on, talk!
Speak!
So, speak!
Who is to guide you?
Christian!
- Christian!
Randolf!
Christian!
- Christian!
Randolf!
Christian!
Christian!
Christian!
- Christian!
You have made a good choice.
Christian!
- Christian!
Now the lion has shouted.
What do you play for a game?
Pst.
Have you lost your mind?
Will you fool me?
Let me go!
- So you can not treat me.
What are you talking about?
- Just from this farce.
We had an agreement.
- I beg you.
I have no influence on these decisions.
Without your advice, Christian would never have become an army leader.
My dear, you want to win the war.
Is not it your interest that the best lead the army?
I will let Otto know what you are doing.
Yes, please, try it!
I wish you much success.
What do you think he will believe?
His faithful consort?
Or the boundless knight,
Who spreads lies from injured vanity.
Hm?
Lie?
Did you want to say something?
Christian!
You have come far.
It just asks how.
On the side of the margrave or in the lap of his wife?
You're not just insulting me.
But also the margrave's wife.
Lord, what does the dog care?
Stop!
On the spot!
Stop!
How dare you pull the gun in my castle?
He deserved it.
I am your strongest vassal.
My men are going to battle for you.
Your men?
You all live in my country, my country.
My!
And your men have sworn to me the fidelity.
Me!
We are at war.
What he has done is betrayal.
Treason is punished with death.
You have always faithfully served me.
So I will spare his life.
But your troops are coming to me.
And you yourself will stay here.
And your guilt in the service of the margrave.
So, take off!
He will come back safely.
These are Albrecht's men.
Have the Wettins finally left their castles?
Do you welcome the Margrave?
Are you the leader?
Then come along.
Follow the river Elbe.
In the villages they need flour and turnips.
The men are missing in the fields.
Then continue west.
For the settlers in the hollow is iron and seed.
Do not lose time!
Return before it gets cold.
Are you this Christian knight?
- Yes.
How many men do you lead?
- Two dozen.
Does Otto's margrave have any more to offer?
Well then.
Lead your men to the end of the valley.
We wait there for the others.
At New Moon we attack the Lion's Castle.
So get ready.
What have these men done?
They served the lion.
We all are in someone's service.
This is not a crime.
For me.
Hüa!
Who is the blacksmith here?
There is enough.
Here, take!
- Thank you.
Also for all?
- Just take it.
Have you no wine?
The bread can hardly be eaten.
Drop your teeth.
Forgive us, we have no other bread.
You!
Bring me wine!
I dont have any.
- Then please take care!
Look, the sweet little bird!
I know you, do not you?
From Meissen.
Look at me when I talk to you!
You were with Christian, right?
Is this his village?
This coffin?
And the rulers are his peasants?
Does he care well for you women?
What have you got there?
Show it!
A knight with whom I fought had one thing round his neck.
Thieves rabble!
The margrave lets you cut off your hands.
You did not stole it, did you?
He gave it to you, did not he?
Beautiful girl...
All alone here?
A scream and I'll slit your throat.
I knew Christian had a weakness for farmers.
His stable smell will not let go.
(Cries)
Who wants?
You?
No no!
No mice!
Thank you.
Do me the favor and tell your nobleman of our meeting.
I would be lucky if he asked me for a double fight.
You should get married, Marthe.
You need someone to protect you.
Yes.
If Wiprecht still wants me,
I agree with the wedding.
Blow this blade well!
The scout is back.
Have you seen troops?
- 300 men.
They will reach Henry's fortress in three days.
We can not wait, we must attack.
Otto, we can overrun the lion and his castle.
It is impossible to take it in three days.
When their troops reach us, they attack from two sides.
My prince, I fear no battle, but it is futile.
I have not come here to hide.
We will attack and if it is the last.
There is another possibility.
We must stop the troops.
Have you lost your mind?
- An open battle against Henry?
No open battle, an attack.
When the camp burns and they lose their horses,
The lion needs days to gather his troops.
And who should be so crazy to lead this attack?
Give me ten men.
So be it.
"Is God for us, who is then against us?
The Lord, who did not spare his Son, but gave for us,
How should he not give us all with him?
Neither death nor life, neither angels nor heirs, no powers... "
"Thus saith the Lord:
I trust you forever.
For the bridegroom of my faithfulness, thou shalt know the Lord... "
So I ask you, Marthe.
Do you want to love and honor this man whom God entrusts to you?
And the marriage with him lead in good as in bad days,
In health, and sickness, till death be forgiven, answer:
Yes I do.
Christian, watch out!
Yes I do.
Come here!
Come on, you're my wife.
Undress yourself!
You shall undress.
Say three times the father-in-law.
I'll see if you can.
"Our Father, who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name, unto us thy kingdom come... "
They are back again.
Come all!
A young knight.
Did you see Christian?
He is in his hut.
Get Wiprecht, he wanted to speak to our Lord.
Forgive.
You're hurt.
Can I look at the wound?
I ride to the next village, Father Roland.
I'll get my things.
How did this happen?
Who supplied you?
A Feldscher.
Marthe, who hit you?
I ask for your blessing, Lord.
He's married.
You have my blessings.
Who is the lucky one?
Lord, rest first.
The trip was exhausting.
What had I expected?
The order of the world left no connection between us.
In the battle, the thought of Marthe alone kept me alive.
But now we were farther apart than ever before.
Wiprecht!
Yes?
Do not think I have not seen the traces in her face.
You will treat them decently.
Lord, the Markgräfin is here.
Mistress.
Why do not you celebrate the victory at Hof?
Somebody has to burrow the dead.
Horrible, such a young fellow!
But one day Henry will pay for suffering,
Which he brought over the country.
- We'll all pay for that.
I know you blame me on the war.
But you will understand me.
Only when Henry is down there is peace.
He is not yet defeated.
We have won only one battle.
I know.
- What brings you to me?
My son.
Dietrich is sick.
She said he will die.
Who?
Marthe?
How does she know?
You do not have to protect them from me.
I know their gift.
I know she sees things that others can not see.
She could help Dietrich.
But something prevents her from doing so.
She is afraid of her abilities.
Give me the girl.
In a monastery you can help her to use her gifts.
Do you think Marthe wants that too?
They can not know what is good for them.
Forgive me my open words, Mistress.
It's always up to you, and Marthe will help your son.
But I will not force her to anything.
You have sworn allegiance to Otto.
If he wants it, you have to do that.
But you want that, and not him.
Is it not enough for us to go to war?
Marthes place is here in the village.
I know you will respect that.
It was our first spring.
We had survived the winter, and everyone was full of confidence.
I'll take the sack.
Thou shalt not bear.
But something did not let go of me.
Marthe.
I wanted to be close to her and could not.
Salt, fresh salt!
Yes!
Precious.
Barley?
For barley there is a half shell.
Who has what?
The most beautiful school.
Because it gets warm under the ass.
I'm glad, thank you.
Vegetables?
- And flour.
A beautiful stone.
All the best to you and your village!
- You also.
Christian!
God, look at this!
Oje, oje.
- Without the salt you are easier.
Come, help, at the same time.
Hurry
And again!
- One two Three!
Come here!
Older.
Have you hurt yourself?
- Yes, by the stone.
I've already seen this in Goslar.
This is not a normal stone.
- Rather?
This is Bleierz.
What?
- What is Bleierz?
Silver.
- Silver?
What!
We have already transported.
But so much in one spot!
Silver!
- Madness.
In the end your whole village stands on silver.
On silver.
- On silver!
Attention!
So rich silver ore
They have not yet seen in Goslar.
With God...
The stars are really good.
You have to get miners, many.
But that is difficult, the winter will come.
People need to be cared for.
We wait until spring.
I'll send you millet, barley, and everything you need.
The silver makes us rich.
But we should give ourselves time.
We have not.
The right of the mountain lies with the Emperor.
To him belongs all that is deeper in the earth than a plow digs.
And now, after our victory over his cousin,
He will hardly allow us to dismantle the silver.
So we have to get as much out of the earth as possible,
Before the Emperor learns it.
Lord, the people in my village have traveled far.
They have been badly treated in their homeland.
I do not want to expose them to arbitrariness.
These people, as you call them, are entrusted to me by God.
You distrust me with them.
My prince, if I may say something.
If you want to spare Christian and his men,
Why do you not proclaim the right of the right?
This could speed up the matter very much.
There will be enough people to win the ore.
Truly, Randolf is right.
We will not be able to get the silver out of the ground sooner.
Then rascals will cross my village.
They will not have anything to eat and they will take it by force.
What do you think?
(The music is silenced.)
Do you want to make me a fool?
What does not matter?
I consider everything.
Play on!
(Beat)
The Markgräfin wants to speak to you.
They will overpower you, thieves, despair,
You and your village.
You will only keep the misfortune.
The silver will take Otto.
You will need someone here to help you.
Otherwise Randolf will take it all over.
And you are?
With your permission, but how would you stop Otto,
To proclaim the general right of mining?
This does not have to be your concern.
And what is the price?
You know him.
Marthe.
I want to help her.
- So she can help you.
This is when you are Lord.
- That's no help, Markgräfin.
You also have to make difficult decisions.
It is up to you whether you want to protect your village or not.
I had no choice.
I had to send the people to whom I wanted to be so close.
Maybe forever.
I want you to go to the monastery.
The healing women there will teach and receive you.
I need nothing to learn, I am needed here.
Marthe, that is not a request.
It is a gift from the Markgräfin.
I thank her for her generosity.
But she can not decide about me.
But I.
I want you to pack your things.
Luke will take you there tomorrow morning.
And who should take care of everything here?
Take care of your father!
I'll be back.
What do you want?
Do I need a reason to visit my husband?
At this time of day?
The silver will make you rich.
All of us.
And no one here will have to eat more of pewter pots.
This is not what worries me.
Rather?
When people come here, the Emperor will know.
Would not it be better to dig quietly over a longer period?
What do you think?
So you think I should let Christian try?
Why trust him so much, hey?
He is the only one to whom such a task can be entrusted.
I am concerned only with the silver.
Do not sell me for dumb, yes?
I know that this is not all.
Do not you think I've imagined our marriage differently?
Go down immediately from me.
Get down!
You are only interested in hunting and your whores.
You are satisfied with what you have.
But I'm not.
I am so much younger than you.
And if you are long dead, I will still experience,
As one of my sons will be far more than a margrave.
So let me do what I think is right.
And you can do what you think is right.
In the end, it will be the best for us all.
Come together!
I have to speak with you.
Bring people together.
Comes.
The Markgraf has given us the permission to win the silver.
Wonderful!
He will send us material for huts and digging.
I'll get miners in Goslar.
Yes, we are farmers, we can not.
Much things will change.
But you will continue to do your work.
You can rely on that.
Then the village will be prosperous.
It is a pleasure for me to tell you,
That we will take up a peasant girl.
A peasant girl has no dowry.
She will go to Joseph's house as long as she is here.
This is Marthe.
Mucking.
You said she was afraid?
She wants to hide it, especially from herself.
We must ask the Lord for patience.
It's up to her, she has to want it.
Forgive me my urge, but my son is seriously ill.
I do not have the time.
- I know.
But only she can determine her gift.
I have to learn.
When do I begin?
Do you know this plant?
- Masterwurz.
What do you need them for?
- Wound healing and stomach ache.
And those?
- Liebstöckel, against the full body.
Coltsfoot, against cough.
I can not teach you anything you already know.
You sow, get up!
High with you!
Come on, come on!
Come on!
Come on!
High, let's go!
High with you!
Get up, up with you!
Stand up!
High with you, you lazy bastard!
Do not look like that!
It must get up, otherwise it is settled.
Stop it!
This is my only horse.
Go!
I take care of it.
The wound must be washed out.
Rabies.
It has the disaster in the mouth.
It will die.
What?
I...
I do not know that.
- Yes, you do.
(He murmurs syllables.)
(Voices) "We ask you, let him rest in peace
And raise him up in the day,
Whom thou hast appointed according to thy promise.
Give it to the eternal pleasures.
Do not remember his sins.
And give that his end is full of peace.
Heal the grief of the living by your comforting spirit.
Give us all a blessed ending through Jesus Christ, your Son. "
"Oh God, what is that?"
"He moved."
"She's with the devil." - "Did you see it?"
"Holy Mother of God, protect us."
"Heaven is with us."
Here you can see the Silver Line.
In the village everybody was happy about the silver.
They did not follow the melting furnaces at all.
We took the ore out of the ground, and some dreamed of wealth.
I could not guess how high the price was.
That's why I'm here?
This is what you want to teach me?
I do not want that.
(Woman screams)
"Shut up!" "The woman is possessed."
"Your daughter shall not be like her."
(Neigh)
Holt Marthe, please.
Dietrich needs them.
We have no more time.
Remains.
You must come, please.
What?
- The son of the margrave...
He is here.
He is dying.
Joseph shall do it, he shall help him.
He is old.
He never cured people.
The boy needs you.
My mother...
She said she taught me.
That I can not help it, that I am only a child.
Only one child.
"She has the devil in her body.
Kill her!"
"The woman is possessed."
I had to watch, so I would not be like them.
Your mother has protected you.
It was their decision.
Just because people do not understand it does not mean,
That it is repugnant to God.
There is nothing wrong with keeping life.
What you can do is not your own.
It belongs to the people.
Do not be afraid of it.
Christian, the margrave is waiting for you.
Follow me.
Christian!
Sir.
Let me embrace you!
Hildebrand.
They are hard.
Send the men to the hall!
They are to eat and drink as much as they like.
You accompany me on the hunt.
We meet at the Devil's Head.
Hey, this is not a place for a small man.
I just wanted to caress him.
Dietrich...
I thought you were in the monastery.
- That's me, too.
You look changed.
- That's just the dress.
Help me up!
We'll do better together.
So, it's enough.
You have to spare a bit.
I have to tell Father.
What happened?
He has not had a fever for three weeks.
Now he has left his camp and is no longer holding.
Thats not what I meant.
Marthe!
- I have to.
See you later.
Christian, come here!
We have been waiting for you.
Wish a successful hunting!
We will make rich booty.
And we divide ourselves, three men each.
Christian comes to me, Friedhelm, too.
And you're driving the drivers.
Here we go!
(Loud whine)
Further apart!
What are you gazing at?
Would rather be with the hunters.
Do not hit anything.
(Animal cries) Oh.
Comes with!
(Cries of a young animal) Pst.
(The screams are louder.)
A trap.
- poacher.
It calls his mother.
Wait!
Give me the horn!
- What you up to?
(Horn signals)
It comes from there.
We want to be the first.
Leave the boobies!
He who can not ride shall creep.
Come, quickly away!
Sit down.
Rest and ride back to Meißen.
Here!
Come here!
Come on!
What has happened?
A bear mother attacked him.
Hol Marthe!
Get Master Lehnhard, quickly!
Burgvogt, if you want the margrave to live, then bring Marthe.
Mrs. Hedwig, the margrave is wounded.
Randolf lured us to the trap.
He knew that the bear mother would defend her boy.
Christian...
Where have you been, huh?
Why were not you with me?
In Altenburg you are always always by my side.
What happened is no accident.
You must understand that silver will change everything.
No longer will that be the strongest of all the feudal men.
But the one who bestows them.
This is not Otto's world.
The old man...
God already knows what he is doing.
Christian, will you come to my house?
We both, we...
It would be so much to us.
The margrave has lost much blood.
But he will survive.
What do you want from me?
I thought we should clear that before you return to your village.
What is there to clarify, Randolf?
I'm going to make sure you get enough silver today.
The margrave is no longer in a position to do so.
What is this thing about?
Well, well, well.
We do not want to begin cooperation in the dispute.
Everyone will do their own thing.
You will get enough silver.
Let me say one thing:
Do not eat me with trifles!
You certainly do not want me to come to your village
And show you how to do this.
Hedwig would never allow that.
Do not disappoint me!
What's wrong with you?
This must go faster.
Not sleep!
Go on, go on!
Hurry, men!
How long will this continue?
We can not.
The oxen must be on the field.
And we need a break, sir.
We continue.
- But we have to catch the harvest.
They did not understand.
I just wanted to prevent worse.
Randolf was capable of anything.
We had to satisfy the greed.
But what could I expect?
Go, girl, faster!
Emma!
Emma!
Emma!
We bring them into the house.
(Sob)
Now all the men out!
Jonas, Christian, all out!
Press!
Pressing, do you hear?
And press, press, press!
Do not stop!
You have lost too much blood, you have to go on.
You can not stop now, Emma.
Go on and on!
(Cries of pain)
Lot, one, two, three and three...
Yes!
Next, next, next!
You did it.
You did it.
- Show...
Quite quiet.
What is?
What about my child?
No, Martha!
What about the child...
(She screams incomprehensibly.)
All good.
No!
No!
Oh God, no.
No Please not.
I'm sorry for what happened.
I want you to return to work tomorrow.
When the melting furnaces go out, we lose days.
Do you think it was my fault?
No, do not say that!
You can not help it.
It does not help, we go on.
Take up the work again, take your tool into your hand!
Go to the devices!
Where is Christian?
- In the forest, beat wood.
What is to happen?
How far do you want to go?
It's all about silver.
We have nothing of it.
What do you think of talking to me?
The people here believe in you.
They would give you their lives.
You should not take advantage of this for the margrave.
Marthe, I can not disobey my master's command.
Then he is to fight with us for his food.
He takes what he wants, and you obey him.
And that from your mouth, yes?
A thief, a thief, who surrenders to the first man,
Who leaves her in his house and his bed.
Stay!
Marthe...
Marthe, Marthe...
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
More air!
Hermann, we stop.
- What?
We stop.
Stop it!
Goes home!
It's enough for today.
We take the time we need.
Stop it, it's enough.
You should go home.
Last time it was more.
You leave behind.
Do you get the silver yourself, huh?
No sir.
- We do what we can.
But we must also think of the harvest.
That is not enough.
I told you, take care of the silver.
You'll eat from me.
With permission, but the village must be able to provide itself.
What do you allow yourself to speak to me?
Show respect!
I've never let it go against you.
A quarter less than last time.
I warned you.
I will announce the free mining right.
Everyone is to come
And get the ore out of the ground.
And for this to happen,
I will send Randolf to you.
I beg you, sir.
- You're not capable of doing so.
Randolf will get my people.
- You can leave.
I beg you, Lord, decide if you are better.
I waive your advice.
Go.
Go.
Go!
Go.
Lord, I do not understand.
Where do people want to live?
They will have their camp at the river.
Who is to supply them in winter?
They take what they need.
Anyone who uses your services must pay you.
They will not do that.
- Hildebrand!
A vogt will come.
You all know him, it's Randolf.
He will only monitor the ore mining.
Nothing happens to you, in my honor as a knight.
Now go back to your work.
Why Randolf?
He will provoke you.
I know, but he will not succeed.
And if so?
Why should it?
What about you, Marthe?
Marthe, come, it's late.
Thief!
He's a thief.
He stole my apples.
The woman is lying.
- Open the bag!
If you want something, you pay for it.
Roger that?
So welcome to us.
We must get along as neighbors.
Christian!
My friend.
I look forward to sharing everything with you.
Come on!
Go back to your work.
(Laughter)
What?
(laugh)
Hey!
What do you want here?
- Shall we drain in the talkessel?
Keep the Markscheiden!
You want everything for you.
This is where the digging begins.
- Do not touch me!
This is what I am saying.
- We have the gruesome.
Come here, you!
Christian!
Christian!
Christian, my lord.
The miners, there is strife.
Stop!
Go away!
Where a man wants to dig silver, he is to do it rightly.
Are not the words of the margrave so loud?
Here ore is everywhere.
Go somewhere else and leave us alone!
What happened?
They attacked our men.
They are supposed to arm themselves.
- Nothing at all.
We do not like that.
- We should not trouble.
You said we had to wear them down until they made mistakes.
They have already made the mistake.
He is hurt.
I saw him, he can hardly hold his sword.
Do you want to challenge him to fight?
He will challenge me.
Greetings.
Christian is to come to Meißen.
The margrave wants to see him.
He should hurry.
Must have been very convincing.
Make sure you get lost!
Make my horse the iron!
Thank you.
With your permission, you still owe me the reward.
I am the Lord of the village and owe you no wages.
Christian is our Lord.
And he said that you must pay for our services.
You stand in my way?
Take this as a reward!
Lord, hold on!
Jonas!
He did not want to pay.
- What has he done?
These men have raised their hands against me.
Come!
Put the two in chains!
30 whips and then off into the block!
Karl!
What are you doing with my son?
I did not do anything.
- Come on!
Let mildness rule!
Anything else?
If you were not of noble birth, I would put you to them.
(Cries)
Christian!
- Burgvogt.
The margrave sent me a messenger.
No, I did not send anyone.
But he is one of you.
Wait, I ask.
Christian, I sent a messenger.
But he did not go to you, he went to Randolf.
This is all my fault.
I left him as a vogt, although I knew how he was.
I'm so sorry.
Jonas, hey!
Do not, Marthe, no!
Marthe!
Look at me!
You can do it.
So, it's enough.
The wound must be sewn.
Whipping, now.
- Sir!
All right.
(Cries)
Stop it!
You're welcome...
Let me go to him!
Get out!
Or should we put you in the block?
Come over.
He is unconscious and does not feel anything.
- He will die.
Jonas would not want you to endanger your life.
Come come.
Marthe.
We can not accept it.
- Want to fight?
If it has to be?
- And die?
We must do something.
Ride to Meissen and give Christian notice!
You must hurry, and no one is allowed to notice.
(Laughter)
Come here, join us!
Keep the whole night watch?
What do you care?
We can also have fun here.
Come!
Be the first.
Tomorrow, Luke.
So early on the road?
- Have you seen Ritter Christian?
What's happening?
Where is Christian?
He's gone.
- What?
Since when?
Since yesterday evening.
Christian, see what they've done!
My son!
My son!
What happened?
Randolf denied Jonas his reward.
Karl only wanted to help him.
Jonas has lost a lot of blood and does not come to himself anymore.
Wait here.
You can not go alone.
- You should wait.
Christian!
Leave the two free, immediately!
They raised their hands.
They had their reasons.
The blacksmith is injured.
In the block he dies.
You dare to ask such demands here.
The two do not interest you.
You want me.
Leave her free, and you get me for it.
Only the margrave can judge you.
I will confess that I took silver.
And therefor let you free my people.
Bind them!
Have not you heard?
Bind them!
Get rid of them!
Knight Christian, I accuse you of the theft.
You have misused trust and silver.
Capture him!
Stop.
Since you crawled out of your hole, you just made trouble.
You wanted to turn the world upside down.
That heights are free, and peasants determine their own masters.
Now your arrogance revenges, and no one is with you.
The margrave will decide on this.
Do you think he can help you?
You will not dare doing that.
You can not be so stupid.
She did not tell you, did she?
Well, she's ashamed.
We had fun together.
I took them first and then looked at them,
As the others had their fun with it.
You want to fight?
We should have finished it in Meissen.
Get him out!
Marthe, stay here!
Tie him!
Give him his sword!
Ah!
Marthe, you can not...
Marthe...
She attacked me.
Everyone has seen it.
Watch what I'm doing with her!
Come here!
No!
No!
Let me go!
I'll drown you like a cat.
This happens when you are as stiff as you are.
Let go of my wife!
(Cry of pain)
Christian, stop!
Let Otto judge him!
Marthe!
Please, Marthe...
She lives.
So listen to my verdict.
Knight Randolf, you have blame for yourself.
To the atonement you will go on pilgrimage to the holy land
And there for 40 days the pilgrims guard.
Knight Christian...
Compensation for suffered irreparability
And as a reward for your fidelity
Your fief shall be hereditary.
And after your death no longer fall back upon the margraves.
So that his children be born free.
Thank you.
Marthe!
Come here!
Bow down!
Lord, if you will grant me a wish,
Raises Marthe to my booth that I can marry her.
You want to marry?
This girl?
Without them I would not stand before you today.
So be it!
Arise, Mrs. Marthe.
Stand up!
Do you like?
Please rate these subtitles.
Help other users choose the best subtitles.
Half for you and half for me.
Come on.
Hey.
You'll be rid of me soon.
Stop that crap.
You'll be back on your feet soon, and then you'll help me.
You can't leave me alone with your uptight sister.
She said she'd come visit you soon.
See this scar right here?
She did that.
She nearly poked my eye out.
Your grandfather always told me:
"Your sister is not a sissy like you."
But who's the one who built all this, huh?
I did.
I did all this, for you and your mother.
Isn't that right?
You are great with the animals.
That makes me happy, Jona.
Now get lost.
What was Mom like?
I can't remember her at all.
I want to sleep.
Come on, Papa.
I don't know anything about her.
- It was so long ago, Jona.
So long ago.
He asked about you.
Why won't you talk to each other?
There's a lot to do right now.
- There's always a lot to do.
But there isn't much time left.
There's nothing to talk about.
He's your brother, damn it!
I can see you really care.
Would you stop that?
Dude!
Move it, Maik!
Don't let the others do all the work.
Even the girls are faster.
- Excuse me?
I've got the short stick.
It's so small!
It sucks having a short stick, eh?
- Shut up, spaz.
Cow utters are hairier than your balls.
Knock it off, you two!
- Got a problem?
Enough, guys!
Just learned how to piss standing up, and they're already mouthing off.
You got this, Lasse?
- Sure.
What?
Out with it.
I'm going to study.
For real.
I got accepted.
Don't look at me like that, man.
With your shitty grades?
- Yup.
Theology.
Theology?
- Yeah.
African Studies minor.
No admission restrictions.
I'm gonna apply for a student loan and sew my wild oats, baby!
And finally get out of here.
Out of this fucking "dead zone."
When it's over... then it's just over.
Spare me the damn hospital stench.
Beautiful woman.
Shit.
It'll heal quickly.
Want one?
- No, actually I don't smoke.
I'll bring you some ointment tomorrow.
Do we know each other?
Anka.
I'm here to help you out with your father.
Martha?
She called me.
I dreamt about an angel... who helps me fall asleep.
She really is beautiful.
Yeah.
That's my mom.
She died in a car accident.
I'm sorry.
I'm tired.
I'll come tomorrow and help you.
Good morning.
- Hey.
This is for you.
It fits all the locks.
You can put your things in the cupboard over there.
Take anything you need.
You can go.
It's not like the city.
Fresh air.
I could never live in a city.
Too noisy, too hectic.
Like they say:
once a farmer, always a farmer.
But I had all kinds of silly ideas when I was young.
My dream was to be a swimmer, together with Ron, my best friend.
We trained together.
Ron was an idealist.
That's why he took that job in mine reconnaissance.
I was always at the farm.
I inherited it from my dad...
Do I get any of that?
- Someone has to take care of the cattle.
Sorry.
Special recipe for Burghardt.
I had no choice.
- Okay, then we'll make a deal:
You give me some of whatever that is, and I'll let you get between my sheets.
I'll give you some, so I don't have to get between your sheets.
What's wrong, Papa?
-"What's wrong, Papa?" This!
These pills, every day!
Calm down.
- These pills!
The whole fucking thing!
I don't want them anymore!
I can't go on!
Then you'd finally be rid of me!
Fucking bullshit.
Think of yourself too, man.
That's all I'm saying.
I mean, come with me to Berlin.
We'll rent a really cool apartment.
With one of those hot tubs, and a massive balcony.
We'll hang out all day in bath robes, puffing cigars.
And girls are only allowed in bikinis.
Right.
I'm serious, Jona.
The women there are so damn dirty.
They're all shaved.
And the way they walk!
You two got something going on?
Did you score yet?
- Shh!
Damn, you're killing me!
Ask her out.
If you don't, I will.
I did ask her out.
Lasse!
You wish.
- Lasse!
Get back here!
- What's your problem?
She's yours.
I don't even want her.
And I'll get her, too.
Martha.
How can something like this happen?
You parked in the middle of the path.
And this is better?
Of course it is.
- Stay here.
I'm talking to you.
Martha.
That girl, Anka, is here now.
I organized her.
She'll assist him.
- Assist him?
-Yeah.
But I want to...
- Tomorrow.
Not today.
I want to fly kites like in the old days.
But now it's time for bed.
- No!
We never do what I want to do!
Oh, just look at me.
If this keeps up, then...
I'll end up like your mother.
No!
What did you say?
Can you hear me, Papa?
Can you stand up?
You stupid old man!
You stupid old man.
Sit down, please.
Is he on medication?
Is he in treatment?
- He's in his second round of chemo.
Skin cancer.
It's spread to his head.
- Please sit down.
It's great.
I mean, it will be when it's done.
It's not done yet, is it?
Hey, come here.
You're significantly less ugly than you were yesterday.
Almost presentable.
Thanks.
WOW]
It's just a hobby.
Are you crazy?
I'll buy one.
I'll buy them all, when I've got the money.
You could pay in installments.
What are you doing here?
I'm looking for Burghardt.
He's not doing well.
- He's not here.
After all these years.
What happened?
Martha, please.
- You're dead to me.
And it better stay that way.
Martha, I wanted...
Hey!
What the hell was that?
Keep going.
What's her problem?
No idea.
Fucking hell.
I have to go.
I'm going to church.
It wouldn't hurt you to go once in a while, either.
Papa.
I'm fine.
I know...
I thought that dose yesterday would do me in.
Have you come to finish me off with a large-scale pharmaceutical attack?
No, Anka cooked a delicious chicken soup.
With fresh bread baked by two ex-junkies.
See how much Martha teaches them?
- Martha this, Martha that.
But nobody gives a damn that I need you.
Nature transforms their souls.
Okay, come on.
- Alright.
Let's go eat soup.
You're annoying.
You're annoying.
I heard that!
What are you doing?
- Fishing.
Get out of there.
You'll get an infection.
Don't worry, that only happens to women who never get laid.
You're nuts, Anka.
No!
No!
And you have very nice...
Tits?
Yup.
I still need it.
- Want it back?
Give me my net back.
- Then I want a big fish.
Okay, pike or trout?
I'll take a trout.
For you.
They're good.
Really good.
- I'm a designer, baby.
I'm serious.
You should do something with it.
Life doesn't wait for you, I learned that.
Who was that guy the other day?
- What?
Who was that guy you had an argument with?
No one.
An old admirer.
Is that how you treat old admirers?
My life is none of your business.
I don't have to explain anything to you.
You can all kiss my ass.
Hey.
- Hi.
Do you have a lot to do?
I'm almost done for today.
What are you going to do with all your free time?
I'll find something to do.
Like what?
Ouch!
Sorry.
Papa!
I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
Come on, get up.
I'll call a doctor.
- Don't!
I will!
I can't do this anymore!
- You can!
I can't take it!
- You can!
It's okay.
You'll be fine.
I'll call an ambulance.
Someone will be here soon.
I'd like an ambulance at
It's okay.
Can you go on?
Do you have any strength left, Papa?
Don't you have the courage?
There's nothing I can do.
Get out.
Now.
Martha, I...
- Here.
Boskoop apples.
They're his favorite.
I'm sorry.
Oh, pardon me.
You getting ready to go out?
How are you?
I'm sort of busy with dying at the moment.
I have to sit down.
This is Ron.
This is my son, Jonathan.
Ron, is it?
- Yes.
We have a sow named Ronja.
Jona, will you take me home?
Don't get carried away, Jona.
It's okay.
I can do it.
Can I do anything?
- I've got it, thanks.
Oh, no.
- It's okay, I'll do it.
Lately, somehow Papa's been... sad in a different way.
I don't know.
When he's dead, then...
The towels are there.
- Thanks.
I had another nightmare.
It happened at Gerti's and my wedding.
Jonathan was there, as old as he is now, even though he wasn't born yet.
And there was wheat growing inside the church.
There was a field inside the church.
We start towards the altar.
The priest was so short, only his head was poking out of the wheat.
As I'm leading Gerti to the altar,
I stumble over someone lying on the ground in the grass.
Ron's lying there... in his protective gear, fiddling around with a mine.
He turns to me slowly, opens the visor of his helmet
and just shakes his head.
And that's it.
Then...
Bang!
I've seen people where... almost all their organs had failed, but they still couldn't go.
Something was holding them back.
Something unfinished.
If you want to die... you have to let life in.
Even if it's only for a day.
Gerti had a dress like that.
But hers had flowers on it.
It's so different being alive after you've experienced death.
Death is overwhelming.
I had an accident once.
It was pretty close.
There was so much.
It was really hard to find my way back.
Smell this.
What does it smell like?
Grass?
I don't know, tell me.
The origin.
Home.
What?
Don't expect me to turn into a farmer and start milking your cows.
Nope.
I saw Martha.
- You don't say.
She nearly blew my ass off.
You had it coming, Ronald.
She loved you.
Do you still think about it, sometimes?
I've thought of nothing else, all these years.
It made me sick, what happened.
What we did.
I hated myself for it.
And I tried to hate you for it.
It takes energy to hate.
And I don't have any left.
Hey!
- What?
You used to think that was funny.
You did, not me.
Asshole.
- No, you are.
But it's true.
- You really made tons of cash.
Hello.
Come here.
Jona, sit down.
Ron's just telling me about Iraq.
- That's just great.
Good stories and booze.
That mixes real well with your meds.
Give me back the bottle, Jona.
Please.
Speaking of stories, tell me something about Mama.
- Not now, please.
Yes, now.
I don't know a thing about her, Papa.
She worked at the kiosk, and I bought ice cream from her.
I bought tons of ice cream, every day, for weeks until she noticed me.
Then she told this joke that I didn't get.
I stood there like a moron.
It was so embarrassing.
Then I grabbed her and kissed her.
Did that really work?
No, not really.
Then what?
Nothing.
End of the story.
He's not good at those things.
Did you take your pills?
- Later.
Anybody want a coffee?
- Papa.
You have to take them.
What's the use?
I puke all day and just feel like crap.
Don't worry, Jonathan.
I'll take care of it.
Oh, you will?
Yes.
What would we ever do without you?
Jona, please.
- Ron.
Show me how you'll take care of it.
I've never seen you before.
Then you show up, and now you'll take care of it?
I'm only trying to help.
Thank you.
I don't want any trouble.
- Good.
I'm here for Burghardt.
I see.
An old friend comes and takes over.
That's great.
Actually it's terrific, because it means I'm off duty.
I could do whatever I want.
I could go to the movies.
Yes, go to the movies.
- Anka, let's go to the movies.
I haven't been in three years.
You know why?
Because I got up every morning at 5 AM to take care of my father!
Every morning!
And where were you?
- This is about what Burghardt wants.
You don't have a clue!
- Stop it, Jonathan!
This isn't about the two of you.
Wait.
Anka, where are you going?
I think you've got a few things to sort out in your little family.
You can't just go now.
- Your father asked me to.
He wants to be with Ron.
He wants to stop taking his pills.
Regardless of what we think.
He doesn't know what he's saying.
- Stop treating your father like a child.
He knows exactly what he wants.
It's that easy?
Then I was just a little bonus fuck, eh?
Get your life in order first, okay?
Come on!
- So, very carefully...
Vaddi, get a move on!
- But what do I do?
Follow the calves.
- Down there?
Come on!
Come on!
This way!
Come on!
You steaks.
You walking steaks.
Come on!
That's just for pussies.
Get away.
You've got no soul.
You're too late.
You're behind in your work.
Look who's talking.
Your brother's dying.
Settle your shit before it's too late.
You have no idea.
- Then say something.
Or just run away, like always.
You and your father, both.
You can't handle the truth.
Talk to me!
- Hey!
Stop this bullshit.
- Stop it!
Get lost, Jona.
Leave me alone.
Stop it.
A romantic idea: suddenly you can talk just because somebody's dying.
If you want to talk, why don't you ask your father?
Your mother was a wonderful woman.
He destroyed her.
And not just her.
I just want it all to be forgotten.
We're at the Deichblume for the weekend.
Don't worry.
We'll be back Monday.
I couldn't help it.
I...
I was a coward.
You still are.
She suffered so much, Ron.
But I never thought she'd throw away her own life.
That...
We're the biggest assholes.
The biggest assholes in the world.
Hey, hey!
Jonathan!
Ron!
Please don't.
Please.
Get lost.
Get lost!
I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry for?
For being gay?
For Mama killing herself?
For the bullshit car crash story?
What exactly are you sorry for?
You never loved her.
- That's not true.
Your heart's so big you can love everybody, right?
I don't give a shit about your love.
Do you think it was easy for me?
She was sick.
You were so little.
What could I tell you?
The truth!
Tell me the truth.
Her death was your fault.
What would you have done if that guy hadn't showed up?
Taken it to your grave?
I never saw him again.
- Why didn't you just fucking leave?
I did.
Your mother got sick.
I didn't care.
I couldn't do it anymore.
I packed my bags and just left.
Just like that, Jona.
I could hear you crying.
I got in the car and drove away.
You want the truth?
That's the truth.
How did she do it?
I want to know how she did it.
Tell me.
How?
Tell me.
Tell me!
- With pills.
She took pills.
I want him to leave.
I've got about two weeks left, and...
- And what?
What?
You want to... what?
Be alone with him?
Finally go on your honeymoon?
These are my two weeks.
The skin cancer's devouring him.
Burghardt has metastases in his brain.
Your father didn't do anything wrong, Jonathan.
He couldn't do it right.
Don't you see?
He spent his life punishing himself for your mom's death.
Because it was his fault.
- She made the decision to stay with him.
Come on.
He keeps asking for you.
So, are you gonna marry me?
I told you, not until you grow some chest hair.
But I've already had chemo twice.
Come here.
Sit up.
Okay?
Wait.
You're not getting in my bed with socks on.
What's wrong?
- The tube.
Careful.
Should I stop?
- No, no.
Keep going.
I'm sorry.
No, no.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Hi.
What happened?
My father is gay.
- Really?
Oh my God!
They lied to me my entire life.
They didn't love each other.
No, they hated each other.
I want to show you something.
Come on.
I told her everything about you.
Every last detail.
But she'll be as silent as a grave.
She promised me.
It's okay.
She died, that's all.
Take care.
She was all alone.
No relatives.
Can you imagine?
Not one.
But she died well anyway.
Practically glided away.
Morning, sleepy head.
Come on.
Vitamins.
They're good for your health.
Did you eat?
Oh yeah.
Gourmet slime.
Thanks.
With a knife and fork.
Since when can you cook?
Jona!
He meant well.
Jonathan, please.
Please.
Tell me the truth for once.
If I didn't exist, then you'd be...
Then I'd...
Then this wouldn't have happened.
I kept you from living your life.
What are you talking about?
- I kept you from it.
You're the best part of Mama and me.
You're my big boy.
I love you a hell of a lot.
You stubborn ox.
Hail Mary, full of grace
The Lord is with thee, blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus.
Asshole.
No, you are.
The morphine doesn't help him anymore.
Did you hear me?
Can you help me?
I am scared.
You're almost there.
Martha.
I'm sorry.
I...
I love you all.
Papa.
Stop!
Stop!
Freeze!
Stop!
Hands in the air.
Turn around, slowly!
♪ NCIS:
LA 8x10 ♪ Sirens Original Air Date on November 27, 2016
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Thank you.
You're welcome.
This wasn't me.
You think this was a coincidence, G?
After everything our team's been through?
They've been after Hetty, Granger, and me.
I know.
I just feel bad that the sheriff's department had to pay the price.
Your dad okay?
Garrison?
Hetty sent him to a secure location in Santa Barbara till we figure this out.
You cool with that?
Why wouldn't I be?
We barely know each other, the guy wants to stay with me?
Agent Callen.
Deputy Bennett.
This is my partner, Sam Hanna.
Very sorry for your loss, Deputy.
We know what it's like to lose a teammate in the line of duty.
I appreciate that, but these aren't our guys.
Excuse me?
We have 18,000 employees in the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department, but these aren't two of them.
I don't know who these guys are, but they don't work for us.
NCIS has a couple of reasons to look into this, so we'll be happy to assist.
Be my guest.
And when you find out who these chumps are, impersonating us, let us know.
Will do.
Thank you.
Okay, so if these guys weren't real sheriffs, maybe they weren't here to help you.
Maybe they were here to kill you.
Yeah, well, then, who killed them?
You're sure your old man's out of town?
Eric, what do you make of the security footage from my yard?
I think our shooter is a woman.
It wasn't Hetty, was it?
No.
Young.
Athletic.
And clearly capable.
So, good news is, a dog-walker just called in a stolen sheriff's car, and it's a couple miles from you.
Sending you the address now.
Good work, Nell.
We're on it.
Fact:
I once did a stint as a dog-walker.
I was 15.
Aw.
I bet you were so young and eager and cute.
Yeah.
Maybe a little too eager.
Uh, first trip out with the dogs,
I forgot those little baggies.
That wasn't so cute.
So we just received confirmation that the law enforcement officers killed on Callen's street last night were not, in fact, law enforcement officers.
Eric and I are still trying to figure out who these guys are, in addition to tracking down the shooter.
I see.
Mm-hmm.
Something else?
Come, sit.
Um...
I'd really like another chance to question Carl Brown.
Do you think he's going to treat you differently today?
Probably not.
But I'm not ready to give up.
Hetty, even with him in prison, the internal threats keep coming.
They know where we live.
They know who our families are.
We really don't have another choice.
And...
I have a plan.
Uh-huh.
You've got no idea who the guardian angel might be who killed our phony sheriffs?
No.
Keep thinking.
And you're sure your fath-- sorry-
- Garrison is actually in Santa Barbara?
If Garrison had done this, there wouldn't be any bodies.
Thank you.
All right, well, maybe he just wants to spend the time he has left being part of your lives.
It's his first time finding family, too.
He's had other families.
But now all he has is you, your half sister, and your nephew.
You have told Alex?
I will.
I want to.
I just...
I don't want to...
But you're thinking twice, especially after this morning.
Like father, like son, maybe.
What's that supposed to mean?
Keeping family secrets to protect your loved ones.
That's pretty much what your dad did to you and everyone else in his life.
Huh.
This just keeps getting better.
Strategic location.
I don't see any cameras.
No, whoever did this was a pro.
Stay close, partner.
So, just to clarify, this woman kills two fake sheriffs in your front yard, steals their stolen cop car, and then torches it?
Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious who we're looking for.
Do tell.
I mean, this whole situation just reeks of an angry ex-girlfriend.
So Joelle is pissed that you broke up with her, and now she's taking keying your car to a whole nother level.
Are you serious right now?
You did keep her dining room set.
She bought that for me.
That was a gift.
No, for the both of you, but now it's just a painful reminder of what could have been.
Why are you playing along with this?
I'm just glad you're okay.
Morning, gents.
Without further ado...
Both of our phony sheriffs had surveillance photos of this woman in their phones.
Is this our shooter?
Confidence is high.
I don't recognize her.
Me either.
Check out your home-security video.
What's that look like to you?
Looks like she's going to your front door.
Maybe she was trying to warn you.
So why not just call me?
No access to your phone number?
Everything good?
My neighbor thinks she may have seen something last night.
I'll go talk to her.
We'll double-check the crime scene.
Well, looks like it's just me and you again, Egon.
You know, if, uh, you want to be home with Kensi,
I can just call you if anything comes up.
No, no, no, because both my mom and Kensi's mom are coming to visit.
And it turns out that's just too many moms.
Hi.
How was your run?
It was great.
I made you some breakfast.
Aw, you didn't have to do that.
Gotta keep your strength up, honey.
Okay, let me just help you with this, honey.
Oh, whoa, definitely don't have to do that.
It's no problem.
Thank you.
I picked out a couple outfits for you.
I'll help you get changed when you're done.
Okay, you know that?
Can we just...
Can we just stop for a second, please?
What's wrong?
What do you need?
I don't need anything, I just...
I need you ladies to leave me alone for a second, okay?
We're just trying to help, sweetheart.
No, I know.
I mean, that's the only reason we're here, honey.
And I appreciate that.
I-I really do.
But, um, you're kind of driving me nuts.
Would you prefer we do this one-on-one?
No, Mom, I would prefer if we did this none-on-one.
And, plus, I'm supposed to be able to do these things by myself, so...
You are.
And you're doing great.
Really doing great.
Okay, stop telling me I'm doing great.
I am not ten, I know exactly how I'm doing.
She's getting frustrated.
The doctor said there'd be depression.
Okay, stop talking, both of you, please.
Maybe we should call Martin.
Would you like us to call Martin?
No.
Nope, not at all.
You really don't have to call Deeks.
I'm calling my son.
Oh, my gosh.
Okay, you know what?
I have something you can both do.
You ladies have the day off.
Good-bye.
I am so embarrassed.
Oh, don't be.
Mine's just as bad.
Is it too early for a drink?
I like the way you think.
You're a good mom.
I can tell.
You, too.
Let's go.
Okay, I swear I'm gonna get my gun!
What?
!
Why don't you just...
So... it's a bad time?
Sorry, I thought you were my mother.
Never mind.
I would have brought you flowers, but you didn't seem like the type.
Come on in.
Thank you.
Okay, let's start from the beginning.
So where'd you first meet?
Where'd you go?
What'd you do?
Come on, Carl, you gotta give me something here.
Why?
What are you gonna give me?
What do you want?
Out.
Right.
Look, Sam's been interrogating people for a long time... and I haven't.
So I'm gonna tell you a story.
The summer after I graduated from high school,
I started going out with this guy who... most people would call... a "bad boy."
Tattoos, piercings, he drove this ridiculously loud car.
But he was actually... he was really sweet.
Especially to me.
So, when he started hanging out with this rougher crowd,
I naturally asked him not to.
Asked him to spend more time with me.
But... he didn't listen.
Oh, boohoo.
He broke your heart.
Happens to everyone.
No.
He, uh, he broke into an electronics store and stole a pallet of DVD players.
So, at the end of the summer, he went to county and I went to college.
Wait, are you saying that crime doesn't pay?
I wrote him every day for, it felt like weeks.
Then he stopped writing me back.
Please tell me there's a moral to all this.
I was young.
I thought I could help him, save him, but I couldn't.
I never saw him again after he went into jail.
Maybe he's in here with me.
Wouldn't that be an ironic twist?
Oh, wait.
I didn't just spoil your M. Night Shyamalan moment, did I?
No.
He's not in here, Carl.
Darn.
See, like yourself, he thought he was smarter and tougher than everyone else.
Until a group of inmates took turns stomping on his head until they crushed his skull.
I guess he wasn't so tough after all.
No, he was.
He was a lot tougher than you, Carl.
You may be in solitary, but there's still a price on your head.
It's just so nice to be wanted.
You know?
Honestly, how long do you think it's gonna be before some inmate and crooked guard make a deal and split the cash?
Huh?
Yeah, as much as I love your company and your stories unless these turn into conjugal visits...
Oh, that's cute, Carl.
...I got nothing left to tell you.
Mm-hmm.
I know that.
Yet you keep coming.
It's kind of sad.
Dude.
You've been over here humming for the last ten minutes.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't even ask you to harmonize.
♪ I'm here, you're here ♪
♪ I'm here... ♪
That's a hard pass.
You're trying to make me sing the Garfunkel parts and I'm obviously a Simon.
All right, Paul, take a seat.
Your lurking's making me nervous.
What just happened?
We get something?
Uh, no.
Just my hourly reminder to stand up.
To evil?
No.
So my feet don't fall asleep.
I don't understand... this.
Oh, you don't have to.
That's why I have Nell.
Touché.
Do I even want to know?
I'm just wondering how you're gonna try and get me to talk next time.
Well, Carl, today's my last visit.
And to be honest,
I never really needed you to talk.
You see, every time I come here, word gets out that Carl Brown's meeting with a federal agent.
Again.
Inmates-- they start to wonder,
"What's he telling her?
Who's he ratting out?"
Visit after visit.
"Ooh, that Carl.
"He must be a real Chatty Cathy, or they wouldn't keep coming here to see him."
The inmates start to get nervous, especially after we start rattling their cages.
And so, what do they do?
Well, you know what they say:
"Snitches get stitches.
And turned into bitches."
Everyone will want you dead regardless of the $50K on your head.
And the next time someone comes to see you, chances are, you'll be willing to talk, from the infirmary.
Assuming... they haven't cut out your tongue with a razor blade.
Yeah, they do that, too.
Maybe Natalie never called me or wrote me since I got put in here because she's dead.
Maybe someone was after her and killed her as soon as I was out of the picture.
So, what, someone else put the hit out on you?
I don't know.
Natalie never told me who she was working for.
Why should I believe you?
'Cause I gave you her name.
No, you gave Sam her name.
I'm not Sam.
I met Natalie at the Promenade.
Some dive bar.
Then the next day, we went to the pier.
That's all I have so far.
Oh, I can definitely work with that.
Nell, you rock, seriously.
Uh, is that a lead?
'Cause it sounded a lot like a lead.
Oh, well, Nell says that Brown first met Natalie at a dive bar near the Promenade.
Mm.
And then the next day, they went to the Santa Monica Pier.
Which bar?
Oh, he won't say, but apparently he bought tacos at a nearby food truck later that night.
So, of all the popular taco trucks...
Tita and Chilias, uh, Navarette's, uh, oh, Pepe and Mondo's.
A lot of these trucks have social media accounts that announce their serving locations.
So we can tell where they've been.
You are correct, sir.
Thank you, sir.
We just need to know when.
Right.
Well, we captured Brown two years ago, November 24.
Wow, you were ready to go with that one.
Although he did hold you at gunpoint.
Gunpoint and syringe-point.
Yikes.
Anyway,
Natalie had to turn Brown,
Brown leaked Hetty's info, poisoned Granger-- that takes us back a few months.
Like, June?
Hey, what are you doing?
Relax, I'll put it back to Nell level when I'm done.
All right, these are the taco trucks that serve in Santa Monica.
All right, I feel like we're gonna find something here.
Ready, no whammies, no whammies.
Stop!
Pepe and Mondo's slung their tacos on Santa Monica Boulevard outside the Sunset Ocean Bar.
Which is on the Promenade!
And I just exploded my fist bump, which is a whole new low for me.
So now we're into this rabbit hole of despair, what's next?
Now we just wait for facial rec to pull up photos from the bar.
Wait?
What?
There's no other leads for us to follow?
Hmm?
No, not yet.
Well,
I'll pull up some photos from the Santa Monica Pier the next day, but it might take a while.
Welcome to Ops.
Okay, so we've got all this Star Trek gak and your giant brain, you're telling me all we can do is wait?
Yeah.
No.
All right, hey, Siri, can you tell me where Natalie is?
Alexa?
Cortana?
HAL?
Bueller?
Anyone?
We don't have an AI.
Well, we should.
Beale, take a letter.
"Dear Henrietta, it has come to my attention..."
Um,
I'm not your secretary.
Nor would you have to be if we had AI.
Hmm.
What now?
More wiggling?
Huh?
You want to do some Pilates?
The guys posing as our sheriffs are one Perry Verona and one Dexter Frazier, owners of VexSun Solar in Culver City.
Okay, I would take you with me, but you seem to have a lot going on here, so I'm gonna go.
Hey.
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.
As promised.
Okay.
Address is on the way.
I am calling Callen and Sam.
Beale?
Mm?
You're good people.
Okay.
Tell Deeks we'll meet him there.
All right, he's on his way now.
Right.
Okay, let me know what you find.
All right, Eric.
Bye.
So, uh, Deeks is gonna meet us at some solar roof company where the two phony sheriffs worked.
A solar company?
That sounds bogus.
You think?
Here.
I promised Mrs. Ramirez I would share these with you.
I'm sorry, we had to chase down that lead.
What if she actually saw something?
That poor woman hasn't seen anything clearly since Reagan was president.
Shh.
She still thinks he is.
So, uh, looks like you're gonna have to move, too, now that your address has been compromised.
Yeah.
I know.
Do I detect a sense of nostalgia in the High Plains Drifter?
Don't tell me you actually settled on one place?
Of course not.
No,
I'm just thinking about how Mrs. Ramirez might feel.
Right.
Seriously?
It's four walls and a roof.
I can find that anywhere.
Oh, please.
You've been domesticated.
I knew it.
I knew it.
It was over as soon as Joelle got you that dining room set.
Enough with the dining set.
Thing's going on Craigslist.
Sure it is.
Puttin' it up.
Yeah, right.
Thank you!
Neighbor see anything?
Please.
His neighbor's glasses are thicker than my head.
Mrs. Ramirez was scared.
She just wanted someone to talk to.
Aw, that's sweet.
She's sweet, all right.
Sweet on G.
Oh, older woman.
Hey, Mrs. Robinson.
Mrs. Ramirez is a very sweet old lady.
Please do not say anything sexually perverted or crude, all right?
You're not leaving me a lot to work with, here.
Why is he so grumpy?
You'd be grumpy, too, if your ex left two bodies on your lawn.
I'll be really pleased when Kensi gets back.
Not seeing a lot of solar companies on here, but in case you need to get your fax machine repaired, or we could stop by the Nader campaign offices.
That list needs updating.
We're looking for VexSun Solar.
Uh, it's upstairs.
I can show you.
You guys contractors?
Federal agents.
You have any security footage we can look at?
Uh, no.
Our video surveillance has been down for...
I don't think this building's ever had video surveillance.
So are you guys FBI?
Or NSA?
SEC?
NCIS.
What about IDs?
Got any electronic records of people coming or going?
Uh, no.
We haven't had that system installed yet.
Uh, I'm actually thinking about becoming a federal agent.
Uh, yeah, all I ever do is watch those true crime shows, and I'm perfect for undercover work.
I'm basically a chameleon.
It's just this way.
Wow.
Law enforcement is definitely for me.
I was leaning towards FBI, but, you know, maybe LAPD or NCIS.
I'm really keeping my options open at this point.
Deeks is LAPD.
He's done a lot of undercover work.
You might want to talk to him.
Mm-hmm.
Door?
Okay.
Looks like a bogus front to me.
When's the last time you saw anybody in here?
Uh, yesterday afternoon.
I had no idea they were moving out.
These men work here?
Yeah, both of 'em.
You going to answer that?
Well, it's a number I don't know.
I've been getting a lot of crank calls lately.
Could be a hot tip.
Hello.
Vinny?
How'd you get this number?
From my what?
From my business card?
All right, I gotta call you back.
Did you give Vinny the security guy my business card?
I-I mean, he wants to get into law enforcement.
You'd be a good mentor.
Where'd you even get my business cards?
Got a whole box of 'em on your desk.
Well, at least you had a box on your desk...
This is why I'm getting all those prank phone calls.
Deeks, look at it from a community safety point of view.
Now the entire homeless population of Venice has a direct line to the LAPD.
Hold on a second.
You gave them to homeless people?
Yes.
I thought we were picking on him today.
- I don't play favorites.
- Hey.
Sorry for sending you guys on a wild goose chase.
Well, they were there, we just didn't get there early enough.
You find anything else?
Maybe.
Our phony sheriffs and solar roofing guys are both former military-- army-- although they never served together.
What'd they do after service?
Uh, truck drivers... in Iraq.
Mmm, I smell private contractors.
You got a company?
Uh, maybe.
Ashmati Trucking.
Eight years ago, the owner died and then there was an ugly inheritance battle between the survivors, which ultimately killed the company.
It happens.
Well, these were private contractors working in Iraq, making a lot of money.
Just because the company they worked for went belly-up, that doesn't mean they're not still doing it.
Which takes us back to the question, who were these guys working for and why did this woman kill them?
Which is exactly how we started this day.
Well, Deeks' new buddy, Vinny, said there were six people working out of VexSun Solar.
Two women, four men.
So we've got these two.
The rest are still out there somewhere.
I'm on it.
Hetty...
The wolves are at the door.
I can feel it.
I'm not sure it's safe to trust anyone anymore.
I just wanted to come by and say thank you.
Thank you for what?
Making my time in the hospital bearable.
Oh.
Well.
In that case, I suppose I should thank you, too.
I was in a bad place and you helped pull me out of it.
Well, you were an ass about it, but...
Well, that's a gift.
I just also wanted to say... good-bye before I left.
Where you going?
Back to my unit.
Medical Board restored me to duty status.
What?
!
Yeah, yeah.
That is awesome!
Been sitting on my ass long enough.
And the guys are gonna ride me relentlessly and the one-legged jokes will never end, but it'll be good to get back with my guys.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
I'm...
Is this your truck?
Yeah.
You're impressed.
I'm... more like embarrassed for you.
It's very obnoxious.
Oh, you can't fool me, Kensi Blye.
I know a redneck girl when I see one.
Okay, I am not a redneck.
Well, you'll like this bad boy.
You know what they say, the bigger the truck...
The dumber the driver?
Well, I know you want to go for a ride.

So... did she ever introduce you to her friends?
No.
I told you.
Look, I'm tired and my back hurts.
I want to go back to my cell now.
You should probably try straightening up.
You know, shoulders back and down.
You know?
Suit yourself.
Nah.
Oh, wow.
Is this Natalie Grant?
Hmm.
I found her.
I know who she is.
- The woman from outside my house?
- Yes.
It was Natalie Grant.
Carl Brown just confirmed to Nell that she's the woman in the taxi photo.
Also the same woman who shot the phony sheriffs.
She also goes by Amber Wilcox-- a massage therapist from Houston, Texas.
Uh, I can only trace her back 12 years.
That's a good cover.
It allows her to move around, cash business, no real address.
Smart.
She's on the run now.
But if she was coming to kill Callen, who are the two dead sheriff wannabes that tried to stop her?
What if she wasn't sent to kill me?
What if she was turning to me for help?
Think about it.
She's Carl Brown's handler.
She talks him into trying to kill us, but we catch him, put him in jail.
So then they try and kill him in prison;
we beat 'em to it and put him in isolation.
Now he's talking.
So now they're going after her.
It's not like she can go to the police.
Which means she's in a pretty bad situation, if she's turning to the very people she tried to kill.
Well, she knows she's running out of time and we're probably the only ones that can save her.
Well, if Amber/Natalie turned Brown, she probably knew where he worked.
Why wouldn't she just come here?
If she knows where we work, the people she works for know where we work.
They're probably watching us now.
It's too risky.
Yikes.
Well, by now she's probably out of town or at least gone into hiding.
For all we know, she's working with the same people who tried to kill her.
If that's the case, all her hiding spots are blown.
Okay, so what do we got?
We got family, friends, boyfriends.
Mm-hmm.
I mean, Carl Brown was her boyfriend.
Hey, what if she's at Carl Brown's house?
The file says that he inherited it from his aunt three years ago.
The feds seized it when he went to jail.
And Natalie would have a key.
Not that she needs one.
My God, man!
You're better than Siri!
Thank you.
I'm coming with you.
Why?
Because my career depends on it.
Deeks, take Hetty in the Audi.
All right.
We'll take my car.
Uh, Miss Daisy isn't supposed to drive.
Come on.
All right.
Fraggle Rock!
Oh...
We must've beat Callen and Sam.
Yay!
Yeah, I think we also beat the sound barrier.
Yay.
You, by chance, weren't the one that taught Nell how to drive, were you?
No.
I-I gave her a few defensive driving lessons.
Yeah, I can see that.
You should probably get a haircut.
Oh, don't worry.
Next time, I'll...
I'll wear a helmet.
Possible a parachute.
Definitely a diaper.
Told you she was fast.
How'd you beat us here?
I took a shortcut.
The sidewalk.
You took a sidewalk.
She's in there.
Federal agents!
Natalie?
Amber, we're here to help!
Stay close, Hetty.
Hetty?
It's over, dear.
Please stop.
I said I'll talk if you provide me with a lawyer and protection and witness relocation.
That's quite the list.
I have quite a lot of information.
We don't need a lot of information.
We just need to know who you're working for.
Then give me what I need.
There's nothing here.
Let's go.
Hetty?
Well, she needs us more than we need her.
Right now, she's more valuable to us as bait.
You can't leave me here.
I said I'll talk.
Just... get me out of here.
We'll take her to the boatshed.
Let's go.
See you there.
I'll, uh, I'll ride with them.
You know, just for a little extra protection.
Just get in the damn car, Martin.
Yes.
Yes, Mom.
In the car.
So, we caught Natalie at your house.
We're taking her into custody now.
I'm gonna get back to my team.
Was that story true?
About that guy that died?
What do you think?
Good-bye, Carl.
Good-bye, Nell.
Visitation hours end in 15 minutes.
Repeat: visitation hours end in 15 minutes.
Those two guys you shot, you work with them?
I'll talk when I get my lawyer.
Your lawyer isn't saving your life.
Sam, behind us!
There's two of them.
We're pinned in.
Get out, move, move, move!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Go!
Natalie!
Wait!
Natalie!
Eric, we've been ambushed.
Natalie's on the run.
Looks like she may have been hit.
Hey, Sam?
Eric, we need an ambulance.
All right, help will be here soon.
It's important that you stay calm.
Easy, easy.
Easy.
I bet you weren't this nice to Carl Brown.
Natalie, listen to me.
We need your help.
Who do you work for?
Where did you meet them?
Someone... put out a hit on me when my name got leaked.
I was on my way to your house for help.
And those guys came after me.
Did you know them?
No.
But I think they work for the... the same person I did.
Tell us who.
Natalie.
Hey, you can make this right.
Tell us who.
Make it right.
Rae.
"Rae."
Lemon Grove Park.
Mostly at night.
Eric?
Let's start looking at night footage from security cams in Lemon Grove Park or any park nearby.
She's gone.
I think Rae is a woman.
This woman, to be specific.
She's appeared several times on the outskirts of Lemon Grove Park.
We got a pretty good look on her face right here.
This is a week ago.
We haven't had a chance to I.D. her yet.
She said her name was Heather.
She tried to pick me up a couple months back at a bar.
Is this the only image we have of her?
Well, it'll take me a while to scrub through the data to get more info, but I'm on it.
I'd send you all home, but I can't even guarantee that that's safe.
We'll handle it.
I'm gonna go be with Kensi.
Keep your ears and eyes open.
Thanks, brother.
You really want to wait till morning?
What do you think?
Kens?
Baby?
After hours training?
Ah...
Didn't know you were still here.
You didn't want to see anybody.
Uh...
No, I just, I didn't want to interfere with anybody's practice time, that's all.
And I'm going to take the NCIS Special Agent physical fitness test.
Why?
You don't have anything to prove.
Yes, I do, if I'm gonna come back.
You're gonna let me come back, right?
I don't think you're ready.
Oh, no, Hetty, you're wrong.
I'm ready.
I'm ready.
I've been jogging and working out and shooting.
I am ready.
All right, let me see you shoot with your left hand.
But I'm right-handed.
So am I.
Okay.
All right.
So, what do you want me to do-- my initials... smiley face?
Oh, no.
Just shoot the target.
Oops.
Right.
Force of habit.
Okay.
Guess I just need a little more practice.
Just take your time.

Thank you.
You're welcome.
This wasn't me.
You think this was a coincidence, G?
After everything our team's been through?
They've been after Hetty, Granger, and me.
I know.
I just feel bad that the sheriff's department had to pay the price.
Your dad okay?
Garrison?
Hetty sent him to a secure location in Santa Barbara till we figure this out.
You cool with that?
Why wouldn't I be?
We barely know each other, the guy wants to stay with me?
Agent Callen.
Deputy Bennett.
This is my partner, Sam Hanna.
Very sorry for your loss, Deputy.
We know what it's like to lose a teammate in the line of duty.
I appreciate that, but these aren't our guys.
Excuse me?
We have 18,000 employees in the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department, but these aren't two of them.
I don't know who these guys are, but they don't work for us.
NCIS has a couple of reasons to look into this, so we'll be happy to assist.
Be my guest.
And when you find out who these chumps are, impersonating us, let us know.
Will do.
Thank you.
Okay, so if these guys weren't real sheriffs, maybe they weren't here to help you.
Maybe they were here to kill you.
Yeah, well, then, who killed them?
You're sure your old man's out of town?
Eric, what do you make of the security footage from my yard?
I think our shooter is a woman.
It wasn't Hetty, was it?
No.
Young.
Athletic.
CALLEN:
And clearly capable.
So, good news is, a dog-walker just called in a stolen sheriff's car, and it's a couple miles from you.
Sending you the address now.
Good work, Nell.
We're on it.
Fact:
I once did a stint as a dog-walker.
I was 15.
Aw.
I bet you were so young and eager and cute.
Yeah.
Maybe a little too eager.
Uh, first trip out with the dogs,
I forgot those little baggies.
That wasn't so cute.
(groans)
(footfalls approaching)
So we just received confirmation that the law enforcement officers killed on Callen's street last night were not, in fact, law enforcement officers.
Eric and I are still trying to figure out who these guys are, in addition to tracking down the shooter.
I see.
Mm-hmm.
Something else?
Come, sit.
Um...
I'd really like another chance to question Carl Brown.
Do you think he's going to treat you differently today?
Probably not.
But I'm not ready to give up.
Hetty, even with him in prison, the internal threats keep coming.
They know where we live.
They know who our families are.
We really don't have another choice.
And...
I have a plan.
Uh-huh.
You've got no idea who the guardian angel might be who killed our phony sheriffs?
No.
Keep thinking.
And you're sure your fath-- sorry-
- Garrison is actually in Santa Barbara?
If Garrison had done this, there wouldn't be any bodies.
Thank you.
All right, well, maybe he just wants to spend the time he has left being part of your lives.
It's his first time finding family, too.
He's had other families.
But now all he has is you, your half sister, and your nephew.
You have told Alex?
I will.
I want to.
I just...
I don't want to...
But you're thinking twice, especially after this morning.
Like father, like son, maybe.
What's that supposed to mean?
Keeping family secrets to protect your loved ones.
That's pretty much what your dad did to you and everyone else in his life.
CALLEN:
Huh.
This just keeps getting better.
Strategic location.
I don't see any cameras.
No, whoever did this was a pro.
Stay close, partner.
DEEKS:
So, just to clarify, this woman kills two fake sheriffs in your front yard, steals their stolen cop car, and then torches it?
Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious who we're looking for.
Do tell.
I mean, this whole situation just reeks of an angry ex-girlfriend.
So Joelle is pissed that you broke up with her, and now she's taking keying your car to a whole nother level.
Are you serious right now?
You did keep her dining room set.
She bought that for me.
That was a gift.
No, for the both of you, but now it's just a painful reminder of what could have been.
(chuckles)
Why are you playing along with this?
I'm just glad you're okay.
Morning, gents.
Without further ado...
Both of our phony sheriffs had surveillance photos of this woman in their phones.
Is this our shooter?
Confidence is high.
I don't recognize her.
Me either.
Check out your home-security video.
What's that look like to you?
Looks like she's going to your front door.
Maybe she was trying to warn you.
So why not just call me?
No access to your phone number?
(phone chimes)
Everything good?
My neighbor thinks she may have seen something last night.
I'll go talk to her.
We'll double-check the crime scene.
Well, looks like it's just me and you again, Egon.
You know, if, uh, you want to be home with Kensi,
I can just call you if anything comes up.
No, no, no, because both my mom and Kensi's mom are coming to visit.
And it turns out that's just too many moms.
Hi.
How was your run?
It was great.
I made you some breakfast.
Aw, you didn't have to do that.
Gotta keep your strength up, honey.
Okay, let me just help you with this, honey.
Oh, whoa, definitely don't have to do that.
It's no problem.
Thank you.
I picked out a couple outfits for you.
I'll help you get changed when you're done.
Okay, you know that?
Can we just...
Can we just stop for a second, please?
What's wrong?
What do you need?
I don't need anything, I just...
I need you ladies to leave me alone for a second, okay?
We're just trying to help, sweetheart.
No, I know.
I mean, that's the only reason we're here, honey.
And I appreciate that.
I-I really do.
But, um, you're kind of driving me nuts.
Would you prefer we do this one-on-one?
No, Mom, I would prefer if we did this none-on-one.
And, plus, I'm supposed to be able to do these things by myself, so...
You are.
And you're doing great.
Really doing great.
Okay, stop telling me I'm doing great.
I am not ten, I know exactly how I'm doing.
She's getting frustrated.
The doctor said there'd be depression.
Okay, stop talking, both of you, please.
Maybe we should call Martin.
Would you like us to call Martin?
No.
Nope, not at all.
You really don't have to call Deeks.
I'm calling my son.
Oh, my gosh.
Okay, you know what?
I have something you can both do.
You ladies have the day off.
Good-bye.
(sighs)
I am so embarrassed.
Oh, don't be.
Mine's just as bad.
Is it too early for a drink?
I like the way you think.
You're a good mom.
I can tell.
You, too.
Let's go.
(sighs)
(knock on door)
Okay, I swear I'm gonna get my gun!
What?
!
Why don't you just...
So... it's a bad time?
Sorry, I thought you were my mother.
Never mind.
I would have brought you flowers, but you didn't seem like the type.
(exhales)
Come on in.
Thank you.
(indistinct chatter in distance)
NELL:
Okay, let's start from the beginning.
So where'd you first meet?
Where'd you go?
What'd you do?
Come on, Carl, you gotta give me something here.
Why?
What are you gonna give me?
What do you want?
Out.
Right.
Look, Sam's been interrogating people for a long time... and I haven't.
So I'm gonna tell you a story.
The summer after I graduated from high school,
I started going out with this guy who... most people would call... a "bad boy."
Tattoos, piercings, he drove this ridiculously loud car.
But he was actually... he was really sweet.
(chuckles)
Especially to me.
So, when he started hanging out with this rougher crowd,
I naturally asked him not to.
Asked him to spend more time with me.
But... he didn't listen.
Oh, boohoo.
He broke your heart.
Happens to everyone.
No.
He, uh, he broke into an electronics store and stole a pallet of DVD players.
So, at the end of the summer, he went to county and I went to college.
Wait, are you saying that crime doesn't pay?
I wrote him every day for, it felt like weeks.
Then he stopped writing me back.
Please tell me there's a moral to all this.
I was young.
I thought I could help him, save him, but I couldn't.
I never saw him again after he went into jail.
Maybe he's in here with me.
(laughs)
Wouldn't that be an ironic twist?
Oh, wait.
I didn't just spoil your M. Night Shyamalan moment, did I?
No.
(sighs) He's not in here, Carl.
Darn.
See, like yourself, he thought he was smarter and tougher than everyone else.
Until a group of inmates took turns stomping on his head until they crushed his skull.
I guess he wasn't so tough after all.
No, he was.
He was a lot tougher than you, Carl.
You may be in solitary, but there's still a price on your head.
It's just so nice to be wanted.
You know?
Honestly, how long do you think it's gonna be before some inmate and crooked guard make a deal and split the cash?
Huh?
Yeah, as much as I love your company and your stories unless these turn into conjugal visits...
Oh, that's cute, Carl.
...I got nothing left to tell you.
Mm-hmm.
I know that.
Yet you keep coming.
(laughing)
It's kind of sad.
(humming)
Dude.
(smacks lips) You've been over here humming for the last ten minutes.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't even ask you to harmonize.
♪ I'm here, you're here ♪
(high-pitched):
♪ I'm here... ♪
That's a hard pass.
You're trying to make me sing the Garfunkel parts and I'm obviously a Simon.
All right, Paul, take a seat.
Your lurking's making me nervous.
(computer beeps)
What just happened?
We get something?
Uh, no.
Just my hourly reminder to stand up.
To evil?
No.
So my feet don't fall asleep.
(sputtering)
I don't understand... this.
Oh, you don't have to.
That's why I have Nell.
Touché.
(chuckling)
Do I even want to know?
I'm just wondering how you're gonna try and get me to talk next time.
Well, Carl, today's my last visit.
And to be honest,
I never really needed you to talk.
You see, every time I come here, word gets out that Carl Brown's meeting with a federal agent.
Again.
Inmates-- they start to wonder,
"What's he telling her?
Who's he ratting out?"
Visit after visit.
"Ooh, that Carl.
"He must be a real Chatty Cathy, or they wouldn't keep coming here to see him."
The inmates start to get nervous, especially after we start rattling their cages.
And so, what do they do?
Well, you know what they say:
"Snitches get stitches.
And turned into bitches."
Everyone will want you dead regardless of the $50K on your head.
And the next time someone comes to see you, chances are, you'll be willing to talk, from the infirmary.
Assuming... they haven't cut out your tongue with a razor blade.
Yeah, they do that, too.
Maybe Natalie never called me or wrote me since I got put in here because she's dead.
Maybe someone was after her and killed her as soon as I was out of the picture.
So, what, someone else put the hit out on you?
I don't know.
Natalie never told me who she was working for.
Why should I believe you?
'Cause I gave you her name.
No, you gave Sam her name.
I'm not Sam.
(sighs)
I met Natalie at the Promenade.
Some dive bar.
Then the next day, we went to the pier.
NELL:
That's all I have so far.
Oh, I can definitely work with that.
Nell, you rock, seriously.
DEEKS:
Uh, is that a lead?
'Cause it sounded a lot like a lead.
Oh, well, Nell says that Brown first met Natalie at a dive bar near the Promenade.
Mm.
And then the next day, they went to the Santa Monica Pier.
Which bar?
Oh, he won't say, but apparently he bought tacos at a nearby food truck later that night.
So, of all the popular taco trucks...
Tita and Chilias, uh, Navarette's, uh, oh, Pepe and Mondo's.
A lot of these trucks have social media accounts that announce their serving locations.
So we can tell where they've been.
You are correct, sir.
Thank you, sir.
We just need to know when.
Right.
Well, we captured Brown two years ago, November 24.
Wow, you were ready to go with that one.
Although he did hold you at gunpoint.
Gunpoint and syringe-point.
Yikes.
(clears throat)
Anyway,
Natalie had to turn Brown,
Brown leaked Hetty's info, poisoned Granger-- that takes us back a few months.
Like, June?
(chair hisses)
Hey, what are you doing?
(chair hisses)
Relax, I'll put it back to Nell level when I'm done.
(sighing):
All right, these are the taco trucks that serve in Santa Monica.
DEEKS:
All right, I feel like we're gonna find something here.
Ready, no whammies, no whammies.
Stop!
Pepe and Mondo's slung their tacos on Santa Monica Boulevard outside the Sunset Ocean Bar.
Which is on the Promenade!
(both imitate explosion)
And I just exploded my fist bump, which is a whole new low for me.
So now we're into this rabbit hole of despair, what's next?
Now we just wait for facial rec to pull up photos from the bar.
Wait?
What?
There's no other leads for us to follow?
Hmm?
No, not yet.
Well,
I'll pull up some photos from the Santa Monica Pier the next day, but it might take a while.
Welcome to Ops.
Okay, so we've got all this Star Trek gak and your giant brain, you're telling me all we can do is wait?
Yeah.
No.
All right, hey, Siri, can you tell me where Natalie is?
Alexa?
Cortana?
HAL?
Bueller?
Anyone?
We don't have an AI.
Well, we should.
Beale, take a letter.
"Dear Henrietta, it has come to my attention..."
Um,
I'm not your secretary.
Nor would you have to be if we had AI.
Hmm.
(computer chirps)
What now?
More wiggling?
Huh?
You want to do some Pilates?
(sighs) The guys posing as our sheriffs are one Perry Verona and one Dexter Frazier, owners of VexSun Solar in Culver City.
Okay, I would take you with me, but you seem to have a lot going on here, so I'm gonna go.
Hey.
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.
(grunts)
DEEKS:
As promised.
Okay.
(chair hisses)
Address is on the way.
I am calling Callen and Sam.
Beale?
Mm?
You're good people.
(sighs)
(Eric speaking indistinctly over phone)
Okay.
Tell Deeks we'll meet him there.
All right, he's on his way now.
Right.
Okay, let me know what you find.
All right, Eric.
Bye.
So, uh, Deeks is gonna meet us at some solar roof company where the two phony sheriffs worked.
A solar company?
That sounds bogus.
You think?
Here.
I promised Mrs. Ramirez I would share these with you.
(laughs)
I'm sorry, we had to chase down that lead.
What if she actually saw something?
That poor woman hasn't seen anything clearly since Reagan was president.
Shh.
She still thinks he is.
So, uh, looks like you're gonna have to move, too, now that your address has been compromised.
Yeah.
(sighs)
I know.
Do I detect a sense of nostalgia in the High Plains Drifter?
Don't tell me you actually settled on one place?
Of course not.
No,
I'm just thinking about how Mrs. Ramirez might feel.
Right.
Seriously?
It's four walls and a roof.
I can find that anywhere.
Oh, please.
You've been domesticated.
I knew it.
I knew it.
It was over as soon as Joelle got you that dining room set.
Enough with the dining set.
Thing's going on Craigslist.
Sure it is.
Puttin' it up.
Yeah, right.
(chuckles)
Thank you!
(car door opens) Neighbor see anything?
(chuckles) Please.
His neighbor's glasses are thicker than my head.
Mrs. Ramirez was scared.
She just wanted someone to talk to.
Aw, that's sweet.
She's sweet, all right.
Sweet on G.
Oh, older woman.
Hey, Mrs. Robinson.
Mrs. Ramirez is a very sweet old lady.
Please do not say anything sexually perverted or crude, all right?
You're not leaving me a lot to work with, here.
Why is he so grumpy?
You'd be grumpy, too, if your ex left two bodies on your lawn.
I'll be really pleased when Kensi gets back.
(whistles) Not seeing a lot of solar companies on here, but in case you need to get your fax machine repaired, or we could stop by the Nader campaign offices.
That list needs updating.
We're looking for VexSun Solar.
Uh, it's upstairs.
I can show you.
You guys contractors?
Federal agents.
You have any security footage we can look at?
Uh, no.
Our video surveillance has been down for...
I don't think this building's ever had video surveillance.
So are you guys FBI?
Or NSA?
SEC?
NCIS.
What about IDs?
Got any electronic records of people coming or going?
Uh, no.
We haven't had that system installed yet.
Uh, I'm actually thinking about becoming a federal agent.
Uh, yeah, all I ever do is watch those true crime shows, and I'm perfect for undercover work.
I'm basically a chameleon.
It's just this way.
Wow.
Law enforcement is definitely for me.
I was leaning towards FBI, but, you know, maybe LAPD or NCIS.
I'm really keeping my options open at this point.
Deeks is LAPD.
He's done a lot of undercover work.
You might want to talk to him.
Mm-hmm.
Door?
Okay.
Looks like a bogus front to me.
When's the last time you saw anybody in here?
Uh, yesterday afternoon.
I had no idea they were moving out.
These men work here?
Yeah, both of 'em.
(phone ringing)
You going to answer that?
Well, it's a number I don't know.
I've been getting a lot of crank calls lately.
Could be a hot tip.
Hello.
Vinny?
How'd you get this number?
(laughs)
From my what?
From my business card?
All right, I gotta call you back.
Did you give Vinny the security guy my business card?
I-I mean, he wants to get into law enforcement.
You'd be a good mentor.
Where'd you even get my business cards?
Got a whole box of 'em on your desk.
Well, at least you had a box on your desk...
This is why I'm getting all those prank phone calls.
Deeks, look at it from a community safety point of view.
Now the entire homeless population of Venice has a direct line to the LAPD.
Hold on a second.
You gave them to homeless people?
Yes.
I thought we were picking on him today.
I don't play favorites.
ERIC:
Hey.
Sorry for sending you guys on a wild goose chase.
Well, they were there, we just didn't get there early enough.
You find anything else?
Maybe.
Our phony sheriffs and solar roofing guys are both former military-- army-- although they never served together.
What'd they do after service?
Uh, truck drivers... in Iraq.
Mmm, I smell private contractors.
You got a company?
Uh, maybe.
Ashmati Trucking.
Eight years ago, the owner died and then there was an ugly inheritance battle between the survivors, which ultimately killed the company.
It happens.
Well, these were private contractors working in Iraq, making a lot of money.
Just because the company they worked for went belly-up, that doesn't mean they're not still doing it.
DEEKS:
Which takes us back to the question, who were these guys working for and why did this woman kill them?
Which is exactly how we started this day.
Well, Deeks' new buddy, Vinny, said there were six people working out of VexSun Solar.
Two women, four men.
So we've got these two.
The rest are still out there somewhere.
I'm on it.
Hetty...
The wolves are at the door.
I can feel it.
I'm not sure it's safe to trust anyone anymore.
I just wanted to come by and say thank you.
Thank you for what?
Making my time in the hospital bearable.
Oh.
Well.
In that case, I suppose I should thank you, too.
I was in a bad place and you helped pull me out of it.
Well, you were an ass about it, but... (chuckles)
Well, that's a gift.
(both laugh)
I just also wanted to say... good-bye before I left.
Where you going?
Back to my unit.
Medical Board restored me to duty status.
What?
!
Yeah, yeah.
That is awesome!
Been sitting on my ass long enough.
And the guys are gonna ride me relentlessly and the one-legged jokes will never end, but it'll be good to get back with my guys.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
I'm... (Kensi chuckles)
Is this your truck?
Yeah.
You're impressed.
I'm... more like embarrassed for you.
It's very obnoxious.
Oh, you can't fool me, Kensi Blye.
I know a redneck girl when I see one.
Okay, I am not a redneck.
(laughs)
Well, you'll like this bad boy.
You know what they say, the bigger the truck...
The dumber the driver?
(laughs)
Well, I know you want to go for a ride.

So... did she ever introduce you to her friends?
No.
I told you.
(sighs)
Look, I'm tired and my back hurts.
I want to go back to my cell now.
You should probably try straightening up.
You know, shoulders back... (phone chimes) ...and down.
You know?
Suit yourself.
(clears throat)
Nah.
Oh, wow.
Is this Natalie Grant?
Hmm.
ERIC:
I found her.
I know who she is.
The woman from outside my house?
ERIC:
Yes.
It was Natalie Grant.
Carl Brown just confirmed to Nell that she's the woman in the taxi photo.
Also the same woman who shot the phony sheriffs.
She also goes by Amber Wilcox-- a massage therapist from Houston, Texas.
Uh, I can only trace her back 12 years.
That's a good cover.
It allows her to move around, cash business, no real address.
Smart.
She's on the run now.
But if she was coming to kill Callen, who are the two dead sheriff wannabes that tried to stop her?
What if she wasn't sent to kill me?
What if she was turning to me for help?
Think about it.
She's Carl Brown's handler.
She talks him into trying to kill us, but we catch him, put him in jail.
So then they try and kill him in prison;
we beat 'em to it and put him in isolation.
Now he's talking.
So now they're going after her.
It's not like she can go to the police.
Which means she's in a pretty bad situation, if she's turning to the very people she tried to kill.
Well, she knows she's running out of time and we're probably the only ones that can save her.
Well, if Amber/Natalie turned Brown, she probably knew where he worked.
Why wouldn't she just come here?
If she knows where we work, the people she works for know where we work.
They're probably watching us now.
It's too risky.
Yikes.
Well, by now she's probably out of town or at least gone into hiding.
SAM:
For all we know, she's working with the same people who tried to kill her.
If that's the case, all her hiding spots are blown.
Okay, so what do we got?
We got family, friends, boyfriends.
Mm-hmm.
I mean, Carl Brown was her boyfriend.
ERIC:
Hey, what if she's at Carl Brown's house?
The file says that he inherited it from his aunt three years ago.
The feds seized it when he went to jail.
And Natalie would have a key.
Not that she needs one.
My God, man!
You're better than Siri!
Thank you.
I'm coming with you.
Why?
Because my career depends on it.
Deeks, take Hetty in the Audi.
All right.
We'll take my car.
Uh, Miss Daisy isn't supposed to drive.
Come on.
All right.
(engine revs)
(Deeks screams) (tires screech)
Fraggle Rock!
Oh...
(inhales sharply)
We must've beat Callen and Sam.
Yay!
Yeah, I think we also beat the sound barrier.
Yay.
You, by chance, weren't the one that taught Nell how to drive, were you?
No.
I-I gave her a few defensive driving lessons.
Yeah, I can see that.
You should probably get a haircut.
Oh, don't worry.
Next time, I'll...
I'll wear a helmet.
Possible a parachute.
Definitely a diaper.
Told you she was fast.
How'd you beat us here?
I took a shortcut.
The sidewalk.
You took a sidewalk.

DEEKS:
Natalie?
Amber, we're here to help!
Stay close, Hetty.
Hetty?
It's over, dear.
Please stop.
(grunts)
I said I'll talk if you provide me with a lawyer and protection and witness relocation.
That's quite the list.
I have quite a lot of information.
We don't need a lot of information.
We just need to know who you're working for.
Then give me what I need.
There's nothing here.
Let's go.
Hetty?
Well, she needs us more than we need her.
Right now, she's more valuable to us as bait.
NATALIE:
You can't leave me here.
I said I'll talk.
Just... get me out of here.
We'll take her to the boatshed.
Let's go.
See you there.
I'll, uh, I'll ride with them.
You know, just for a little extra protection.
Just get in the damn car, Martin.
Yes.
Yes, Mom.
In the car.
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)
So, we caught Natalie at your house.
We're taking her into custody now.
I'm gonna get back to my team.
Was that story true?
About that guy that died?
What do you think?
Good-bye, Carl.
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)
Good-bye, Nell.
MAN (over P.A.):
Visitation hours end in 15 minutes.
Repeat: visitation hours end in 15 minutes.
Those two guys you shot, you work with them?
NATALIE:
I'll talk when I get my lawyer.
Your lawyer isn't saving your life.
CALLEN:
Sam, behind us!
(tires screeching)
There's two of them.
We're pinned in.
Get out, move, move, move!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Go!
Natalie!
Wait!
Natalie!
(groaning)
(tires screech)
Eric, we've been ambushed.
Natalie's on the run.
Looks like she may have been hit.
Hey, Sam?
Eric, we need an ambulance.
All right, help will be here soon.
It's important that you stay calm.
(grunting)
Easy, easy.
Easy.
I bet you weren't this nice to Carl Brown.
Natalie, listen to me.
We need your help.
Who do you work for?
Where did you meet them?
Someone... put out a hit on me when my name got leaked.
I was on my way to your house for help.
And those guys came after me.
Did you know them?
No.
But I think they work for the... the same person I did.
SAM:
Tell us who.
Natalie.
Hey, you can make this right.
Tell us who.
(heavy breath)
Make it right.
Rae.
"Rae."
Lemon Grove Park.
Mostly at night.
(gasping)
CALLEN:
Eric?
Let's start looking at night footage from security cams in Lemon Grove Park or any park nearby.
(distant sirens wailing)
She's gone.
ERIC:
I think Rae is a woman.
This woman, to be specific.
She's appeared several times on the outskirts of Lemon Grove Park.
We got a pretty good look on her face right here.
This is a week ago.
We haven't had a chance to I.D. her yet.
GRANGER:
She said her name was Heather.
She tried to pick me up a couple months back at a bar.
Is this the only image we have of her?
Well, it'll take me a while to scrub through the data to get more info, but I'm on it.
I'd send you all home, but I can't even guarantee that that's safe.
We'll handle it.
I'm gonna go be with Kensi.
Keep your ears and eyes open.
Thanks, brother.
You really want to wait till morning?
What do you think?
Kens?
Baby?
(gunshots)
After hours training?
Ah...
Didn't know you were still here.
You didn't want to see anybody.
Uh...
No, I just, I didn't want to interfere with anybody's practice time, that's all.
And I'm going to take the NCIS Special Agent physical fitness test.
Why?
You don't have anything to prove.
Yes, I do, if I'm gonna come back.
You're gonna let me come back, right?
I don't think you're ready.
Oh, no, Hetty, you're wrong.
I'm ready.
I'm ready.
I've been jogging and working out and shooting.
I am ready.
All right, let me see you shoot with your left hand.
But I'm right-handed.
So am I.
Okay.
All right.
So, what do you want me to do-- my initials... smiley face?
(laughs)
Oh, no.
Just shoot the target.
Oops.
(clip rattling)
(Hetty clears throat)
Right.
Force of habit.
(sighs)
(quiet laugh)
Okay.
Guess I just need a little more practice.
Just take your time.

Tonight on 8 Out Of 10 Cats -
Match of the Day - it's Gabby Logan.
Can you feel the love tonight?
It's Phil Wang.
And their team captain - Aisling Bea.
And facing them tonight -
Breaking news - it's Krishnan Guru-Murthy.
Show me the funny - it's Rosie Jones.
And their team captain - Rob Beckett.
Now welcome your host -
Jimmy Carr.
Hello and welcome to 8 Out Of 10 Cats, a show about opinion polls, surveys and statistics.
Did you know, for example,
Candy Crush is the most downloaded game on Smartphones?
And that's because Tinder is not technically a game.
Although I am a player.
In the past two years, 25% of UK adults have bought plus size clothing.
If you don't know what plus size clothing is, it comes in XL, XXL and fucking 'L'!
And 25% of Brits employ a cleaner.
I once had sex with my cleaner.
I bloody love that Henry the hoover.
Right, let's get started.
What Are You Talking About?
That's the name of our first round.
It's our panellists' job to guess the public's top three most popular talking points.
Rob's team, what do you think the nation has been talking about this week?
I think it's got to be the old snap election that's been going on for about three years.
It has been going on a while, hasn't it?
Oh!
With this, "Oh, it's going to be so quick!" And it keeps changing.
I don't know who I'm voting for,
I don't know what's going on any more.
I just can't keep up.
Rosie, do you know who you're voting for?
Well, between you and me,
I'm disabled...
LAUGHTER
We thought you'd been drinking.
To be fair, Jimmy,
I have.
But I don't know who I'm voting for.
It really depends on the day, when I'm in the polling booth, where my hand goes.
Krishnan, what do you think's going to happen in this election?
I think it's really exciting.
It's become really exciting in the last two weeks.
Cos two weeks ago, they said, right, it's going to be a landslide for the Tories, they're going to have a 170-seat majority,
Labour are going to be wiped out.
And then something in the last two weeks has gone, actually...
There's a couple of things.
I mean, first of all,
Theresa May hasn't been as good as everybody thought she would be and she's dodged interviews and debates and all that kind of stuff.
And Jeremy Corbyn hasn't imploded, which a lot of people thought would happen.
So he has been much better than anybody thought and she's been worse than people thought.
What I've enjoyed is Theresa May, cos like, she's quite good if you send her out with a script and she delivers her message but as soon as she has got to answer a question or improvise,
she starts panicking.
She gets like visual tics, her face starts going...
Agh, agh, agh!
And she starts panicking and going back to her stock phrase.
"Agh, Brexit means Brexit!
"Oh, God, strong and stable!
Oh, malfunction, malfunction!"
AISLING BEA:
I think it's because she's Marge Simpson.
Well, dressed up as Marge Simpson but secretly underneath, she's Mr Burns.
She's like, "Hey, Homer, can I get you a beer?"
But underneath, she's like, "Ah, the dementia tax, excellent!"
Shall we have a look at Theresa May?
So, obviously, May's policies on the NHS didn't go down well with one member of the audience.
Take a close look at what he's mouthing.
We all rely on the health service.
We all know people either who work in the health service like yourself, who's been through the health service, who've had great care and attention from the fantastic staff in the health service.
That's why we're ensuring that we are putting more money into the NHS and more money for the future as well as what is happening...
I'd quite like him to do like an Anchorman and see him and go,
"Utter bollocks" as if he were her autocue, you know?
He's reading her lines!
I can't believe how uncomfortable she looked ad-libbing.
She does need to do a circuit, some stand-up, a few months out doing the pubs, the small venues.
Get a hold of that stuff.
Cos she's a really impressive woman when she seems to have an autocue.
She seems to be quite an impressive orator and then take that away and she's...
I kind of like the idea that a politician should look like, you know, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn.
I like the idea that they're not that polished.
Otherwise, you put me in charge.
I'm bloody good off-the-cuff.
So, Jeremy Corbyn went on Women's Hour this week and-and he didn't do great.
No.
He did what I like to call a Diane Abbott.
Let's have a look.
Let me understand then, how much will it cost to provide un-means-tested childcare for 1.3 million children?
Erm, it will cost, erm...
It will obviously cost a lot to do so, we accept that.
I presume you have the figures?
Yes, I do.
You don't know it?
Erm...
You are logging into your iPad here.
You've announced a major policy and you don't know how much it'll cost?
Can I give you the exact figure in a moment, please?
Is this not exactly the issue with people and the Labour Party?
All of our manifesto is fully costed and examined.
And...
But you are holding your manifesto, you're flicking through it, you've got an iPad there, you've had a phone call while we are in here, and you don't know how much it is going to cost.
Can we come back to that in a moment?
LAUGHTER
I feel like there's a lot of lazy stereotypes about Jeremy Corbyn.
Like, "Oh, Jeremy Corbyn is made out of hay".
"Jeremy Corbyn writes his e-mails by hand."
"Jeremy Corbyn is secretly the child from the TV show Woof
"and at night-time he turns back into a shaggy dog."
We've got a clip of him on The One Show answering some very tough questions about his allotment.
It's a chance to grow things, a chance to reflect on things and a chance to just unwind and be yourself and chat to all the other allotment holders, exchanging plants and all that, and there's something magic,
when you grow your own beans, you're growing your own potatoes, you grow your own corn, take it home and...
And we are thrilled with this.
And you grow fruit trees and then you turn the fruit trees into jam and I would like to present The One Show with a jar of my jam.
Thank you very much!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
She just gave that to him!
You all just saw that, she gave him the jam and he went, "Yeah,
"I'd like to present this to you." That's her jam!
It sounded like he was doing a birds and the bees talk to his teenage son.
Sort of going like, "And then you grow your own bean and then
"you take it on to the potatoes and you make jam!"
This is why he is working.
He is ridiculously laid-back about everything.
You can ask him about jam, you can ask him about meeting the IRA...
GABBY LOGAN:
Just don't ask him about costing childcare!
I do feel a bit sorry for politicians in a way, though, because, whatever you say, they get constantly scrutinised and these people that go in to the thing and ask them questions, and they're so righteous when they ask,
"Why aren't you going to do this?
What are you going to do about that?
I'd love to see a politician do a bit of research on them and go,
"Yeah, that's fine.
When are you going to clear out your shed?
"Months you've been saying you'll do that.
"Why don't you sort your shed out and then come back at me?"
Phil, what do you think is going to happen in this election?
I'm really enjoying this election, it's really exciting now, because it's unpredictable.
It's like Game of Thrones, you know, in that I've not paid to watch it.
Theresa May is like Cersei.
She's miscalculated the threat that the High Sparrow holds, you know?
The High Sparrow is obviously Jeremy Corbyn.
And now it turns out he's embarrassing her in front of all of King's Landing.
Are you maybe a Ukip fan?
Myself?
Yeah.
Yeah, I go to their rallies.
Mm-hmm.
I throw chow mein at them.
And you know what?
They eat it, they eat it.
They're passionate but they're hypocrites.
Rosie, who is the best party for disability benefits?
Why are you asking me?
Rob has more problems than I do.
That's the thing,
I'm having a real nightmare applying for benefits, because they sent me this massive form
so I thought, "Right, bugger you", and I hand-wrote the whole form.
And they rang me up and said,
"Sorry, erm,
"but we can't read your writing."
And I went, "Oh, really?
"Maybe that's because I'm disabled!"
OK, let's have a look and see if the election is up there.
Of course.
The election campaign is the most talked about thing.
Choosing between the Tories, Labour, SNP, Lib Dem, Ukip, the Green Party and Plaid Cymru, it's like deciding which STI to get.
A recent YouGov poll revealed that if only people under 40 were allowed to vote, Jeremy Corbyn would win.
That said, if only people under four were allowed to vote, the next Prime Minister would be Peppa Pig.
I think Theresa May seems a little artificial.
It looks like the people who did my hair and teeth also did her personality.
Aisling's team, what do you think the nation have been talking about over the last week?
I think that it was the season finale of football.
The season finale... of football?
Oh, Jimmy, it's great news.
Finally, after all these years, football's finished, we're done, it's over.
Cos sometimes I was watching football, thinking, when will this ever be solved?
!
But now, I've been told that it's over.
Can I ask, erm, whodunnit?
I didn't see it.
Wenger did it.
Wenger was out.
Arsene Wenger.
Yes, Gabby!
We should probably ask Gabby about this.
Gabby, what is football?
So the season is finished and then every two years, you get a complete break for a couple of months because there's no World Cup, there's no European Championship...
That's when I hit the clubs to look for the lads.
There's leagues, league leagues, cup leagues...?
Like, what...?
You have different leagues and they all get winners and then you have a Cup competition that goes all through the season and finishes...
Who has the best cup?
That's the FA Cup and that was won by Arsene Wenger's Arsenal, much to the annoyance of Chelsea who won the league, obviously.
Well, that's one each, that's fairer.
I don't really want to talk about the football, Jimmy, cos I've got in a row.
AISLING GASPS
I've upset the entire town of Huddersfield...
AISLING:
Oh, no!
ROB: ..on Twitter.
If you are going to upset a town, not a bad one to pick.
You can't slag off Huddersfield...
Well, you can if you know anything about it.
Well, I lived in Huddersfield for three years.
So I've earned the right to slag it off.
You haven't.
So, what did you tweet, Rob?
I was just annoyed that no proper clubs are getting promoted.
It was all boring ones.
Well, some people came back.
Yeah, they went mental at me.
One person tweeted -
APPLAUSE
My favourite, someone
- I'm presuming from either Huddersfield or Reading - someone came back with -
Delightfully succinct.
I know!
But "Milky Bar Boy" is so degrading, isn't it?
Not even "Kid"!
How emasculating! "Boy"!
Rosie, do you follow football?
Well, to be honest,
I don't know a lot about football, but I am an expert in dribbling.
Same, same.
Same, same.
Krishnan, do you follow the soccer ball?
I've become a football fan because of my son, who is a big Liverpool fan.
So I've now become a Liverpool fan again.
How did they do in the soccer ball?
Well, they made it through to...
Well, almost to...
To the judges' houses?
Yeah.
I don't know if you got your kid into Liverpool or he got you into it.
Take a look at what this dad did.
Ooh, Liverpool kit.
HE LAUGHS
SHE CRIES
THEY BOTH CRY
APPLAUSE
I mean...
Presumably, those kids are Huddersfield fans.
Who do you support, Gabby?
Who is your team?
My team got promoted this season as well.
Ooh!
Yeah, Newcastle United.
IN A BAD GEORDIE ACCENT:
Newcastle United?
I didn't know you couldn't do a Geordie accent?
Phil, are you...?
You're not footbally, are you?
Sporty?
I'm...
Chinese people aren't really into football.
It's too confusing...
GABBY:
They are, they're buying all the best players in the world.
PHIL:
They're trying to build it up but traditionally, it's tricky for us because red cards are good luck for us.
So if someone does a bad challenge, the ref comes over and goes,
"Good luck", you go, "Thanks, man" and you go...
Pretty soon it is just 11 on 11 kung fu.
Gabby, what would be a good gateway sport for non-sporty cats like us?
I think you'd start off with the beach sports.
Bit of Frisbee...
Frisbee!
ROB:
That's not a sport!
Don't get the British Frisbee Association on your back, Rob.
I'll stick 'em on my Huddersfield lift, go fuck yourselves!
APPLAUSE
Let's have a look and see whether the end of football is up there.
AISLING:
The end of football!
Yes, it's the end of the football season.
Winning a place in the Premier League was worth £170 million to Huddersfield.
For that kind of money, they could just knock it down and start again.
You can't say that!
I just did!
Damn it!
That's it for part one, see you after the break.
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Welcome back to 8 Out Of 10 Cats, where we're still trying to guess the nation's most popular talking points.
OK, fingers on buzzers, one more thing to get.
BUZZ Is that the return of Love Island?
Oh...
Do you watch Love Island?
I quite like it, yeah.
I just...
I'd quite like them to do a spin-off called Hate Island...
LAUGHTER
..and they'd put like Trump, Piers Morgan and Katie Hopkins on it, with a velociraptor.
LAUGHTER
What is Love Island?
Oh, it's like a game show, it's a bit like pass the parcel, but the parcel is always dick.
LAUGHTER
Talk this through the rules of engagement, here.
There's like say five gals and six guys, and they have to...
Oh, my God, I love this show so much.
LAUGHTER they have to couple up at the start, and then there's one guy spare, and then over the course of the week he has to try and sort of lure one of the gals to be his gal,
and then the other guy will be voted off.
And they all have to sleep together in the bed...
I mean, it sounds really dark.
LAUGHTER
They're forced to sleep together while we, the nation, watch it.
But they must get bored of shagging, cos it's just constant shagging.
Do they actually shag?
Do they actually have sex?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, they do!
LAUGHTER
I'm shocked this is television.
Yeah, this is when you're on, this is what I'm watching when you're doing your thing.
LAUGHTER
Shall we treat ourselves to look at this year's Love Island contestants?
My biggest turn-off when it comes to men is someone who is so arrogant and cocky, and wants to like be with every single girl.
Like, keep your pants in one bed, mate.
That's...
That's it.
The name of my girls' group Whatsapp is Life.
We call ourselves lifers.
SHE CHUCKLES
If I could describe myself in bed...
Passionate, 100%.
Energetic, and actually...flexible.
Very flexible for someone short.
Right, from being in the Blazin' Squad to now, my pulling game is actually better now.
Have you seen me now?
Like, I'm literally like...
Wow!
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
I liked the guy that was flexible in bed.
Yeah, I could...
I'm very flexible, I could do Tuesdays.
LAUGHTER
What's mental is though like now like if you go to an old people's home, it's sort of like, "Oh, that's Freddie, he served in Normandy."
But what's going to happen when this generation gets to that age?
"Oh, see her over there?
She got fingered by Calum Best in Fiji."
LAUGHTER
Phil, have you seen Love Island?
I used to live with Iain Stirling, who is the narrator on Love Island.
Oh, yeah!
So Ian's gone from the most sexless house in Britain...
LAUGHTER
..to the most sex-full house in the world.
I watched a bit, I try and support my friends.
LAUGHTER
But no friendship is that strong.
LAUGHTER
Do you know Ian Stirling?
He's a comedian, and he's the guy...
What's his...?
What's his accent...
Scottish!
His accent is...
THICK, BROAD SCOTS:
And now, in Love Island, they're about to start the fingering game.
Whoever fingers the most will be this week's king and queen, and be immune from eviction.
LAUGHTER
Do they really have a fingering game?
They don't really have a fingering, Gabby.
LAUGHTER
Actually, here's a fun fact.
Fingering is the only thing I'm fast at.
LAUGHTER
You don't know where it's going to go!
How exciting!
APPLAUSE
Imagine going in to clean the house.
Oh, it would be like that scene in ET.
LAUGHTER
Yeah, if they go in there with one of those blue lights from CSI it's going to be...
It'd be like Christmas!
LAUGHTER
I didn't know Jason Pollock was on it this year!
Jason Pollock?
Fuck!
LAUGHTER
Is he related to Jackson Pollock?
Shit.
Jason Pollock?
You know Jason Pollock!
LAUGHTER
Fucking Jason!
LAUGHTER
I'm actually looking forward to the spin off.
It's actually a disabled special called cripples with nipples.
I think it's okay when she says it.
Okay.
Well, I can tell you the return of Love Island is not up there.
But if you've never seen Love Island, the concept is very simple.
11 people enter a villa and then each other.
Okay, fingers on buzzers, one more thing to get, what else have people been talking about?
What do you reckon?
Is a Donald Trump and covfefe?
This is Donald Trump breaking the Internet, I believe.
Yeah.
With a misspelt tweet.
Here it is.
Covfefe.
Covfefe.
ROB:
I think I went covfefe all-inclusive in 2007.
I was pissed most of the time, but I swear it was covfefe.
What do you think he was trying to say?
Somebody else came out and said he was supposed to be saying kerfuffle.
Kerfuffle.
ROB:
Oh, kerfuffle.
I thought it was coverage.
The negative media coverage.
I think it was after a tweet, the phone's broke, and he can't access his account, he can't remember the password.
And then, five hours later, he deletes it.
Then he's back in the game.
Sean Spicer came out and said,
"Oh, yes, but it might not make sense to you,
"but it made sense to the President
"and it made sense to a small group of people."
Well, we've got that clip.
Here's what Trump's press secretary Sean Spicer had to say about
Trump's tweet.
I imagine the small group of people who know what he meant are the Kremlin.
Maybe covfefe's like a Russian codeword for fire the missiles now.
What would you ask him if you interviewed him?
Or have you interviewed him?
I have interviewed him,
I interviewed him before he was President.
Before he was even...
Well, let's...
And then your interview made him become president?
Well, it's interesting, these are the hard-hitting questions that you asked.
Take a look.
Just finally, Mr Trump, you're wearing a hat today and obviously you're famous for your hair.
Recently, you divulged the secrets of your hair to Rolling Stone magazine, I was just wondering if you wouldn't mind, doing the same for us on television now.
Well, sure, I'd love to take off my hat.
It's actually my hair, you know, I have lots of witnesses, so it is, but, erm, hey, it's mine.
It may not be pretty, but it's mine.
Some pretty hard-hitting journalism there.
You noticed he had a hat on almost immediately.
So well done.
Nothing gets past me.
The truth is, that's a six-minute interview all about the
Scottish National Party and the environment and his golf course.
And you just use the little bit at the end, that was meant to end with a laugh.
Yeah, cos the rest of it was pretty dull.
Okay, it's easy to make a mistake when you're tweeting.
Our politicians have done it.
Ed Balls famously tweeted back in 2011...
After nearly 100,000 retweets, 28th of April became known as Ed Balls' day.
This is my favourite ever fail on Twitter.
So, Susan Boyle's PR team sent twitter into meltdown when they tweeted this...
Send your questions to...
Su's anal bum party!
I love the fact that the anal bum party's got a headquarters.
Oh, it's important to be organised.
Well, I can tell you that Donald Trump's misspelled tweet is not up there.
But who knew Donald Trump couldn't control his hands?
Literally every woman he's ever met.
Okay, fingers on buzzers.
One more thing to get.
What do you think, Rob?
Is it the old BA chaos?
Oh, yeah, this looked pretty miserable.
A whole weekend of no flights.
Yeah, and this is because...
We don't know.
I mean, they claim it was a power surge and everybody's going, well, there wasn't a power surge.
No.
I think they've got all their computers running off one extension lead from Costco.
It was the most massive malfunction, whatever it was.
That there was no backup, though.
You'd hope, wouldn't you, a company of that size and the scale of what it's got to do, would have some kind of backup system?
The Daily Mail got outraged on behalf of everyone, as per uzhe.
They were like, "Oh, British Airways
"should drop British from their name."
But, like, people were queueing on a bank holiday Monday, angry about the heat in small rooms.
That's the most British thing I've ever heard.
I think they should just drop airways and leave it as British.
ROB:
I think it was the only time Ryanair passengers have felt smug.
Walking through the airport like, "What's that, BA?
"You get two pieces of hand luggage?
"We get one, but we get a fucking plane."
I never got the IT problem.
Cos why didn't they just turn it on and off again?
The problem with turning it off and then on again is on an airline,
I think that's what Malaysian Air tried.
CROWD:
Ooh!
Oh!
Phil, you must defend Malaysian Airlines.
The food is quite good.
I had a little touch of the Jimmy Carr lifestyle when we went to Alicante last week.
Oh, right, fancy.
And we went on BA and I took my parents.
I got them upgraded to the business...
It's not like proper business class, but you get a little bit more space at the front, a meal, and you get to go in the lounge at the airport.
I took Mum and Dad and you should have seen them in that lounge.
It was like Black Friday.
It was a 6:30 AM flight, right.
When we landed at nine, guess how many brandies my mum had had.
Seven.
LAUGHTER
She'd had a bottle of brandy.
She went, "I'm getting my money's worth."
She come out on a profit.
I once got so badly delayed in a lounge in Newcastle after a football match I was watching.
IN BAD NEWCASTLE ACCENT:
Newcastle United was playing.
I don't believe it.
What you doing?
!
No idea.
And there were four guys and me in the lounge and then they ended up putting us on a coach and taking us to Middlesbrough and then putting us on a...
And I ended up going out with one of the guys.
I ended up having an actual relationship.
How long did you go out for?
Oh, a few months.
So what you're saying is a good alternative to Tinder is to go to Newcastle United for a match and then get a replacement bus service.
I mean, that's...
Aisling, I'm really sorry.
Yeah.
But we're all thinking it.
When you do a Newcastle accent are you really trying to mock me?
It does sound like that.
It does sound a lot like that.
I mean...
Let's take a look and see if the BA chaos is up there.
Yes, it's the British Airways' IT crash.
So those were the nation's most popular talking points, but in other news, a clip of a Russian newsreader being rudely interrupted during her TV broadcast went viral this week.
Take a look.
Think the dog was a cameraman and he was trying to, like, trying to rejig the chairs or something like that.
Krishnan, has anything like that ever interrupted you?
I'm usually the one doing the interrupting.
PHIL:
Didn't Quentin Tarantino shut your butt down?
He said he was going to.
He didn't actually do it.
He said he was going to shut your butt down?
Yeah, I don't know what that would have entailed.
GABBY:
You would have been able to go to Susan Boyle's anal bum party.
OK.
At the end of that round,
Rob, Krishnan and Rosie have two points,
Aisling, Gaby and Phil have one point.
So, that's it for part two, see you after the break.
Welcome back to 8 Out Of 10 Cats.
And The Winner Is is the name of our final round.
Here's your first one.
Um, when you go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like,
"covfefe."
What's the worst thing that's happened to you at work?
Gabby?
I coughed over the Chelsea manager Conte after the FA Cup final.
That was quite embarrassing.
Did you get any spitty bits out?
I started having a proper coughing fit, but he carried on answering the question and then I started pinching myself because I thought, if I pinch myself, it might hurt more than the cough that wants to come out and I'll stop coughing.
Oh, God.
So I was closing my eyes and I was pinching myself and then I started crying.
And then I thought, I'm going to have to cough, so I turned to cough, not knowing that his wingman was stood right behind me...
What do you mean, his wingman?
Was he trying to chat you up?
Phil, have you ever been embarrassed at work?
Well, I work on my own because I just sit at home and write things.
So, the only person I have to embarrass myself in front of is me, which does happen, sometimes I'll catch myself naked and be like,
"Oh, sorry."
You know, sometimes I'll do a fart and no-one 'fesses up to it...
Or sending the e-mail and forgetting the attachment.
And then you have to send another one,
"Oh, the attachment might help," and it's just like, oh...
It's embarrassing.
Well, you're very close there with sending the e-mail.
Erm, maybe, including the people it's about.
Yes!
Well, yeah, I'll give you that.
Sending the e-mail to the wrong person.
Oh, yeah.
You don't think?
You're wrong.
It's shitting yourself.
If you shit yourself at work, it's the worst thing...
Classic number two!
You're telling me that if you're at work at your desk, you shit yourself, that isn't as bad as going, "Oh, I sent that to him."
How often do you think that happens in the workplace?
I've never sent an e-mail to the wrong person ever.
But you've shit yourself?
I've shit myself two or three times this week.
I can smell it.
OK, yes, the most embarrassing thing to happen at work is sending an e-mail to the wrong person.
A really embarrassing moment at work is when you're standing next to a guy at the urinal and you lose your erection.
OK, another question.
What do you think?
Having a bath.
What?
I can't work out how to clean myself.
I can't work out how to do the cleaning.
I don't ever feel clean after a bath.
I just sort of sit in it like...
In order to clean your bits, you've got to...
You can't just...
If you put the soap or the shower gel on your hand and then you go in and it's sort of gone in the water before it's touched the skin...
You have to sort of pop it out and go...
When you're popping out to do the little clean, do you have to do that face?
Cos I think that face is the issue.
Well, no-one's watching me have a bath, so it doesn't matter what my face is doing, does it?
This is degrading.
I don't like that, I'm no good at going upstairs, my legs ain't the right length for stairs.
They're too long for one step at a time but not long enough for two.
So I either have to lunge up or do little shuffles.
I can't take memory sticks out of my computer, it tells me off.
"That was taken out unexpectedly." No, it weren't.
I knew I was going to do it.
APPLAUSE
OK, Rosie, what do you wish you were better at?
This question annoys me because I'm perfectly perfect how I am.
Why should I wish I was better at anything?
I mean...
Apart from online gambling.
I'm really, really bad at that.
So, you wish you were better at being lucky?
Yeah.
What thing do you wish you were better at?
Gabby, what do you think?
Do you know, I have been running since I was about one.
What from, Gabs?
I've pretty much run my whole life, you know?
And I've never got any better at it.
Yeah.
So, I said to Paula Radcliffe, how can I get better at running?
I thought, I'll go straight to the top and work with Paula, she gave me this, like, long technical answer that involved hard work...
And I just thought, I'm going to carry on doing running.
Can you ask her what her most embarrassing moment at work was?
What do you think it was?
I'm telling you now, it ain't sending an e-mail to the wrong person.
Sent it to Flora instead of Virgin, oh!
I think maybe I'd like to finally solve the mystery of how to wash a bowl after Weetabix have been in it.
Why, why Weetabix?
Why don't they use Weetabix to put like buildings together or bricks?
Have you tried not eating Weetabix?
Cos it doubles up.
Cos Weetabix is disgusting.
Yes.
So, top thing people wish they were better at?
Sex.
Sex is number eight on the list.
Do you wish you were better at sex?
No, but I think other people should wish they were.
Do you know, my mum's complete chat about the birds and the bees was when I was 15 and she...
My sister and I were discussing sex and she came into the bathroom and she just looked at me and she went,
"How do you know you'll be any good at it?"
And walked out.
That was it.
Oh, my God.
Well, she knew I was a very competitive person, so she put me off another two years cos I just wanted to make sure I nailed that.
She was very clever.
What do you do at the gym to prepare for that?
Oh, no, it was more about watching, reading.
Oh, OK, the theory!
Phil's got a lot of the theory.
He could ace the theory.
Oh, God.
The practical, who knows?
Any day now.
OK, it's a school subject.
Maths!
Maths!
It's something you would learn at school.
Languages.
Languages is exactly right.
Yes, the top thing people wish they were better at is foreign languages.
I'm fluent in the language of love but sometimes I speak too quickly and my girlfriend ends up having to chat to herself.
BUZZER
Well, that sound tells me it's the end of the round and of the show which means the final scores are Rob, Krishnan and Rosie have two points.
Aisling, Gabby and Phil are the winners with three points.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Thanks to all of our panellists and our wonderful studio audience and to all of you watching from home.
That's it from us, goodnight!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Okay, Cosmo.
Shake.
Good boy!
See how easy it is?
Tommy, shake.
Good boy!
Max, what are you up to?
Training Tommy to do tricks.
Why does his breath smell like Pup-Peroni?
Because he wouldn't eat the Snausages.
[doorbell ringing] [chattering]
I got that.
I got it.
[commotion]
Look, I just started dating this guy.
Everybody, just please act normal.
But it's Hunter Pence.
He's my favorite San Francisco Giant.
The man's won two World Series.
Just don't embarrass me, okay?
[all mutter in agreement]
- Hi!
- Hi!
[commotion]
Cheese!
Hunter, I apologize.
This is my family not embarrassing me.
I don't know what all the fuss is about.
I'm just a regular guy.
I put on my uniform two legs at a time.
Don't you mean one leg at a time?
No.
I stand on my bed and jump right into them.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Underpants.
It's Hunter Pence.
Really?
That's disappointing.
Well, sit.
Sit, sit.
Oh, it's so nice to have you.
You and Stephanie make the cutest couple.
And Stephanie is the nicest person I've ever met.
How was that?
Except where you asked me how it was, it was great.
It's so awesome your lifetime batting average is .284.
Right, Steph?
Right.
I'm delighted to meet all of you guys.
And you kids, you're so lucky to have Stephanie as your aunt.
Did I get that right, Steph?
Okay, look, I wanted this to go well.
Hunter, I read online that you eat pizza with a fork.
Don't trust anything you read online, except for that!
I've got my special pizza fork right here at all times.
Check that out.
Isn't he the cutest?
I just get lost in those big old crazy eyes.
I only have crazy eyes for you.
Aw...
Well, this is so nice of you to invite us all to the game today.
Oh, here are your tickets.
You don't want to miss Stephanie singing during the Seventh Inning Stretch.
And thanks for hooking this up, but it's a little terrifying.
You said you want a singing career.
I was thinking more an open mic night at a deserted coffee house.
Hey, you're singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" to people at a ball game.
It's the happiest moment in baseball.
Except for when you take your cup off after a doubleheader.
Don't I know it.
Mr. Hunter Pence, sir.
I have show-and-tell on Monday.
Could you please hit me a foul ball?
I'm in a bit of a slump right now, so I can't promise you anything.
But I will give it my best shot.
How about that?
Yeah.
You know, I'm starting to think your slump is my fault.
- You haven't got a hit since we've dated.
- Oh, my gosh!
You're the mystery blonde.
You're the jinx.
Oh, it's all over the Internet.
- [clamoring]
- You're the jinx?
Hey, guys.
It's not Stephanie's fault.
I'm the one swinging the bat.
Speaking of swinging the bat, you're a tad late on the fastball.
- And dropping your right elbow.
- You're swinging at garbage.
- I'll let our batting coach know.
- You have a batting coach?
Better fire that guy.
- Alright, I'll see you later.
- [Hunter] Alright, see you later.
Hunter Pence!
Dude, you are the greatest.
Man, finally, a real fan.
Oh, my God.
Oh, hey, man.
I played some Little League.
From one All-Star to another, choke up on that bat.
I'll leave the tickets at Will Call next time.
I just came by to pick up my ticket.
Yeah.
Here you go, Matt.
We will see you at the seats.
Oh, sweet.
Okay, great.
I will see all of you guys there.
- Bye.
- Bye, Matt!
Oh, I forgot, there's one more thing I need to talk to you about.
Wow!
Well, I remembered that thing that I need to talk to you about.
[D.J. sighs]
Oh, we were...
We were just talking about animal clinic business stuff.
Mom, you like him.
Would it bother you boys if I did?
- No.
Matt's cool.
- I like him.
I'm not your kid, but I like him, too.
Tommy, what do you think?
[adopts child's voice] He's not a three-time All-Star, but he's okay.
Wow, I'm so glad that the kids are cool with Matt.
Because he is kind of great.
Have you mentioned this to Steve?
He might not think Matt's so great.
[sighs]
I know.
I've been avoiding this for too long.
I'm going to go tell Steve that I'm interested in someone else.
I mean, we haven't dated in 20 years.
It'll be fine.
Can you guys tell him for me?
I'll tell him.
Sorry, Steve.
Mom likes another dude.
So since Lola's coming to the game with us, can you make me look good by laughing when I say something funny?
Sure, if that ever happens.
Come on.
This is important to me.
Fine, I'll be your wing girl.
Just try to be cool.
J-Money don't try.
J-Money is.
[laughs]
What?
You told me to laugh if you said something funny...
J-Money.
Aw, this was so fun.
This is Cosmo's first walk with his doggy mom.
We should walk our dogs together every morning.
And every night.
Hey, let's just move in together.
You know, for the dogs.
Do you have a minute to chat?
I gotta meet friends later, but sure.
Sit.
Good dogs.
Good Steve.
You know, I know we've been spending a lot of time together lately.
And it's been great.
But I...
Isn't it crazy how fate has brought us back together?
You hear about couples who were each other's first loves and later in life, they find their way back to each other.
Ah, you're such a romantic.
That's one of the things I love about you.
What are some other things?
I could be late.
[laughs]
I love that you always make me laugh.
And I love that we're still friends.
I gotta be honest, since we've been hanging out again like this, all these old feelings are coming back.
What about you?
Well, of course I still care about you.
I feel exactly the same way.
Hey, Deej, I wonder if we still have the old chemistry.
- Oh, I don't know.
- Well, let's find out.
That was our first kiss since high school.
[both chuckle]
I feel like we're back underneath the bleachers again.
Oh, you were pretty fun.
I'm a lot more fun now.
I mean, that kiss...
That was really nice.
But we could do a whole lot better.
- Steve, I can't.
- Sure you can.
Watch.
Whoa.
She is really letting him down easy.
Yeah, he seems to be taking the bad news pretty well.
- Whoa.
- Wow.
See, I told you we could do better.
Well, um, I should get going.
Yeah, I guess you should.
Okay.
But, um, we will kiss about this later.
Have you seen my dog?
Comet?
[Kimmy] Here she comes.
[Kimmy whistles innocently]
Kimmy, you realize there's no coffee in that pot?
Oh.
Yeah, I'm cutting back on my caffeine.
You guys saw our little kiss goodbye, huh?
Well, we saw the G-rated peck and then the R-rated full-frontal Frenching.
Well, I was going to tell him about Matt.
And then he kissed me.
And I liked it.
But I just kissed Matt two hours ago.
Oh, my gosh.
Am I a floozy?
Anyone who uses the word "floozy" cannot be a floozy.
Isn't Matt moving back to Miami in, like, two weeks?
You're right.
I mean, long-distance relationships never work.
I should tell Matt we should just be friends.
Well, if it goes as well as it did with Steve, he's a lucky man.

[D.J.] Hey!
Hey, Steph.
Your boy Hunter really came through with some great seats today.
- [Steph] He's such a doll.
- Pardon me.
Excuse me.
[groans] Pardon me.
Help me, Steph.
[grunts] Ooh, boy, here we go.
Yes.
Ooh, phew.
Hi.
Yeah, oh, security frowns on personal advertising, but Gibbler Style Party Planning doesn't play by the rules.
[chuckles]
The JumboTron's going to love my Fathead.
Kimmy, I'm just curious.
How many ideas did you go through before deciding that this was the best one?
Hey, Mom.
Can I get something to eat?
Oh, hey, no.
You know what?
I got this ticket for free.
This is my treat.
Put it on my card.
Aw, thanks, Matt.
Anybody want to get a bite with me?
Oh, get me a hot dog.
Mustard on the left, ketchup on the right, relish down the middle.
The mustard and ketchup can't touch.
And my drink should be half root beer and half diet soda, a splash of lemonade.
I call it a Lola-Cola.
Maybe you should just go with him.
Works for me.
[music playing over speakers] [crowd cheering]
[announcer] Now batting for the Giants, right fielder, number eight, Hunter Pence.
[shouts] Go, Pencey, go.
Aw, he cleaned out his ear.
It's our secret signal.
Oh, how romantic.
A finger full of wax.
I saw that ear thing.
You're that mystery blonde, ain't you?
You're the jinx.
Boo!
[yells] Boo, Aunt Stephanie!
Why are you booing me?
I'm a Giant's fan.
Hello.
Aw, he struck out again.
You'll get him next time, baby.
[shouts] Dump her, Hunter!
She's killing you, buddy!
So, you want a hat or something?
[gasps] Oh, my gosh!
It's an autographed two-time Cy Young award-winning Tim Lincecum in-game jersey.
He's my favorite pitcher of the modern era.
We'll take it.
Really?
Awesome!
You didn't have to do that.
But I'm kind of glad I did.
- That will be $247.
- Whoa.
No wonder my parents never bought me one.
Are you sure about this?
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
No problem.
Just put it on my card.
Sure thing.
Dr. Harmon?
Dr. Matt Harmon.
There's something I really want to show you.
It's my favorite place in the stadium.
Is that okay?
Sure.
That's how you do it.
[crowd cheering]
Ramona, Jackson just texted me.
He and Lola are watching the game from the top deck.
Do they want me to come up?
Um, it didn't say that.
Well, I guess this is the thanks I get for helping Jackson.
They ditched me.
Hey, you think you've got problems?
Monday's show-and-tell and I've got bupkis.
[yells] Somebody hit me a foul ball.
[Max shouts] Hey, man, not over there.
I'm by first base!
Hey, Deej, I have been meaning to talk to you about something.
About me moving back to Miami.
Oh, I've been wanting to talk to you about that, too.
Long-distance relationships are really hard.
Yes, well, the truth is that my family's here, right, and I love this city and I love working at the clinic because there's this cute doctor that works there.
And so I have decided to move to San Francisco permanently.
This San Francisco?
Oh, I thought you'd be a little more excited than that.
No, I am.
It's wonderful.
I just thought you were going to Steve.
I mean, leave.
But now you're going to Steve... stay.
[announcer] Now batting for the Giants, number eight, Hunter Pence.
Hand me a foul ball.
But not too hard.
Max, honey, the odds of Hunter hitting a foul ball directly to you are like a billion to one.
[Max shouts] He just hit one our way!
- [D.J. gasps] Oh!
- Oh, here it comes.
- [D.J.] It's coming right at us!
- Yes, come to Daddy!
Hey, man, that was my ball.
Better get used to it now, kid, because life's a series of broken dreams and bitter disappointments.
Except today, because I got myself a foul ball.
- Hootie-hoo to you.
- Hey, buddy.
He's just a kid, man.
Don't be a jerk, okay?
Yeah, whatever, pal.
[groans] Ooh, I just sat on my nachos.
Yeah, that's what you get for being a meanie.
Snap.
[crowd groans]
- He struck out again.
- Thanks to you, Jinxie.
I'm about to go entertain the crowd, okay?
You enjoy sitting on your cheese.
Come on, Ramona.
Grab a fathead.
Let's give these people what they came here for.
I think they came here to see a game.
They came here for a good time.
That's what we'll give them.
I have nothing else to do.
I've officially been friend-snatched.
Wow, you were right.
This view is amazing.
Yeah.
My dad used to bring me up here.
[Lola] You can see the city.
You can see the bay.
I see my mom's car getting a parking ticket.
I told her that wasn't a space.
It's windy.
[chuckles]
- Are you cold?
- A little.
I'll keep you warm.
- Can we take a selfie?
- No.
I didn't think so.
This is the perfect spot for maximum Gibbler exposure.
[rock music playing over speakers]
[Kimmy] Alright.
Are you ready?
Here we go.
Five, six, seven, eight... [chants] Party planning, Gibbler Style!
[both] Always goes the extra mile!
Is she really your best friend?
- [Kimmy] Party planning, Gibbler Style!
- [Ramona] Always leaves you with a smile!
Here comes security.
[Kimmy chants] Dakota Fanning, Tatum Channing, they all love my party planning!
Hey, hey, hey, careful with those fatheads.
[shouts] Go, go, Gibbler for all your party planning needs.
[announcer] The Giants remind fans to please stay off the dugout.
Kimmy's getting hauled out of here.
Do you want to go help her?
Oh, no.
This happens to Kimmy all the time.
Oh, get your camera out.
Stephanie's about to sing.
[announcer] Now it's time for the Seventh Inning Stretch.
So get on your feet and show your San Francisco spirit by joining Stephanie Tanner in the singing of "Take Me Out To the Ballgame."
Take it away, Stephanie.
[music playing over speakers] [shouts] She's a jinx.
Boo!
We love you, Stephanie.
Go Steph.
[chants] Jinx, jinx!
- This goes out to Hunter Pence...
- [man] Jinx, jinx!
You may never get a hit again, but you're a hit in my heart.

How rude!
But do you know what?
San Francisco is my city, so if that's what you people want, then for the love of the Giants, I will break up with Hunter Pence right now.
I'm sorry, Hunter.
It's over.
Stephanie's broken up with a lot of guys, but this is the first time it'll be on SportsCenter.

[announcer] The Giants extend their apologies.
Now, let's enjoy the Kiss Cam.
[crowd cheering]
["I Got You Babe" playing]
Hey, there's my girl!
She's such a good mom, you guys.
[crowd booing]
Whoa, guys, leave her alone.
She's being polite.
Good job, honey.
[crowd cheering] [shouts] Kiss him, Mom.
Don't do it, D.J.
[crowd cheering] [yells] What?
No...
D.J.!
Excuse me, sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Excuse me.
D.J., a word.
Out of my way, Lou Seal.
This doesn't concern you, Lou.
Whoa.
This isn't your business, Lou Seal.
Isn't that your podiatrist, wrestling a seal?
Oh, my lanta!
What is Steve doing here?
- D.J., I need a word with you, please.
- [security guard] Sir, let's go.
What's he so upset about?
I don't know.
We were just kissing this morning!
Did he say you two were kissing this morning?
I don't know, I can't hear.
Let's go, Giants.
[shouts] Let's go, Giants.
[announcer] Now batting for the Giants, number eight.
Look, here they come.
[Stephanie sighs]
Well, what a fun way to launch my singing career...
An emotional breakdown in front of 40,000 people.
Not only did I make it on the JumboTron, but guess what?
Channel Six caught it all, and I'll be on the eleven o'clock news tonight.
I lead a charmed life.
Do we have to leave?
I didn't catch my foul ball.
Yeah.
It's the bottom of the ninth.
Bases are loaded.
Giants are down by three.
- Hunter Pence is up to bat.
- [yells] Hit me a home run, Pencey!
Max, the odds of him hitting a home run directly to you are like a billion to one.
- He hit a long drive to right field.
- This is right field.
[Jackson] It's going, going... gone!
It's not gone, it's right here.
[screams] Whoo-hoo!
Okay, let's go home.
Come on, everybody.
Let's see if we're on SportsCenter.
Hey, Max, you're going to have a great story for show-and-tell on Monday.
Yeah, my home run ball is so much cooler than Taylor's sea monkeys.
And they aren't even monkeys.
They're just shrimp.
Kids are so gullible.
Are you sure we're cool?
I feel really bad about breaking the girl code.
Sisters before misters.
Well, if you feel really bad, then I feel better.
It was all my fault.
I invited her out to my favorite seats.
I mean, I never expected her to say yes.
Are you sure I can't help you pay for this jersey?
Nah, it's okay.
I worked out a deal with Dr. Matt.
I'm washing his car this weekend.
And every weekend for the next two years.
What are you doing?
Well, I'm expecting a little fallout from my unexpected double-date.
I'm changing my email, shutting down Facebook and pricing a four-bedroom house in Idaho.
[doorbell ringing]
I'll get that.
Might be one of the guys you kissed in the last eight hours.
Hey, it is.
D.J., we need to have a little chat.
[doorbell ringing]
I get to answer this one.
- Hi, Matt.
- [sighs] Hi.
D.J., the other guy you kissed is here.
D.J., you said we could talk about things later.
Well... it's later.
Wow, this is the second time today you guys are in the same place at the same time.
Isn't that funny?
[D.J. chuckles nervously]
Okay, why don't we all just sit down on the couch and we can talk about our day.
[Steph] Excuse me, sorry.
Scoot over, Steve.
Okay.
Sorry.
Oh, did you not need us here for this?
- No.
- Okay.
We'll be in the kitchen pretending not to listen.
The truth is, well, Matt and I just started dating.
And, Steve, I was going to tell you, but then you kissed me.
And then I was going to tell Matt that I kissed Steve.
But then, Matt, you kissed me.
And, well, Steve, you saw.
So...
So as you can see, I am completely innocent in all of this.
Okay, thanks for stopping by.
Wait, D.J., I have, like, real feelings for you.
Uh, and I have realer feelings for you.
The past six weeks have been great.
Oh, six weeks?
We go back 25 years.
Checkmate.
Your move.
Man, there is no move after checkmate.
That was my point exactly.
Guys, you are both great.
But it was just a week ago that I decided I was ready to go on my first date.
My first date in 15 years.
And now I have two amazing men that want to date me, and I like them both and I am so confused.
How can you be confused after the kiss that we had?
Oh, please.
That crowd-induced JumboTron pity kiss?
Come on.
No.
I'm talking about our first kiss.
I'll see you Monday.
Okay, Monday it is.
D.J., wait.
- [Steve yells] Oh!
- Oh, now that's a kiss.
D.J.!
How could you do this to me?
I wasn't doing it to you.
Oh, that was nothing.
Alright, you want to see some real romance?
Watch this.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Oh, we were in love.
You were in high school.
Wow, Steve.
Your hair was great.
Our kids would have that hair.
Not for long.
What are you two doing here?
Sorry, we'll go back in the kitchen.
D.J., what do you want to do?
Please don't put any pressure on me.
I'm not ready to make any big decisions.
I'm not interested in being in some kind of competition.
I agree.
I'm out.
Okay, if he's out, I'm totally back in.
Then I'm back in, too.
Can we have dinner next week?
Um, yeah, sure.
Can we go out, too?
Yeah, I guess so.
Okay, great.
Great, so I'll see you soon.
And I'll see you sooner.
Do you see my problem?
You're both great kissers.
I was not impressed.
Not impressed at all.
I wasn't even trying.
D.J. Fuller, dating two guys at once.
[sighs] How did this happen?
Simple.
You're a floozy.
Okay, Cosmo.
Shake.
Good boy!
See how easy it is?
Tommy, shake.
Good boy!
Max, what are you up to?
Training Tommy to do tricks.
Why does his breath smell like Pup-Peroni?
Because he wouldn't eat the Snausages.
I got that.
I got it.
Look, I just started dating this guy.
Everybody, just please act normal.
But it's Hunter Pence.
He's my favorite San Francisco Giant.
The man's won two World Series.
Just don't embarrass me, okay?
- Hi!
- Hi!
Cheese!
Hunter, I apologize.
This is my family not embarrassing me.
I don't know what all the fuss is about.
I'm just a regular guy.
I put on my uniform two legs at a time.
Don't you mean one leg at a time?
No.
I stand on my bed and jump right into them.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Underpants.
It's Hunter Pence.
Really?
That's disappointing.
Well, sit.
Sit, sit.
Oh, it's so nice to have you.
You and Stephanie make the cutest couple.
And Stephanie is the nicest person I've ever met.
How was that?
Except where you asked me how it was, it was great.
It's so awesome your lifetime batting average is .284.
Right, Steph?
Right.
I'm delighted to meet all of you guys.
And you kids, you're so lucky to have Stephanie as your aunt.
Did I get that right, Steph?
Okay, look, I wanted this to go well.
Hunter, I read online that you eat pizza with a fork.
Don't trust anything you read online, except for that!
I've got my special pizza fork right here at all times.
Check that out.
Isn't he the cutest?
I just get lost in those big old crazy eyes.
I only have crazy eyes for you.
Aw...
Well, this is so nice of you to invite us all to the game today.
Oh, here are your tickets.
You don't want to miss Stephanie singing during the Seventh Inning Stretch.
And thanks for hooking this up, but it's a little terrifying.
You said you want a singing career.
I was thinking more an open mic night at a deserted coffee house.
Hey, you're singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" to people at a ball game.
It's the happiest moment in baseball.
Except for when you take your cup off after a doubleheader.
Don't I know it.
Mr. Hunter Pence, sir.
I have show-and-tell on Monday.
Could you please hit me a foul ball?
I'm in a bit of a slump right now, so I can't promise you anything.
But I will give it my best shot.
How about that?
Yeah.
You know, I'm starting to think your slump is my fault.
- You haven't got a hit since we've dated.
- Oh, my gosh!
You're the mystery blonde.
You're the jinx.
Oh, it's all over the Internet.
You're the jinx?
Hey, guys.
It's not Stephanie's fault.
I'm the one swinging the bat.
Speaking of swinging the bat, you're a tad late on the fastball.
- And dropping your right elbow.
- You're swinging at garbage.
- I'll let our batting coach know.
- You have a batting coach?
Better fire that guy.
- Alright, I'll see you later.
- Alright, see you later.
Hunter Pence!
Dude, you are the greatest.
Man, finally, a real fan.
Oh, my God.
Oh, hey, man.
I played some Little League.
From one All-Star to another, choke up on that bat.
I'll leave the tickets at Will Call next time.
I just came by to pick up my ticket.
Yeah.
Here you go, Matt.
We will see you at the seats.
Oh, sweet.
Okay, great.
I will see all of you guys there.
- Bye.
- Bye, Matt!
Oh, I forgot, there's one more thing I need to talk to you about.
Wow!
Well, I remembered that thing that I need to talk to you about.
Oh, we were...
We were just talking about animal clinic business stuff.
Mom, you like him.
Would it bother you boys if I did?
- No.
Matt's cool.
- I like him.
I'm not your kid, but I like him, too.
Tommy, what do you think?
He's not a three-time All-Star, but he's okay.
Wow, I'm so glad that the kids are cool with Matt.
Because he is kind of great.
Have you mentioned this to Steve?
He might not think Matt's so great.
I know.
I've been avoiding this for too long.
I'm going to go tell Steve that I'm interested in someone else.
I mean, we haven't dated in 20 years.
It'll be fine.
Can you guys tell him for me?
I'll tell him.
Sorry, Steve.
Mom likes another dude.
So since Lola's coming to the game with us, can you make me look good by laughing when I say something funny?
Sure, if that ever happens.
Come on.
This is important to me.
Fine, I'll be your wing girl.
Just try to be cool.
J-Money don't try.

- Sure you can.
Watch.
Whoa.
She is really letting him down easy.
Yeah, he seems to be taking the bad news pretty well.
- Whoa.
- Wow.
See, I told you we could do better.
Well, um, I should get going.
Yeah, I guess you should.
Okay.
But, um, we will kiss about this later.

Works for me.
Now batting for the Giants, right fielder, number eight, Hunter Pence.
Go, Pencey, go.
Aw, he cleaned out his ear.
It's our secret signal.
Oh, how romantic.
A finger full of wax.
I saw that ear thing.
You're that mystery blonde, ain't you?
You're the jinx.
Boo!
Boo, Aunt Stephanie!
Why are you booing me?
I'm a Giant's fan.
Hello.
Aw, he struck out again.
You'll get him next time, baby.
Dump her, Hunter!
She's killing you, buddy!
So, you want a hat or something?
Oh, my gosh!
It's an autographed two-time Cy Young award-winning Tim Lincecum in-game jersey.
He's my favorite pitcher of the modern era.
We'll take it.
Really?
Awesome!
You didn't have to do that.
But I'm kind of glad I did.
- That will be $247.
- Whoa.
No wonder my parents never bought me one.
Are you sure about this?
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
No problem.
Just put it on my card.
Sure thing.
Dr. Harmon?
Dr. Matt Harmon.
There's something I really want to show you.
It's my favorite place in the stadium.
Is that okay?
Sure.
That's how you do it.
Ramona, Jackson just texted me.
He and Lola are watching the game from the top deck.
Do they want me to come up?
Um, it didn't say that.
Well, I guess this is the thanks I get for helping Jackson.
They ditched me.
Hey, you think you've got problems?
Monday's show-and-tell and I've got bupkis.
Somebody hit me a foul ball.
Hey, man, not over there.
I'm by first base!
Hey, Deej, I have been meaning to talk to you about something.
About me moving back to Miami.
Oh, I've been wanting to talk to you about that, too.
Long-distance relationships are really hard.
Yes, well, the truth is that my family's here, right, and I love this city and I love working at the clinic because there's this cute doctor that works there.
And so I have decided to move to San Francisco permanently.
This San Francisco?
Oh, I thought you'd be a little more excited than that.
No, I am.
It's wonderful.
I just thought you were going to Steve.
I mean, leave.
But now you're going to Steve... stay.
Now batting for the Giants, number eight, Hunter Pence.
Hand me a foul ball.
But not too hard.
Max, honey, the odds of Hunter hitting a foul ball directly to you are like a billion to one.
He just hit one our way!
- Oh!
- Oh, here it comes.
- It's coming right at us!
- Yes, come to Daddy!
Hey, man, that was my ball.
Better get used to it now, kid, because life's a series of broken dreams and bitter disappointments.
Except today, because I got myself a foul ball.
- Hootie-hoo to you.
- Hey, buddy.
He's just a kid, man.
Don't be a jerk, okay?
Yeah, whatever, pal.
Ooh, I just sat on my nachos.
Yeah, that's what you get for being a meanie.
Snap.
- He struck out again.
- Thanks to you, Jinxie.
I'm about to go entertain the crowd, okay?
You enjoy sitting on your cheese.
Come on, Ramona.
Grab a fathead.
Let's give these people what they came here for.
I think they came here to see a game.
They came here for a good time.
That's what we'll give them.
I have nothing else to do.
I've officially been friend-snatched.
Wow, you were right.
This view is amazing.
Yeah.
My dad used to bring me up here.
You can see the city.
You can see the bay.
I see my mom's car getting a parking ticket.
I told her that wasn't a space.
It's windy.
- Are you cold?
- A little.
I'll keep you warm.
- Can we take a selfie?
- No.
I didn't think so.
This is the perfect spot for maximum Gibbler exposure.
Alright.
Are you ready?
Here we go.
Five, six, seven, eight...
Party planning, Gibbler Style!
Always goes the extra mile!
Is she really your best friend?
- Party planning, Gibbler Style!
- Always leaves you with a smile!
Here comes security.
Dakota Fanning, Tatum Channing, they all love my party planning!
Hey, hey, hey, careful with those fatheads.
Go, go, Gibbler for all your party planning needs.
The Giants remind fans to please stay off the dugout.
Kimmy's getting hauled out of here.
Do you want to go help her?
Oh, no.
This happens to Kimmy all the time.
Oh, get your camera out.
Stephanie's about to sing.
Now it's time for the Seventh Inning Stretch.
So get on your feet and show your San Francisco spirit by joining Stephanie Tanner in the singing of "Take Me Out To the Ballgame."
Take it away, Stephanie.
She's a jinx.
Boo!
We love you, Stephanie.
Go Steph.
Jinx, jinx!
- This goes out to Hunter Pence...
- Jinx, jinx!
You may never get a hit again, but you're a hit in my heart.
♪ Take me out to the ball game ♪
♪ Take me out to the crowd ♪
♪ Buy me some peanuts and... ♪
What is wrong with you people?
What do you want from me?
Wait, you want me to break up with Hunter Pence?
How rude!
But do you know what?
San Francisco is my city, so if that's what you people want, then for the love of the Giants, I will break up with Hunter Pence right now.
I'm sorry, Hunter.
It's over.
Stephanie's broken up with a lot of guys, but this is the first time it'll be on SportsCenter.
Oh, Hunter, I just want to look in those crazy eyes one more time.
Hunter!
Hunter!
Hunter!
Hunter, no!
Hunter, wait!
Hunter!
Wait!
Well, maybe I'll get a hit now.
The Giants extend their apologies.
Now, let's enjoy the Kiss Cam.
Hey, there's my girl!
She's such a good mom, you guys.
Whoa, guys, leave her alone.
She's being polite.
Good job, honey.
Kiss him, Mom.
Don't do it, D.J.
What?
No...
D.J.!
Excuse me, sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Excuse me.
D.J., a word.
Out of my way, Lou Seal.
This doesn't concern you, Lou.
Whoa.
This isn't your business, Lou Seal.
Isn't that your podiatrist, wrestling a seal?
Oh, my lanta!
What is Steve doing here?
- D.J., I need a word with you, please.
- Sir, let's go.
What's he so upset about?
I don't know.
We were just kissing this morning!
Did he say you two were kissing this morning?
I don't know, I can't hear.
Let's go, Giants.
Let's go, Giants.
Now batting for the Giants, number eight.
Look, here they come.
Well, what a fun way to launch my singing career...
An emotional breakdown in front of 40,000 people.
Not only did I make it on the JumboTron, but guess what?
Channel Six caught it all, and I'll be on the eleven o'clock news tonight.
I lead a charmed life.
Do we have to leave?
I didn't catch my foul ball.
Yeah.
It's the bottom of the ninth.
Bases are loaded.
Giants are down by three.
- Hunter Pence is up to bat.
- Hit me a home run, Pencey!
Max, the odds of him hitting a home run directly to you are like a billion to one.
- He hit a long drive to right field.
- This is right field.
It's going, going... gone!
It's not gone, it's right here.
Whoo-hoo!
Okay, let's go home.
Come on, everybody.
Let's see if we're on SportsCenter.
Hey, Max, you're going to have a great story for show-and-tell on Monday.
Yeah, my home run ball is so much cooler than Taylor's sea monkeys.
And they aren't even monkeys.
They're just shrimp.
Kids are so gullible.
Are you sure we're cool?
I feel really bad about breaking the girl code.
Sisters before misters.
Well, if you feel really bad, then I feel better.
It was all my fault.
I invited her out to my favorite seats.
I mean, I never expected her to say yes.
Are you sure I can't help you pay for this jersey?
Nah, it's okay.
I worked out a deal with Dr. Matt.
I'm washing his car this weekend.
And every weekend for the next two years.
What are you doing?
Well, I'm expecting a little fallout from my unexpected double-date.
I'm changing my email, shutting down Facebook and pricing a four-bedroom house in Idaho.
I'll get that.
Might be one of the guys you kissed in the last eight hours.
Hey, it is.
D.J., we need to have a little chat.
I get to answer this one.
- Hi, Matt.
- Hi.
D.J., the other guy you kissed is here.
D.J., you said we could talk about things later.
Well... it's later.
Wow, this is the second time today you guys are in the same place at the same time.
Isn't that funny?
Okay, why don't we all just sit down on the couch and we can talk about our day.
Excuse me, sorry.
Scoot over, Steve.
Okay.
Sorry.
Oh, did you not need us here for this?
- No.
- Okay.
We'll be in the kitchen pretending not to listen.
The truth is, well, Matt and I just started dating.
And, Steve, I was going to tell you, but then you kissed me.
And then I was going to tell Matt that I kissed Steve.
But then, Matt, you kissed me.
And, well, Steve, you saw.
So...
So as you can see, I am completely innocent in all of this.
Okay, thanks for stopping by.
Wait, D.J., I have, like, real feelings for you.
Uh, and I have realer feelings for you.
The past six weeks have been great.
Oh, six weeks?
We go back 25 years.
Checkmate.
Your move.
Man, there is no move after checkmate.
That was my point exactly.
Guys, you are both great.
But it was just a week ago that I decided I was ready to go on my first date.
My first date in 15 years.
And now I have two amazing men that want to date me, and I like them both and I am so confused.
How can you be confused after the kiss that we had?
Oh, please.
That crowd-induced JumboTron pity kiss?
Come on.
No.
I'm talking about our first kiss.
I'll see you Monday.
Okay, Monday it is.
D.J., wait.
- Oh!
- Oh, now that's a kiss.
D.J.!
How could you do this to me?
I wasn't doing it to you.
Oh, that was nothing.
Alright, you want to see some real romance?
Watch this.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Oh, we were in love.
You were in high school.
Wow, Steve.
Your hair was great.
Our kids would have that hair.
Not for long.
What are you two doing here?
Sorry, we'll go back in the kitchen.
D.J., what do you want to do?
Please don't put any pressure on me.
I'm not ready to make any big decisions.
I'm not interested in being in some kind of competition.
I agree.
I'm out.
Okay, if he's out, I'm totally back in.
Then I'm back in, too.
Can we have dinner next week?
Um, yeah, sure.
Can we go out, too?
Yeah, I guess so.
Okay, great.
Great, so I'll see you soon.
And I'll see you sooner.
Do you see my problem?
You're both great kissers.
I was not impressed.
Not impressed at all.
I wasn't even trying.
D.J. Fuller, dating two guys at once.
How did this happen?
Simple.
You're a floozy.
- Dearly beloved.
We're gathered here today to celebrate the holy union of Paul and Margene.
In first Corinthians it's written...
Love is patient, love is kind.
It does not envy, it does not boast, and it ain't proud.
It don't dishonor, yo.
And it never looks for itself.
Love doesn't have anger problems, and it forgets the bad stuff.
Love is rad, love never fails.
So yo, what's being said here in the first shout out to the Corinthians, is that love is perfect.
And now, Paul and Margene will declare their love for each other.
So please, face one another.
Margene, do you take Paul to be your lawfully wedded husband?
- I do.
- And Paul, do you take Margene to be your lawfully wedded wife?
- I do.
- By the power vested in me by the state of Oklahoma, and Jesus...
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
I'm presenting for the first time as a married couple...
Mr. and Mrs. Paul Harrison, give it up!
- We did it!
- I know!
- You look a little shell shocked.
- Well, I don't know if you know this but I just got married.
- I know, and it was perfect.
And tonight, everything's gonna be perfect.
You'll see.
- Wife.
- Husband.
- How hard did you try to get it off?
You don't understand, she's gonna kill you when she finds out, it's unforgivable!
- Whoa, lady!
Chill out, all right?
At least I didn't lose a cake.
- It's not lost, it's just not here yet!
- Man, why has it been so long since we have caught up?
- I don't know, it's probably my fault.
- No, no, it is Facebook's fault.
Because instead of keeping me informed, it's just curating posts for my transphobic aunt.
- Yeah, when it's not selling our identities to corporations.
- Right.
- In any case, we should catch up.
- Well tell me, how's your life, what's going on?
- I mean, a lot, i...
- oh, doinked ya!
- Okay.
I saw so much talent walking down the aisle.
We are gonna do some damage tonight.
- Okay, so we have to get going because you know our language...
- oh yeah, must make the trains on time.
Remember that, Jim?
Still funny!
- Still Jewish!
- Skyler has clearly changed a ton.
- Yeah, it's like being back in high school.
- Ow, I can't walk that fast in these shoes!
- Wait, who are they again?
- College friends.
- Oh yeah, new people, I'm good.
No thanks.
Oh, I feel like we should get in there.
- Yeah, just get ready for a lot of hopping and giggling.
- Game face?
- This is it.
- That's terrible, that will convince no one.
There we go.
- All right, let's do this.
- So much happier.
- And he's the one telling everyone what to do, and saying that I'm in hysterics.
- Some one needs to slap her,
I would, but I'm a man.
- Oh, that's really...
- Bethanie, will you slap her?
- Okay, now yous are telling me different things, what do you want me to do?
- Do not slap her!
- What the hell's going on?
- Greta's freaked out because the cake's not here yet.
- I taste tested over 350 cakes to find this one, that is like 18,000 calories.
- Also, I have no wedding ring.
And I can't use my pockets cause there's holes in them.
- Why?
- Magic tricks.
- Right, right.
And because of Colton's magic tricks we had to spend forever trying to pry it off,
- which means we have half the time to finish our reception and get out of here in time to make our flight to Hawaii tonight.
- This is one of Greta's more appropriate freakouts,
I'm just saying.
- Hey Paul, why can't you just miss the flight
- because I can't, I can't, and I won't, I won't, we won't lose this break.
- They won't, this is their special night, Skyler!
- Okay, somebody please get something to calm Greta down, please.
- Oh, I have Xanax!
- Oh god.
- I mean, I have Xanax guys, stop looking at me.
- We can't lose Greta, she's running the entire reception.
- I know, but she's a friend not a...
I told you, professional wedding planners don't usually have nervous breakdowns.
- Greta's usually a big anal machine
I never thought we'd break her.
Look, if we need to leave tomorrow my dad can just...
- no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, I got the tickets, I wanna do this, we're gonna do this.
Greta's gonna lock this down, okay?
We will make this right, okay?
Promise.
- Hey, Paul.
- Yeah?
- Small problem.
She took them all.
- Hey Greta, how many pills were in here?
- Listen.
This situation is infinitely more complex than you realize and I get more stressed out...
- how many?
- I don't know, like seven or eight...
- Nice!
- So Greta's out.
Alex?
- Hi, yeah.
- Yes, yes, great idea, and condense it down to one hour.
- No, no, no, no, why are you picking me?
Why?
- Because you were next in line, honey.
- Margene, I don't know shit about weddings.
And it's Greta, she will be fine, she'll snap out of it.
Hey Greta, do you wanna tell them...
- everything is ruined, and I'm gonna die!
- Oh fuck me, okay!
You know what, I'd love to, I'd love to!
- Grab her instruction manual and get started.
- Manual, what?
- Yeah, it's pretty expensive.
- Shit.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Thanks for talking to me before.
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
- Seriously.
I hate asking these things but,
I need you for one more thing.
- What's up?
- Since you're great with planning, and you picked out great tuxes by the way.
Can you help Alex out?
- Why don't you ask your best Mn?
- Get it off.
- I can't get it off.
- Pull harder.
- Yeah, I just feel like you'd be a lot more effective.
Look I cannot miss this flight, okay?
The honeymoon she deserves, and...
You know, the wedding night that she has longed for.
- I don't know.
- I didn't tell you?
- No.
She's gonna put on white cotton panties, go really slow Paul, oh my god, oh my god,
I'm a real woman.
It's gonna be awesome.
Unless I miss the flight.
- Look, I...
- What?
- I just...
- Come on.
- Wedding stuff right now, you know?
It's...
- I totally forgot, I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.
- Thank you.
- Oh call animal control,
I see a dog pack forming.
Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba!
We ready to get some of that prima nocta pussy tonight!
- Yeah, I think I am.
- I don't think so.
- I don't think so, come on Jim, don't leave me hangin'!
I already got my eyes on this hot little 11th grade girl, Katie Samuels.
- From our 11th grade?
- Yeah.
What did I say?
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Katie Samuels, 11th grade French.
Think she'd go for me?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- What?
Is it my hair?
- No, no, no, your hair looks great,
- yeah, cause I have a very consistent barber, Jim.
- Attention!
- Coming.
- Hey ya'll, so...
Eyes up here.
So you're probably wondering what is Alex doing holding my reception procedure manual...
We lost our fearless leader.
No.
I have decided to share my duties with my deputy bridesmaid asslicks.
- Asslicks?
- No...
- Okay, yeah, enjoy that trip.
Listen up people, we have an hour to get all of this shit done, so please just do what I say when I say it or I'll kick your ass.
Secondly, big smiles everyone because it's time for the grand entrance, yeah!
Let's see it!
Fine, okay, first up we have Quentin and Lisa followed by Skyler and Bethanie,
Jim and myself, then Colt.
- Yeah, hey.
Am I flying solo now or do I have to bring this bird?
- That is all yours.
Then the lovely bride and groom, we got this.
Let's do this, people.
All right.
- Ladies first.
- Don't tell me what to do, Quentin.
- Hey, Lisa.
- Oh no I see, if she tells you, then you know.
- Can you just smile?
Just smile.
- God, I hate you.
- Look at this.
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding me?
First reception as a groomsman, it is awful.
- Gosh, I've been to a million of these and they are all the same.
Just a bunch of people asking you questions, and I don't know why they ask you, it's none of their business.
And then the cake comes out and I want a second piece is it the right thing to do to have another piece?
I don't know, it just makes me...
- no, no, I know, I know, I know, you hate these things, but this one's gonna be different, you know, we're together.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
You can be my wingman.
Skyler and Bethanie!
- I just can't believe they actually got married.
- I know, it's crazy.
- No, no, like really married, with a ring and a cake and a house.
- Actually they have none of things.
- Okay true, but they have that
- and now, Jim and Alex.
- Things have just changed a lot.
- Not all things.
- I said Jim and Alex!
- Okay.
- There we go.
- Hey, let's stick together tonight.
- Yes.
- Awesome.
- Absolutely.
- Great.
- Oh shit, be right back.
- What?
- And now, the best man, Colton.
And the maid of honor, Greta.
Come on, Colt and Greta, yeah, there we go, nice!
And now, I proudly present our bride and groom.
Paul and Margene, yeah!
Nice!
- Nope, fuck it.
- Hello everyone...
- Whoa!
- Hi.
Hi, sorry.
It is time for the buffet, so if you can just line up in an orderly fashion please.
Thank you.
- That was good.
- Shut up.
- Yeah.
- Shut up.
Okay wait, don't shut up, I'm lying.
Can you please continue to tell me about this la life of yours?
You are editing movies?
- Yeah, well more like corporate videos, the occasional web series, but yeah.
- That's great, and I heard that you were dating somebody?
- Absolutely, I actually proposed like two weeks ago.
- Jim, that's amazing.
- Oh no, she said no so I'm single again.
- Best thing about getting married?
- Seriously, we just skip the whole line?
Things are turning around.
- Paul?
- Hey, aunt Sylvia, I want you to meet my new wife, Margene.
- We were hoping to speak with you.
- We're just starving, maybe once we sit down to eat.
- Do you know the ceremony started an hour and five minutes late?
So I had gout last year.
- Oh, wow.
Hey Colton, can I please get some food?
- Yeah, workin on that bro.
- How do you plan on eating all of that salami?
- With my mouth.
- Oh.
- Well, that Rapunzel.
- That's...
- I don't think we got a chance to meet at the rehearsal.
I'm Skyler.
Probably heard that name tossed around.
You're Margene's friend, from college.
- Yeah, Lisa.
- Lisa.
- Don't believe anything she says.
- Not even her name?
Sorry, you guys know each other?
- Yeah, we used to date.
- Oh.
That's cool, you guys are...
Still friends and doing that and...
Well you still talk, that's something.
- We actually haven't spoken since we broke up three months ago.
- Okay, I'm gonna let you guys catch up...
- oh, three months, wow.
I guess time only flies when you're having fun.
- Okay.
- To make a long story short, you know, she shows up at the Meadow, both our families are there, my grandmother wheels herself out, looks up at the sky and is like
"oh my god, what the hell is that?"
I come down in a parachute, I rip off my gear, and I'm wearing a tux.
Thanks, this tux, actually.
Anyway, she moved out the next day, said I was moving too fast.
Now she is Facebook official with some guy named Weston Hancock.
God, I hate Facebook.
That was also the last time I ever saw my memaw.
You and Timmy have been going out, hm?
I'm sure he'd like to know.
- No need to do that, okay.
- Really don't care.
- Okay, fine, four months.
- Four months?
But that doesn't make mathematical sense...
- more perfect than you, yeah.
- Hey, what's going on up there?
- Your little porn addiction?
- No, it's erotic cinema, and I'm an aficionado.
- It's erotica, what?
- Dude, let's go, what's the hold up?
- The chicken's not out yet, and I don't do well with fish, and it's a weird color, and if I can't...
- this girl's talking a lot!
- Hey, hey, Bethanie, what's going up there?
- Hey, I'm waiting for the chicken.
- What?
Just get the fish, it's healthier.
- It's healthier.
- It's good for you.
- Shit's good for you.
- Please, would you get the fish for me, Bethanie, come on.
- Okay, okay, fine, I'll get the fish.
- Please.
- Fish, yeah!
- Thank you.
- Hold on, one more slice.
- Pollo, no you missed out, Pollo.
- Excuse me, is that chicken?
- There we go.
- Hi.
- Hey, you got the fish.
- I got the fish.
I love fish.
- I don't know how you do it.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
Damn Jim, I'm really sorry.
- Yeah, thanks.
- No, no, it really sucks.
It's like you think your life is going in one direction and then all of a sudden...
I'm just gonna say it, your ex-girlfriend, she's a cunt, she is.
- Did you just use the c word?
- Ms. Sylvia, hi!
I did, yeah, you know, it's actually a term of endearment now that us young people use.
Yeah, we reclaimed it so it's super hip.
And let me tell you, you look great tonight you cunt, so great.
I also broke up with my boyfriend recently.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, he was a liar and I couldn't trust him and we shouldn't focus on those people.
We should focus on this reception, so do you wanna maybe help me with all this tonight?
- I...
I should probably work on my toast, so...
- You wrote a toast?
- Yes I did.
- Oh, okay.
Well, I can't wait to here it cause it'll probably be pretty perfect, so.
- Colt, I am famished, where's my food?
- Oh, too late baby bro.
- Hey, garcon.
Hi, do you think I could get like a dinner plate with some food?
- It's buffet style, man.
- Seriously man, I'm the groom, I just got married.
- That's your problem.
- Got an imaginary friend?
- Hey, no, sorry, just going over my speech.
- I totally forgot to tell you.
- What?
- I'm so sorry...
We decided to only go with speeches from the best man and maid of honor to save time.
- Oh...
- You know what?
If you have something you want to say,
- no, no, no, it's not a big deal, I get it, it's fine.
Don't worry about it.
What are you doing, Colt?
- Uh, making wine out of...
I mean wine out of water.
- Okay, you're just like pouring your wine into your...
- it's the last supper Jim, look.
- Yeah, I get it.
- Well it took you a long time.
- Hey, what do you have for a speech?
- Oh, yeah, speech.
I don't know, probably wing it.
That's what I'm good at, tell a few stories about how Paulito and I used to get schwasted.
- Right.
Look.
Just try this on for size.
- Thanks, apostle Jim.
- Lifetime of that.
Where is the food?
- Oh, okay.
Speeches, hey, Greta.
It's time for speeches.
Maybe eat something first?
- Am I gonna eat something first?
- Yeah, nevermind.
- Oh!
Hello!
Margene is one of my oldest friends.
She's very, very old.
At William Jennings Bryant high we were in every club together.
Yearbook, right.
Mathletes.
Drug free youth.
But it wasn't until we got to ou that her and with...
Mr. Paul.
Paul.
I love Margene so much.
And Paul.
I never wanna feel...
So much love.
And...
As they come together we gotta be there, right?
To Maul and Pargene!
- Oh!
- Oh!
- Okay!
- Bullhorn!
I guess we are not all cut out for the stage now, are we?
When my little half bro asked me to be his best man,
I was like "hell no!"
Sike!
Ya mama rides a motorbike!
And then you know, we'd hang out a lot and then we'd...
It goes a little something like this.
I always knew a day would come when Paul and I would have to move on from being such close friends.
And today as he's married, it's clear his world's changed forever as he moves on to married life.
Here's a confession.
I always secretly wanted to hate Paul's wife, future wife.
How dare she take away my best friend!
But when Paul and Margene began dating senior year of high school,
I knew if there was a woman perfect enough to be Paul's new best friend, it was Margene.
And on this...
And on this...
- Auspicious.
- Au what?
- Auspicious.
- Fuck you.
And on this auspicious day, we raise our glasses high to Paul and Margene, to best friends everyone.
Guys, best friends!
Don't take it for granted, you don't know how long you have them for.
- Thank you, love you bro.
- Yeah, love you too.
- And thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
If I could just have everyone's attention.
- Calm it down people.
- My very, very good friend Jim has some words for us this evening.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- So without further adeu...
- Dude, I don't wanna do it.
- Jim.
- Jim, Jim, Jim.
- Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
- Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
♪ He's a wordsmith
- okay!
Wow, that's gonna be a hard one to follow.
- Obvi.
- You know...
Paul and I, we've known each other for...
I don't know, since middle school and...
I remember the first time we got schwasted.
- Best friend memories, yes Jim.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You know, I too used to get schwasted with Margene, in her parents basement.
Okay, little secret.
Mike's hard lemonade and this girl?
Pro, sucks them down, she's amazing.
And you know, we bring this up as a...
As a...
- Segway.
- A Segway to inform you that...
Although the bar is an open bar, we should really still tip the staff.
- Yes, and you know if you get a beer...
You don't have to.
- Nope.
- But if you get a mixed drink, it's just what's done.
- Super polite.
- On that note, to everlasting love!
- Everlasting love, yeah great, bye.
- Thank you.
- That sucked.
- Why would you say that?
- Thank you.
- Hi guys, time to dance.
- Oh no.
- No, no, you have 70 minutes, you wanna get out of here, you gotta do the romantic shit.
- Okay, okay, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sorry.
You look beautiful.
- Got everything.
- I have it for you right here.
- Yep, I'm fine.
- I got it.
- Okay.
- How about a spin, huh?
- I could take a spin.
You all right?
- I'm great.
The speeches were a little weird.
- We're still running late.
I'm just worried about the flight.
- Paul, we're married.
- I know.
- Everything's great.
Everything's perfect.
- And now for the father daughter dance.
- We just...
- Daddy.
Thank you for all this.
And for talking earlier, and being so understanding.
Without mom, I'm lucky I have you to listen.
And I know it freaked you out.
Plus there's Paul's job and everything.
Look.
Everything's turning out just right.
Right?
- And everyone, dance floor!
Let's get on it, yeah!
- What did you eat?
- Nothing yet.
Oh, I'm hungry.
- Steady, steady.
- Oh, great speech by the way.
- My oration on getting schwasted.
Thanks, I actually wrote it a couple weeks ago.
You know, thanks.
- I have officially thrown Greta's schedule out the window and let's see, I now have...
Oh, 68 minutes to finish all of this.
- When's the cake?
- Uh, when it gets here finally?
- Wrong, no, no, no.
Most people wait for the cake to leave, and you don't early exits.
I know this, cause I've been planning my wedding since I was a little...
- girl.
Since you were just a little baby.
- Okay, all right, very funny.
You now have... 67 minutes, you're just wasting time.
- Thank you for that, mhm.
- You need me.
I'm in.
- Do not fuck with me.
- I'll take it back.
- No, you said it, you're in.
- All right, let's do this.
- Really?
- Oh thank you so much for coming.
- Yeah, you enjoying yourself?
- You know, we was outside with the bugs for over an hour waiting for the service to start.
- Ow, well.
We thank you and everyone for your Patience.
- And...
I got walking pneumonia ya'll,
I'm here sick as a dog.
- Oh, oh, should you be out of bed?
- It's walking pneumonia.
Let me see this wedding ring.
- Oh, well that's a very funny story, and it all starts with a very stupid man named Colton.
- Colt hired this band and when he did he just kept screaming "it's gonna be 1998 all over again!"
Poor guy, he's just, he's nostalgic for nostalgia.
- Hey, I agree with him.
I like swing.
We did that kick ass routine.
In show choir, the swing one, you remember?
- Uh huh.
- Oh wait, are we pretending like you didn't do show choir for four years of your life?
- Uh huh.
- Okay, great, so then...
Moving on to the binder there.
- All right, let's see.
In case of male shirt disaster...
I.E. Wine spilling or colored armpit stain, et cetera, contingency tuxedo shirt taped underneath the dance...
- No, she did not.
- Okay that's crazy, it's under...
- It's under there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- She taped it?
Tampons are taped underneath table seven.
Note the following bridesmaids are on their period.
- Oh my, ew, no, Greta!
- Greta, Greta this is...
- Terrible.
- This is my 8th wedding this summer.
Do you know the financial and psychological toll that eight bridesmaids dresses has on a person?
And Greta, it's got me thinking about settling down.
About settling, you know?
I want Skyler.
I know.
- And you are...
- His best friend?
I know.
And only delusional people think their best friend's gonna fall madly in love with them.
I mean...
But maybe my best friend will fall madly in love with me.
Oh, honey.
Don't swallow your tongue.
- Okay.
That man wore a no fear, no fear like half sleeve t-shirt to my wedding.
Your family's crazy.
- Wait, my family?
- Uh huh.
- I thought he's with your side.
- Ah, it's gonna take forever to greet all these people.
But we have to.
- Yeah, we do.
Or else we face a lifetime of guilt from everybody.
Including, and especially your father.
You know what, we gotta get out of here on time so we can make our flight.
- Yeah.
So that we can consummate our love together.
- I am both excited and anxious at the thought of being physically intimate.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Then I got a plan for us.
Ready for it?
You go take your side, I will take mine, we meet back in one hour, and off to our honeymoon.
- Great idea.
- You know, like only if you're into it.
- No, if that's what we need to do to make tonight perfect, then...
That's what we'll do.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Now break.
- Pull my finger.
Pull my finger.
- No I really needed you to pull my finger, but...
Out of rolls.
Yo, homeslice!
You got any butter?
- It's buffet style man!
I can't get everything!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
- Butter.
- Yeah.
- You should cut it off.
- Aw dude, tried man.
The ring's too thick.
- Not the ring, the finger.
I once chopped a finger clean off, making cannoli.
Blood gushing all over the caramel and shit, fucking disgusting.
And then, I just took that sucka to the hospital...
Gave it to the docs, and they just re-attached it later.
- What kind of knife did you use?
- Colt, don't chop your finger off.
- And do not use butter, olive oil is way better.
- Olive oil.
So nice of you to finally join us,
I mean, this cake was only supposed to be here oh, this afternoon.
- I have a really good excuse, all right?
I forgot the wedding was tonight and I had to pull an all nighter.
- So you're just a professional Baker and you forgot you had a job today?
So glad that Greta's doped out and did not hear that.
- Is that the girl that ate 900 dollars worth of samples?
- There's been a mistake.
- Yeah, hiring this guy as their Baker.
- No, no, no, no, no.
This is the wrong cake.
- No, first of all, our cake's supposed to be red velvet, and secondly...
This has a black couple on top.
- So?
- So our bride and groom is white people.
- Here I thought we live in a post racial society.
- No, no, no, no, no, we will keep the cake because thanks to you we don't have any other choice, and you know I'm sure it's still delicious, and it costs them...
Holy shit man.
- That's robbery.
- Robbery, that's crazy.
- Cake is art.
- Look, this isn't a racial thing, we just want a white cake topper.
- I only brought will and Jada.
- Of course you did.
Okay, we will improvise, we'll find some wite-out and we will make them Caucasian, yeah.
- You want white face?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- So, you were saying you teach hot yoga or something?
- I also mentioned that I'm in engineering management and information sciences consulting, but yes I teach hot yoga on Saturdays.
- Do you think you'll stay in Tulsa long or...
- Uh no, I feel like a big city's kind of always called my name.
- Big city, la is a big city.
London has shitty food, Chicago...
Chicago's actually awesome but...
I'm in la.
- Okay, well consider it considered then.
- All right.
- Could we see what's next because I just wanna go to the bar.
Ooh, cancel a flash mob, yes.
- Hey.
Hey Bethanie.
What you girls up to, huh?
Running from boys?
- Oh no, pastor Kyle.
We are here to celebrate the holy union of two pious Christians, so, here we go.
- And Greta, huh?
- Well she's stoned, excuse me.
- On Jesus I hope.
- Well...
All right, here we go.
Stand up straight, Greta.
- Look, it's really not that complicated.
We all go out on the dance floor, perform the routine that I sent you on YouTube, yeah, and we wear these masks.
- That is terrifying.
Yeah, no, Sean, I don't think that anyone is gonna actually do any of that, yeah.
- Okay, so you're gonna force me to do like a one man flash mob, what do you...
- At that point I think it's just called a flash.
- Oh, flash.
- All right, took that easy, all right what's next?
- Let's see, next we are going to make sure that the alcohol inventory is stocked and then smell check the staff.
- That's exactly what I got from that, so.
- Hey, just honing in on Katie Samuels, 11th grade French.
How's my breath?
Not ready yet, okay.
- That poor, poor girl, okay.
Serious question about Skyler.
- About his hair?
- So that is his hair?
- Yeah it's his hair.
He bought it online and glued it to his head, it's his hair.
- Shut up.
No, you're not serious.
- I mean I've never got 100 percent confirmation, yet I am 100 percent sure.
- So wait, wait, wait, how does it work when he's trying to take a girl home?
Does he tell her on the date or like they get in the bedroom and he's like
"surprise, look, I'm bald, look at my head, hey."
- It's like he lives in the golden age of bald men.
- Total social acceptance to buzz your head.
- Willis, Statham, fucking Matt Lauer.
Head buzzing pioneer.
- He looks amazing.
He looks great.
- I would go on a date with him...
- I'm ready nerds, out of my way.
- Okay.
- Katie Samuels?
11th grade French, gotcha.
- Skyler, right?
Yeah?
Yeah, you...
You look...
Wow.
- Thank you.
Wow, I mean...
That's great, but you, I mean you...
Look absolutely stunning.
- Oh thank you.
- Katie.
Hey.
- Pastor Kyle.
Hey.
Sorry about missing Bible study the other night, it's just that I had this...
- hot date?
- No.
Come on.
- Yeah, come on.
- Well...
So um...
Yeah, I'm super thirsty.
So I'm gonna hop up and just go get myself a...
- beer?
- Can I...
No.
Soda water would be like, exactly what I want.
Ow.
Can I please, thank you.
Yeah, you guys just go and have a good...
- What the fuck, Kyle?
You just cockblocked me man.
- Whoa, whoa, hey.
It's pastor Kyle now.
That's some language you're using there man, what's going on?
- What's going on?
What the fuck is going on with you, Kyle?
All right, I once saw you, yeah, at a frat party in a hot tub with your whole...
I guess I can't even repeat it, can I?
- No need.
I was actually with Katie Samuels, so.
- Oh...
- I'm praying for you man!
- Save it!
- Hey.
What's going on?
- I don't know why, but...
I was just thinking about...
I was just thinking about when you left for college.
You know, at the time I figured our friendship would be over, fall outta touch, whatever.
But then...
But then when you were getting in your car to leave, you remember what you said?
You said "I'll see you in a few weeks."
- Yeah, that was technically true.
- No, yeah, but then at the end of fall break you said the same thing again.
"See you in a few weeks."
The holidays came, and spring break.
You keep saying the same thing,
"see you in a few weeks", the time between would get longer and longer in between, but you just always would say "see you in a few weeks."
It's got me thinking...
Now that I'm settled here, you're out there...
We probably won't see each other much at all anymore.
- Come on, things aren't gonna change.
- I already have, man.
Anyway.
You know, I think we're pretty lucky
Colt got that ring stuck on his big stubby finger, right?
Seriously, if you hadn't talked to me...
I was gonna bolt.
- Dude, it was just cold feet.
- No.
No, it was more than that.
It was me thinking about like...
All the marriages I know that have failed.
- Your parents are in functional marriages.
- Not to each other.
Plus, on top of that...
Margene's dad paid for everything here.
I can't afford to give her a perfect wedding,
I could barely afford the plane tickets for the honeymoon.
Now with the merger, I don't even know if my job...
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
The same reason you wouldn't of left.
You know how lucky you are, man.
Look, all you have to do is make Margene happy.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt I just...
- no.
- I have your beer.
- Perfect timing.
- Sorry.
- I actually just saw some second cousins from Lawton over there that...
I should go bond with.
- Okay, so let me guess.
He was bugging you as to when you plan on settling down because Margene asks me like literally every day.
- Why are they always trying to get single people to get married?
It's like do you just wanna drink the booze at my wedding as payback or...
You know, the more I think about it...
I feel like married people were actually recruited themselves into getting married and then they settle down, they realize it's super boring, and it doesn't actually work unless they have other married friends around to watch like
homeland and shit with.
Marriage is...
Marriage is a pyramid scheme, it is.
- Oh my god, I fucking hate you!
- Sorry, she's got Tourette's.
Sexually contracted Tourette's.
You arrogant, neurotic, self centered, immature, homophobic.
- No, no, no, not true, I'm not afraid of them.
- Needy, childish, jealous...
- Which is warranted because you're a skank!
- A misogynist!
- I am not.
- You laughed at me when I told you
I was sexually harassed at work.
- You said it in a funny voice.
- You know what, Quentin?
I think the worse thing about all of this is that you're obviously not over me.
- Oh, no, no, no, I'm over you.
- Yeah, I'm so over you I wouldn't fuck you with your 10 foot dick.
- Okay well, at least one of those has one of those, fuck you Quentin!
Oh, I thought this was over.
- It wasn't over.
It still isn't over.
- I think actually the animal that
I identify with the most...
Is the wolf.
- Oh.
Because it's half wild animal, part domesticated dog.
Cause a part of me like...
Tries to hunt.
The other part of me is loyal, likes my tummy scratched.
- Oh, are you a lone wolf?
- Hungry like the wolf.
- And you are adorable.
But I am married.
- Oh.
Look at that.
- Yup.
Ring on the finger usually means married.
- Yeah, I guess unless you're Margene, right?
- What?
- Oh, no, not like she's loose or anything...
Just saying because the ring...
- What?
- Nevermind, nevermind, just forget I said that, and forget, I'm sorry, you're married.
- Well you give up awfully easily.
I didn't say no.
I said I'm married.
Thought you were a bad boy.
- I am, it's just...
You're married, so.
- Yeah, well, suit yourself.
But Fyi, my pussy tastes real good.
And my husband and I have a certain arrangement.
I mean, if you're interested.
- Yeah.
Wow, okay, yeah let me...
Let me just use the little boy's room for a second, and when I get back, we'll have an answer.
- I'll be here.
- Okay.
- Occupied!
- I'll just go this way, it's easier.
That's fine.
Oh shit I'm sorry,
I didn't know anyone else was in here.
- The more the merrier.
- I just need a place to think for a second.
You know, actually, I would appreciate the advice of a total stranger.
You see...
This married woman just told me what her vagina tastes like.
- How would she know what her vagina tastes like?
- That...
I'm just wondering like you know, do I go for it?
That's taboo, like how often do these...
- stop, look.
I'm you, from the future.
- No, I was just like you, I was always chasing tail...
And then one day, my hair fell out.
- No.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, your standards have dropped, the screwing...
Won't sedate the the loneliness.
You'll end up bald with a prostate the size of a mandarin orange, and the only sexual adventure you'll have is when your wife brings a young man home.
So...
I don't know.
Go for it!
Oh, this woman...
Is she a redhead in a purple dress?
- Yeah?
- Wow.
You'll do just fine.
- Yeah.
I will do just fine.
Oh shit.
God.
Damn it.
Watch it, dumb broad!
Hey, sorry.
- Gosh.
Wow, I was just about to head to the dance floor, you wanna join me?
- You know what?
It wasn't as cool as I thought it would be.
- Oh right.
- Come here.
But yeah, later, you know, show those jokers how it's done.
- Oh, oh, you mean some of this?
- A little lesson in that, you remember that?
- A little of that, a little of that 2008.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, bring it back.
And bring it back, and bring it back.
- And then I'll do this like we used to...
Hi.
Don't cry Bethanie, don't cry.
You left me without my medicine.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
- The millennials for Christ.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Have you seen Paul?
- Um...
I thought that he would be with you.
- Yeah...
We're trying this whole divide and conquer thing to save time, you know, so.
Can I ask you something?
- Yes?
- Was my wedding perfect, was it?
- Oh my gosh, you look like an angel.
And these dresses that you picked, they're beautiful, they're gorgeous, like you would think that somebody would actually notice, that guys would actually take notice of you, but no.
Just, you look everything...
Everything is perfect.
- Thanks.
- Okay.
- Okay, well, I gotta run.
Uncle Pete's not gonna greet himself, so.
- And to me, I find Christianity is the real social media...
- pastor Kyle, thank you.
It was such a wonderful ceremony.
It was just so...
It was stunning, thank you, perfect.
- I refuse to be a slave to a trapper keeper, we are throwing rice.
If a pigeon comes down and eats it, it will explode.
- That can't possibly be true...
- it is.
- Hello, throwing rice, it's a tradition.
- Oh, I forgot what a romantic you are.
Do you remember how you asked me to prom?
- Yeah, in a night tub put on a pony.
- Okay, fine.
I will admit it...
High school dances were kind of the best.
Oh, we would get so dressed up and then we would dance to the best songs of 2006.
Oh wait, do you remember... ♪ You don't know me
♪ you don't even care oh, that was good.
- That was a good song.
- That shit was my jam.
- That was a good one.
- And then you'd be on the dance floor dancing cheek to cheek with your crush, and you'd get those shivers up your spine, so cute.
- Yeah, when we weren't grinding to lil Jon or n'sync.
- Oh god, and sweating...
Profusely because the 100...
- yeah, we were like disgusting sweaty teenagers.
- So gross.
Hundred of us would be on that dance floor just packed in, and you'd look around and the guys would be like grinding away, just all in the hips.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Like ugh, what's up Kyle?
Kyle was one of these.
He was like oh my god, you're here.
You're here, and I just gotta go.
I gotta go, I gotta go.
- You're just missing that awkward erection we all had.
- True, true, I am missing that.
- We never danced though.
In all the craziness, I lost you.
- Well, I wanted to dance with you.
- When I found you, you were dancing with Zeb Buckman.
- Oh, Zeb.
- I didn't have my pony, so you know, how was I supposed to ask you to dance?
- You should've just cut in.
- Yeah, but...
That guy.
- Zeb.
- Yeah, football playing douchebag.
- Zeb.
- Yeah, Zeb.
- No, no, Zeb.
- What the f...
Why is he, no one talks to that...
- You have to hide me.
Right now.
- What, why?
- We have to go.
Nope, gimme the binder, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.
- Where are we, what is happening right now?
Do you still talk to this guy?
- Hi, how's it going?
Everybody looks so lovely tonight.
Okay bye, bye.
Take this, take this.
I'm gonna take this.
- What, okay.
- So you take this.
- He has no idea who I am,
- god, he's coming this way.
- Okay, yep.
Buffet, buffet, buffet, buffet.
- Nope.
Gonna just not be okay.
- All right, nope, nope, nope.
Yup.
- Is he behind us?
He knows my ass, we have to go.
- We have to go, we have to go, we have to go, we have to go, okay bye, bye, bye.
- Kitchen.
- Oh my god, why?
Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good, I'm good.
- Oh my god, I uninvited him.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Why is he here?
- You were dating Zeb Buckman?
- Okay, do not judge me.
It was college and it's like this on again off again thing we just, we've always...
- Okay, and now you're...
- Off again.
No, he is a lying, non-committal flirt who gets way too many medically necessary massages.
We are on a break.
It's buffet style people, buffet style, get it yourself!
Jesus!
Nobody respects me, man!
- I hear ya, Maximiliano.
I hear ya man.
Blaze on.
Yeah.
- Thanks bro.
- Dude.
Everybody thinks that I'm a fuck up.
- Is it getting any looser?
- Not at all, man.
I mean yeah, sure, big whoop.
I have screwed up in the past.
You know.
Maybe the old saying is true.
There are no second acts in American history.
Wait, who said that?
- Uh...
F. Murray Abraham.
- Oh yeah.
- Dude, I got hopes.
I got dreams.
I haven't told anyone this.
I auditioned for the band out there.
- What?
- Yeah.
Dude, it would be like 1998 all over again.
The glory days of swing before the fucking gap commercialized it.
- Mhm.
- Sexy horn, maxi!
You're in the band!
- Oh yeah.
- Dude, give me a chance, I'll bring back swing.
Dude, it'll be the swing revival...
Revival.
I didn't even get a callback.
- Good talk bro.
- So, what is he here to like win you back or something?
I'm not gonna say that it like hasn't worked before, but I mean god, haven't you seen the man?
He just, he looks like a fucking Ken doll and I can't...
Sorry, that's weird.
It sounds stupid, I know, I know but it's just...
It's been going on since college, and it's always just been super fucking casual and it's...
Fuck!
Okay, how long into casual does something like cease to be casual.
- Hey.
- God!
- What's up?
- Hey, just hiding, you?
- Hiding.
Throw rice or bubbles during the...
- oh, we talking about the myth that if you give rice to a bird they'll explode?
- Not a myth guys, that will happen.
- Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna grab a bag of rice right now, bust this myth.
Hey, can I get a bag of rice?
- You okay?
- Yes.
Nope, yeah, I'm good, so good.
We just, you know, haven't seen each other since everything so it's...
- You wanna like, ignore him?
We can stay in here...
- no, no, ignore him?
Please, absolutely not.
I just, am waiting for the courage to come so that I can just go out there and just fuck with him.
And you know what?
You, ooh.
You said that you would stick by me all night, so you're gonna help me fuck with him.
Yep, come on, let's go, uh huh.
- I...
Okay.
Wait, Alex.
Alex.
- No, no, no, not ready.
No, no, no, no, no.
- I was never fingered in high school.
I also never went out on a date.
But for some reason, this bothers me more.
I was too busy with clubs and grades for boys, so I didn't kiss a boy 'til college, and by the time a boy had sex on top of me...
My...
Junior year...
It was too late.
I realized I missed out on something.
That time when it was new and exciting.
But no.
No boys wanted to finger me, let alone do me.
I didn't even have a date for prom.
The prom I planned.
I wanted to dance, have fun.
To be fingered.
Fingered with love.
- God, is that Buckman?
- The whores at Orpha's lounge are gonna freak out.
You're my fuckin' hero, man.
- Okay.
- One, two, three!
- There it is, all right.
Thanks hombre.
You have a great night, okay?
- You too man.
- Thanks for coming out.
You've got to be kidding me.
- No, no, no, let's go.
He's right there.
Let's go.
He's getting taller as we get closer.
- Zebediah Buckman.
- Hey, there you are.
- Hi, okay, what's...
Why are you here?
- Uh, I'm your plus one.
- No, see you were my plus one but then, you know, remember, we went on a break, so now that actually makes you my minus one.
- Yeah, I was actually hoping we could talk about that.
- Jim, you remember Jim right?
From high school?
Oh, we have just been talking and catching up all night.
- Hey Zeb, how's it going?
Heard you weren't playing ball anymore, what's up now, like coaching little league?
- Aw, jokes!
No, actually.
Turns out Mark Hyduke over at Peakmore, he's a big sooner fan.
So the Duke's got me doing the whole natural gas, land acquisitions thing.
Now look, I don't really get it...
But I make a lot of money, so I won't complain.
I won't, I won't.
- I heard you were out in Hollywood making like...
Movies and shit.
- He is.
- Yes, yeah I am.
In fact an editor.
We're off to the language of film.
You know, it's hard work, it's important work.
- Yeah.
- It's thankless work.
- Okay.
- Mostly I'm at a computer for hours just like sifting through footage trying to make that perfect scene in a dark room, alone.
Oh god, this guy, he's so stinking humble.
You know, he was actually just voted by Hollywood as one of the top creative minds.
- Shit.
- Shit's right, who you texting?
Michelle?
She still part of your rotation?
You know what, I don't give a shit.
I don't give a shit.
We're gonna go dance, bye.
- Alex...
- Do you think that made him miss me?
- Yeah, how could it not?
I don't really, I didn't plan on dancing.
No seriously, I didn't...
I'm just not in the mood to...
- No, you planned this, this is crazy.
♪ Baby, baby, looks like it's gonna hail
- this is crazy.
All right, what do we do?
- Oh, ah, turn, yes.
Kick, yes.
Oh!
- Jump!
Oh wait, I like these.
- Remember yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh!

- how did that just happen?
That was crazy.
- It was terrible.
We just, we can't let it go.
We can't let show choir go, that's good.
- That's amazing.
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bar.
Yeah, I'm gonna get us a beer, you...
- you sure you good?
- All right, yeah, no, give me a beer, please, please.
- Yeah, I'll be right back, all right?
- Okay.
- Come on little buddy.
Hey Jim, almost busted that bird myth.
- Okay!
- Come on little buddy, eat the rice.
Eat it, come on.
- Yep.
- Hey, can I get two beers when you have a second?
What the hell just happened?
- Bubbles.
Go bubbles.
Hey, can I get a...
Do you want anything?
- No, I'm good thanks.
- Can I just get five shots of absinthe, neat.
What's got...
- I just, I don't know, thought a part of me was gone, but it's not.
Oh it's back.
- That's so good champ.
That's so good, thank you.
- Did the pigeon really just...
- for the love of god, bubbles!
Thank you.
- Why?
- For the bird.
- Thank you so much, sir.
- Two shots of Jager!
Have a shot of Jager with me, will ya?
- I'm good, honestly.
- Nah, you'll drink it.
- Okay.
- Hey, to cobras and condoms.
Two things I don't fuck with.
- Whatever.
I haven't had Jager since college.
- Oh, that's the yeah.
Best part about getting the Redshirt.
Another year of college, of football.
Of Jager.
Look at that.
And of Alex.
- Yeah, yeah.
I heard you two split up, huh?
- No, no.
This is a game we play.
She gets pissed, and she takes me back.
That's why I bought you a drink.
- Oh no, it's open bar actually.
- Because I...
I remember you, Jim...
As a nice, harmless show choir, Billy Elliot dance boy.
And I just don't want you getting your hopes up.
You know?
- I think she actually moved on, so, sorry.
- Okay.
Yeah, come here.
- I'm good.
- No, come here.
Alex knows me, okay?
She knows what she's getting, and she likes it.
She likes it.
- Okay.
- She'll always take me back, you got that?
- Sure.
- So I will see you out there!
All right?
- Yeah!
- Byah!
I'm fuckin' with you, dude.
I'm fuckin' with you.
What a goober.
What have we got here?
Boomer!
Yo, you won't believe this hick shit wedding
Alex brought me to.
- Your beer.
- Bless you child.
Thank you.
- Yeah, cheers.
- Cheers.
Their first date was prom, too.
- Yeah, he asked her with the marching band.
Hell of a big gesture.
Ugh, and now they are Mr. and Mrs. Harrison.
- I hope she doesn't change her name on Facebook.
- Please, she will.
They all do, like, immediately, and then I'm going through my feed and I'm like...
Because nobody has the same name anymore.
You know, giving away your last name is just, it's weird.
You're losing a part of yourself which is completely unnecessary.
Frankly, like marriage itself.
- Come on, you don't believe that.
- Yeah, I do.
I don't know, maybe, but I mean look at Tim Robbins,
Susan Sarandon, never got married.
- Yeah, they split up a few years ago.
- No, they...
- Yeah.
- Shit.
Shit, I have been using that example for so long that I completely forgot.
- When did you become a cynic?
- I have to be very logical in my job, thank you very much.
- Hot yoga?
- Fuck you.
Fuck you, I'm not cynical okay?
I'm just, I...
I'm cautious.
I like to weigh the pros and cons of all aspects of my life and when it comes to men,
I just need them to be like sweet mostly, nice enough, dependable ish, and you know...
That's enough for me, and I don't really need much more and that way I don't get in too deep and I never get hurt, and it's great, I win.
So great.
We should get back to the binder...
- I feel like it's probably around 40 minutes, so.
- Do it.
- Yeah, cool, thank you.
- Yeah, of course.
- Hey, couple words?
Yo, just a few words.
Just a few words.
Yo, can I get a word.
- Oh, it's you.
- Yeah.
Listen, Daddio.
You were aces in the audition.
- Yeah, thanks.
- But you lack true star power.
The charisma to get a clip joint jumpin'.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey man.
I've been working on some groovy new moves.
Come on, give me another chance.
Another chap, another chance.
Even swing music had another shot at swing revival.
- Hey, I find the term "swing revival" offensive.
It's as if it ever went anywhere.
- Sorry about that, not sorry.
You know what?
Maybe I'll just start my own band and I will be at every wedding destroying it better than you.
Hey, guess what?
- You got the ring off?
- Balls!
- Colt!
Buddy.
- Hey, newlyweds!
- Hey, Kyle!
Pastor Kyle.
- That's as promised,
I will introduce you to your marriage mentor.
Ned, Ned, come here.
Ned and his wife have the strongest and dopest relationship of anyone I know.
He can answer all your questions, man.
Actually, I just need a minute alone with Margene.
- No, I couldn't help overhearing you're having some anxieties.
- A little, yeah.
I mean I love Margene, of course...
But it's just such a big step forward.
- Well, it's normal to be nervous about making love for the first time.
- I'm sorry?
- See, the key to pleasuring your wife is orgasm via stimulating both the g spot and the clitoris.
The clitoris is the bean shaped knob at the top of the vagina...
- hey uh, Kyle?
- Pastor Kyle.
- Pastor Kyle?
Do you think we should be talking about this right here?
- Married sex is a godly thing, it's where Jesus thrives.
Ned, go on.
Pay attention, okay?
- Oh, great.
He used to go down on me for 25 or 30 minutes at a time.
You know, about the length of a night court.
But...
- Oh, nice to see you.
- But no more.
So, I just wanted to warn you that over time the rule of thumb is generally the amount of attention your husband lavishes on you now, eventually that's just gonna be cut in half.
You know, it's kind of a shame but...
What can we do?
If we love them, we just have to find a workaround which I've done cause, you know.
I've got a thing for bald guys.
So, tell me about your friend Skyler?
- Um...
- We get our personal massagers from Walgreens, it's very inexpensive.
But don't get the penis shaped kind, that's for homosexuals.
Well!
Good luck tonight!
- You chill.
- Finally we're together.
- And now time for the garter toss!
- It's what's next, I'm sorry, I don't know, I don't know.
- Let's keep it going.
Let's just...
Oh, hey.
I've just been doing a lot of thinking.
Tonight, you know, it's just like...
And hear me out here, it's like...
I don't know, the whole weight of everything is just like hitting me now.
- I know, also we've only been married about...
- okay.
- Looks like I'm gon' get married now,
I caught the underwear thingy.
- Don't you have pneumonia?
- No?
- Yes you do.
- No, must've got me mixed up with somebody else.
Now come on, let's get that picture.
- What is your last name?
- Johnson.
- I was saying, we've only been married an hour and yet things aren't perfect.
They aren't okay, they aren't anything.
- The future's looking bright.
- Hi, ladies, sorry.
I don't know why you would've gotten it earlier, but I heard that the fish went bad, so we should avoid that tonight.
- This is why I never eat fish.
- Yeah, okay, great.
- You're so lucky that you're married.
- Oh just tell him you like him already!
Wow look, there's Skyler!
- Life, it's fragile.
- Hey dude.
- Hey.
- How's your night?
- Booze is strong, the girls suck.
- And inevitably end up hanging out with you all night.
It's like college all over ago.
- Well, I don't mind hanging out with you.
- Really?
- You're telling me there's no guys here that you want to have had your pipes laid in, laid to the...
- What?
- Sorry.
- That doesn't even make sense, and it was confusing...
- I'm drunk.
- And kinda graphic.
And who here would I lay pipe with anyway?
Colt?
- No.
God no.
You deserve much...
Much better.
All right.
I'll see you around, Bethy.
- Ow.
Kinda got my boob on that one.
- Tried pretty hard to catch that bouquet.
- Oh, yeah, I don't know what that was.
I'm just confident this is gonna last.
- Don't pressure me into anything, okay?
We'll just keep it cool.
What we'll do.
- You know, I think god had creator's block you are a walking fucking stereotype.
- Well obviously Satan didn't have the same problem with you.
You're creatively evil!
- Idiot!
- The Elon musk of hatefulness...
- oh good one!
- The inception of sluttiness, just layers...
- so creative!
- And layers of whorish behavior.
- You know what, Quentin?
Every single time we get close...
- you fuck a dude in prison?
- No, he was on trial.
- For murder!
- For manslaughter!
If we go back in there, I will hate myself.
- Oh please, if we go back in there it's because I hate myself.
- Ow.
- Get in!
- Okay.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Now, go, go, go.
Faster, faster, faster.
- Bethanie?
Don't go on this dance floor!
Gonna find a dude to finger me!
What are you doing?
Come with me.
- Oh god.
Not feeling so good.
Ugh, god.
I'm sorry, excuse me, hi.
Excuse me, sir...
- What, what?
- Do you have like tums or bab...
- it's buffet style, senorita!
- What?
- I can't get everything!
- Why would that be on the buffet table?
Why are you yelling at me?
- Want a salami sensation?
- Oh god Colt, get out of my way.
- Man!
Everybody keeps taking a hot dump on me.
- Yeah, yeah.
Everybody keeps shitting on me too, and still expects so much, right?
- Yeah!
I don't even have big dreams, you know?
Just little mini, miniature size ones and everyone still squashes them, you know?
My future, my life.
Bro.
I'm a fuckin' joke.
- I know dude, I know.
- I know you know, everybody knows.
Colt the fuck up, we get the message.
You know?
But you know...
Shit's gotta change.
- Yeah.
- Know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.
Yeah, you know what?
He's right.
He's right.
- I am right!
- Yeah, listen to this guy!
- Listen to me, people.
- We have to unionize!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- We have been persecuted for too long, today we go on strike!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What about the reception?
- Fuck the reception, man.
We're occupying the kitchen, we are the 99 percent.
- Actually, they far outnumber you out there.
- We have been treated unfairly for too long, we will be paid equally at a rate fairly.
Solidarity, my brothers!
- Stop it!
What are you doing, maxi?
- You did it!
- No, you did this!
- You did it, you're the man, revolucion!
- We're not friends!
- Strike, strike, strike, strike!
- We're done.
- You're the man!
- Oh my god.
Damn it!
How'd that happen?
Hey, Greta, where's Jim, have you seen Jim?
What are you doing, have you see Jim?
Whoa, hey, you dipping?
You dip, I dip, we dip.
- Get low.
You dip, I dip, we dip.
- Ah, Jim.
Jim!
Jim!
Jim!
- So what do you wanna sing?
- I don't know the name of it but it's like... ♪ You don't know me
♪ you don't really
- please stop?
Why do you wanna sing that?
- It was just a certain girl's favorite song from 06 and I'm a big believer in grand gestures, so.
- Sorry, but...
We just play swing, jazz, big band...
And mid aughties ballets.
So you're in luck.
- Thanks man.
Fuck.
- Let's get serious for a second.
Does jet fuel get hot enough to...
- excuse us for one...
- Hey...
Jim!
- Hey, what's up buddy?
- I'm talking to this pretty lady right now.
- How much you got to drink in the last like hour and 20 minutes?
- Um, I don't know.
Have you checked your pussy?
Gotcha.
- Right, okay.
- Roasted.
- You notice anything peculiar about her?
- Oh, yeah, Jim...
I checked, first thing.
No ring.
- Okay, look again.
- Pretty hot.
- Look again.
- She's fat as shit.
- I'm pregnant.
- Hey lady...
Shh!
Can she hear us?
- Every word.
- So, you're not seeing anyone then?
All right.
Where was I?
Tower seven.
- He's flirting with literally every single woman here except for me.
How do I get him to see me that way?
- You're trying too hard.
- See, my mother taught me not to act like some desperate schoolyard floozy.
- Am I a floozy?
- You want a boy's attention?
Give him as little as possible.
In my day we called that playing hard to get.
You might wanna write that down.
- I think I'm okay.
- It drives the boys wild.
It's how I got my Sully here.
Isn't that right, honey?
- Oh you are just so sweet, thank you so much.
- And you're a real cunt!
- Jim!
Jim!
You sir, have a beautiful home.
I love the parties here, back in high school...
We used to dry hump all over your tennis court.
Sometimes wet.
We all did.
Not her.
That's a child.
Margie's dad.
Or can I call you Tobias?
Spit it to me straight, Tobester.
How much easier was it to get laid back in the day?
Cause today...
Sucks.
I mean, I tried it all.
I tweet, I swipe, I snap.
Feminism.
Best case scenario...
I get a Hummer in the back seat of my Camry.
Good.
Paul's got the right idea, you know.
He's just...
Lock and park Margie down now, so every night he can just fucking cuddle.
And procreate, respectively.
In the marital bed, so you can have grandchildren.
I'm sorry.
That's potpourri.
My grandpa, he used to take me to feed the birds.
And now...
I have no grandpa, no girlfriend,
and no pigeon.
It doesn't matter how much I try.
I can't get the blood off my hands.
You've been to war, you know what it's like.
It was like...
Like a balloon full of spaghetti.
And the beak?
The beak is barely on there, man.
I've been holding on to it
I can't let it go.
- All right, we have...
- Where's the beak?
- 24 minutes to get...
- I lost the beak!
- Out the door, that's up to the cake.
- Speaking of which, once we cut the cake...
That's it, we're done, like this is over.
- That deserves a celebratory dance.
- Oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Yeah.
- I'm in, I'm in.
- All right, let's try this.
♪ Ever since that girl
♪ said hello to me
♪ I'm in as dizzy
♪ as a lovesick fool could be
♪ on my face you see a smile
♪ where there used to be a frown
- why do you have this like dra...
- no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't, stop.
- Okay, wow.
What the fuck is this, Jim?
- It's...
It's an engagement ring.
- Yeah.
- Look, this looks weird okay, but this is weird.
Okay, all right, the past few weeks it's just been a haze, and I proposed and I forgot it was in there until tonight, so I've been carrying around this ring like a depressed Frodo Baggins.
Look...
- Yeah, come here.
Look, Jim.
We have had a lot of fun tonight but you clearly still have some things...
- no, no, no, no.
There's something that I want to show you, okay?
There's something I want to do for you.
There's something I'm gonna do in front of you.
Jesus Christ, this couldn't get any worse.
- Oh my god, thank god I found you.
- No, no, no, not now.
- No, no, no, this is important.
- What?
- Here's a list with our demands.
- Oh, are you a die hard villain now?
- Yippee-ki-yay...
- motherfucker, you're going on strike?
- Mhm, yeah.
- What?
- And it's long overdue.
Colt here helped us see that.
- Don't touch me?
- Seriously, Colt?
Okay, how's it going?
Can you just do me a favor?
Get the cake, bring it out, then you can do whatever the fuck you want.
How's that sound?
- Yeah, not until our demands are met.
- Okay, I can't get you dental insurance right now.
- Then I can't get you your cake right now.
- Let me see this.
I got it.
I know what this means.
- Okay, sorry.
So where was I?
We should definitely focus on the cake.
Yeah, I feel like the crowd is probably starting to get restless, and you know...
- where's the wedding cake?
This is bullshit!
- See, see, they want the cake, so...
Uh, maybe go into the kitchen and help Colt bring it out, and I will stay out here and just distract everyone.
Okay, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Great, awesome, thank you.
Okay, Alex.
Distraction, distract...
Sean.
Hey, Sean?
Sorry about earlier, but you're still ready to dance right, yeah?
- No, sweetheart.
I was born ready.
Yeah, move.
- Great, oh.
- Okay, move.
Play the tape.
Play the tape.
Move bitch.
- Hey, come here!
Forget those stinking signs, forget everything, we're gonna go global.
We're gonna go global because we have been treated like second class citizens for too long by these people.
Throw the fucking tray away, right now!
Yes, Cesar Chavez died for our privilege to unionize.
Let's exercise that privilege, people!
Revolucion!
- Hey, where's that wheelie thing?
- Hey sorry scout, I can't help you.
Union rules!
- Okay, there's no union, you made that up man.
- Can you handle your side, bro?
- Yeah I'm fine, Jesus.
- I saw you and Alex had a little tiff earlier.
Don't you worry, I got you.
All right, chin up.
I'll drive her home.
To my home.
Where we'll fuck.
- You don't deserve her, man.
- What, and you do?
Really?
Why, tell me.
- Cause I'm a nice guy.
- Oh fuck, Jim.
"I'm a nice guy?"
And what, I always finish last, is that it?
Wanna know why you finish last?
Because you bitch and moan about finishing last.
Jimmy...
Okay, you know what Alex does all day?
She works.
Now do you really thinks she wants to come home and work some more fixing your sad life?
No, dude, no.
But you see, me.
I'm easy.
And until she decides she wants something better,
I am a-okay finishing first.
- Need help?
Why'd you, bro...
What?
No!
No, no!
- What is...
- No!
- What is your problem, Colt?
- What?
My problem?
I found the wheelie thing, I was just trying to help.
- You stopped trying!
I really should've been the best man.
- Jim, come on man.
Jim, Jim I found the wheelie thing.
Don't throw the cake...
- Oh god Jim, what happened to the cake?
- It's gone, it's pulverized.
- My art!
- Okay, let me, let me, can I...
Oh wait, I got it.
Greta, she prepared for this.
Nope, tampons.
- No, no, Jim, what, we'll juts get some water and we'll just dab it.
- Look, there's something I need to do.
Thank you, Sean.
That was a thing.
Look, there's something that...
I wanted to say.
- Hey!
When we doing cake?
I'm diabetic, and I took an extra Insulin shot in preparation.
- Yeah, we did it already.
It was over there and it was delicious, so.
Isn't that right, Margene?
And Paul, where's Paul?
So...
I...
I wanted to sing a song for you guys, so here goes.
- I understand that you probably have your reasons, you usually do.
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- Hey, Margene.
I really need to talk to Paul, where is he?
- I don't know.
And it's not that big of a backyard, so yeah.
Where the fuck is he?
- Try not to say Timmy's name while we're fucking.
Because I associate that name with you.
You won't have to, cause we're never having sex again.
- Fine.
After this time though, right?
- Obviously.
- Okay, great.
- That's fine, you can just spin me around and live out your prison rape fantasy.
- What exactly are you implying?
- I don't know, let's ask some of the boys
- that was at camp, and I told you that in confidence, that's it, we're over!
- No, I hope you die alone then!
- And I hope you get your mother's hitch!
- Okay!
God damn it!
Okay.
You wanna play games, Quentin?
Oh god, that's so strong.
Hey Skyler, no, okay.
Do you wanna make out?
- I don't know, I've been doing some thinking.
- What is there to think about?
I'm way hotter than you.
Are you crying?
- No.
Same ballpark, maybe.
Same parking lot, okay.
- Okay, stop that.
Third base, all access, under the dress, but you have three seconds to decide.
While he's looking, Skyler!
- All right.
- Okay great, let's go.
Let's go have sex then!
- I'm already wearing a condom, just so you know.
- You're what?
- I put it on before because it's hard.
- Easy, I got you.
This song sucks.
It does, it sucks my balls.
- Does it, does it suck, really?
- Yeah, cause they played this shit at prom, right?
- They did, yup.
- Now that, that was a dance, and I wasn't even your date.
Right?
- No, Jim was.
- Jimmy, um...
Yeah, he's a bit of a chump though.
- Don't, okay.
- Can I borrow you for a moment, perhaps?
- I would love that, thank you for it, okay.
- Are you back with Zeb?
- Margene, I don't know I mean he's...
He's not that bad when you're like having sex with him, it's, you know.
- God damn it, Sean!
- Hey, what, look at me, what is going on with you?
- Can I be honest?
- Okay, come here.
Come, come with me.
- Do you think he's gonna be upset at me?
- No it's, who cares, it's Sean.
He's fucking fine.
Okay, talk to me.
- On our honeymoon people are gonna ask to see my ring.
And I'll have to just explain that my brother-in-law's wearing it.
- I'm gonna chop off Colt's finger, it'll solve everything...
- it's not just that though, I want my husband, who I love, so where the hell is he?
What chance does our marriage have?
- Aw babe, don't think that.
- One more thing.
I love you, and I say this as your closest friend.
Stop going back to Zeb, okay?
He is a creep, and you deserve better, look at you.
There's better here tonight.
- I'm fine, but I would like to know what you mean by that, so.
- Finding someone to stick with you all night is harder than it looks.
Trust me.
Do I look okay?
- You don't leave until you...
Come here.
I love you.
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, okay?
Find your husband.
- I will.
- Go.
- Hey Alex.
Did I overhear you say that...
- cut off your finger?
Colt, yes, I definitely will, mhm.
- Gotcha.
Maxi, I gotta talk to you.
Max, I gotta talk.
Hey.
You end the strike?
- Yeah man, I talked to Mr. Zebadiah Buckman, and he game me three box seats to the next ou game.
He did what you couldn't do, Colt.
He appeased the masses, and he signed my forearm.
- Okay, that wasn't on your list of shitty demands.
- Hey Colt.
I bet you had fun in high school.
- You kiddin' me?
Best five years of my life.
Only human voted prom king twice.
Look it up.
- I was fuckin' miserable in high school.
I was trying so hard to get into a good college,
I never experienced anything.
- And then when you got into college you probably didn't have any fun cause you were just trying to get a job.
- And I got a job.
And a house and car and a cat and...
That's it.
- Cool.
- I was never fingered in high school.
- Makes sense.
I mean...
No offense, but I could only imagine getting fingered by a teenage boy is just like, you know...
- What?
- Well...
It's like getting your vagina played with by a chimpanzee.
- Oh my god.
Get out!
- No, I wanna touch your...
But I wanna be the chimpanzee that does.
- Stop!
- Hey you know what?
At least you have a job.
- What happened?
- Well I lost it because I got fired from the Cherokee casino, dealing Blackjack wrong.
- For cheating?
- No, I wish.
Just counting the cards too slow.
Cause sometimes there's like a lot of cards that equal 21, and sometimes there's like an Ace and the Ace is worth two or one, different point values.
- Shh, it's boring.
- I'm boring?
- Yeah, you're boring.
- I'm boring?
I like that you eat food off the floor cause
I don't trust people that don't eat food off the floor.
How do you do it?
How do you keep your shit together?
You know, besides now...
Now you're little miss loaded lady face.
- I could help you.
- With what?
- Basic addition.
- Is that a joke?
- But you have to teach me how to have fun.
- Sign me up, where do I sign up,
I'm the president of...
Okay well this isn't fun, this is more...
Just fuckin' weird.
Whoa.
Nevermind, this is fucking awesome.
Oh!
How deep is my...
Greta.
Greta, look at this!
Look!
What is missing from my finger?
The fucking ring!
You did it!
Hey, you did it!
What was that?
What'd you just do?
Spit it up, no spit it up.
Greta, spit it up, we're not fucking around right now.
What was that, that was bullshit!
Come on, no!
Fuck me!
- Okay!
- Fuck me, no don't fuck me, fucking, are you serious?
Oh my god, I gotta get Jim, I gotta get Jim, put your fuckin' head on the cape and pillow.
I gotta find Jim, I gotta find Jim again.
Oh dear god.
Pastor Kyle, pray me a good one brother.
- Yo Jesus, help this bro...
- that's terrible.
- Oh, fucking Jim.
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
Where are you Jim!
- Hey Tobias.
Dad.
Yeah, I notice you've been quiet all evening.
I'm sorry I haven't really been around,
I've just been running around, greeting folks.
- You are a fucking moron.
- How's that?
- You know...
When little Margene was born, my life changed forever.
- Wait, I can't believe you just said that.
Seriously, that's exactly how I've been feeling tonight.
Like everything is changing like with my friends...
- yeah, well your friends are also morons.
- I know that because I've been listening to them all god damn night.
- They mean well if you just give them...
- would you just shut up and let me finish?
- Yes sir.
- Now being her father.
Probably the most important and fulfilling thing
I've ever done in my life.
But...
Now I gotta let my little girl go.
Which brings me to why you are such a fucking moron.
- Um...
- Well son, because I've been sitting here all night long feeling all depressed because
I'm not gonna see little Margene as much.
But you.
You get to spend the rest of your life with her.
- And I've barely seen her all night.
- Do you love her?
- Love her?
Sir...
She's my favorite person, my every thought is consumed with trying to make her happy, trying to take care of her.
- Well there, you have a problem right there son because we don't take care of Margene,
Margene takes care of us.
But you know, when her momma died last year, well...
She started coming to me with her issues and...
Believe you me, she's got some mighty god damn big issues.
Well...
I'm not her mother and I didn't know what to say, didn't know what to do...
Until I realized.
You see...
All Margene ever needs is someone to listen.
And someone to let her know that she is not alone.
- I am a fucking moron.
- Well, we agree on something.
So I tell you what son, you got a choice to make.
Now, you can either man up in the next 10 minutes and become a real husband, or I tell you what...
I'll shove my hand so far up your ass and drag you down to the courthouse and sign the annulment in your god damn blood, you got me?
- Yes, yes sir.
- You "feel" me?
- I do.
Sir, I'll just keep it at sir.
Glad we had this talk.
- Yo, yo, yo.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You see Jim?
- No, have you seen Margene?
- No.
- Have you guys seen Lisa?
- No, maybe she's with Margene.
- No, I think she's with Skyler.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, so maybe Margene is with Greta.
- No, no, no, Greta's face down in the cake, maybe Margene's with Quentin!
- I'm Quentin.
- Oh sweet, right on man.
Hey, I gotta find Jim.
Good luck Paul, good luck...
- Quentin.
- Jesus Christ, you guys, are you fucking kidding?
Everyone could see you.
- Hey Jim, what's up dog?
- Hey Jim!
- Bout to get a game going, man.
What are you doing, you interrupted.
- Hey, is Quentin with you?
Is he looking for me though?
Is he following you, is he looking for me?
Quentin!
Quentin?
Is he behind the bushes?
- I don't know.
Who's back there?
Hey, Quentin.
- No, I'm sorry guys.
Hi, it's just me.
- Bethanie, what are you doing back here?
- Just being sad mostly.
And then you guys showed up, started making out,
I freaked out, I jumped into the bushes.
I'm sorry, I've just been throwing up for unrelated, food related reasons.
- Why you hiding from us?
- I like you.
Like more than just a friend,
I think that you're the coolest, cutest guy that I know.
- Really?
- Really?
- And I don't wanna see you with another girl,
I wanna see you with me.
I'm sorry, I just had to say it.
- Okay I'm sorry, but that's my man that you're talking about there.
- Okay, Lisa.
- No, no, no.
For all you know, Scott and I have something very special going on...
- Skyler and I have something very special going on here.
- You do, huh?
- Oh no, Quentin's found us.
- Hey, okay.
We've all...
- Quentin, calm down.
- I'm gonna kill you, you slutty piece of shit!
- Hey, hey!
Whoa!
- Oh my god!
Oh my god!
He just pulled off my...
Actual real hair!
- Okay, all right.
- Is there blood, Jim?
- No, no.
- Is there?
I'll kill you!
- No, no!
- All right come on!
You guys, we're adults with college degrees for Christ's sake.
- Not I!
- Ged.
- What do you want, Colt?
- Coming in warm with some hot news, and a little bit of cold.
Sizzling stuff first, the ring is off.
Woo!
All right, ice cold...
Greta swallowed it.
So, we're working with...
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!
You fucking idiot!
- Hey!
This is the first day of the rest of my life!
And you are all supposed to be here to support me.
To be my wedding party, but instead the boys are fighting, Lisa's whoring around again, and Bethanie...
I don't even know what's up with you.
Now obviously I expected more from tonight, but I really expected more from me to you.
I never asked you to be perfect, but I had hoped that when times got tough and when I was feeling vulnerable that someone would be here for me.
Have I not been here for each of you?
- Wait, wait.
Margene, wait.
Look, I'm sorry.
Okay?
We're all sorry.
We're gonna do better.
Quentin and Lisa.
You two can fight or fuck or whatever verb you choose, just do it to each other and leave us out of it.
Skyler...
You look great, man.
- Thanks James, appreciate it.
- I think you need to throw up.
Bethanie, I think you need to throw up again, so maybe you guys can help each other find a bathroom.
What, Colt?
- Well you left me out, so...
I'm ready.
Don't touch anything, don't fuck anything else up.
- Come on man, hey.
Hey, hold on, hear me out Jim.
Can I go on Greta duty?
I wanna go on Greta duty.
- You'll do that?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna do that.
Day and night until I find that ring.
- What?
I'm gonna roll my sleeves up figuratively and literatively, until I find that ring.
- Don't worry about it, that'd be awesome man.
- Scrubbed in, ready for surgery.
- Great, okay, well.
Look, let's just go find Paul.
- Thank you.
So...
You know Paul better than anyone.
What's going on with him?
- I think he's just freaked out about the future, his job, losing his friends.
- You guys have lost touch.
- I still should've been the best man.
- Oh come on.
He had to choose his brother.
So you're not his best man, you're his best friend.
- Nah, you are.
- Like you said in your toast, you're caught.
- My toast?
- Come on, I am a 4th grade English teacher,
I know when boys cheat off each other's homework.
- Look, in the future if Paul does anymore stupid shit...
- If...
Paul does.
- All right, when he does...
You can come to me for advice, I'd like that.
- I have some advice for you.
Alex is amazing.
Don't give up on her.
Promise?
- So, Paul could be anywhere.
- Hey.
- Oh jeez.
- We have to talk.
- I know, just...
Not right here.
- Okay.
- I'm cutting in.
Look, I'm crazy about you, and I think you know that.
- Okay, Jim...
- no, I was gonna make a big show of it too, but grand gestures, they're not real.
Didn't matter how I asked you to prom if I didn't dance with you.
- So what, you're trying to make up for the past or...
- no, no, I can't go back and edit life, it just keeps moving forward, never pausing.
And Zeb...
- Oh, I'm what?
- Zeb's an asshole.
If you cared about him at all, you would leave him.
His douchebaggery is just a byproduct of you validating his behavior.
- Oh, big words.
- What do you want from me?
- I want a dance, and I want to take you to dinner tomorrow night, and I want you to not be afraid of what's ahead because love doesn't disappoint, he does.
- Alex.
- We should be together.
That's all.
- Well that guy's a dick.
- I need to be alone for a while.
- Wait, babe.
Babe, wait!
Alex!
- Hey...
Can I just get like, one water?
- Make that two.
Hi.
What?
- Oh, you don't wanna...
Let's just say I'm lucky you can't get diseases from a bird.
- Okay, um...
So about before.
I know, that must've been quite the shock for you, and I can explain.
- Oh, and I knew.
And we all knew, like literally everybody that you know knew.
But you could've told me.
- Cause you're my best friend.
- Yeah.
Which is why...
I am so sorry that I said that I liked you because that was really weird.
- No, hey, hey, Bethanie don't do that.
No, no, no, I thought that was sweet, and honestly I need to tell you that...
- okay Skyler hey listen, I don't like you.
I mean, I can't like you.
I was hung up on you for a really long time, but I think that I had to get it out loud to finally realize that we want different things.
You want to sleep with random girls and that's okay.
But I want a man.
I want a man that wants me.
Cool.
All right.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go throw up now.
So...
- Oh hey, Bethanie.
- Yeah?
- Everyone knew?
- Everyone but you.
- Thanks.
- We need to make time for each other.
- I know.
- Paul...
Where were you tonight?
- Just had to do some thinking.
- And?
- And I decided that I want to spend the rest of my life by your side, and making you happy...
And praying those are the same things.
- I can't have you running off...
- I know.
- I know, I know.
- Because I'm pregnant.
And I've really...
- Just wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Paul.
- Wait.
Please just wait.
That...
That is the greatest thing I've ever heard in my life.
We're gonna be a family.
I'm gonna be a father...
You're having a baby?
- No, no, no, no, I am absolutely terrified, trust me.
But good, this is the single greatest moment of my life.
Right here.
I mean I get to...
And can you download the baby books on kindle right now?
And can you fly?
We haven't thought about this,
I don't think we should fly, here's what we're gonna do.
I got a new plan listen to me, no I'm serious.
We're gonna go home, we are going to eat, we're gonna eat again, some more, a lot of food, on kindle because I have this Amazon gift card that my uncle Sully...
And I think we should go and spend some time together on our honeymoon.
Also, we're gonna need to pretend like we made this there...
- Right, right.
- So.
- Conceived.
Conceived the first time we made love.
- How poetic.
- How perfect.
- Hello.
- What is...
- Oh...
- Your chariot.
- Where did you...
Wait, I thought we're like waiting for all like the guests and the rice and...
- bubbles, and it's not about them, it's about you guys and it is exactly time for you guys to hit the road, so get out of here.
- Listen.
Thank you for everything tonight.
I'm sorry it all went to shit.
- No, you know what?
The honeymoon will be perfect.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
I don't really need this anymore, so...
Why don't you take it for the honeymoon?
I will have yours ready and sanitized when you get back.
- What?
- No, don't worry about it.
- Okay.
- Wife.
- Oh my gosh.
Husband.
- I don't even...
Know how to...
- I'll see you in a few weeks.
- All right.
- Have fun.
- Will do.
- Thank you.
- Of course.
- Go get her.
- They grow up so fast, don't they?
- Hey.
So...
I feel like we're not done with this binder and there's some things in here that we missed and should you know, go back and...
- So, where's Zeb?
With a very nice large to go order of fish.
Sometimes we just have to move on.
- Have I turned you into a romantic?
- Man I don't know, two hours ago you definitely were not.
- Yeah, that's...
It's been a weird night.
- Yeah.
- Oh my god, you weren't on the tennis court.
And then Quentin showed up and pulled off his toupee.
- Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
Shut the fuck up, kiss my face.

This programme contains some strong language
APPLAUSE
Good evening.
Welcome to Have I Got News For You.
I'm Jo Brand.
In the news this week, as footage emerges from the recent royal tour, it appears Nicholas Witchell picked the wrong moment to bend over and tie his shoelaces.
In his last year in office, there are suspicions that Barack Obama is frittering away Secret Service resources as extra protection is laid on for Tiddles, the White House cat.
And after a long day's recording, there's a sense of deja vu for the producers of Top Gear as they fail to provide Chris Evans with a steak.
No wonder he's angry!
He's got pixelated organs.
On Ian's team tonight is an actress and comedian whose Twitter biography refers to her as a "Northern powerhouse", presumably because George Osborne has no idea where she is and has never given her any money.
Please welcome Diane Morgan!
APPLAUSE
And with Paul tonight is a business consultant and host of Countdown who once described me as his celebrity crush.
Only if I sat on you, mate.
Please welcome Nick Hewer.
APPLAUSE
And we start with the biggest stories of the week.
Paul and Nick, take a look at this.
Ah, yes, the collapse of British Home Stores, a very famous name on the high street.
That's their funeral collection there.
Er, baboon, er, he's the new chairman, he's come in.
That's Sir Philip Green and money rushing in.
So, yes, there's a bit of controversy about BHS
- and Sir Philip Green.
- It's a hell of a story.
It's a bonfire of the vanities, an extraordinary, terrible story.
Erm...he's not a spiv.
- He's not a spiv?
- He's not a spiv.
I know he's not a spiv.
My lawyer said he's not a spiv.
And you'll remember, he's had his run-ins in the City before.
I don't know why you're planting this on me!
- Because...
- If you want to suggest Sir Philip Greed...
Green...
- LAUGHTER
- Sorry.
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
If you want to suggest there's something fishy about his whole financial thing, well, you say it, not me!
- I'm not saying he should be put inside.
- Your boys on Private Eye will be all over it like a cheap suit.
Although perhaps not one from BHS.
Let's just do figures quickly, shall we?
He bought it for 200 million.
Fair play to him, it made a profit of around 500 million in less than a decade.
But he also took out around 580 million in dividends and various deals for himself and his family.
Which is quite a lot to give yourself in a tax haven.
Again, I'm not saying that's odd.
I've shoplifted in BHS, but it was never that much.
The flipside of taking all this money out is that the reason it's gone bankrupt is there's a £570 million pension fund.
And someone's got to pay the pensions to these employees.
Now, you'd think that might be someone who'd taken 400 million out himself, but no.
It's another body, called the Pension Protection Fund,
- which is backed by, ooh, the taxpayer.
- AUDIENCE MEMBER:
- Oh!
Oh, you're happy now, aren't you?
I think BHS shutting down is a bit like when someone tells you that someone's died but you thought they'd died earlier anyway.
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
See, like, Woolworths, when that went bust, you know, people were genuinely sad because they didn't know where to get their pic'n'mix.
That was a big issue for me!
In all seriousness, my concern is that this little episode damages the whole idea of entrepreneurship.
Because entrepreneurs are meant to create money.
Spread it around.
This is all apparently rocketing
- to the South of France into Monte Carlo.
- Are you suggesting this is more like asset stripping?
- No...
- I wouldn't use that phrase.
And what about the stuff in it?
Is that good?
I don't go to BHS.
One thing that's weird about Philip Green - well, I find it weird - is that celebrities find him irresistible, don't they?
How much did he spend on his birthday party?
Something like £5 million.
And everyone was there, but they were there cos they'd been paid.
Which the rest of us would consider, yes, tragic.
I got away with 200 quid for mine.
Erm, well, let's have a look at him with some beautiful people.
Here's a beautiful person
- Liz Hurley, of course.
Here's another beautiful person.
Yeah, Rita Ora.
And another beautiful person...
Yeah.
And listen, here's Sir Philip Green with another beauty.
Aww.
But you are a long way away.
- Where did you find that?
!
- It's in my personal collection.
It's a specialist website.
Does anyone know what the boss of MS said about him
- after his failed takeover of MS in 2004?
- Was that Stuart Rose?
- Mmm.
They came to blows, almost, outside the Dorchester, you know?
- During that...
- How posh of them!
Not outside Kentucky Fried Chicken.
He said...
Right...
And what's going to happen next?
Does the parliamentary committee have the power to coerce him to come before them and answer questions?
And apparently, the answer is yes.
They're also talking about bringing
Lady Christina!
After all, she owns it.
Yes.
No, Frank Field seems to think that he will be summoned to the Commons Work Pensions Committee...
Let's have a look at him telling us about that.
It's inconceivable that we wouldn't actually invite...
Sir Philip Green to come.
Um...he's called us a load of effing arseholes...
I mean, that's the height of arrogance, isn't it, really?
This is the demise of BHS and Sir Philip Green's battle to hold on to his title.
Philip Green likes to surround himself with celebrities like Kate Moss, although it's less well known that Sir Philip has done a bit of modelling himself.
And here's what he was modelling for.
APPLAUSE
In 2010, David Cameron personally appointed Sir Philip Green as the...
Ah, 2010, the same year David Cameron personally appointed
George Michael the Driving Safety Tsar.
And Nick Clegg the Deputy Prime Minister.
Commenting on Sir Philip Green's handling of the BHS pension fund,
Alastair Campbell said it had...
Well, Sir Philip, you've got a yacht, you know what to do.
APPLAUSE
OK, Ian and Diane, take a look at this.
The Presidential visit.
Ugh, that's the propaganda.
Good grief, that's a selfie!
And that's Flaky!
We had a visit by an American president, which was incredibly exciting.
Um...
It was!
He played golf, which is... important on a state visit.
And he ate two enormous meals with the royal family.
And he advised us to stay in the EU.
No, it was a threat!
He said, "Unless you stay in the EU, you're going to the
"back of the queue," which is a mistake with British people, cos we think, "Great, queue!
"I'll go back again and queue up!
"This is good."
Are these EU/US trade deals as exciting as they sound?
I'm gripped!
I can barely sleep at night, going over the details.
One being negotiated at the moment is...
They're called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
Obama said, "If you don't stay in the EU,
"you don't get this brilliant deal," which is a terrible deal which half of Europe is trying to throw out.
It's basically a deal that allows corporate America to do what it likes.
Having a go at Obama is very popular(!
)
What did the Brexit camp make of his intervention in support of staying in the EU?
Were they pleased?
- No, they were jolly cross.
- They were jolly cross.
Because all they've got is Marine Le Pen.
What did Jeremy Corbyn discuss with Obama during the 30 sparse minutes that he got to spend with him?
Do you know?
I think it was global capitalism and the effect on the labour market.
That's not far off, because the subject of their half-hour discussion was...
What, and Cameron had a round of golf?
Well, I think by the time Corbyn had actually said that, his time was up.
Yes, a round of golf.
That was next on his agenda.
This took place just outside Watford.
The President's retinue blended into its surroundings.
Here's the usual convoy of Secret Service personnel.
There they are.
And here they are in golf-course mode.
Now, David Cameron and President Obama exchanged gifts.
This is what Obama gave Cameron.
A custom-made Shinola men's watch engraved with the presidential seal.
A bison-leather duffel bag monogrammed with the Prime Minister's initials.
Three cans of US Open tennis balls.
And a pair of sports towels personalised with the UK/US friendship flags.
Whatever they are.
Sports towels?
It's an unsubtle message, isn't it?
It's "get exercising, fatty".
This is what David Cameron gave him.
A volume of the complete works of Shakespeare.
Oh.
That's it.
The only thing I was interested in was, you know...
Boris mentioned this bust of Churchill...
- Oh, that's right.
- ..that Obama had that apparently he claimed
- he'd had removed from his office.
- Yeah.
But I'd be interested in having that if he's not put it back.
Cos I've got a Martin Luther King snow globe I could swap.
Do you know how Churchill's grandson, Nicholas Soames, reacted?
- Do you know what he said?
- He exploded.
- He was angry.
He thought Boris was out of order to take issue with its removal, saying...
- "Bogged it." - "Bogged it." Has anyone here ever bogged it?
Well, let's take a little detour.
How did Ken Livingstone bog it this week?
If I'm using it in the right context.
He came out in defence of someone that the party have now suspended.
Naz Shah, who's an MP, yeah.
Naz Shah, who made some rather unfortunate anti-Semitic posts.
But as she said, it was way back in 2014.
Which is, you know, a world away.
It's like 1932, isn't it?
The suggestion was that he said, apparently, that in 1932 Hitler was saying that he actually was a Zionist.
He thought it was a jolly good idea that he wanted to ship all the Jews in Germany...to Israel.
But when you're making a speech saying that somebody else isn't an anti-Semite, it's best to keep the words
"Hitler" and "Jews"... away from each other, on the whole.
How did Ken Livingstone avoid journalists after news of his suspension broke?
Put on a pair of dungarees and went home.
No, he actually did bog it, because he took cover in a disabled toilet... which I'm assuming is the meaning of "bogging it".
I don't know.
There he is... nipping into one.
And he was in there for 20 minutes while journalists shouted questions about Hitler at him.
I watched him being chased up the stairs by Mr Mann and being given a thumping, and he kept smiling.
But it is something when you've got two Labour figures just screaming at each other.
That footage is brilliant.
Disgusting racist!
Rewriting history!
You're a disgusting racist!
- Are you saying it's not true?
- Yes, you're a lying racist!
Really?
Why don't you go and check the history?
A Nazi apologist!
A Nazi apologist!
You're a disgusting Nazi apologist, Livingstone!
Wow!
It's a happy party(!
)
- He's got terribly long legs, you know.
- Who?
Ken Livingstone?
I met him once.
I met him.
I said to him, "You've got disproportionally long legs."
It's a true story.
And he said, "I know."
He probably thought,
"This is the weirdest chat-up line I've ever had."
- "Disproportionately long legs."
- Look at him next time.
- Very long legs.
- DIANE:
- That's true.
I met him.
He does have long legs.
Yeah.
LAUGHTER
- Was that it?
- Was that what?
- All you thought?
- No.
He gave me a mince pie.
Well, if we can just go back to the subject of Brexit for a bit,
Nick, how well do you think the two campaigns are doing?
Cos you're a bit of a PR expert, aren't you?
I think that it's a very close thing, but I think there's always room for an event, isn't there, quite near the end?
Quite near polling day, something might suddenly jump out of the salad and surprise us all.
Do you mean an event as in something happening that...?
Do you remember Macmillan? "Events, dear boy, events."
Something could happen.
Yeah, but he didn't have the salad metaphor, which is brilliant.
I'm thinking an enormous cockroach.
I'm thinking about Billy Connolly.
Do you know that story?
He used to go to parties and put his penis on a plate and put salad over it and then walk round and people would...
And he would pick a bit off and...
- Who told you this?
!
- Maybe I dreamt that.
I read it somewhere.
Where did you read this?
Made-Up Stories For Incredulous People?
- I think I read it in The Lady.
- Ah, yes.
I might be wrong.
Well, they've got their finger on the pulse, certainly.
Anyway, if I'm in prison next week, it's because he's put me there.
OK, right, now, writing in The Times, Michael Gove said that if we didn't have to give 350 million a week to the EU, we'd have more money to spend on the NHS.
What current problem could that solve?
The other side just said, well, then, we wouldn't have all these immigrants coming in, filling all the jobs at the NHS.
No, this is about the junior doctors who've been on strike again over their new contract as Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says he wants to see a seven-day NHS.
One striking doctor held up a placard which said...
As an extra precaution, if anyone had to suddenly go into hospital, what could they take with them if they wanted to?
- A relative.
- Well, they could, but they could also take a Freezone Card.
Have a look at this.
This is a Hunt Freezone, and it says...
APPLAUSE
This is Barack Obama's visit to the UK.
David Cameron and Barack Obama enjoyed a round of golf together, though even the presidential golf buggy had to be followed by a motorcade of Secret Service men.
Still, they were on a golf course - that's an awful lot of grassy knolls.
This week saw the latest round of strikes by junior doctors with doctors on the picket line shouting, "Scab!
Scab!
Scab!"
and patients responding, "I know.
"If I come back tomorrow, will you look at it?"
Meanwhile, Ken Livingstone has been suspended from the Labour Party for attempting to defend Naz Shah's anti-Semitic comments.
Livingstone said...
I'm not sure whether that was Hitler or Ken.
Teams, now, here's another one.
Yes, this is the extraordinary story of Hillsborough.
Kelvin MacKenzie, the editor of the Sun.
Basically, people were demonised.
Football fans in the 1980s were seen as hooligans, drunk the whole time.
There had been lots of pitch invasions, so therefore you had these fences put up.
Ken Bates, the Chelsea chairman, wanted to put up electrified fences, I remember...
So this was how people viewed football fans.
The truth of the matter is that amongst these 96 people were working-class people, middle-class people, people from Liverpool, people outside of Liverpool.
And it took 27 years to come out.
Which sort of makes Chilcot look fast.
This is the news that the Hillsborough families had succeeded in their 27-year campaign.
It was celebrated on the front pages of the national press...
The Guardian, the Mirror...
The Star...
The i...
The Telegraph...
And the Sun...
Absolutely no sign of Hillsborough there.
- At all.
- The fact that the Murdoch papers didn't run it because of their embarrassment about having run headlines that said
"The Truth..." And then they got it all wrong and they just fed exactly what the police said to them.
And then they stuck to that line for years.
I mean, there was extraordinary collaboration to make sure
- there was one story put out.
- After the tragedy, 164 police statements submitted to the Justice Taylor report were altered, and most of the alterations were to remove criticism of the police operation and senior officers' lack of leadership.
If you want to learn more about the findings of the Hillsborough inquest, you can read in-depth analysis on the BBC website, and if you want to know less, then read the Sun.
APPLAUSE
And so to round two, The One-Armed Bandit of News.
Fingers on buzzers, teams.
Bloop!
BUZZER
This is the astronaut in space
- Tim Peake, is it?
And 26 miles, he ran round the...
On a little sort of space thing there.
- Do you mean a treadmill?
- Treadmill.
Actually, if he stands still, he does more than 26 miles, cos he's orbiting the earth, so he's...
Yeah, he ran the marathon cos the cameras were on him and he ran and ran and ran and everybody was very happy at the end.
- That's nothing compared to you, is it?
A marathon?
- No.
- You did how many?
- 135 miles.
- Yeah, just like that.
- In an hour.
In an hour?
!
That's fantastic!
Oh, all right...
Were you parachuting out of a plane?
- Seven days.
- Seven days.
- Yes.
- You had sticks.
- I had sticks?
- I saw you with the sticks.
- Oh, yeah, I know, but...
- Were they helpful?
- They are quite helpful, but I didn't really use them very much because they make you look like a twat.
No, they really do.
People are thinking, "Is she skiing?
There's no snow, what is she doing?"
It does look like...
You might have been approaching a giant Chinese meal.
Actually, Tim Peake, he broke a world record
- for running a marathon in space.
- Was he dressed up?
- Tim Peake?
- It seems like he's showing off, really, you know.
He's already in space, why run a marathon?
Yeah, you're right.
How do you even run a marathon in zero gravity?
- He was strapped down so he didn't float away.
- OK.
You mustn't leave the window open.
That's right.
They strapped me to the treadmill, but that's cos I kept trying to get away!
Let's have a look at Tim on his machine.
Here we go.
That is clever.
- NICK:
- He's got chains, look at that.
He's not THAT happy, is he?
Is it just me or is he upside down?
Back down here on earth, who slightly undermined Tim's incredible achievement?
All those other people in the marathon.
Yeah, well, there was one man called Martin Hewlett, who set the
Guinness World Record for the fastest earth marathon dressed as an astronaut.
Running in a costume that can be dangerously dehydrating, here he is before the race.
That's him in the middle.
Here he is after finishing.
Although, I think, in terms of suffering,
I'm not sure anyone beats this guy.
I know what you're thinking, but don't worry - a bloke dressed as Simon of Cyrene came and took it off him soon after.
Have I got my Bible facts right there, Ian?
- Terrific.
- Great to hear a Simon of Cyrene joke.
There've been very few for about 2,000 years!
Simon of Cyrene walks into a pub and says...
"I'll take your pint off you."
At the last supper, they're all sitting round and Jesus turns to the disciples and he says,
"I'm afraid that one of you, by this time tomorrow morning,
"will have betrayed me."
And Peter says, "Is it I, Jesus?" He says, "No, it is not you, Peter,
"you are one of the most faithful of all my apostles."
And James said, "Is it I, Jesus, is it I, James?"
"No, James, you are very faithful.
And Judas says, "Is it I, Jesus?"
- And Jesus said...
- MOCKING TONE:
- "Is it I, Jesus?"
True story.
Deuteronomy 26: 34, 85.
Or whatever bus routes go near there.
There were quite a few other novelty marathon records set in London.
- Can you name any of them?
- Yes, Mirror Man.
- Not Mirror Man?
- No.
- No.
Cabbage Boy!
Brought up by rogue cauliflower in the jungle.
No, no.
- Well, they're the only two I saw.
- There was a dinosaur, wasn't there?
There was a dinosaur, but, actually, record-setters - there was the fastest marathon by someone dressed as an elf, fastest marathon by someone wearing chainmail and...
The six-foot hot dog crossed the line in three hours, 57 minutes, closely followed by me.
- Has anyone here ever run the marathon?
- No.
Oh, I'm not speaking for everyone.
There's several people up there, look, there we are.
Oh, look at that, that's quite a lot.
Look, you're all on that side, so obviously you are more energetic cos you walked a bit further to your seats, maybe.
Congratulations, well done.
Has anyone ever...?
No-one's been to space in here, have they?
Has anyone?
No, didn't think so.
Sarah Brightman's pulled out, hasn't she, of space?
- DIANE:
- Oh, yeah!
Mm.
- Was this on the Richard Branson trip?
- Yeah.
- Cos that's always a bit delayed, isn't it?
- She paid a fortune!
Well, it was 200 grand, I think it was, wasn't it?
She was going to sing up there, as well, wasn't she?
I Lost My Heart To A Starship Trooper, was it?
A MAN LAUGHS LOUDLY
Thank you!
There's Andrew Lloyd Webber.
I once met Andrew Lloyd Webber at a city airport and I went,
"Good afternoon, Mr Lloyd Webber," and he went, "Mmmmph."
Like that, as if he really hated me.
Which he probably does, actually, but there we go.
If you look very closely at Andrew Lloyd Webber, you see Princess Margaret.
Is she inside him?
- She is there.
- That's grotesque!
- No, he is Princess Margaret.
- Is he?
- Look, you study it and tell me I'm wrong.
- Oh, I am having a look now.
Well, let's have a look.
Isn't that right?
There's a certain something.
Right, why did this lady, Betty Barker, think Tim Peake was drunk last Christmas Eve?
She works in his local pub?
He came in, he said, "I'm going into space next year."
He called her from the Space Station by mistake after getting the wrong number on his space phone when he was trying to call home.
Oh.
She was lucky there was a photographer there to capture the moment.
APPLAUSE
Well, Betty Barker thought he was a drunken reveller looking for a good time.
She's optimistic, old Betty, isn't she?
And she said...
And she said...
- That was quite picky.
- It is a bit.
Extraterrestrials may have been trying to contact us for decades... ..but they speak to the wrong people.
Betty Barker fucked it up.
Anyway...
Finally, shall we see how Tim Peake is inspiring a nation of youngsters
- to reach for the stars?
- Absolutely.
Here we go.
- You look like an astronaut - are you going to be an astronaut?
- No.
According to his CV, Tim Peake is not only an astronaut, he is...
He also has realistic hair and gripping hands.
Which means, at the end of this round,
Paul and Nick have four and Ian and Diane have three.
APPLAUSE
OK.
Time now for the Odd-One-Out Round.
Paul and Nick, your four are a spelling test for schoolchildren,
Bernie Clifton's new album, the Sinner's Bible and the village of Mela Thiruvenkatanathapuram in India.
- That's a...
- APPLAUSE
- Very good.
- Thank you.
Is that the place that's got a railway station where they say, "We're here."
Erm...
So, spelling tests.
Wasn't there something the other week about there were some kids had been given a spelling test they'd already seen?
The real test happened to be exactly the same - is that the story?
- Yes.
- That's that.
OK.
So the Sinner's Bible...
That was an early Bible, where it had a misprint in it.
- Ah, yes.
- And in the Ten Commandments, instead of saying "thou shalt...not kill", they'd left the "not" out.
Was it kill, or adultery?
- That was adultery.
- It was adultery.
That's why people got excited, because...
It said "thou shalt commit".
Did you say Bernie Clifton's got a new album out?
- Yes, he has.
- And what's interesting?
They printed the songs of a death-metal band instead of his own titles.
There must be a spelling mistake in the name of that town, then.
- I think I've got it.
- Test for the children, because it's been changed.
- That's the odd one out.
- That is the right answer.
In all the other three cases...
- There have been...
- A misprint, a mistake.
- Yes, that's right.
Absolutely.
- Whereas, with this town,
- they've got it completely right.
- No, no.
- I said that Paul had got it right.
- What you asking him for?
- You might as well ask the cat.
- I said before he'd got it right.
But between you you've got it, so one point each.
They've all featured misprints, except the spelling test for UK seven-year-olds, which appeared online correctly before the exam took place.
- NICK:
- Ah.
- Do you know how the error was discovered?
- Somebody spotted it.
Correct.
A primary school teacher noticed that...
One would hope that at least one of them would.
Where do they get this knowledge from?
Who else had an embarrassing week with writing and all that?
Shakespeare.
Well, it could have been, but it wasn't, no, it was someone that...
- Was it Nicky Morgan?
- Yes, it was Nicky Morgan.
Do you know why?
- She managed to spell something wrong on a letter.
- That's right.
She wrote a letter justifying education proposals and signed it off like this...
AUDIENCE GROANS
Sounds like a Mary Poppins track.
# Yours sincerily... #
But why is that particularly embarrassing for Nicky Morgan?
And not just cos she's Education Secretary.
Cos she's always said that all schools should be academies.
No, it's because sincerely is on the government's own list of words that ten-year-olds should be able to spell.
And we've already mentioned the mix-up at the launch of veteran entertainer Bernie Clifton's new album.
Can you explain why he's on an ostrich?
That was his act.
Those aren't his legs.
No, don't give it away!
The magic is spilling out.
You're making me feel stupid now.
Bernie's album's been misprinted with a track listing, as you said, of the new album belonging to death-metal band Abhorrent Decimation.
Cheery Bernie Clifton said...
Well, not to your face, mate.
Bernie's trying to relaunch his career, but with one big difference - what is it?
- He's not doing the ostrich any more?
- That's right, he's ditched it.
- Really?
- Mm.
And he says this...
But you kept giving it to them, Bernie, you whore.
Now, the village Mela Thiruvenkatanathapuram, right?
What idiot managed to misprint the name of Mela Thir...thing?
It was actually a New York Times journalist who was writing an article about...a place in India where possible future
Supreme Court Judge Sri Srinivasan comes from.
And how did they make amends?
By printing it again, but again making a different mistake.
Well, they published this apology.
SHE MUMBLES THE PLACE NAME
I just, I've said it once, I really don't think I can do it again.
Now, 1,000 copies of the so-called Wicked Bible, or the Sinner's Bible, were published in 1631 and it was so called, of course, because it contained a misprint in the seventh of the ten commandments so it read....
How long did it take the puritans of the 17th century to pick up
- on this mistake?
- Six months.
- A year.
- A year?
- I know.
I was wrong by 50%.
And the commandments are quite near the front, apparently.
So weird.
Must have been quite a year, though.
The whole of Christendom at it.
Now, Isis fighters were also the subject of an unfortunate typo by an American news channel.
- Did anyone see what NBC said they'd been getting up to?
- No.
A tweet stated that...
Wait till they find out Goldilocks slept in three different beds - they'll stone her to death.
GROANS AND LAUGHTER
Sorry.
No, I'm not.
The New York Times article talked about one resident of Mela Thiruvenkatanathapuram who was famous for...
Mind you, that was just when supporting the local football team.
"Give us an M!"
Ian and Diane, here are yours.
Hermione Granger, Anne Hathaway, the moons of Uranus and Tottenham Hotspur.
- I think this is a Shakespeare question.
- Yes.
Cos Hermione is named after Hermione in The Winter's Tale.
The moons of Uranus are all Shakespeare characters.
Tottenham Hotspur
- Harry Hotspur in Henry IV 1.
Crikey, Ian!
Anyone would think I'd done a degree.
That was a hell of a football match, Henry 4-1.
Went into extra time.
- And who's that?
- Anne Hathaway.
That was Shakespeare's wife, but not a character, so she's the odd one out.
Correct!
APPLAUSE
When you go back to the 17th century, you can't touch him - he's red-hot.
Now, many of Uranus' moons have been named after Shakespearean characters, as you said, such as Titania, Oberon, Ariel and Puck.
But what did the discovers of Pluto's moons do about naming them which caused controversy?
Oh, was it Moony McMoonface?
- NICK:
- They ask the public, did they?
- They ask the public?
No, they asked an actor
- William Shatner.
- Oh, fantastic.
- Yep.
And he suggested Vulcan.
- It's quite good, isn't it?
- Yeah.
It has a remarkable 27 moons, but what else is distinctive about Ur-ANus?
Well, it's been pronounced UR-anus since 1978.
Only if you're an American, Paul.
- No, British scientists have all signed up to it.
- Oh, do they?
- Yeah, to stop us laughing at Ur-ANus.
- OK.
And the rings around it.
It's not working, is it?
Wondering whether they'd be able to put a man on there.
It was the first planet to be discovered, right, by Sir William Herschel in 1781, because all the others had been known about and visible for thousands of years.
Now, in an interview for American radio, JK Rowling said that she'd named Harry Potter's Hermione after a character in...
- The Winter's Tale.
- Yes, very good.
She said a lot of people in America pronounce it Hermy-one.
"Lots of people in America", that sounds very scientific, yeah.
- I used to think that Penelope was pronounced Penny-loap.
- Me too.
The word discotheque has long disappeared, but a friend of mine thought it was disc-o-the-queue.
Mind you, another friend of mine thought doing was pronounced dawing.
Anyway, they are all named after Shakespeare's characters, apart from Anne Hathaway, who's named after his wife.
In a live BBC sketch to mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death, Prince Charles played the part of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, so he didn't even get to be king in that.
APPLAUSE
Which means, at the end of this round,
Paul and Nick have five and Ian and Diane have six.
APPLAUSE
Time now for the Missing Words Round, which this week features as its guest publication Deposits Magazine, the magazine of rocks, fossils and geology which, when it comes to its own content, can't always make its mind up...
And we start with...
Knock Keith Chegwin's confidence.
This is the story of Reza Beluchi, who attempted to walk across the ocean from Florida to Bermuda in a large inflatable plastic bubble.
After being rescued by the coastguard,
Beluchi popped the bubble and stepped out of it, saying,
"I feel like I've really let myself down."
I think it was "the dinosaurs died out", but I heard they "dined out for no apparent reason".
No.
It is, in fact...
Brexit.
- Exactly.
The dinosaurs' departure...
- Tyrannosaurus Brexit!
AUDIENCE GROANS Thank you very much indeed.
APPLAUSE
Next...
- NICK:
- Merkin.
- Merkin!
Settlement.
Foot.
Head.
Arm.
Kidney.
Centipede bigger than a human kidney.
Foot, head, arm, finger.
Centipede bigger than a human...
- Bigger than an actual human?
- Yes.
Imagine that coming out of your salad, Nick.
I think that's pretty much the Billy Connolly experience.
Sorry!
APPLAUSE
Finally...
- Nick:
- Chokes.
Is it there's nothing missing? "Man with giant foot"?
- No, there is.
It's...
- Yeah?
A traffic warden in South London ticketed a giant foot that parked outside Balham Tube Station.
Here's the traffic warden giving the foot a parking ticket.
To be fair, the foot had just broken down and it was waiting for a "toe truck".
So, the final scores are -
Paul and Nick have five, but Ian and Diane have seven.
APPLAUSE
But before we go, there's just time for the caption competition.
- DIANE:
- Bet you a quid I can lose my hand.
Don't put your keys in me
- I'm not a handbag yet!
On which note, we say thank you to our panellists,
Ian Hislop and Diane Morgan, Paul Merton and Nick Hewer.
And I leave you with news that, after drastic budget cuts, it looks like the next Star Wars movie could be a little disappointing.
In Cambridge, a long-running feud in the council traffic department escalates to full-on civil war.
And in Glasgow, there's terror as the police are called in to identify a mysterious and suspicious package.
Good night!
APPLAUSE
This programme contains some strong language.
APPLAUSE
Good evening.
Welcome to Have I Got News For You.
I'm Jo Brand.
In the news this week, as footage emerges from the recent royal tour, it appears Nicholas Witchell picked the wrong moment to bend over and tie his shoelaces.
In his last year in office, there are suspicions that Barack Obama is frittering away Secret Service resources as extra protection is laid on for Tiddles, the White House cat.
And after a long day's recording, there's a sense of deja vu for the producers of Top Gear as they fail to provide Chris Evans with a steak.
No wonder he's angry!
He's got pixelated organs.
On Ian's team tonight is an actress and comedian whose Twitter biography refers to her as a "Northern powerhouse", presumably because George Osborne has no idea where she is and has never given her any money.
Please welcome Diane Morgan!
APPLAUSE
And with Paul tonight is a business consultant and host of Countdown who once described me as his celebrity crush.
Only if I sat on you, mate.
Please welcome Nick Hewer.
APPLAUSE
And we start with the biggest stories of the week.
Paul and Nick, take a look at this.
Ah, yes, the collapse of British Home Stores, a very famous name on the high street.
That's their funeral collection there.
Er, baboon, er, he's the new chairman, he's come in.
That's Sir Philip Green and money rushing in.
So, yes, there's a bit of controversy about BHS
- and Sir Philip Green.
- It's a hell of a story.
It's a bonfire of the vanities, an extraordinary, terrible story.
Erm...he's not a spiv.
- He's not a spiv?
- He's not a spiv.
I know he's not a spiv.
My lawyer said he's not a spiv.
And you'll remember, he's had his run-ins in the City before.
I don't know why you're planting this on me!
- Because...
- If you want to suggest Sir Philip Greed...
Green...
- LAUGHTER
- Sorry.
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
If you want to suggest there's something fishy about his whole financial thing, well, you say it, not me!
- I'm not saying he should be put inside.
- Your boys on Private Eye will be all over it like a cheap suit.
Although perhaps not one from BHS.
Let's just do figures quickly, shall we?
He bought it for 200 million.
Fair play to him, it made a profit of around 500 million in less than a decade.
But he also took out around 580 million in dividends and various deals for himself and his family.
Which is quite a lot to give yourself in a tax haven.
Again, I'm not saying that's odd.
LAUGHTER
I've shoplifted in BHS, but it was never that much.
The flipside of taking all this money out is that the reason it's gone bankrupt is there's a £570 million pension fund.
And someone's got to pay the pensions to these employees.
Now, you'd think that might be someone who'd taken 400 million out himself, but no.
It's another body, called the Pension Protection Fund,
- which is backed by, ooh, the taxpayer.
- AUDIENCE MEMBER:
- Oh!
Oh, you're happy now, aren't you?
I think BHS shutting down is a bit like when someone tells you that someone's died but you thought they'd died earlier anyway.
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
See, like, Woolworths, when that went bust, you know, people were genuinely sad because they didn't know where to get their pic'n'mix.
That was a big issue for me!
In all seriousness, my concern is that this little episode damages the whole idea of entrepreneurship.
Because entrepreneurs are meant to create money.
Spread it around.
This is all apparently rocketing
- to the South of France into Monte Carlo.
- Are you suggesting this is more like asset stripping?
- No...
- I wouldn't use that phrase.
And what about the stuff in it?
Is that good?
I don't go to BHS.
One thing that's weird about Philip Green - well, I find it weird - is that celebrities find him irresistible, don't they?
How much did he spend on his birthday party?
Something like £5 million.
And everyone was there, but they were there cos they'd been paid.
Which the rest of us would consider, yes, tragic.
I got away with 200 quid for mine.
Erm, well, let's have a look at him with some beautiful people.
Here's a beautiful person
- Liz Hurley, of course.
Here's another beautiful person.
Yeah, Rita Ora.
And another beautiful person...
Yeah.
And listen, here's Sir Philip Green with another beauty.
Aww.
But you are a long way away.
- Where did you find that?
!
- It's in my personal collection.
It's a specialist website.
Does anyone know what the boss of MS said about him
- after his failed takeover of MS in 2004?
- Was that Stuart Rose?
- Mmm.
They came to blows, almost, outside the Dorchester, you know?
- During that...
- How posh of them!
Not outside Kentucky Fried Chicken.
He said...
Right...
And what's going to happen next?
Does the parliamentary committee have the power to coerce him to come before them and answer questions?
And apparently, the answer is yes.
They're also talking about bringing
Lady Christina!
After all, she owns it.
Yes.
No, Frank Field seems to think that he will be summoned to the Commons Work Pensions Committee...
Let's have a look at him telling us about that.
It's inconceivable that we wouldn't actually invite...
Sir Philip Green to come.
Um...he's called us a load of effing arseholes...
I mean, that's the height of arrogance, isn't it, really?
This is the demise of BHS and Sir Philip Green's battle to hold on to his title.
Philip Green likes to surround himself with celebrities like Kate Moss, although it's less well known that Sir Philip has done a bit of modelling himself.
And here's what he was modelling for.
APPLAUSE
In 2010, David Cameron personally appointed Sir Philip Green as the...
Ah, 2010, the same year David Cameron personally appointed
George Michael the Driving Safety Tsar.
And Nick Clegg the Deputy Prime Minister.
Commenting on Sir Philip Green's handling of the BHS pension fund,
Alastair Campbell said it had...
Well, Sir Philip, you've got a yacht, you know what to do.
APPLAUSE
OK, Ian and Diane, take a look at this.
The Presidential visit.
Ugh, that's the propaganda.
Good grief, that's a selfie!
And that's Flaky!
We had a visit by an American president, which was incredibly exciting.
Um...
It was!
He played golf, which is... important on a state visit.
And he ate two enormous meals with the royal family.
And he advised us to stay in the EU.
No, it was a threat!
He said, "Unless you stay in the EU, you're going to the
"back of the queue," which is a mistake with British people, cos we think, "Great, queue!
"I'll go back again and queue up!
"This is good."
Are these EU/US trade deals as exciting as they sound?
I'm gripped!
I can barely sleep at night, going over the details.
One being negotiated at the moment is...
They're called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
Obama said, "If you don't stay in the EU,
"you don't get this brilliant deal," which is a terrible deal which half of Europe is trying to throw out.
It's basically a deal that allows corporate America to do what it likes.
Having a go at Obama is very popular(!
)
What did the Brexit camp make of his intervention in support of staying in the EU?
Were they pleased?
- No, they were jolly cross.
- They were jolly cross.
Because all they've got is Marine Le Pen.
What did Jeremy Corbyn discuss with Obama during the 30 sparse minutes that he got to spend with him?
Do you know?
I think it was global capitalism and the effect on the labour market.
That's not far off, because the subject of their half-hour discussion was:
What, and Cameron had a round of golf?
Well, I think by the time Corbyn had actually said that, his time was up.
Yes, a round of golf.
That was next on his agenda.
This took place just outside Watford.
The President's retinue blended into its surroundings.
Here's the usual convey of Secret Service personnel.
There they are.
And here they are in golf-course mode.
Now, David Cameron and President Obama exchanged gifts.
This is what Obama gave Cameron.
A custom-made Shinola men's watch engraved with the presidential seal.
A bison-leather duffel bag monogrammed with the Prime Minister's initials.
Three cans of US Open tennis balls.
And a pair of sports towels personalised with the UK/US friendship flags.
Whatever they are.
Sports towels?
It's an unsubtle message, isn't it?
It's "get exercising, fatty".
This is what David Cameron gave him.
A volume of the complete works of Shakespeare.
Oh.
That's it.
The only thing I was interested in was, you know...
Boris mentioned this bust of Churchill...
- Oh, that's right.
- ..that Obama had that apparently he claimed
- he'd had removed from his office.
- Yeah.
But I'd be interested in having that if he's not put it back.
Cos I've got a Martin Luther King snow globe I could swap.
Do you know how Churchill's grandson, Nicholas Soames, reacted?
- Do you know what he said?
- He exploded.
- He was angry.
He thought Boris was out of order to take issue with its removal, saying...
- "Bogged it." - "Bogged it." Has anyone here ever bogged it?
Well, let's take a little detour.
How did Ken Livingstone bog it this week?
If I'm using it in the right context.
He came out in defence of someone that the party have now suspended.
Naz Shah, who's an MP, yeah.
Naz Shah, who made some rather unfortunate anti-Semitic posts.
But as she said, it was way back in 2014.
Which is, you know, a world away.
It's like 1932, isn't it?
The suggestion was that he said, apparently, that in 1932 Hitler was saying that he actually was a Zionist.
He thought it was a jolly good idea that he wanted to ship all the Jews... in Germany...to Israel.
But when you're making a speech saying that somebody else isn't an anti-Semite, it's best to keep the words...
"Hitler" and "Jews"...
- away from each other...on the whole.
- How did Ken Livingstone avoid journalists after news of his suspension broke?
Put on a pair of dungarees and went home.
No, he actually did bog it, because he took cover in a disabled toilet... which I'm assuming is the meaning of "bogging it".
I don't know.
There he is... nipping into one.
And he was in there for 20 minutes while journalists shouted questions about Hitler at him.
I watched him being chased up the stairs by Mr Mann and being given a thumping, and he kept smiling.
But it is something when you've got two Labour figures just screaming at each other.
That footage is brilliant.
Disgusting racist!
Rewriting history!
You're a disgusting racist!
- Are you saying it's not true?
- Yes, you're a lying racist!
Really?
Why don't you go and check the history?
A Nazi apologist!
A Nazi apologist!
You're a disgusting Nazi apologist, Livingstone!
Wow!
It's a happy party(!
)
- He's got terribly long legs, you know.
- Who?
Ken Livingstone?
I met him once.
I met him.
I said to him, "You've got disproportionally long legs."
It's a true story.
And he said, "I know."
He probably thought,
"This is the weirdest chat-up line I've ever had."
- "Disproportionately long legs."
- Look at him next time.
- Very long legs.
- DIANE:
- That's true.
I met him.
He does have long legs.
Yeah.
LAUGHTER
- Was that it?
- Was that what?
- All you thought?
- No.
He gave me a mince pie.
This is Barack Obama's visit to the UK.
David Cameron and Barack Obama enjoyed a round of golf together, though even the presidential golf buggy had to be followed by a motorcade of Secret Service men.
Still, they were on a golf course, that's an awful lot of grassy knolls.
Meanwhile, Ken Livingstone has been suspended from the Labour Party for attempting to defend Naz Shah's anti-Semitic comments.
Livingstone said...
I'm not sure whether that was Hitler or Ken.
Teams now, here's another one.
Yes, this is the extraordinary story of Hillsborough.
Kelvin MacKenzie, the editor of the Sun.
Basically, people were demonised.
Football fans in the 1980s were seen as hooligans, drunk the whole time.
There had been lots of pitch invasions, so therefore you had these fences put up.
Ken Bates, the Chelsea chairman wanted to put up electrified fences, I remember...
So this was how people viewed football fans.
The truth of the matter is that amongst these 96 people were working-class people, middle-class people, people from Liverpool, people outside of Liverpool.
And it took 27 years to come out.
Which sort of makes Chilcot look fast.
This is the news that the Hillsborough families had succeeded in their 27-year campaign.
It was celebrated on the front pages of the national press...
The Guardian, the Mirror...
The Star...
The i...
The Telegraph...
And the Sun...
Absolutely no sign of Hillsborough there.
- At all.
- The fact that the Murdoch papers didn't run it because of their embarrassment about having run headlines that said
"The Truth..." And then they got it all wrong and they just fed exactly what the police said to them.
And then they stuck to that line for years.
I mean, there was extraordinary collaboration to make sure
- there was one story put out.
- After the tragedy, 164 police statements submitted to the Justice Taylor report were altered and most of the alterations were to remove criticism of the police operation.
And senior officers' lack of leadership.
If you want to learn more about the findings of the Hillsborough inquest, you can read in-depth analysis on the BBC website and if you want to know less, then read the Sun.
APPLAUSE
And so, to round two, The One-Armed Bandit of News.
Fingers on buzzers, teams.
Bloop!
BUZZER
This is the astronaut in space, Tim Peake, is it?
And 26 miles, he ran round the...
On a little sort of space thing there.
- Do you mean a treadmill?
- Treadmill.
Actually, if he stands still, he does more than 26 miles, cos he's orbiting the earth, so he's...
Yeah, he ran the marathon cos the cameras were on him and he ran and ran and ran and everybody was very happy at the end.
- That's nothing compared to you, is it?
A marathon?
- No.
- You did how many?
- 135 miles.
- Yeah, just like that.
- In an hour...
In an hour?
!
That's fantastic!
Oh, all right...
Were you parachuting out of a plane?
- Seven days.
- Seven days.
- Yes.
- You had sticks?
- I had sticks?
- I saw you with the sticks.
- Oh, yeah, I know, but...
- Were they helpful?
- They are quite helpful but I didn't really use them very much because they make you look like a twat.
No, they really do.
People are thinking, "Is she skiing?
There's no snow, what is she doing?
- It does look like...
- You might have been approaching a giant Chinese meal.
Actually, Tim Peake, he broke a world record for running a marathon in space.
Was he dressed up?
- Tim Peake?
- It seems like he's showing-off, really, you know, he's already in space, why run a marathon?
Yeah, you're right.
How do you even run a marathon in zero gravity?
- He was strapped down so he didn't float away.
- OK.
You mustn't leave the window open.
That's right.
They strapped me to the treadmill but that's cos I kept trying to get away!
Back down here on earth, who slightly undermined Tim's incredible achievement?
All those other people in the marathon.
Yeah, well, there was one man called Martin Hewlett who set the
Guinness World Record for the fastest earth marathon dressed as an astronaut.
Running in a costume that can be dangerously dehydrating, here he is before the race.
That's him in the middle.
Here he is after finishing.
Although, I think in terms of suffering,
I'm not sure anyone beats this guy.
I know what you're thinking, but don't worry, a bloke dressed as Simon of Cyrene came and took it off him soon after.
Have I got my Bible facts right there, Ian?
- Terrific.
- Great to hear a Simon of Cyrene joke.
There've been very few for about 2,000 years!
Simon of Cyrene walks into a pub and says...
"I'll take your pint off you."
Why did this lady, Betty Barker think Tim Peake was drunk last Christmas Eve?
She works in his local pub?
He came in, he said, "I'm going into space next year."
He called her from the Space Station by mistake after getting the wrong number on his space phone when he was trying to call home.
Oh.
She was lucky there was a photographer there to capture the moment.
APPLAUSE
Well, Betty Barker thought he was a drunken reveller looking for a good time.
She's optimistic, old Betty, isn't she?
And she said...
And she said...
- That was quite picky.
- It is a bit.
Extraterrestrials may have been trying to contact us for decades... ..but speak to the wrong people.
Betty Barker fucked it up.
Anyway...
Finally, shall we see how Tim Peake is inspiring a nation of youngsters
- to reach for the stars?
- Absolutely.
Here we go.
- You look like an astronaut - are you going to be an astronaut?
- No.
OK.
Time now for the Odd-One-Out Round.
Your four are a spelling test for schoolchildren,
Bernie Clifton's new album, the Sinner's Bible and the village of Mela Thiruvenkatanathapuram in India.
- That's a...
- APPLAUSE
- Very good.
- Thank you.
Is that the place that's got a railway station where they say, "We're here."
Erm...
So, spelling tests.
Wasn't there something the other week about there were some kids had been given a spelling test they'd already seen?
The real test happened to be exactly the same - is that the story?
- Yes.
- That's that.
OK.
So the Sinner's Bible...
That was an early Bible, where it had a misprint in it.
- Ah, yes.
- And in the Ten Commandments, instead of saying "thou shalt...not kill", they'd left the "not" out.
Was it kill, or adultery?
- That was adultery.
- It was adultery.
That's why people got excited, because...
It said "thou shalt commit".
Did you say Bernie Clifton's got a new album out?
- Yes, he has.
- And what's interesting?
They printed the songs of a death-metal band instead of his own titles.
There must be a spelling mistake in the name of that town then?
- I think I've got it.
- Test for the children, because it's been changed.
- That's the odd one out.
- That is the right answer.
In all the other three cases...
- There have bee...
- A misprint, a mistake.
- Yes, that's right.
Absolutely.
- Whereas, with this town,
- they've got it completely right.
- No, no.
- I said that Paul had got it right.
- What you asking him for?
- You might as well ask the cat.
- I said before he'd got it right.
But between you you've got it, so one point each.
They've all featured misprints, except the spelling test for UK seven-year-olds, which appeared online correctly before the exam took place.
- NICK:
- Ah.
- Do you know how the error was discovered?
- Somebody spotted it.
Correct.
A primary school teacher noticed that...
One would hope that at least one of them would.
Where do they get this knowledge from?
And we've already mentioned the mix-up at the launch of veteran entertainer Bernie Clifton's new album.
Can you explain why he's on an ostrich?
- That was his act.
Those aren't his legs.
- No.
No, don't give it away!
The magic is spilling out.
You're making me feel stupid now.
Bernie's album's been misprinted with a track listing, as you said, of the new album belonging to death-metal band Abhorrent Decimation.
Cheery Bernie Clifton said...
Well, not to your face, mate.
Bernie's trying to relaunch his career, but with one big difference - what is it?
- He's not doing the ostrich any more?
- That's right, he's ditched it.
- Really?
- Mm.
And he says this...
But you kept giving to them, Bernie - you whore.
Time now for the Missing Words Round, which this week features as its guest publication Deposits Magazine.
The magazine of rocks, fossils and geology.
Which, when it comes to its own content, can't always make its mind up...
And we start with...
Knock Keith Chegwin's confidence.
This is the story of Reza Beluchi, who attempted to walk across the ocean from Florida to Bermuda in a large inflatable plastic bubble.
After being rescued by the coastguard,
Beluchi popped the bubble and stepped out of it, saying,
"I feel like I've really let myself down."
I think it was "the dinosaurs died out", but I heard they "dined out for no apparent reason".
No.
It is, in fact...
Brexit.
- Exactly.
The dinosaurs' departure...
- Tyrannosaurus Brexit!
AUDIENCE GROANS Thank you very much indeed.
APPLAUSE
Finally...
- Nick:
- Chokes.
Is it there's nothing missing? "Man with giant foot"?
- No, there is.
It's...
- Yeah?
A traffic warden in South London ticketed a giant foot that parked outside Balham Tube Station.
Here's the traffic warden giving the foot a parking ticket.
To be fair, the foot had just broken down and it was waiting for a "toe truck".
So, the final scores are -
Paul and Nick have 5, but Ian and Diane have 7.
APPLAUSE
But before we go, there's just time for the caption competition.
Bet you a quid I can lose my hand.
Don't put your keys in me
- I'm not a handbag yet!
On which note, we say thank you to our panellists,
Ian Hislop and Diane Morgan, Paul Merton and Nick Hewer.
And I leave you with news that, after drastic budget cuts, it looks like the next StarWars movie could be a little disappointing.
In Cambridge, a long-running feud in the council traffic department escalates to full-on civil war.
And in Glasgow, there's terror as the police are called in to identify a mysterious and suspicious package.
Goodnight!
APPLAUSE
On the ground!
Get on the ground!
Now!
Get on the ground!
No...
Open the register.
Give me the cash.
Okay, okay, okay.
GUNMAN:
Give me it!
Get down!
GUNMAN:
Open it!
Open the register.
I'm going as fast as I can.
Well, go a little faster!
CASHIER:

Yeah, well, I have a family, too, okay?
And I'm gonna count to three, and if that cash register isn't open,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your head.
One!
CASHIER:

Don't shoot!

Holster your weapons.
MAN:
Let's reset.
Okay... so... what went wrong with this exercise?
All due respect for the new training guidelines,
Sergeant Langley, this was a must-shoot situation.
But Janko didn't shoot, did she?
I had a better angle to see everything.
It was a no-win scenario.
It happens.
Sometimes we can't control all the factors, but we can control ourselves.

Aw, thank you for coming tonight, Henry.
You're the best.
Nah, that would be you, Tim.

Congratulations, Tim.
You made it.
Commissioner,
Ms. Reagan, good of you to attend.
Wouldn't have missed it.

I would have stayed a little bit longer if you let me...
Mandatory retirement applies to everyone, Tim.

Except the commissioner.
HENRY:
I hear you're going to Florida?
Sunshine and golf courses, that's all they got where I'm headed, Henry.
You're welcome anytime.
I never figured you for a snowbird.
Yeah, me neither.
I thought I'd stay in New York until they planted me beneath it, but times have changed.
And the winters aren't getting any warmer.
No, it's not the cold.
I'm taking Amy away from all of this.
City's going to hell in a hand basket.
Well, we'll miss your head and shoulders in the cause, Tim.
It's a lost cause now.
The good guys are the ones getting chased out.
I'm sure you're in the minority thinking that.
Ooh, I am in the minority, you are right there.
When I first came on the job, and you were the boss of bosses?
That was a totally different time.
We got a damn good commissioner running the show now.
But... he's a little too caught up in politics and appeasement to take off the gloves and do what needs doing, you ask me.
Sounds like you needed the change.
Right.
Thanks for your service, Lieutenant.
And don't let the door hit you in the ass

Thank you.
It's the truth.
Your scores in every category are off the charts.
How long you been on patrol with Reagan?
About two years.
So, you ready for a move up?
I like where I am for now.
Look, the NYPD needs people like you in higher profile positions.
There's a push to improve community relations.
I feel like I do that every day.
It's a drop in the bucket compared to what you could be accomplishing with a little more visibility.
I can tell you have the right touch.
I'm not sure what kind of touch that is.
(chuckles) Let's get real.
You have the potential to do big things in this department, but being partnered with a Reagan is holding you back.
Why is that?
The PC can't afford to be seen as favoring his son's partner.
You need another hook.
You?
There's nothing wrong with having ambition.

I know.
So?

Oh, she's great.
Thank you so much.
Oh, happy to help.
Forgotten, but not gone.
How was Harrison's racket?
Lively, but not a moment too soon.
What do you mean?
His sell-by date as a reliably good cop had long passed.
Yet, you let him stay on till the end.
I kept a close eye on.
He stayed out of trouble.
Since when is that your criteria for keeping a man on the job?
Since the man was one of my father's favorites.
And a very good man...
with a blind spot.
So, what do we got?
We're starting to get calls on the two males shot on the D train last night.
How do you want this to go out?
Ah...
Sid said he's on his way up about that.
He couldn't put it in an e-mail?
He said an e-mail wouldn't do.
Hey.
Those two shot on the subway last night are still in intensive care.
But you didn't come up here for that.
Well, we're still piecing some of this together, but apparently the first victim was a lush worker with a record, robbing a passed out drunk.
He sliced open his pocket with a razor, took his wallet.
Witnesses say the drunk woke up and shot him.
And?
There was another kid close by-- he got shot as well, but we don't know what his role was.
But the first victim still had the wallet on him.
It was Tim Harrison's wallet.
What?
We call that burying the lead.
And I call it...
I still can't believe it.
(sighs)
Were both shooting victims black?
Yeah.
GARRETT:
And the shooter was white, and a cop.
Did the witnesses identify Tim as the shooter?
They all picked his photo from the array.
And they said he fired again when the perps scattered.
Any idea where he is now?
In the wind, with a gun and no wallet.
Friends, family?
Canvassing everybody.
No hits yet.
How do you want this to go?
Tim was a decorated and respected member of this department.
He's entitled to the presumption of innocence until proven otherwise.
Witnesses saw him shooting up a subway car.
And we have a man who has Tim's wallet.
I don't think Tim gave it to him.
I'm just saying...
Put out a picture and a description.
We're not trying him right now, we're just trying to find him.
You want to tell me what's really going on?
I said I didn't want to talk about it.
Come on, you casually say you saw a murder when you were ten-years-old, and now you want to just drop it, just like that?
Yeah.
What, you gonna smack me upside the head until I tell you?
What happened?
It was, like, 25 years ago.
My mother sent me out to get some milk from the bodega across the street and...
I saw something I wasn't supposed to see.
You do realize that I'm your partner, right, Baez?
Come on.
That guy we saw, Octavio Nunez... (sighs) ...I saw him curb-stomping someone to death right in the middle of the street.
Someone you knew?
A friend?
A boy I liked.
Everyone called him Gabo.
He was the first person I knew who thought I could make it out of the hood.
And you saw him get killed.
(sighs)
Any idea why?
You can't be the only witness.
Other people were looking out their windows, they're just too scared.
Octavio was young, but he already had a rep as an enforcer with the local crew.
I was scared, too.
I locked eyes with him, and I never said anything.
(sighs)
So, he was never charged.
He disappeared about a month later, and no one ever talked about it.
Gabo's mother put flowers on the spot where it happened every year until she died.
Sorry.
Well, you know, this Octavio guy is back in the neighborhood.
I mean, he must be up to something.
We can pinch him now.
No, just-just let it go, Danny, okay?
I still have family on that block.
Come on, there's no statute of limitations on murder.
I'm asking you to let it go, okay?
It's not your family that still lives there.
Okay, each team take one, pass them along.
Lieutenant Harrison was a member of this department, but right now we have to treat him like any other armed perp.
If you see him, approach with caution, and request an 85 forthwith.
Moving on, we're continuing our training assignments.
As most of you know, this precinct is a testing ground for the new community policing model.
You'll each be getting turns to ride with me.
That's all for today.
Roll call dismissed.
Janko.
You ready?
Oh, I meant to tell you before roll call
I won't be on patrol today.
Everything all right?
Yeah, I have a court appearance tomorrow.
I thought I mentioned it.
ADA wants me in for trial prep.
All right, Reagan, looks like it's just me and you.
Janko, I'll catch you next time.
Talk to you later, okay?
Sure.
(phone ringing nearby)
Reagan, you are looking at my personnel file.
I was not.
I mean, I am, but I'm just looking at places you used to live, that's all.
So you can get more information on the murder I saw.
I thought we agreed to leave it alone.
No, I didn't agree to anything, okay?
Murder's murder, and this Octavio guy's skated on half a dozen as it is.
Yeah, in Mexico.
And now he's back in town and he's trying to go legit.
Oh, so you've been tracking him, too.
Of course, I have.
You think I haven't been over this a million times in my head?
The only thing I know is nobody becomes a cop to forget about witnessing a homicide, okay?
This thing is gonna haunt you until you put it down, Baez.
Or until you put it down and stop torturing me with it.
You're torturing yourself.
You know you're down for this.
Come on, let's nail this son of a bitch.
All right, I'm in.
Good.
You gonna let up on me now?
Not a chance.
Hey, uh, w-what happened today?
Why'd you duck your turn with Langley?
I told you I had to get ready for court.
Yeah, you guys went out after training the other night.
Did, uh, something happen?
It doesn't matter.
Eddie, Eddie.
He try to put a move on you or something?
It's all good.
I-I handled it.
What'd he do?
It was nothing.
(inhales)
Uh, he kissed me.
We both had had a lot to drink and I was not... completely blameless.
What are you telling me?
Look, Jamie, I really don't want this to get around, and I'd really like it if you didn't say anything.
Hey...
He's your superior officer.
You telling me you wanted this?
Jamie, I can handle my business.
You need to stay out of this, okay?
Please.
I'm sorry I said anything to you.
Go.
Witnesses confirm the second kid who got shot was just trying to break up the robbery.
Great.
Still no sign of Tim.
We're pinging his cell phone.
We put an alert over NLETS to law enforcement nationwide.
The guy's got no wallet.
He must be reaching out to friends, family.
Turns out he's been separated from his wife for over a year.
Amy has not heard a word from him.
So, all that stuff about heading south together was just wishful thinking.
Boss, the Tim Harrison I knew, apparently he's--
I don't know-- he just hasn't been himself for awhile.
Or maybe the self he really is, he kept a lid on till last night.
Point taken, sir.
You've got a call coming through.
It's Lieutenant Harrison.
I've got TARU tracing it.
(exhales)
Thank you, Baker.
Sit down.
Tim.
Don't bother tracing this call, Frank.
I'll be gone before you get here.
(sighs)
You know you need to turn yourself in.
They were both good shootings, Frank.
The one black kid had a blade, the other was backing him up.
I shot in self-defense.
That's for a grand jury to decide.
You would have done the same thing-- any cop would have.
You will have your day in court, you have my word.
Your word?
I served your father with distinction for 20 years.
You shipped me out to Staten Island the day he left the building.
This has got nothing to do with that.
Of course it does.
The city is going back to the wolves 'cause you tied the hands of the people that saved it.
Tim,
I am about an inch away from having to attach
"armed and dangerous" to the bulletin with your name and picture on it.
Don't make me do that.
Come in.
Come home.
I'll tell you what, Frank.
You do what you have to do, 'cause I'm gonna do what I have to.
(water splashing)
We didn't get it.
(siren wailing)
MAN:
Hey, Maria. ¿Qué pasa?
WOMAN:
Hola, Maria. ¿Qué tal?
It's the street I grew up on.
Mm, also the street where Gabo was murdered.
Yeah, that was then, this is now.
You Detective Foster?
You the guys called about Octavio Nunez?
Yeah, what's the story here?
It looks like an arson and explosives job.
Yeah, Octavio is moving his drug profits into real estate.
The building he was trying to buy just happened to have a gas explosion last night.
Let me guess, negotiations had stalled.
Yeah, fire marshals said it looks like the gas line was deliberately cut.
The property will sell for a song now.
That's how Octavio rolls.
Word is he stomped a boy named Gabriel Montoya to death on this street.
A couple dozen people looking out their windows, no one said anything.
DANNY:
Think anybody on the block will talk about what's going on with him nowadays?
(scoffs) Would you, if you just saw one of your neighbor's buildings blow up?
Hey, you can't blame them.
People got to live.
The point of this training is not to escalate little problems into big problems for the sake of running up numbers.
No one needs to get shot to death over driving with a broken taillight.
Isn't that just common sense?
If it was that common, everyone would have it.
What's up with you, Reagan?
You've had an attitude all morning.
Nothing, I'm just focusing on the training.
This to do with Janko?
She say something to you?
Why would she?
I've seen how you are with her at the precinct.
You two just partners?
Why do you want to know, are you interested in her?
You have first dibs?
Hey, you know what, we're partners.
Otherwise... (chuckles)
So, I heard you two had a couple drinks the other night.
She say anything to you about that?
Nah, I just heard it wasn't strictly about the new training guidelines.
She didn't seem to mind too much.
You don't see how that could be a problem?
(laughs):
Hey... if you got in there first, I'll back off.
Otherwise, you snooze, you lose.
Can't be jealous of what you never had.
You're not worried about getting jammed up for harassment?
Why am I feeling like this is turning into an unfriendly conversation?
Just looking out for my partner.
Trust me, she's a big girl.
Yup, yeah, thanks for the update, Sergeant.
Yeah, yeah, you, too.
Bye now.
That about Tim Harrison?
Yeah.
A few scattered sightings, nothing confirmed.
Why didn't you just ask me?
What do you mean?
Why are you using sources when the most informed source there is lives in the same house as you?
Maybe I didn't want to bother you.
Oh, since when has that ever stopped you?
Look, I know you don't like the man or care about what happens to him.
That's not true.
Yes, it is.
I liked him fine.... once.
I just didn't like what he became.
Which was?
Oh, come on, Pop.
We had this discussion years ago when I first transferred him out to Staten Island, expressly because the population of Staten Island is 75% white.
Well, you never put it quite that way.
Oh, sure I did, you just didn't want to hear it.
You saying I'm covering for a bigot?
No, I-I-I've always said Tim did a good job for you.
I knew a Vice Squad detective who walked home one night and found himself thinking every woman he saw was a hooker.
So, he put in for a transfer the next day.
Remember him?
It didn't happen overnight.
I thought about it for weeks.
You caught yourself, corrected yourself.
Tim didn't, so I did it for him.
You think I looked the other way?
No, Pop, I-I wouldn't think that.
I think it was...
kind of... cumulative, and it came to a head after you were gone.
But I got to tell you, when I had him... he was a hammer and every black guy was a nail.
There were complaints, sure, but Tim was a good cop, mechanically.
So, the bosses always found a way to see it his way.
He's innocent until proven otherwise, Francis.
I know that.
Then say it like you mean it.
TIM:
She wants to see me-- just tell her I'm here.
Tell Erin Reagan
OFFICER:
She's aware.
Tim Harrison is down here.
OFFICER:
Everything metal has to go through the machine.
Hey, Tim.
What's going on?
Oh, I told these idiots that I want to see you, and they want to search me like I'm some kind of criminal.
Okay, well, it's standard operating procedure in the courthouse-- you know that, right?
Come on.
Drop it!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Relax!
Relax!
Don't move!
Relax!
Everyone, just take it easy!
Shut up!
ERIN:
Okay, take it easy.
I want Henry down here right now.
Make it happen.
Or what?
I got no beef with you, Ms. Reagan.
Okay, but if you're down here, then you mean to turn yourself in, right?
Yeah, on my terms!
Not on anybody else's!
I didn't come down here to beg for mercy!
Tim, I promise you will get due process.
I am not gonna just take a plea and dummy up.
My side of the story needs to be told.
Okay, okay.
But if you force these officers to shoot you you won't have the opportunity to tell it, right?
How did I get to be the bad guy here?
That's what I don't understand.
I was one of the best of the best.
I know that.
We all know that.
But you need to put the gun down.
Right now, just put the gun down.
I can't be locked up with those animals!
I was a New York City police officer!
I deserve some respect!
Now, you can give me your word as Henry Reagan's granddaughter you're gonna do the right thing.
I give you my word.
(handcuffs jingling)
How you holding up?
(clears throat)
They're keeping out of central booking for now,
But I-I'm headed for the belly of the beast.
What are you hearing from your granddaughter?
You're in deep.
You might have justification for the guy who robbed you, but we have witnesses that say the other guy was trying to intervene on your behalf.
They were both in on it.
Did you get a look at them?
Tim, the other boy doesn't have a record.
Just means he never got caught.
Come on, Henry.
We both know what these people are up to.
This was a public service shooting, end of story.
You're not doing yourself any favors talking that way.
These could be attempted murder charges.
Not if there's still justice left in the system.
If you want my support, you're gonna have to tell me the truth about what happened that night.
I feared for my life.
Period.
You'd had a lot to drink!
That's got nothing to do with anything.
Can you look me in the eye and say you didn't just see black and start shooting?
I got to explain this to you, Henry?
Yeah, you do.
I gave my life to this city and the department!
I sacrificed both of my marriages and my relationship with my kids to serve you!
And your son!
I left it all out on the battlefield.
Now I--
I just want to go home.
Did you panic because you saw young black males?
They don't make me panic.
I can show you the medals.
Did you shoot them because you were certain that they'd kill you if they didn't?
I made a stand on that train.
'Cause someone had to say enough.
I got nothing to apologize for!
To you or to anyone.
Every week I'm calling you.
Come have dinner with your mother and your sister.
And now you show up unannounced?
What are you talking about?
I call you all the time.
And I'm here every other Friday.
Today's not Friday.
I was working around the neighborhood.
I thought I'd just drop by.
(chuckles)
But you never "just drop by."
Ana.
No, no, Ma.
She's always been squirrely.
She's up to something.
We're looking into an old case, which might be connected to a new one.
Why don't I like how that sounds?
Do you remember what happened with Gabo, mami?
I thought we were never gonna talk about that.
Octavio Nunez is back in town.
You know that, don't you?
Of course I know that!
Him and his brothers just bought two buildings on the street.
And probably half the people that are living there are the same people who saw what he did to Gabo that night.
Yeah, and they kept their mouths shut.
Which is why they're still alive.
You know that other building just happened to explode when the owner wouldn't sell low to Octavio?
Why you got to be such a drama queen?
Mami, I need you to talk to those neighbors and get them to open up about what they saw that night.
If we pull together, we can put him away.
Maria, that was a long time ago.
And your sister and I, we still live here.
I can help you find a new place.
I don't want to move!
This is where my life is.
Overlooking a spot where a boy was killed?
How long are we gonna pretend that it never happened?
(exhales)
Then you're selfish.
What?
You heard me.
You want to go after this Octavio, because your conscience is bothering you?
No, Ana, I'm a cop.
Yeah, and you being a cop got our brother killed.
Her only son.
That is not what happened.
Haven't we lost enough already?
Hey.
Hey.
Heard you had some static with Langley in the RMP.
A lot of what he says is right, you know?
Yeah, well, I'm not joining the fan club.
And I think you should resign your membership.
You didn't get into it with him because of me, did you?
He asked me if I had first dibs on you.
Great.
This isn't just about what he did with you, Eddie.
It's about the job.
It doesn't sound that way.
He abused his position with you.
I keep telling you-- this wasn't some sex assault.
It was just a mistake.
Why can't you just leave it alone?
How far did it go?
Do you want a play-by-play?
Did you tell him to stop?
I did.
Just... not immediately.
I'm not very proud of this, but it's not always clear whose fault it is.
Okay, well, you could be lying back on his bed naked.
If you tell him to stop, he needs to stop.
Well, it didn't go that far.
Just only in your imagination.
Well, you can stonewall this all you want, Eddie, but you know what he did is wrong, and you know that's it's probably happened to other people.
All right, I need to get going.
My turn with Ray's coming up.
So, what's the deal with these bunny ears?
Pop.
What?
(Danny chuckles)
Okay, what's this?
Well, when we were setting the table, I overheard Pops and Grandpa talking about how it's not like the old days, when you could just use the bunny ears.
(chuckles)
You care to explain?
It's a myth.
Never really happened.
What was it?
Well, the story goes that back in the good old days, if a perp wouldn't confess, a detective would leave the room and then he'd come back wearing a pair of bunny ears.
And then he would beat the hell out of the perp until he confessed.
Why?
So, in theory, when the perp was on the stand and said, "A detective put on rabbit ears and beat me up," no one would believe him.
That's awesome.
Yeah, well, we don't do it that way anymore.
Well, but maybe we should.
Once in a while, you know, it might do some good.
Unless you care about the Bill of Rights.
HENRY:
Look, the point is the police saved this city because they had a freer hand.
We had more than 2,200 murders in a year.
Everyone forgets that.
No one's forgotten that.
But times change.
Meaning?
Meaning we do not have 2,200 murders a year anymore.
More like 300.
And you don't need to rule with an iron fist to issue a parking ticket.
Yeah, but we weren't hired to be social workers either.
Some of this new training is good, and some of it doesn't work out on the street.
Well, some of it won't work.
But the city isn't a war zone anymore.
No, but any car stop could have a gun under the front seat.
And you got to think that way if you want to get home safe to your family.
Danny, can we not...
Good luck getting the public on your side with that attitude.
It's easy for you to say, up in your cushy office.
Every day is a balancing act.
But that's what we signed up for.
ERIN:
Here's what I know.
You don't make cases with bunny ears or blackjacks anymore.
You make 'em by convincing people to talk.
Fair enough.
That's true.
Well, I'd like to talk about somebody passing those carrots down here.
So now it's okay to be a snitch?
No.
No.
To report a crime, yes.
That's different.
In fact, it's your duty as a citizen.
Well, Sean took my earbuds last week and never gave 'em back.
What?
Sean, as your lawyer, I advise you to take the fifth and pass the potatoes, please.
My partner witnessed a murder out on the street when she was ten.
We just spotted the guy the other day.
He got away with it?
Yeah.
That's a hard case to make after all these years.
Any other witnesses?
No.
None were willing to come forward, and she's afraid because her family still lives in the neighborhood.
Can you get him on anything else?
Well, he's trying to take his business legit, but I'm sure if I put my bunny ears on,
I could come up with something.
I'm sure you can find another angle to use to hang him.
Like when the Feds got Al Capone...
It was on tax evasion.
Right, so look for the little crimes that hide the big crimes.
People don't change that much.

Octavio Nunez.
Octavio Nunez.
You're under arrest.
What's the charge?
Unlawful eviction.
Can't throw your tenants out without proper notice.
(laughter)
Hey, Marco, what is this, a joke?
No, I'm not joking.
I'm dead serious.
Now get your ass up.
Not you, jackass.
Sit down.
No, you hold it right there.
Hell to the no.
It's not going down like that.
No way, no how.
Oh, hell to the yeah, it is, cowboy.
Unless of course you want to do this the hard way.
Cowboy.
What, are you gonna take out your gun and shoot me?
Like the cop on a train, bang-bang?
(shouting indistinctly)
If I shoot you, you'd better believe it'll be justified.
Damas y caballeros!
Silencio!
Shut up!
Este hombre es un...
How do you say "pedophile" in Spanish?
Pedofilo.
...pedofilo!
(indistinct shouting in Spanish)
Cuff him.
Now, I know the rest of you are all law-abiding citizens who don't violate children, Let's go, move.
so we'd appreciate it if you'd step aside so we can escort Mr. Nunez out of here.
This is crazy, and it'll never stand up.
Of course it will.
Get him out of here.
Ladies and gentlemen, the New York Police Department would like to thank you for your cooperation, and Buenas noches.
Hey.
Sergeant, thank you for taking the time.
I know you got a lot on your plate.
This better be serious, Reagan.
I was supposed to be home a half hour ago.
I got us a table inside.
RAY:
What's this about, anyway?
You said you wanted to talk privately.
Hey, Sergeant.
Brenda.
Officer Cropper.
Long time no see.
Right this way, Sergeant.
Hi, Ray.
What's up, Ray?
Officers.
Sergeant Langley.
(chuckles)
What's the deal here, Reagan?
Why don't I give you the seat with the view?
All right, what are you trying to pull?
I'm not trying to pull anything.
You pulled in all these women I've worked with.
Oh, you mean the "Ray-lettes"?
The wha...?
Who calls 'em that?
That's what they call themselves.
See, because once they all got to talking, they realized the one thing that they had in common was that they all felt they'd been pressured to let Ray have his way.
You've been hitting on women in every precinct where you've done training.
I never forced myself on anyone.
They all got in the saddle willingly and enjoyed the ride while it lasted.
You were their training officer.
You were out of line.
I may not be the perfect messenger, but I'm good at my job.
Ask yourself.
Are you trying to take me down because I'm out of line or because you got a thing for Janko?
Officer Eddie Janko is my partner, and that's all there is to it.
Yeah, keep telling yourself that.
So what do you want from me?
I'm thinking you should put in for a transfer.
I hear there's an opening...
on Staten Island.
(scoffs)
DANNY:
Come on.
Stop staring.
It's rude.
Damn, son.
You bring me in like this.
An unlawful eviction.
It's not even worth my money to hire a lawyer.
Couldn't agree with you more.
Though we have other things to talk about.
You remember him?
Nah, I don't know who that is.
Okay.
How about this?
Maybe this will jog your memory.
Is it supposed to?
Yeah.
It's Gabriel Montoya.
You stomped him to death in the middle of the street.
Not me.
Yeah, you.
Got a couple of dozen witnesses who watched you do it from inside their apartments.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So how come I never got locked up for it?
Doesn't that seem strange to you?
Yeah, did seem strange to me.
But then you made the mistake of coming back.
I'm a property owner doing business in my old neighborhood.
Ain't no law against that.
You do realize people aren't afraid of you anymore, and they will come forward now.
And where are they?
You talking about ancient garbage nobody even cares about.
Sit down.
I'm calling your bluff.
Sit down!
Yeah, this is bullcrap.
Unlawful eviction is a misdemeanor.
So give me your worthless little summons and let me go.
Can't do that.
We're not finished yet.
Look out now.
Here comes the heavy artillery.
How you doing, shady lady?
I didn't catch your name before.
What about her?
I never seen her before either.
You're trying that pedofilo business again, huh?
It won't work.
She's not a victim, Octavio.
OCTAVIO:
Oh, yeah?
Then who is she supposed to be?
She's a witness who saw what you did that night.
(scoffs)
She looked you right in the eye.
I know you remember her.
Take another look.
(chuckles)
Take another look!
Look at the photo!
Look at it!
That girl grew up to become a cop.
Girl in the photo is me.
(sighs)
I asked building security to bring him up.
They're on the way.
Did he make a scene?
No, sir, but I told him to take your private elevator, just to be safe.
Thank you, Baker.
He's here.
Let's have him.
Commissioner.
Lieutenant.
I understand you were in the building without an appointment.
Oh, I've got some fliers here to distribute for my, uh, legal defense fundraiser.
I have asked Detective Baker to put together an appropriate e-mail list for you.
I think I'm more effective face-to-face.
This is police headquarters.
We have a strict policy about solicitations.
I got a lot of friends here...
Who I'm sure would love to hear about your cause.
By e-mail.
After 40 years in the department,
I think I have a right...
You do not have the right to hand out fliers like it's Times Square.
Period.
You're even gonna try and derail me getting a fair trial.
No.
Then what else is this?
The way we do things here.
Your way.
(chuckles) As long as I'm in this office, yeah.
(sighs)
Now, you are entitled to a fair trial and I will do everything in my power to make sure you have one.
Oh, you will, huh?
Yeah.
But I would hope you would listen to a piece of advice.
You can knock on every door in this building and catch my people at their most generous, but you will still only have enough to pay a lawyer.
Not the best lawyer, just a lawyer.
I got a damn good defense.
Says you.
Says a prosecutor-- who will be the best prosecutor the DA has-- in this climate?
Not so much.
I'll take my chances.
You shot a kid who was trying to intervene on your behalf.
A kid who's biggest jam up to now was trying to decide between a full ride to Iona or Fordham.
And you shot him in a subway car full of witnesses.
A full half of them black.
Like him.
You're not the judge or the jury.
The district attorney is going to make you a generous offer.
Take the plea.
And you're not my boss anymore, either.
Well, it's just a piece of advice.
Not an order.
Now... the police officer outside will escort you downstairs and out of this building.
For the last time.
(door closes)

Okay, okay, okay.

Open the register.
I'm going as fast as I can.
Well, go a little faster!
I have a family...
Yeah, well, I have a family, too, okay?
And I'm gonna count to three, and if that cash register isn't open,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your head.

Don't shoot!

Please...
Jamie, look out!
Three!
Holster your weapons.
Let's reset.
Okay... so... what went wrong with this exercise?
All due respect for the new training guidelines,
Sergeant Langley, this was a must-shoot situation.
But Janko didn't shoot, did she?
I had a better angle to see everything.
It was a no-win scenario.
It happens.
Sometimes we can't control all the factors, but we can control ourselves.
Janko, nice restraint.

I think it's brave getting up there.
I could never.
I'm with you.
Not me, I got a whole set of tunes I'm gonna sing for my retirement.
Is that a promise or a threat?
There they are, the first family... plus one.
Aw, thank you for coming tonight, Henry.
You're the best.
Nah, that would be you, Tim.
Sid!
Congratulations, Tim.
You made it.
Commissioner,
Ms. Reagan, good of you to attend.
Wouldn't have missed it.
One of the longest serving cops in this department.
I would have stayed a little bit longer if you let me...
Mandatory retirement applies to everyone, Tim.
Except the commissioner.
I hear you're going to Florida?
Sunshine and golf courses, that's all they got where I'm headed, Henry.
You're welcome anytime.
I never figured you for a snowbird.
Yeah, me neither.
I thought I'd stay in New York until they planted me beneath it, but times have changed.
And the winters aren't getting any warmer.
No, it's not the cold.
I'm taking Amy away from all of this.
City's going to hell in a hand basket.
Well, we'll miss your head and shoulders in the cause, Tim.
It's a lost cause now.
The good guys are the ones getting chased out.
I'm sure you're in the minority thinking that.
Ooh, I am in the minority, you are right there.
When I first came on the job, and you were the boss of bosses?
That was a totally different time.
We got a damn good commissioner running the show now.
But... he's a little too caught up in politics and appeasement to take off the gloves and do what needs doing, you ask me.
Sounds like you needed the change.
Right.
Thanks for your service, Lieutenant.
And don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
I think I need a drink with my old pal, Tim.
Come on, buddy, let's go.
Come on.
And a good night to all.
Yeah.
Let's do it.

Ooh, whoa, this has got to be my last one.
We both have day tours tomorrow.
Relax.
You did good today.
Thank you.
It's the truth.
Your scores in every category are off the charts.
How long you been on patrol with Reagan?
About two years.
So, you ready for a move up?
I like where I am for now.
Look, the NYPD needs people like you in higher profile positions.
There's a push to improve community relations.
I feel like I do that every day.
It's a drop in the bucket compared to what you could be accomplishing with a little more visibility.
I can tell you have the right touch.
I'm not sure what kind of touch that is.
Let's get real.
You have the potential to do big things in this department, but being partnered with a Reagan is holding you back.
Why is that?
The PC can't afford to be seen as favoring his son's partner.
You need another hook.
You?
There's nothing wrong with having ambition.
I know.
So?
Take the hand that's offered to you.
Wow.
That was, um...
Really?
Oh, no, I like you!
I like you, I do.
Oh, come on.
I jus...
I jus... you're my training sergeant at my precinct.
We can't do this.
Who's gonna know?
I'm gonna know.
I'm sorry.
I hope that's okay.
Why wouldn't it be?
I don't want it to be weird when we work together.
I'm still good.
Aren't you?
Yeah, sure.
No harm, no foul, right?
I'm just saying, you can't tell me anything about these streets I don't already know.
Yeah, except where to get a decent cup of coffee without spending half your paycheck.
Here.
Excuse me, sir, you seen him?
Uh... nope.
Why don't you take a closer look?
Maybe he's been in here, a customer, you seen him in the neighborhood.
Uh... yeah, no, no.
No, coming up blank.
You seen him in the neighborhood, somewhere around?
Yeah, doesn't ring any bells.
Okay, uh, I'll tell you what.
Uh, post that in the window, okay?
Yeah.
Help us out.
All right.
Hey, where you going?
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
That guy behind me...
It's not our guy.
Doesn't look anything like the sketch.
I know.
When I was ten, I saw that guy stomp a boy to death in front of my building.

Did the sitter work out?
Oh, she's great.
Thank you so much.
Oh, happy to help.
Forgotten, but not gone.
How was Harrison's racket?
Lively, but not a moment too soon.
What do you mean?
His sell-by date as a reliably good cop had long passed.
Yet, you let him stay on till the end.
I kept a close eye on.
He stayed out of trouble.
Since when is that your criteria for keeping a man on the job?
Since the man was one of my father's favorites.
And a very good man...
with a blind spot.
So, what do we got?
We're starting to get calls on the two males shot on the D train last night.
How do you want this to go out?
Ah...
Sid said he's on his way up about that.
He couldn't put it in an e-mail?
He said an e-mail wouldn't do.
Hey.
Those two shot on the subway last night are still in intensive care.
But you didn't come up here for that.
Well, we're still piecing some of this together, but apparently the first victim was a lush worker with a record, robbing a passed out drunk.
He sliced open his pocket with a razor, took his wallet.
Witnesses say the drunk woke up and shot him.
And?
There was another kid close by-- he got shot as well, but we don't know what his role was.
But the first victim still had the wallet on him.
It was Tim Harrison's wallet.
What?
We call that burying the lead.
And I call it...
I still can't believe it.
Were both shooting victims black?
Yeah.
And the shooter was white, and a cop.
Did the witnesses identify Tim as the shooter?
They all picked his photo from the array.
And they said he fired again when the perps scattered.
Any idea where he is now?
In the wind, with a gun and no wallet.
Friends, family?
Canvassing everybody.
No hits yet.
How do you want this to go?
Tim was a decorated and respected member of this department.
He's entitled to the presumption of innocence until proven otherwise.
Witnesses saw him shooting up a subway car.
And we have a man who has Tim's wallet.
I don't think Tim gave it to him.
I'm just saying...
Put out a picture and a description.
We're not trying him right now, we're just trying to find him.
You want to tell me what's really going on?
I said I didn't want to talk about it.
Come on, you casually say you saw a murder when you were ten-years-old, and now you want to just drop it, just like that?
Yeah.
What, you gonna smack me upside the head until I tell you?
What happened?
It was, like, 25 years ago.
My mother sent me out to get some milk from the bodega across the street and...
I saw something I wasn't supposed to see.
You do realize that I'm your partner, right, Baez?
Come on.
That guy we saw, Octavio Nunez I saw him curb-stomping someone to death right in the middle of the street.
Someone you knew?
A friend?
A boy I liked.
Everyone called him Gabo.
He was the first person I knew who thought I could make it out of the hood.
And you saw him get killed.
Any idea why?
You can't be the only witness.
Other people were looking out their windows, they're just too scared.
Octavio was young, but he already had a rep as an enforcer with the local crew.
I was scared, too.
I locked eyes with him, and I never said anything.
So, he was never charged.
He disappeared about a month later, and no one ever talked about it.
Gabo's mother put flowers on the spot where it happened every year until she died.
Sorry.
Well, you know, this Octavio guy is back in the neighborhood.
I mean, he must be up to something.
We can pinch him now.
No, just-just let it go, Danny, okay?
I still have family on that block.
Come on, there's no statute of limitations on murder.
I'm asking you to let it go, okay?
It's not your family that still lives there.
Okay, each team take one, pass them along.
Lieutenant Harrison was a member of this department, but right now we have to treat him like any other armed perp.
If you see him, approach with caution, and request an 85 forthwith.
Moving on, we're continuing our training assignments.
As most of you know, this precinct is a testing ground for the new community policing model.
You'll each be getting turns to ride with me.
That's all for today.
Roll call dismissed.
Janko.
You ready?
Oh, I meant to tell you before roll call
I won't be on patrol today.
Everything all right?
Yeah, I have a court appearance tomorrow.
I thought I mentioned it.
ADA wants me in for trial prep.
All right, Reagan, looks like it's just me and you.
Janko, I'll catch you next time.
Talk to you later, okay?
Sure.
Reagan, you are looking at my personnel file.
I was not.
I mean, I am, but I'm just looking at places you used to live, that's all.
So you can get more information on the murder I saw.
I thought we agreed to leave it alone.
No, I didn't agree to anything, okay?
Murder's murder, and this Octavio guy's skated on half a dozen as it is.
Yeah, in Mexico.
And now he's back in town and he's trying to go legit.
Oh, so you've been tracking him, too.
Of course, I have.
You think I haven't been over this a million times in my head?
The only thing I know is nobody becomes a cop to forget about witnessing a homicide, okay?
This thing is gonna haunt you until you put it down, Baez.
Or until you put it down and stop torturing me with it.
You're torturing yourself.
You know you're down for this.
Come on, let's nail this son of a bitch.
All right, I'm in.
Good.
You gonna let up on me now?
Not a chance.
Hey, uh, w-what happened today?
Why'd you duck your turn with Langley?
I told you I had to get ready for court.
Yeah, you guys went out after training the other night.
Did, uh, something happen?
It doesn't matter.
Eddie, Eddie.
He try to put a move on you or something?
It's all good.
I-I handled it.
What'd he do?
It was nothing.
Uh, he kissed me.
We both had had a lot to drink and I was not... completely blameless.
What are you telling me?
Look, Jamie, I really don't want this to get around, and I'd really like it if you didn't say anything.
Hey...
He's your superior officer.
You telling me you wanted this?
Jamie, I can handle my business.
You need to stay out of this, okay?
Please.
I'm sorry I said anything to you.
Go.
Witnesses confirm the second kid who got shot was just trying to break up the robbery.
Great.
Still no sign of Tim.
We're pinging his cell phone.
We put an alert over NLETS to law enforcement nationwide.
The guy's got no wallet.
He must be reaching out to friends, family.
Turns out he's been separated from his wife for over a year.
Amy has not heard a word from him.
So, all that stuff about heading south together was just wishful thinking.
Boss, the Tim Harrison I knew, apparently he's--
I don't know-- he just hasn't been himself for awhile.
Or maybe the self he really is, he kept a lid on till last night.
Point taken, sir.
You've got a call coming through.
It's Lieutenant Harrison.
I've got TARU tracing it.
Thank you, Baker.
Sit down.
Tim.
Don't bother tracing this call, Frank.
I'll be gone before you get here.
You know you need to turn yourself in.
They were both good shootings, Frank.
The one black kid had a blade, the other was backing him up.
I shot in self-defense.
That's for a grand jury to decide.
You would have done the same thing-- any cop would have.
You will have your day in court, you have my word.
Your word?
I served your father with distinction for 20 years.
You shipped me out to Staten Island the day he left the building.
This has got nothing to do with that.
Of course it does.
The city is going back to the wolves 'cause you tied the hands of the people that saved it.
Tim,
I am about an inch away from having to attach
"armed and dangerous" to the bulletin with your name and picture on it.
Don't make me do that.
Come in.
Come home.
I'll tell you what, Frank.
You do what you have to do, 'cause I'm gonna do what I have to.
We didn't get it.
Hey, Maria. ¿Qué pasa?
Hola, Maria. ¿Qué tal?
It's the street I grew up on.
Mm, also the street where Gabo was murdered.
Yeah, that was then, this is now.
You Detective Foster?
You the guys called about Octavio Nunez?
Yeah, what's the story here?
It looks like an arson and explosives job.
Yeah, Octavio is moving his drug profits into real estate.
The building he was trying to buy just happened to have a gas explosion last night.
Let me guess, negotiations had stalled.
Yeah, fire marshals said it looks like the gas line was deliberately cut.
The property will sell for a song now.
That's how Octavio rolls.
Word is he stomped a boy named Gabriel Montoya to death on this street.
A couple dozen people looking out their windows, no one said anything.
Think anybody on the block will talk about what's going on with him nowadays?
Would you, if you just saw one of your neighbor's buildings blow up?
Hey, you can't blame them.
People got to live.
The point of this training is not to escalate little problems into big problems for the sake of running up numbers.
No one needs to get shot to death over driving with a broken taillight.
Isn't that just common sense?
If it was that common, everyone would have it.
What's up with you, Reagan?
You've had an attitude all morning.
Nothing, I'm just focusing on the training.
This to do with Janko?
She say something to you?
Why would she?
I've seen how you are with her at the precinct.
You two just partners?
Why do you want to know, are you interested in her?
You have first dibs?
Hey, you know what, we're partners.
Otherwise...
So, I heard you two had a couple drinks the other night.
She say anything to you about that?
Nah, I just heard it wasn't strictly about the new training guidelines.
She didn't seem to mind too much.
You don't see how that could be a problem?
Hey... if you got in there first, I'll back off.
Otherwise, you snooze, you lose.
Can't be jealous of what you never had.
You're not worried about getting jammed up for harassment?
Why am I feeling like this is turning into an unfriendly conversation?
Just looking out for my partner.
Trust me, she's a big girl.
Yup, yeah, thanks for the update, Sergeant.
Yeah, yeah, you, too.
Bye now.
That about Tim Harrison?
Yeah.
A few scattered sightings, nothing confirmed.
Why didn't you just ask me?
What do you mean?
Why are you using sources when the most informed source there is lives in the same house as you?
Maybe I didn't want to bother you.
Oh, since when has that ever stopped you?
Look, I know you don't like the man or care about what happens to him.
That's not true.
Yes, it is.
I liked him fine.... once.
I just didn't like what he became.
Which was?
Oh, come on, Pop.
We had this discussion years ago when I first transferred him out to Staten Island, expressly because the population of Staten Island is 75% white.
Well, you never put it quite that way.
Oh, sure I did, you just didn't want to hear it.
You saying I'm covering for a bigot?
No, I-I-I've always said Tim did a good job for you.
I knew a Vice Squad detective who walked home one night and found himself thinking every woman he saw was a hooker.
So, he put in for a transfer the next day.
Remember him?
It didn't happen overnight.
I thought about it for weeks.
You caught yourself, corrected yourself.
Tim didn't, so I did it for him.
You think I looked the other way?
No, Pop, I-I wouldn't think that.
I think it was...
kind of... cumulative, and it came to a head after you were gone.
But I got to tell you, when I had him... he was a hammer and every black guy was a nail.
There were complaints, sure, but Tim was a good cop, mechanically.
So, the bosses always found a way to see it his way.
He's innocent until proven otherwise, Francis.
I know that.
Then say it like you mean it.
She wants to see me-- just tell her I'm here.
Tell Erin Reagan
She's aware.
Tim Harrison is down here.
Everything metal has to go through the machine.
Hey, Tim.
What's going on?
Oh, I told these idiots that I want to see you, and they want to search me like I'm some kind of criminal.
Okay, well, it's standard operating procedure in the courthouse-- you know that, right?
Come on.
Drop it!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Relax!
Relax!
Don't move!
Relax!
Everyone, just take it easy!
Shut up!
Okay, take it easy.
I want Henry down here right now.
Make it happen.
Or what?
I got no beef with you, Ms. Reagan.
Okay, but if you're down here, then you mean to turn yourself in, right?
Yeah, on my terms!
Not on anybody else's!
I didn't come down here to beg for mercy!
Tim, I promise you will get due process.
I am not gonna just take a plea and dummy up.
My side of the story needs to be told.
Okay, okay.
But if you force these officers to shoot you you won't have the opportunity to tell it, right?
How did I get to be the bad guy here?
That's what I don't understand.
I was one of the best of the best.
I know that.
We all know that.
But you need to put the gun down.
Right now, just put the gun down.
I can't be locked up with those animals!
I was a New York City police officer!
I deserve some respect!
Now, you can give me your word as Henry Reagan's granddaughter you're gonna do the right thing.
I give you my word.
How you holding up?
They're keeping out of central booking for now,
But I-I'm headed for the belly of the beast.
What are you hearing from your granddaughter?
You're in deep.
You might have justification for the guy who robbed you, but we have witnesses that say the other guy was trying to intervene on your behalf.
They were both in on it.
Did you get a look at them?
Tim, the other boy doesn't have a record.
Just means he never got caught.
Come on, Henry.
We both know what these people are up to.
This was a public service shooting, end of story.
You're not doing yourself any favors talking that way.
These could be attempted murder charges.
Not if there's still justice left in the system.
If you want my support, you're gonna have to tell me the truth about what happened that night.
I feared for my life.
Period.
You'd had a lot to drink!
That's got nothing to do with anything.
Can you look me in the eye and say you didn't just see black and start shooting?
I got to explain this to you, Henry?
Yeah, you do.
I gave my life to this city and the department!
I sacrificed both of my marriages and my relationship with my kids to serve you!
And your son!
I left it all out on the battlefield.
Now I--
I just want to go home.
Did you panic because you saw young black males?
They don't make me panic.
I can show you the medals.
Did you shoot them because you were certain that they'd kill you if they didn't?
I made a stand on that train.
'Cause someone had to say enough.
I got nothing to apologize for!
To you or to anyone.
Every week I'm calling you.
Come have dinner with your mother and your sister.
And now you show up unannounced?
What are you talking about?
I call you all the time.
And I'm here every other Friday.
Today's not Friday.
I was working around the neighborhood.
I thought I'd just drop by.
But you never "just drop by."
Ana.
No, no, Ma.
She's always been squirrely.
She's up to something.
We're looking into an old case, which might be connected to a new one.
Why don't I like how that sounds?
Do you remember what happened with Gabo, mami?
I thought we were never gonna talk about that.
Octavio Nunez is back in town.
You know that, don't you?
Of course I know that!
Him and his brothers just bought two buildings on the street.
And probably half the people that are living there are the same people who saw what he did to Gabo that night.
Yeah, and they kept their mouths shut.
Which is why they're still alive.
You know that other building just happened to explode when the owner wouldn't sell low to Octavio?
Why you got to be such a drama queen?
Mami, I need you to talk to those neighbors and get them to open up about what they saw that night.
If we pull together, we can put him away.
Maria, that was a long time ago.
And your sister and I, we still live here.
I can help you find a new place.
I don't want to move!
This is where my life is.
Overlooking a spot where a boy was killed?
How long are we gonna pretend that it never happened?
Then you're selfish.
What?
You heard me.
You want to go after this Octavio, because your conscience is bothering you?
No, Ana, I'm a cop.
Yeah, and you being a cop got our brother killed.
Her only son.
That is not what happened.
Haven't we lost enough already?
Hey.
Hey.
Heard you had some static with Langley in the RMP.
A lot of what he says is right, you know?
Yeah, well, I'm not joining the fan club.
And I think you should resign your membership.
You didn't get into it with him because of me, did you?
He asked me if I had first dibs on you.
Great.
This isn't just about what he did with you, Eddie.
It's about the job.
It doesn't sound that way.
He abused his position with you.
I keep telling you-- this wasn't some sex assault.
It was just a mistake.
Why can't you just leave it alone?
How far did it go?
Do you want a play-by-play?
Did you tell him to stop?
I did.
Just... not immediately.
I'm not very proud of this, but it's not always clear whose fault it is.
Okay, well, you could be lying back on his bed naked.
If you tell him to stop, he needs to stop.
Well, it didn't go that far.
Just only in your imagination.
Well, you can stonewall this all you want, Eddie, but you know what he did is wrong, and you know that's it's probably happened to other people.
All right, I need to get going.
My turn with Ray's coming up.
So, what's the deal with these bunny ears?
Pop.
What?
Okay, what's this?
Well, when we were setting the table, I overheard Pops and Grandpa talking about how it's not like the old days, when you could just use the bunny ears.
You care to explain?
It's a myth.
Never really happened.
What was it?
Well, the story goes that back in the good old days, if a perp wouldn't confess, a detective would leave the room and then he'd come back wearing a pair of bunny ears.
And then he would beat the hell out of the perp until he confessed.
Why?
So, in theory, when the perp was on the stand and said, "A detective put on rabbit ears and beat me up," no one would believe him.
That's awesome.
Yeah, well, we don't do it that way anymore.
Well, but maybe we should.
Once in a while, you know, it might do some good.
Unless you care about the Bill of Rights.
Look, the point is the police saved this city because they had a freer hand.
We had more than 2,200 murders in a year.
Everyone forgets that.
No one's forgotten that.
But times change.
Meaning?
Meaning we do not have 2,200 murders a year anymore.
More like 300.
And you don't need to rule with an iron fist to issue a parking ticket.
Yeah, but we weren't hired to be social workers either.
Some of this new training is good, and some of it doesn't work out on the street.
Well, some of it won't work.
But the city isn't a war zone anymore.
No, but any car stop could have a gun under the front seat.
And you got to think that way if you want to get home safe to your family.
Danny, can we not...
Good luck getting the public on your side with that attitude.
It's easy for you to say, up in your cushy office.
Every day is a balancing act.
But that's what we signed up for.
Here's what I know.
You don't make cases with bunny ears or blackjacks anymore.
You make 'em by convincing people to talk.
Fair enough.
That's true.
Well, I'd like to talk about somebody passing those carrots down here.
So now it's okay to be a snitch?
No.
No.
To report a crime, yes.
That's different.
In fact, it's your duty as a citizen.
Well, Sean took my earbuds last week and never gave 'em back.
What?
Sean, as your lawyer, I advise you to take the fifth and pass the potatoes, please.
My partner witnessed a murder out on the street when she was ten.
We just spotted the guy the other day.
He got away with it?
Yeah.
That's a hard case to make after all these years.
Any other witnesses?
No.
None were willing to come forward, and she's afraid because her family still lives in the neighborhood.
Can you get him on anything else?
Well, he's trying to take his business legit, but I'm sure if I put my bunny ears on,
I could come up with something.
I'm sure you can find another angle to use to hang him.
Like when the Feds got Al Capone...
It was on tax evasion.
Right, so look for the little crimes that hide the big crimes.

Octavio Nunez.
Octavio Nunez.
You're under arrest.
What's the charge?
Unlawful eviction.
Can't throw your tenants out without proper notice.
Hey, Marco, what is this, a joke?
No, I'm not joking.
I'm dead serious.
Now get your ass up.
Not you, jackass.
Sit down.
No, you hold it right there.
Hell to the no.
It's not going down like that.
No way, no how.
Oh, hell to the yeah, it is, cowboy.
Unless of course you want to do this the hard way.
Cowboy.
What, are you gonna take out your gun and shoot me?
Like the cop on a train, bang-bang?
If I shoot you, you'd better believe it'll be justified.
Damas y caballeros!
Silencio!
Shut up!
Este hombre es un...
How do you say "pedophile" in Spanish?
Pedofilo.
...pedofilo!
Cuff him.
Now, I know the rest of you are all law-abiding citizens who don't violate children, Let's go, move.
so we'd appreciate it if you'd step aside so we can escort Mr. Nunez out of here.
This is crazy, and it'll never stand up.
Of course it will.
Get him out of here.
Ladies and gentlemen, the New York Police Department would like to thank you for your cooperation, and Buenas noches.
Hey.
Sergeant, thank you for taking the time.
I know you got a lot on your plate.
This better be serious, Reagan.
I was supposed to be home a half hour ago.
I got us a table inside.
What's this about, anyway?
You said you wanted to talk privately.
Hey, Sergeant.
Brenda.
Officer Cropper.
Long time no see.
Right this way, Sergeant.
Hi, Ray.
What's up, Ray?
Officers.
Sergeant Langley.
What's the deal here, Reagan?
Why don't I give you the seat with the view?
All right, what are you trying to pull?
I'm not trying to pull anything.
You pulled in all these women I've worked with.
Oh, you mean the "Ray-lettes"?
The wha...?
Who calls 'em that?
That's what they call themselves.
See, because once they all got to talking, they realized the one thing that they had in common was that they all felt they'd been pressured to let Ray have his way.
You've been hitting on women in every precinct where you've done training.
I never forced myself on anyone.
They all got in the saddle willingly and enjoyed the ride while it lasted.
You were their training officer.
You were out of line.
I may not be the perfect messenger, but I'm good at my job.
Ask yourself.
Are you trying to take me down because I'm out of line or because you got a thing for Janko?
Officer Eddie Janko is my partner, and that's all there is to it.
Yeah, keep telling yourself that.
So what do you want from me?
I'm thinking you should put in for a transfer.
I hear there's an opening...
on Staten Island.
Come on.
Stop staring.
It's rude.
Damn, son.
You bring me in like this.
An unlawful eviction.
It's not even worth my money to hire a lawyer.
Couldn't agree with you more.
Though we have other things to talk about.
You remember him?
Nah, I don't know who that is.
Okay.
How about this?
Maybe this will jog your memory.
Is it supposed to?
Yeah.
It's Gabriel Montoya.
You stomped him to death in the middle of the street.
Not me.
Yeah, you.
Got a couple of dozen witnesses who watched you do it from inside their apartments.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So how come I never got locked up for it?
Doesn't that seem strange to you?
Yeah, did seem strange to me.
But then you made the mistake of coming back.
I'm a property owner doing business in my old neighborhood.
Ain't no law against that.
You do realize people aren't afraid of you anymore, and they will come forward now.
And where are they?
You talking about ancient garbage nobody even cares about.
Sit down.
I'm calling your bluff.
Sit down!
Yeah, this is bullcrap.
Unlawful eviction is a misdemeanor.
So give me your worthless little summons and let me go.
Can't do that.
We're not finished yet.
Look out now.
Here comes the heavy artillery.
How you doing, shady lady?
I didn't catch your name before.
What about her?
I never seen her before either.
You're trying that pedofilo business again, huh?
It won't work.
She's not a victim, Octavio.
Oh, yeah?
Then who is she supposed to be?
She's a witness who saw what you did that night.
She looked you right in the eye.
I know you remember her.
Take another look.
Take another look!
Look at the photo!
Look at it!
That girl grew up to become a cop.
Girl in the photo is me.
I asked building security to bring him up.
They're on the way.
Did he make a scene?
No, sir, but I told him to take your private elevator, just to be safe.
Thank you, Baker.
He's here.
Let's have him.
Commissioner.
Lieutenant.
I understand you were in the building without an appointment.
Oh, I've got some fliers here to distribute for my, uh, legal defense fundraiser.
I have asked Detective Baker to put together an appropriate e-mail list for you.
I think I'm more effective face-to-face.
This is police headquarters.
We have a strict policy about solicitations.
I got a lot of friends here...
Who I'm sure would love to hear about your cause.
By e-mail.
After 40 years in the department,
I think I have a right...
You do not have the right to hand out fliers like it's Times Square.
Period.
You're even gonna try and derail me getting a fair trial.
No.
Then what else is this?
The way we do things here.
Your way.
As long as I'm in this office, yeah.
Now, you are entitled to a fair trial and I will do everything in my power to make sure you have one.
Oh, you will, huh?
Yeah.
But I would hope you would listen to a piece of advice.
You can knock on every door in this building and catch my people at their most generous, but you will still only have enough to pay a lawyer.
Not the best lawyer, just a lawyer.
I got a damn good defense.
Says you.
Says a prosecutor-- who will be the best prosecutor the DA has-- in this climate?
Not so much.
I'll take my chances.
You shot a kid who was trying to intervene on your behalf.
A kid who's biggest jam up to now was trying to decide between a full ride to Iona or Fordham.
And you shot him in a subway car full of witnesses.
A full half of them black.
Like him.
You're not the judge or the jury.
The district attorney is going to make you a generous offer.
Take the plea.
And you're not my boss anymore, either.
Well, it's just a piece of advice.
Not an order.
Now... the police officer outside will escort you downstairs and out of this building.
For the last time.

Previously on "frontier..."
You are under arrest.
This is your fault!
Lord benton set up a trap.
And you walked right into it.
You turned your back on me, declan.
You betrayed me,
And you will beg my forgiveness.
I'm looking for lord benton.
Cut him down.
I don't care what he's doing!
Lord benton, sir.
For reasons I don't pretend to comprehend,
You've confined my company to barracks.
And cut our rations.
It's winter.
Rationing is only prudent.
Captain chesterfield's men seem to get ample sustenance.
Do they?
My men are hungry, sir.
If we are to make it to spring,
We must have more food.
Request denied.
Captain benedict johnson died two weeks ago,
And still no inquiry...
Dismissed, commander everton.
Before he was murdered,
You were stripped of your authority.
You, sir, are illegally governing fort james!
Starve me now if you want.
But I will return to england,
And I will report all of this.
I will ensure the full weight of the law.
Comes down on you, sir.
Seize commander everton.
What the hell is this?
Release me at once!
Fifty lashes.
In the yard.
What?
!
Lord benton is deliberately starving those men.
I know.
Then do something.
To confront him now will get me killed.
So you'd be content with a garrison of dead soldiers,
Is that it?
Why do you give a shit about those men?
Because it's an opportunity.
Earn their loyalty.
With their support as well as your own soldiers,
You can arrest benton now.
Now's the time.
Lock lord benton up.
And you are governor.
You'd like that?
Very much.
Good day, captain chesterfield.
My god.
You look terrible.
Where are the others?
I came alone.
I need food.
Ale.
Of course.
But it's not safe for you here.
Christ, if you're seen...
Look, declan, I know why you came back here,
But I'm telling you, you do not need to do it.
Wait!
Benton will self-destruct.
Captain chesterfield will move into the governor's house.
And we will have an advantage.
I made an agreement with chesterfield.
I know how to handle him.
Just please, wait.
If benton lives, nothing will change.
And if you fail?
Look at you, you can hardly breathe.
If you die, what then?
There's a patrol out every day.
They've turned this place over three times.
Are you asking me to leave?
No...
I just...
I need to get you somewhere safer than here.
Come on.
Sokanon, clenna needs to rest.
Harp's sick,
He's been in and out of consciousness.
For over ten days.
He's in terrible condition.
We have to get to fort james before he does anything.
Maybe it's not the best idea to get too close to a man.
If he's sick and crazy.
Yesterday you were begging to be taken back.
Sokanon... she needs to move faster not slower.
I've had enough of your shite, you know that?
Jesus, clenna, don't...
Fuck!
Sokanon!
Get off her, now!
Are you all right?
Ungh!
Maybe both of you need to rest.
There is no way fort james is safe for us.
Is declan harp really worth dying for?
We need to keep moving.
He's cracking up.
He's paranoid.
Scaring the shit out of his own soldiers.
Means he's weak.
It means he's unpredictable.
Let me see.
Jesus.
You can't do it.
Not now.
Not like this.
They're gone, grace.
My family's dead.
Benton tortured them.
Shhh...
It's all right.
Declan?
Declan, you're too hurt to go anywhere.
Now you promise me you'll change your plan.
I've waited so long for you,
You cannot leave me now, not like this.
I'm sorry.
I have to do this.
I have to.
Kill them on sight.
M'lord?
Your patrols.
Should they discover declan harp.
Or any of his consorts,
They are to show no mercy.
That's unwise, sir.
Chesterfield, are you deaf,
Or simply confused?
Lord benton, with respect.
What I'm saying is...
Is given recent events, we might want to avoid.
Any more unwelcome scrutiny from england.
"We do give and grant unto said governor."
The powers to make peace or war.
With any prince or people whatsoever,
"That are not christians."
Michael smyth is irish.
So is the girl.
They won't be missed.
Declan harp's head.
Is to be stuck on the end of a bayonet.
And displayed in the yard.
People must understand there are consequences.
To treachery and treason.
Come on!
We have to keep on moving.
No, I know.
That's right.
Two men arrived when you were gone.
They asked for you.
The one on the right said he received your letter.
Samuel grant.
And malcolm brown came in very drunk.
Asking for captain chesterfield.
What is it with men and fucking revenge?
All right, you keep an eye on brown,
I'll deal with grant.
Welcome to fort james, gentlemen.
You must be samuel grant.
Miss emberly.
You guessed.
Or did someone spoil our surprise?
And...?
Cobbs pond.
At your service.
Is there a place we can speak freely?
There is.
I hope your tastes will not exceed our cellars, mr.
Grant.
Please.
We are not particular.
The stew was exquisite.
I was intrigued by your letter.
"The key to fort james",
I think you described yourself as.
So we decided to make the trek.
And meet my mysterious correspondent.
I had no idea how beautiful she would turn out to be.
If I had known you were coming I'd have been more prepared.
This is a token of my good faith.
I dinnae expect you to reply to my offer in person.
Well, I wanted to see for myself...
Those wonderful furs you wrote so eloquently about.
Not until we have an understanding.
Well, an understanding requires.
That I see what I might buy.
You put me a great risk, sir,
By coming here.
A woman of your enterprise,
I assumed had protection.
A redcoat perhaps,
Hiding underneath your skirts?
In fact, we should present ourselves.
At the governor's house, should we not?
Yes, sir.
Yes.
What business do you have with lord benton?
None.
Never met the man.
Simply a courtesy.
My proposal was confidential.
Can I trust you to be discrete?
I understand that discretion for a woman in your position.
Is paramount.
And that the consequences of discovery.
Would be shattering.
Mr. Grant?
Miss emberly?
There's nothing I don't know about what happens here.
You need me.
Of course.
Declan harp,
Is he in town?
I have not seen him.
A shame.
I was hoping to kill two birds with one stone.
You made your fortune in american pelts.
If I'm not mistaken.
Fortune?
Well, that's an overstatement.
Certainly when compared with the success of the hbc.
Indeed.
Please.
Apologies, that was the last of the moose.
But cook may be able to scrape up some cold rabbit?
We ate at the ale, but thank you.
And what did you make of our miss emberly?
Who's that?
The proprietress.
Yes.
Fine-looking woman.
A whore with more ambition than sense.
Not to be trusted.
Brandy?
Please.
And what brings you north, sir?
Well, sir, I'm a private businessman.
Who believes in identifying and profiting.
From common interests.
And it seems to...
Common interests?
Yes.
You're a competitor.
I'm sure you're aware.
That it is customary for a man of your stature.
To provide a letter of intention.
Before arriving at fort james.
I also believe that things may get misinterpreted.
Through written correspondence,
And if one wants to make new friends.
It must be done in person.
Friends?
Well, if this is a party.
Then perhaps I should pour tea.
Look to the future, sir.
I prefer to learn from history.
To the king.
Mr. Grant,
You and your colleague are accustomed.
To more hospitable southern climes.
I must caution you that here in the north,
Death can be brutal.
And come without warning.
I do hope you understand.
The world you find yourselves in.
I have faced far more formidable circumstances, lord benton,
And not only have I survived,
I found the experience...
Fulfilling.
But I appreciate your concern for our welfare.
It's late.
We are raw from travel.
Perhaps a meeting tomorrow?
I do have a proposition for you.
You yankees always do.
Tomorrow then.
Excuse me?
Time was, as wee boys,
Me and my brother douglas.
Wanted to murder cedric ourselves.
The brown brothers.
One big happy family.
He was my blood but the man was stupid,
Thick as turf.
We were always cleaning up cedric's mess.
Drove us mad.
If your idiot brother is dead.
It's because he deserved it.
You knifed him.
No trial.
Nuthin'.
Get to your point.
I loved my brother,
So I'm going to cut the inside of your leg.
So you bleed like a pig in a butcher shop.
Then I'm going to slice open your guts.
And shove them down your throat.
And when that's done,
I'll crack your skull.
And piss on your brains.
Is that pointed enough for ya?
Captain chesterfield?
Jonathan.
Malcolm brown is drunk and he's grieving.
I'm going to gut him like I gutted his brother.
You want to be governor?
Don't get caught up in that nonsense.
Keep your focus -
And your focus is benton.
There's been a development.
What sort of development?
I sent a letter to montreal.
Offering to sell samuel grant our stolen furs.
A letter?
Without informing me?
The issue is that he's here.
At the fort.
Jesus christ!
He showed up with some thug.
They're over at the governor's house right now.
This is the consequence.
Of you keeping your schemes from me.
You need to discover what they're talking about.
Fine.
I've been thinking about what you said this morning.
And?
And I've had a revelation about what should happen.
Once benton's gone.
And what's that?
You are to become the new governor's wife.
A marriage would be good for business.
No more secrets.
We can plot our next steps without fear of discovery.
And...
Perhaps, in-in time,
We could start a family to share our good fortune with.
Jesus christ.
You're serious.
You're not going to do no better.
I'd rather marry malcolm fucking brown.
I could take you right now.
In the state lord benton's in,
I could do so without fear of reprisal.
But, I suspect you would prefer the warmth and security.
Of a governor's feather bed.
Yeah?
We need your help.
All right, come on.
Shhh...
I can't get warm.
Shh!
Have another brandy.
Agh!
Don't leave me!
I'm right here.
You'll die.
I'm not gonna die.
I'm not gonna die.
You just killed one man, michael.
That doesn't make you a warrior.
You don't belong here.
Don't throw me overboard for...
For her.
Promise.
Promise me.
We shouldn't wait any longer.
Michael, go get grace.
We need to straighten her leg.
Even then it might be too late.
What happens if it's too late?
We get the saw.
You should drink as much as you can.
This is gonna hurt.
Fuck off, grace memberly, it already hurts.
Shh...
It's all right, it's all right.
Ready?
It's all right, clenna.
You're all right.
The worst is over.
No, it's not.
What?
Why?
It didnae set properly.
We're gonna need to do it again.
No.
Shhh...
His frame of mind is not conducive to your proposal.
Every man is hungry for something -
Food, love, money, power.
To know benton's appetite is to have the upper hand.
Well, the man seems to have an appetite for blood.
'Cause he sees enemies everywhere.
To secure his trust.
We'll have to both validate his paranoia.
And create the illusion of a mutual enemy.
Or we could just kill him.
And negotiate with the next man?
I remain open to all options.
Declare yourself.
Declan harp.
Mr. Harp?
Finally.
Forgive mr.
Pond,
He is zealously dedicated to my protection,
Which I appreciate.
Why are you in fort james?
We're both are committed to the demise of the hbc,
Are we not?
I've come to judge how long before fort james falls,
And, if possible,
To give it a little nudge.
This cause could be advanced considerably.
If you and your people were to trade with me.
You deal only with the black wolf company.
That's reasonable,
Provided you can maintain the volume.
To satisfies my needs.
Yes.
Grace emberly.
When the time comes,
You provide safe passage to montreal.
Or...
Wherever she wants to go.
Done.
Anything else?
Tomorrow, go for a walk with benton in the woods,
Away from as many soldiers as possible.
What do you intend to do?
Bury a knife in his chest and cut off his head.
I respect a man who is straight and fair.
Common interests.
Agreed.
You shouldn't have followed me.
What would you have done if it were me?
Where's michael?
With clenna.
You can't trust grant.
You can't trust anyone.
Grant has as much interest in benton being dead as we do.
Let me go with you and I'll finish this with one arrow.
I have to do this myself.
You don't!
We can't all die...
None of us has to die!
He has taken them from us.
You don't know.
He said things and did things,
That I can't get out of my head.
I have to end him,
For her, nuna,
For my boy, for us.
She wouldn't want this.
Declan, I abandoned everything to follow you.
We have fought side by side all this time.
Please, I don't want this for you.
You are all I have left.
You have michael.
He's ready.
He's not!
Then you keep testing him until he is.
You finish what we started.
You destroy the garrison.
Re-establish trade with the lake walkers...
Machk won't...
Machk will listen to you.
He has to,
Or his people will not survive the winter.
Once I kill benton, you swear to me,
You'll leave his empire in ashes.
Swear to me you'll see to it.
Come here.
So?
What did you want to tell me?
Captain chesterfield has a habit.
Of walking through the fort, alone,
Checking on his patrols and sentries.
Where you and I are standing.
Is the likeliest place you can surprise him.
And avenge your brother's murder.
Where's michael?
Gone.
All right, ladies.
Downstairs.
Time to open up.
How are you feeling, clenna?
It's throbbing.
More brandy?
I feel like I've been in pain.
Ever since I got on the boat that brought me here.
Well, it hasn't killed you.
Must have made you stronger.
Don't feel strong.
Well, it's not many men who can go through.
What you've been through.
And still be talking right now.
You're strong.
You know, we women can take more pain.
In this place,
That's the greatest advantage a person can have.
And because we can take the pain,
You and I,
Yeah, we're capable of things here that...
We would never have thought possible.
And you just let him go?
After killing ourselves to get back here,
After clenna almost lost her fucking leg?
!
Harp trusts you, michael.
Now you have to trust him.
And if he dies?
Well?
I swore I wouldn't follow him.
This is rubbish.
Being loyal to him doesn't mean letting him commit suicide.
I don't expect you to understand.
I'm going after him.
Redcoats cannae resist other people's silver, hey?
Come on!
Come on.
Come on!
This is for my brother, sassanach.
Wait, captain chesterfield!
In god's name, please!
Captain chesterfield, you must stop!
Get out of my fucking way!
You aren't supposed to be here.
I chose to be here.
Beautiful grounds.
Yes, kensington fucking gardens.
Get to your proposition, mr.
Grant, it's cold.
I would like you to take a message back to the hbc.
On my behalf.
Why would I do that?
Because it will make you richer.
A bribe then?
It's an incentive.
Tell them it makes more sense for them.
To trade their furs through montreal.
There's a ready port that's open.
Far longer than fort james.
And you would be our partner there?
Exclusively.
Yes.
Here you have enemies on all sides.
Montreal is safe,
It is immune from native attack;
There are banks,
There are warehouses with abundant coal to heat them.
And men to work in them.
Men the hbc wouldn't have to feed or arm.
You have stones, mr.
Grant.
But if you think I won't cut them off.
And feed them to the ravens you're wrong.
Remember bunker hill, lord benton.
After your so-called "victory",
More than a thousand british dead.
Left in the mud to rot.
Winning a battle when the war is already over -
I don't think that's history you want to repeat, is it?
I don't know you, mr.
Grant.
And I'd be a fool to make such a recommendation.
Based on a walk in the mud.
Lord benton,
If I could say something to you,
Right here, right now, in this minute,
To earn your trust, would you,
As a matter of honor, agree to carry out my request?
Try me.
Declan harp is behind one of these trees,
Preparing to kill you.
Alone?
So I am informed, yes.
Kill the boy!
No!
Go.
Malcolm, stay still.
Praise the almighty,
You shall live through this day, mr.
Brown!
And chesterfield?
Alive.
Thank god?
I'm not finished with him.
God's will and god's miracle.
A miraculous escape from the jaws of death.
Malcolm, stay still!
Give me one good reason.
Why I shouldn't have the pair of you hanged.
Is that how you would reward us for saving your life?
Hang two americans on a trade mission -
The hbc won't be the only ones who start asking questions.
You think your compatriots.
Will start a war in your name?
I'd have thought such a ridiculous bluff beneath you.
Those who know me know I don't bluff, lord benton.
Your company, your king,
They won't want the news of a murderous madman in the north.
To reach their customers and allies.
And if it does,
You can be sure you'll meet your own end at the gallows.
The charter of the hudson's bay company.
Empowers me to raise armies and wage wars.
Against all its enemies.
I am no enemy of the hbc, I am a businessman,
I am a christian.
I am well aware of the company charter.
I will let you live,
But you are to leave fort james immediately.
If I do not receive word of your departure,
Then you will suffer the same fate as declan harp.
And be hanged as conspirators.
You may go.
I look forward to our next encounter.
I saw a gallows being built at the garrison.
Harp will hang tonight.
Then that's when I'll do it.
Do what?
I'll blow up the magazine.
The powder's already there.
A diversion.
When you give harp his last rites,
Slip this into his hands.
Grace, we're gonna need your help as well,
Along with imogen and mary.
Of course.
What do you intend to do about clenna?
Your coat, you need your coat.
I'm not going anywhere.
We don't have time to argue, clenna.
No, I-i can't!
Okay, I want us to be together, but I can't.
What?
I want us to have children.
A home.
A life.
I want that, too.
I can't do that out there, in the forest!
Clenna...
They're gonna kill harp,
And then they'll kill me.
Grace can help us, all right?
We'll make it to spring and then we can go home.
I won't go back to england.
This is where I belong now.
Then...
Goodbye, michael.
Goodbye, clenna.
Through the valley of the shadow of death,
I shall fear no evil.
Your rod and your staff shall comfort me.
All the days of my life.
And I shall dwell in the house of the lord.
In nomine patris, et filii,
Et spiritus sancti,

Fire brigade to the magazine!
We're under attack!
I want men on that ridge.
Right away, sir.
Secure the fort!
Drop him!
Drop him now!
You five with me!
Take lord benton to his house.
Sir, go with these men.
Sir...
In the name of god almighty, stop!
Take him!
Take him!
Go!

Know what photokeratitis is?
How about flash blindness?
The same thing, really.
Both caused by excessive exposure to ultraviolet light.
Cornea burns, unable to handle the light's intensity.
And you temporarily lose your vision.
The theory... pain is only psychological since the retina has no pain receptors.
This particular model was built by Homeland Security to torture prisoners after 9/11.
Unfortunately, it was banned... after some of those fuckers went blind for good.
4x03 - "Job"
Let me the fuck out!
I'll fucking kill you!
Motherfucker, I will fucking kill you!
1 YEAR AGO
Thank you.
Hey, Bunker.
Doctor says you're gonna be all right.
3 MONTHS AGO
Hey.
Hey, hey.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You're safe.
Look at me.
It's okay.
You have a fever.
Your body is fighting off the infection.
I'm gonna lift up your head, okay?
Hold it down.
That's good.
Okay.
That's good.
That's it, swallow.
I'm gonna clean you up a little bit more, okay?
It's gonna sting.
Do you have any idea... what you're even doing?
You're still breathing, aren't you?
You.
You gonna invite us in?
Colonel Stowe may have been crazy, but he was still military and kept meticulous records.
After Genoa, CID seized his files.
I tried everything I could to get my hands on them, but I kept hitting brick walls.
So then she came back to you?
Y'all know busting through walls is my specialty.
Okay, so then you stole the Genoa files from CID?
Don't need to steal when you got the power of persuasion.
Took a little longer than I would have liked.
Finally got to the right record clerk in the Pentagon.
In exchange for me not chopping off his dick, he graciously supplied me with a copy of the files.
There was a list of everyone working on the base that day.
So you compared it to the list of casualties?
One name was unaccounted for.
Private contractor named Leo Fitzpatrick.
I'm guessing you know how to find this Leo?
Of course, soldier boy.
I've never been on my own before.
You're not anymore.
Sir.
- Nina Cruz.
- Send her in.
- Mr. Mayor.
- What is it, Deputy?
The last three guys your district attorney cut loose were all royally fucked up after the fact.
- Vigilante?
- I think it's more than that.
See, all three releases were connected to you.
Whoever the vigilante is, they know you've got the DA in your pocket.
Someone's sending you a message.
Sheriff Lotus.
- What do you think, Deputy?
- I think Brock makes a lot of noise, but he'd never come after you like that.
- Then get me a name.
- It could get messy.
Then you'll clean it up.
You hired me to be your eyes and your ears.
I don't mind doing the cleaning, but that costs more.
Then you better be worth it.
- Sheriff?
- Helen, the damn Internet is broken again.
I'll take a look.
The Bowmans are here to see you.
Oh, shit.
- Shall I bring them upstairs?
- Uh, no.
No, I'll do it.
Try to fix this.
- Mr. and Mrs. Bowman.
- Sheriff.
Would you like to come up to my office and talk?
The county coroner won't release Rebecca's body to us.
Yes, that's true.
Unfortunately, the body can't be released until the coroner has determined an official cause of death.
The funeral must be held immediately.
- I understand.
- This is our way.
It's...
It's been a week since our daughter's passing.
I know, and I assure you my entire department is working day and night on your daughter's case.
You have no right to keep her from us.
- Mrs. Bowman...
- Please, let us put her to rest.
Um...
all right, let me make some calls.
I'll try to move things along, okay?
- I promise.
- Come.
Let's go.
Again, I'm sorry for your loss.
With technology crossing cultural boundaries, computer ethics are virtually intractable.
Why?
Well, how can we set a global standard when cultural relativism makes it impossible?
And by we, I mean they.
And by they, I mean the United States government.
But what they can do is enforce title 18, section 1030.
If you are caught accessing a computer with intent to steal information or damage a network, you will go to jail.
And when you're out, you'll get a six-figure gig as a security analyst.
That's it.
Go home.
I'll see you all next week.
Hey.
That's great.
Go to the next station.
Please stand clear of the doors.
_
- I'm on the train.
- Copy.
I'm on the move.
Next stop, Wallace Street.
What the fuck, bro?
Asshole.
Move!
- He's on the train.
- Copy.
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Move!
About time, soldier boy.
Just get him in the car!
Get the fuck in the car.
Come on, get the fuck in the car!
- Yeah, got him.
- Jesus fucking Christ, come on.
17 MONTHS AGO
- Hi, Kurt.
- Maggie.
- I...
I heard you were back.
- What are you doing here?
- I brought you some groceries.
- Why?
I don't see anyone else lining up to help you out.
I don't need any help.
Yeah, of course you don't.
- Are you gonna let me in?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
I haven't, uh... had time to go through my mail yet.
I called the hospital every week to check on you.
- No one told me.
- I asked them not to.
I-I know that it was Calvin and his goons that did that to you.
Why didn't you report them?
- That you asking or Calvin?
- Don't be an asshole.
You know he'd kill me if he knew I was here.
I want to kill him for what he did to you.
It's...
It's just amazing how two brothers can be so different and so alike at the same time.
I have to get home.
My cell.
If you need anything.
- Oh, shit.
Shit.
Shit.
- What?
Calvin.
What the fuck?
Where the fuck are you?
I can't...
I can't do this, Kurt.
I know.
It's not always gonna be like this.
You think you can still get him out?
No, I don't.
I did.
But after this...
I know there's no coming back for him.
I just need to figure out how to put him away.
That's gonna take some time.
Time's not gonna change anything, Kurt.
What do you want me to do?
Just kill him now.
I can't kill my own brother.
- He's Hank's father.
- Kurt, when I was a little girl, my father poisoned me with fear.
He made sure that I would only ever feel safe if I was with a man just like him.
And I just accepted that.
That that's how things would always be.
And then you came back.
For the first time in my life, I thought things could be different.
But this isn't about me.
I'm terrified that my son is gonna turn out to be just like Calvin and just like my father...
- mean, hateful, violent...
- I won't let that happen.
You have to trust me, Maggie.
I assume there's a good reason why this son of a bitch is still breathing.
Hey, Leo.
Jesus.
Fuck!
Where's Job?
What?
Where's Job?
- Where the fuck is Job?
- I don't know who that is.
Tell me another lie.
Please.
See how this works?
Every time you bullshit us, she's gonna hit you.
When she gets tired, I'm gonna start.
She hits hard.
I hit harder.
You understand?
You took our friend.
We want him back.
Untie me, and I'll think about helping you.
Stop.
The boy can't talk if he ain't conscious.
Now take Nikita to the kitchen.
Give me and Sugar a minute.
Go.
I'm sorry.
You were just doing what we all wanted to.
Just everybody disappeared all at once.
You know?
It's all my fault.
Job knew the risks.
We all did.
I'm not talking about Job.
You know, I spent nearly two years up in those hills blaming myself for everything that happened.
Now, that would have been a big waste of time if this was all your fault.
Everything got so fucked up.
Yeah, it did.
Mr. Fitzpatrick has had a change of heart.
Really?
You always travel with a handsaw?
Tools of the trade, soldier boy.
It would be best for you if you told them what you told us.
After Genoa, Job was interrogated for three months straight.
They worked him for names, dates, everything.
- But he wouldn't give them shit.
- That stubborn motherfucker.
So they gave up and they marked him for EDE.
- What the hell is that?
- Extended detainment and exploitation.
It's usually reserved for enemies of the state who require some extra motivation.
So where is he now?
- Where the fuck is he?
!
- They're keeping him in a black site.
A supermax hellhole that makes Abu Ghraib look like the Four Seasons.
- How do we get in there?
- You don't.
- How?
!
- No one gets in, period.
- Wrong answer, homes.
- Wait!
Wait!
No one gets in, but we might be able to buy him out if you have the cash.
- Cut his fucking foot off.
- No, don't!
The money is not for me!
Look, the government needs plausible deniability, so these places, they are completely autonomous.
The guys who are running them, they answer to no one.
Sometimes they'll deal.
- How much?
- How much do you have?
So much for early retirement.
Job is gonna be really pissed that we spent it all.
He'll get over it.
Make the call.
Glad you kept it safe for us all these months.
Yeah, I was saving it for a rainy day.
I made the deal.
What are you talking about?
Are you sure?
The money is here.
I am staring right at it.
But if he dies, you get nothing, you hear me?
!
What the fuck just happened?
- Job is scheduled to go dark.
- What the hell does that mean?
It means they have no further use for him.
- When?
- Unclear.
It could be two days, it could be two hours.
You want him back alive, we need to go now.
Okay, I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
You never heard of the five-second rule?
You finished with Rebecca Bowman?
Well, she's Y'd and tied, but it's gonna be some time before I finish the full pathology.
No, we are out of time, Dan.
I need to get this girl's body home to her family.
I hope you're not asking me to rush the autopsy for the victim of an alleged serial killer.
Tell me what you have so far, then, all right?
What I've got is an autopsy in progress.
Don't test me, Dan.
Don't fucking test me right now!
Jesus Christ, Brock, relax.
Well... puncture wounds and tearing of the soft tissue are consistent with animal bites, but they were most likely caused postmortem.
Right, she was already dead when he dumped her body in the woods.
- We knew that, right?
- Yes.
But she was still alive when he filleted her chest and cut her heart out.
That's some real "Temple of Doom" shit.
So it is the same as the other two girls.
Sick son of a bitch.
I'll bet a week's pay the tox screen will find similar traces of Valium and Demerol in her system.
He probably used just enough to keep her conscious, but knock the fight out of her.
God damn it, Dan.
Just give me something.
Anything to catch this asshole.
Uh... a fingerprint, DNA, something.
This guy's good, Brock!
He covers his tracks like a pro.
- Fuck you!
You've got nothing, then.
- Actually...
I've got the opposite of nothing.
Holy shit.
I haven't seen you in here before, have I?
You don't look like our usual clientele.
I'll just have a cup of coffee.
Could I help you with something?
- Um, how much for a piece of pie?
- $3.
That's all I got.
How about a cup of coffee?
I'll pay for the pie.
- And a glass of milk?
- Sure.
Whatever you like.
What's your name?
Cherry.
What's your real name?
Jennifer.
Come on in.
Look around.
Where are your parents, Jennifer?
Don't know.
Don't care.
You have your own bathroom, Jacuzzi tub.
There's plenty of fresh towels.
Clothing in the closet.
Should all fit you nicely.
So help yourself.
Are you gonna fuck me?
I just want you to feel comfortable, nothing more.
You must be tired.
I'll let you get some rest.
You can stay as long as you like.
Hey... whose room is this?
Someone who was very special to me.
I'm afraid our time together has come to an end.
Start walking.
Go.
Keep moving.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
I got you.
I got you.
I got you.
I got you.
- It's about motherfucking time.
- Let's get you home.
- What the fuck is this?
- If you have to ask, you already know.
For future reference, we don't make deals.
Hey.
I was just wondering.
Do I look like the kind of motherfucker who wouldn't know that?
Get the fuck up.
Fuck.
What do you want to do with him?
Yeah, Job.
What are you gonna do now...
Can we go now?
Where are you going?
- Stay the fuck away from me.
- Hmm.
You ungrateful bitch.
I'm sorry.
Please don't hurt me.
No.
I gave you freedom!
I gave you a place to stay!
I gave you everything.
But it was never enough, was it?
Man, you got all the time in the world.
We got two on the gate.
C-block inmates, prepare for yard detail.
Yard detail in 15 minutes for all C-block inmates.
Smokes are being X-rayed.
They'll be waiting for you on the other side.
Thanks, but what I really need is for you to pull your head out of your ass.
I don't understand.
What the hell were you thinking shooting porn in Banshee?
You talked to Proctor.
He's getting tired of your fuckups.
- And so am I.
- I saw an opportunity to earn...
You need to get your priorities straight, boy.
Scrounging for chump change, that's for niggers and spics.
Why the fuck are we still answering to this asshole anyway?
We have an army 10 times bigger than his.
Because I say so.
There are some other reasons I don't want to get into, but for your purposes, that's the only one you need.
Do you hear me?
I hear you.
- No more fuckups.
- No, sir.
Good.
Now get the fuck out of here before I miss lunch.
It's taco Tuesday.
Kai.
I'm sorry, Miriam.
I can't legally do anything to make them release the body.
Legally?
Since when has legal ever stopped you?
I'll personally bring Rebecca home to you as soon as I possibly can, I promise.
When Rebecca left us, I prayed that she'd return.
But when you took her in,
I knew that God had forsaken my prayers.
Her blood is on your hands, Kai.
And for that, I will never forgive you.
You rescued me from that hellhole and the first place you bring me back is here?
Baby, you heartless.
I think we could all use another drink.
This is an 18-year-old bottle of Glenlivet.
I've been saving it for a special occasion.
Come on, Job.
Drink up.
I just need to get some rest.
Then I'm going to grab my take from Genoa, head back into the city, maybe set myself up with a p...
penthouse.
What?
Somebody better start talking now.
Buying them off wasn't cheap.
Leo got away with the bag.
How much?
- All of it.
- So after all that time, I got nothing.
You still got your place in the back, Job.
No, he's not gonna stay in a back room.
You're gonna come stay with me.
I'm gonna take care of you.
- The kids are away.
It'll be quiet.
- And what about Gordon?
I lost track.
Is he in or is he out?
Gordon didn't make it.
Thank you all for coming to get me.
Next time you can tell me why it took 20 months.
What the hell is this?
Lucas Hood.
You're under arrest for the murder of Rebecca Bowman.
Brock, is this a joke?
Sir, I'm sorry, but we have a warrant.
- Brock, you know I didn't do it.
- Yeah?
Then maybe you want to tell me how your blood ended up inside of her car.
Nothing?
And I'm guessing you have no idea how you knocked her up either.
What?
Yeah, Bunker, put the cuffs on this man.
Let's go.
Sir.
- Okay, wait a minute.
This is...
- Hey.
Cruz, stand down.
I said stand the fuck down.
Let's go.
Get him in the car.
It's okay.
Sorry.

Man:
Know what photokeratitis is?
How about flash blindness?
The same thing, really.
Both caused by excessive exposure to ultraviolet light.
Cornea burns, unable to handle the light's intensity.
And you temporarily lose your vision.
The theory... pain is only psychological since the retina has no pain receptors.
This particular model was built by Homeland Security to torture prisoners after 9/11.
Unfortunately, it was banned... after some of those fuckers went blind for good.

[gasping] Hey.
Hey, hey.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You're safe.
Look at me.
It's okay.
You have a fever.
Your body is fighting off the infection.
I'm gonna lift up your head, okay?
Hold it down.
That's good.
[coughing]
Okay.
That's good.
[wheezing]
That's it, swallow.
I'm gonna clean you up a little bit more, okay?
It's gonna sting.
[breathing heavily]
Do you have any idea... what you're even doing?
You're still breathing, aren't you?
[sniffles] [footsteps]
[crows cawing]
You.
You gonna invite us in?
Colonel Stowe may have been crazy, but he was still military and kept meticulous records.
After Genoa, CID seized his files.
I tried everything I could to get my hands on them, but I kept hitting brick walls.
So then she came back to you?
Y'all know busting through walls is my specialty.
Okay, so then you stole the Genoa files from CID?
Don't need to steal when you got the power of persuasion.
Took a little longer than I would have liked.
Finally got to the right record clerk in the Pentagon.
In exchange for me not chopping off his dick, he graciously supplied me with a copy of the files.
There was a list of everyone working on the base that day.
So you compared it to the list of casualties?
Carrie:
One name was unaccounted for.
Private contractor named Leo Fitzpatrick.
[helicopter blades whirring] [no audible dialogue]
I'm guessing you know how to find this Leo?
Of course, soldier boy.
Rebecca's voice:
I've never been on my own before.
Kai's voice:
You're not anymore.
[knocks]
Sir.
- Nina Cruz.
- Send her in.
- Mr. Mayor.
- What is it, Deputy?
The last three guys your district attorney cut loose were all royally fucked up after the fact.
- Vigilante?
- I think it's more than that.
See, all three releases were connected to you.
Whoever the vigilante is, they know you've got the DA in your pocket.
Someone's sending you a message.
Sheriff Lotus.
- What do you think, Deputy?
- I think Brock makes a lot of noise, but he'd never come after you like that.
- Then get me a name.
- It could get messy.
Then you'll clean it up.
You hired me to be your eyes and your ears.
I don't mind doing the cleaning, but that costs more.
Then you better be worth it.
- Sheriff?
- Helen, the damn Internet is broken again.
I'll take a look.
The Bowmans are here to see you.
Oh, shit.
- Shall I bring them upstairs?
- Uh, no.
No, I'll do it.
Try to fix this.
- Mr. and Mrs. Bowman.
- Sheriff.
Would you like to come up to my office and talk?
The county coroner won't release Rebecca's body to us.
Yes, that's true.
Unfortunately, the body can't be released until the coroner has determined an official cause of death.
The funeral must be held immediately.
- I understand.
- This is our way.
It's...
It's been a week since our daughter's passing.
I know, and I assure you my entire department is working day and night on your daughter's case.
You have no right to keep her from us.
- Mrs. Bowman...
- [sobbing] Please, let us put her to rest.
[sighs]
Um...
all right, let me make some calls.
I'll try to move things along, okay?
- I promise.
- Come.
Let's go.
Again, I'm sorry for your loss.
Leo:
With technology crossing cultural boundaries, computer ethics are virtually intractable.
Why?
Well, how can we set a global standard when cultural relativism makes it impossible?
And by we, I mean they.
And by they, I mean the United States government.
But what they can do is enforce title 18, section 1030.
If you are caught accessing a computer with intent to steal information or damage a network, you will go to jail.
And when you're out, you'll get a six-figure gig as a security analyst.

That's it.
Go home.
I'll see you all next week.

[groans]
Fuck.
What do you want to do with him?
Yeah, Job.
What are you gonna do now... [gunshot]
Can we go now?
Where are you going?
- Stay the fuck away from me.
- Hmm.
[grunts]
You ungrateful bitch.
I'm sorry.
Please don't hurt me.
[grunts] [shrieks]
No. [choking]
I gave you freedom!
[coughing]
I gave you a place to stay!
I gave you everything.
But it was never enough, was it?
[laughing]
[gasping]
[door opens, slams] [prisoners shouting]
Man:
Man, you got all the time in the world.
Guard:
We got two on the gate.
Man on P.A.:
C-block inmates, prepare for yard detail.
Yard detail in 15 minutes for all C-block inmates.
Smokes are being X-rayed.
They'll be waiting for you on the other side.
Thanks, but what I really need is for you to pull your head out of your ass.
I don't understand.
What the hell were you thinking shooting porn in Banshee?
You talked to Proctor.
He's getting tired of your fuckups.
- And so am I.
- I saw an opportunity to earn...
You need to get your priorities straight, boy.
Scrounging for chump change, that's for niggers and spics.
Why the fuck are we still answering to this asshole anyway?
We have an army 10 times bigger than his.
Because I say so.
There are some other reasons I don't want to get into, but for your purposes, that's the only one you need.
Do you hear me?
I hear you.
- No more fuckups.
- No, sir.
Good.
Now get the fuck out of here before I miss lunch.
It's taco Tuesday.
[music]
Kai.
I'm sorry, Miriam.
I can't legally do anything to make them release the body.
Legally?
Since when has legal ever stopped you?
I'll personally bring Rebecca home to you as soon as I possibly can, I promise.
When Rebecca left us, I prayed that she'd return.
But when you took her in,
I knew that God had forsaken my prayers.
Her blood is on your hands, Kai.
And for that, I will never forgive you.
[music]
You rescued me from that hellhole and the first place you bring me back is here?
Baby, you heartless.
I think we could all use another drink.
This is an 18-year-old bottle of Glenlivet.
I've been saving it for a special occasion.
Sugar:
Come on, Job.
Drink up.
[gasps]
I just need to get some rest.
Then I'm going to grab my take from Genoa, head back into the city, maybe set myself up with a p...
penthouse.
What?
Somebody better start talking now.
Buying them off wasn't cheap.
Leo got away with the bag.
How much?
- All of it.
- So after all that time, I got nothing.
You still got your place in the back, Job.
Carrie:
No, he's not gonna stay in a back room.
You're gonna come stay with me.
I'm gonna take care of you.
- The kids are away.
It'll be quiet.
- And what about Gordon?
I lost track.
Is he in or is he out?
Gordon didn't make it.
Thank you all for coming to get me.
Next time you can tell me why it took 20 months.
[door opens]
What the hell is this?
Brock:
Lucas Hood.
You're under arrest for the murder of Rebecca Bowman.
Brock, is this a joke?
Sir, I'm sorry, but we have a warrant.
- Brock, you know I didn't do it.
- Yeah?
Then maybe you want to tell me how your blood ended up inside of her car.
Nothing?
And I'm guessing you have no idea how you knocked her up either.
What?
Brock:
Yeah, Bunker, put the cuffs on this man.
Let's go.
Sir.
- Okay, wait a minute.
This is...
- Hey.
Cruz, stand down.
I said stand the fuck down.
Let's go.
Get him in the car.
It's okay.
Sorry.
So... did I miss anything while I was gone?

Know what photokeratitis is?
How about flash blindness?
The same thing, really.
Both caused by excessive exposure to ultraviolet light.
Cornea burns, unable to handle the light's intensity.
And you temporarily lose your vision.
The theory... pain is only psychological since the retina has no pain receptors.
This particular model was built by Homeland Security to torture prisoners after 9/11.
Unfortunately, it was banned... after some of those fuckers went blind for good.
4x03 - "Job"
Let me the fuck out!
I'll fucking kill you!
Motherfucker, I will fucking kill you!
_
Thank you.
Hey, Bunker.
Doctor says you're gonna be all right.
_
Hey.
Hey, hey.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You're safe.
Look at me.
It's okay.
You have a fever.
Your body is fighting off the infection.
I'm gonna lift up your head, okay?
Hold it down.
That's good.
Okay.
That's good.
That's it, swallow.
I'm gonna clean you up a little bit more, okay?
It's gonna sting.
Do you have any idea... what you're even doing?
You're still breathing, aren't you?
You.
You gonna invite us in?
Colonel Stowe may have been crazy, but he was still military and kept meticulous records.
After Genoa, CID seized his files.
I tried everything I could to get my hands on them, but I kept hitting brick walls.
So then she came back to you?
Y'all know busting through walls is my specialty.
Okay, so then you stole the Genoa files from CID?
Don't need to steal when you got the power of persuasion.
Took a little longer than I would have liked.
Finally got to the right record clerk in the Pentagon.
In exchange for me not chopping off his dick, he graciously supplied me with a copy of the files.
There was a list of everyone working on the base that day.
So you compared it to the list of casualties?
One name was unaccounted for.
Private contractor named Leo Fitzpatrick.
I'm guessing you know how to find this Leo?
Of course, soldier boy.
I've never been on my own before.
You're not anymore.
Sir.
- Nina Cruz.
- Send her in.
- Mr. Mayor.
- What is it, Deputy?
The last three guys your district attorney cut loose were all royally fucked up after the fact.
- Vigilante?
- I think it's more than that.
See, all three releases were connected to you.
Whoever the vigilante is, they know you've got the DA in your pocket.
Someone's sending you a message.
Sheriff Lotus.
- What do you think, Deputy?
- I think Brock makes a lot of noise, but he'd never come after you like that.
- Then get me a name.
- It could get messy.
Then you'll clean it up.
You hired me to be your eyes and your ears.
I don't mind doing the cleaning, but that costs more.
Then you better be worth it.
- Sheriff?
- Helen, the damn Internet is broken again.
I'll take a look.
The Bowmans are here to see you.
Oh, shit.
- Shall I bring them upstairs?
- Uh, no.
No, I'll do it.
Try to fix this.
- Mr. and Mrs. Bowman.
- Sheriff.
Would you like to come up to my office and talk?
The county coroner won't release Rebecca's body to us.
Yes, that's true.
Unfortunately, the body can't be released until the coroner has determined an official cause of death.
The funeral must be held immediately.
- I understand.
- This is our way.
It's...
It's been a week since our daughter's passing.
I know, and I assure you my entire department is working day and night on your daughter's case.
You have no right to keep her from us.
- Mrs. Bowman...
- Please, let us put her to rest.
Um...
all right, let me make some calls.
I'll try to move things along, okay?
- I promise.
- Come.
Let's go.
Again, I'm sorry for your loss.
With technology crossing cultural boundaries, computer ethics are virtually intractable.
Why?
Well, how can we set a global standard when cultural relativism makes it impossible?
And by we, I mean they.
And by they, I mean the United States government.
But what they can do is enforce title 18, section 1030.
If you are caught accessing a computer with intent to steal information or damage a network, you will go to jail.
And when you're out, you'll get a six-figure gig as a security analyst.
That's it.
Go home.
I'll see you all next week.
Hey.
That's great.
Go to the next station.
Please stand clear of the doors.
- I'm on the train.
- Copy.
I'm on the move.
Next stop, Wallace Street.
What the fuck, bro?
Asshole.
Move!
- He's on the train.
- Copy.
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Move!
About time, soldier boy.
Just get him in the car!
Get the fuck in the car.
Come on, get the fuck in the car!
- Yeah, got him.
- Jesus fucking Christ, come on.
_
- Hi, Kurt.
- Maggie.
- I...
I heard you were back.
- What are you doing here?
- I brought you some groceries.
- Why?
I don't see anyone else lining up to help you out.
I don't need any help.
Yeah, of course you don't.
- Are you gonna let me in?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
I haven't, uh... had time to go through my mail yet.
I called the hospital every week to check on you.
- No one told me.
- I asked them not to.
I-I know that it was Calvin and his goons that did that to you.
Why didn't you report them?
- That you asking or Calvin?
- Don't be an asshole.
You know he'd kill me if he knew I was here.
I want to kill him for what he did to you.
It's...
It's just amazing how two brothers can be so different and so alike at the same time.
I have to get home.
My cell.
If you need anything.
- Oh, shit.
Shit.
Shit.
- What?
Calvin.
What the fuck?
Where the fuck are you?
I can't...
I can't do this, Kurt.
I know.
It's not always gonna be like this.
You think you can still get him out?
No, I don't.
I did.
But after this...
I know there's no coming back for him.
I just need to figure out how to put him away.
That's gonna take some time.
Time's not gonna change anything, Kurt.
What do you want me to do?
Just kill him now.
I can't kill my own brother.
- He's Hank's father.
- Kurt, when I was a little girl, my father poisoned me with fear.
He made sure that I would only ever feel safe if I was with a man just like him.
And I just accepted that.
That that's how things would always be.
And then you came back.
For the first time in my life, I thought things could be different.
But this isn't about me.
I'm terrified that my son is gonna turn out to be just like Calvin and just like my father...
- mean, hateful, violent...
- I won't let that happen.
You have to trust me, Maggie.
I assume there's a good reason why this son of a bitch is still breathing.
Hey, Leo.
Jesus.
Fuck!
Where's Job?
What?
Where's Job?
- Where the fuck is Job?
- I don't know who that is.
Tell me another lie.
Please.
See how this works?
Every time you bullshit us, she's gonna hit you.
When she gets tired, I'm gonna start.
She hits hard.
I hit harder.
You understand?
You took our friend.
We want him back.
Untie me, and I'll think about helping you.
Stop.
The boy can't talk if he ain't conscious.
Now take Nikita to the kitchen.
Give me and Sugar a minute.
Go.
I'm sorry.
You were just doing what we all wanted to.
Just everybody disappeared all at once.
You know?
It's all my fault.
Job knew the risks.
We all did.
I'm not talking about Job.
You know, I spent nearly two years up in those hills blaming myself for everything that happened.
Now, that would have been a big waste of time if this was all your fault.
Everything got so fucked up.
Yeah, it did.
Mr. Fitzpatrick has had a change of heart.
Really?
You always travel with a handsaw?
Tools of the trade, soldier boy.
It would be best for you if you told them what you told us.
After Genoa, Job was interrogated for three months straight.
They worked him for names, dates, everything.
- But he wouldn't give them shit.
- That stubborn motherfucker.
So they gave up and they marked him for EDE.
- What the hell is that?
- Extended detainment and exploitation.
It's usually reserved for enemies of the state who require some extra motivation.
So where is he now?
- Where the fuck is he?
!
- They're keeping him in a black site.
A supermax hellhole that makes Abu Ghraib look like the Four Seasons.
- How do we get in there?
- You don't.
- How?
!
- No one gets in, period.
- Wrong answer, homes.
- Wait!
Wait!
No one gets in, but we might be able to buy him out if you have the cash.
- Cut his fucking foot off.
- No, don't!
The money is not for me!
Look, the government needs plausible deniability, so these places, they are completely autonomous.
The guys who are running them, they answer to no one.
Sometimes they'll deal.
- How much?
- How much do you have?
So much for early retirement.
Job is gonna be really pissed that we spent it all.
He'll get over it.
Make the call.
Glad you kept it safe for us all these months.
Yeah, I was saving it for a rainy day.
I made the deal.
What are you talking about?
Are you sure?
The money is here.
I am staring right at it.
But if he dies, you get nothing, you hear me?
!
What the fuck just happened?
- Job is scheduled to go dark.
- What the hell does that mean?
It means they have no further use for him.
- When?
- Unclear.
It could be two days, it could be two hours.
You want him back alive, we need to go now.
Okay, I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
You never heard of the five-second rule?
You finished with Rebecca Bowman?
Well, she's Y'd and tied, but it's gonna be some time before I finish the full pathology.
No, we are out of time, Dan.
I need to get this girl's body home to her family.
I hope you're not asking me to rush the autopsy for the victim of an alleged serial killer.
Tell me what you have so far, then, all right?
What I've got is an autopsy in progress.
Don't test me, Dan.
Don't fucking test me right now!
Jesus Christ, Brock, relax.
Well... puncture wounds and tearing of the soft tissue are consistent with animal bites, but they were most likely caused postmortem.
Right, she was already dead when he dumped her body in the woods.
- We knew that, right?
- Yes.
But she was still alive when he filleted her chest and cut her heart out.
That's some real "Temple of Doom" shit.
So it is the same as the other two girls.
Sick son of a bitch.
I'll bet a week's pay the tox screen will find similar traces of Valium and Demerol in her system.
He probably used just enough to keep her conscious, but knock the fight out of her.
God damn it, Dan.
Just give me something.
Anything to catch this asshole.
Uh... a fingerprint, DNA, something.
This guy's good, Brock!
He covers his tracks like a pro.
- Fuck you!
You've got nothing, then.
- Actually...
I've got the opposite of nothing.
Holy shit.
I haven't seen you in here before, have I?
You don't look like our usual clientele.
I'll just have a cup of coffee.
Could I help you with something?
- Um, how much for a piece of pie?
- $3.
That's all I got.
How about a cup of coffee?
I'll pay for the pie.
- And a glass of milk?
- Sure.
Whatever you like.
What's your name?
Cherry.
What's your real name?
Jennifer.
Come on in.
Look around.
Where are your parents, Jennifer?
Don't know.
Don't care.
You have your own bathroom, Jacuzzi tub.
There's plenty of fresh towels.
Clothing in the closet.
Should all fit you nicely.
So help yourself.
Are you gonna fuck me?
I just want you to feel comfortable, nothing more.
You must be tired.
I'll let you get some rest.
You can stay as long as you like.
Hey... whose room is this?
Someone who was very special to me.
I'm afraid our time together has come to an end.
Start walking.
Go.
Keep moving.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
I got you.
I got you.
I got you.
I got you.
- It's about motherfucking time.
- Let's get you home.
- What the fuck is this?
- If you have to ask, you already know.
For future reference, we don't make deals.
Hey.
I was just wondering.
Do I look like the kind of motherfucker who wouldn't know that?
Get the fuck up.
Fuck.
What do you want to do with him?
- Yeah, Job.
- What are you gonna do now...
Can we go now?
Where are you going?
- Stay the fuck away from me.
- Hmm.
You ungrateful bitch.
I'm sorry.
Please don't hurt me.
No.
I gave you freedom!
I gave you a place to stay!
I gave you everything.
But it was never enough, was it?
Man, you got all the time in the world.

And when you're out, you'll get a six-figure gig as a security analyst.
[students laugh]
That's it.
Go home.
I'll see you all next week.
Hey.
That's great.
[music]
Go to the next station.
Man on P.A.:
Please stand clear of the doors.
[repeats in Spanish]
- I'm on the train.
- Carrie:
Copy.
I'm on the move.
Man on P.A.:
Next stop, Wallace Street.
What the fuck, bro?
Asshole.
Move!
- He's on the train.
- Carrie:
Copy.
Hey!
[both grunt]
[alarm blaring]
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Leo:
Move!
[dogs whining] [horns honking]
[tires screeching]
About time, soldier boy.
[grunting] Carrie:
Just get him in the car!
Get the fuck in the car.
Come on, get the fuck in the car!
- Carrie:
Yeah, got him.
- Jesus fucking Christ, come on.
[tires squeal]

- Hi, Kurt.
- Maggie.
- I...
I heard you were back.
- What are you doing here?
- I brought you some groceries.
- Why?
I don't see anyone else lining up to help you out.
I don't need any help.
Yeah, of course you don't.
- Are you gonna let me in?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
I haven't, uh... had time to go through my mail yet.
[clears throat]
I called the hospital every week to check on you.
- No one told me.
- I asked them not to.
I-I know that it was Calvin and his goons that did that to you.
Why didn't you report them?
- That you asking or Calvin?
- Don't be an asshole.
You know he'd kill me if he knew I was here.
I want to kill him for what he did to you.
It's...
It's just amazing how two brothers can be so different and so alike at the same time.
I have to get home.
My cell.
[clears throat]
If you need anything.
[sighs] [ringing] [panting]
[moaning]
[phone buzzing]
- Oh, shit.
Shit.
Shit.
- What?
Calvin.
[ringing]
What the fuck?
[ringing]
Where the fuck are you?
Maggie:
I can't...
I can't do this, Kurt.
I know.
It's not always gonna be like this.
You think you can still get him out?
No, I don't.
I did.
But after this...
I know there's no coming back for him.
I just need to figure out how to put him away.
That's gonna take some time.
Time's not gonna change anything, Kurt.
What do you want me to do?
Just kill him now.
I can't kill my own brother.
- He's Hank's father.
- Kurt, when I was a little girl, my father poisoned me with fear.
He made sure that I would only ever feel safe if I was with a man just like him.
And I just accepted that.
That that's how things would always be.
And then you came back.
For the first time in my life, I thought things could be different.
But this isn't about me.
I'm terrified that my son is gonna turn out to be just like Calvin and just like my father...
- mean, hateful, violent...
- I won't let that happen.
You have to trust me, Maggie.
I assume there's a good reason why this son of a bitch is still breathing.
Hey, Leo.
Jesus.
Fuck!
Where's Job?
What?
Where's Job?
[grunts]
- Where the fuck is Job?
- I don't know who that is.
Tell me another lie.
Please.
Lucas:
See how this works?
Every time you bullshit us, she's gonna hit you.
When she gets tired, I'm gonna start.
She hits hard.
I hit harder.
You understand?
You took our friend.
We want him back.
Untie me, and I'll think about helping you.
[grunts]
Stop.
The boy can't talk if he ain't conscious.
Now take Nikita to the kitchen.
Give me and Sugar a minute.
Go.
I'm sorry.
You were just doing what we all wanted to.
Just everybody disappeared all at once.
You know?
It's all my fault.
Job knew the risks.
We all did.
I'm not talking about Job.
[music]
You know, I spent nearly two years up in those hills blaming myself for everything that happened.
Now, that would have been a big waste of time if this was all your fault.
[chuckles]
Everything got so fucked up.
Yeah, it did.
[sighs]
Mr. Fitzpatrick has had a change of heart.
Really?
You always travel with a handsaw?
Tools of the trade, soldier boy.
[breathing heavily]
It would be best for you if you told them what you told us.
After Genoa, Job was interrogated for three months straight.
They worked him for names, dates, everything.
- But he wouldn't give them shit.
- That stubborn motherfucker.
So they gave up and they marked him for EDE.
- What the hell is that?
- Extended detainment and exploitation.
It's usually reserved for enemies of the state who require some extra motivation.
So where is he now?
[laughs]
- Where the fuck is he?
!
- They're keeping him in a black site.
A supermax hellhole that makes Abu Ghraib look like the Four Seasons.
- How do we get in there?
- You don't.
- How?
!
- No one gets in, period.
- Wrong answer, homes.
- [yelling] Wait!
Wait!
No one gets in, but we might be able to buy him out if you have the cash.
- Cut his fucking foot off.
- No, don't!
The money is not for me!
Look, the government needs plausible deniability, so these places, they are completely autonomous.
The guys who are running them, they answer to no one.
Sometimes they'll deal.
- How much?
- How much do you have?
So much for early retirement.
[music]
Job is gonna be really pissed that we spent it all.
He'll get over it.
Make the call.
Glad you kept it safe for us all these months.
Yeah, I was saving it for a rainy day.
Leo:
I made the deal.
What are you talking about?
Are you sure?
The money is here.
I am staring right at it.
But if he dies, you get nothing, you hear me?
!
What the fuck just happened?
- Job is scheduled to go dark.
- What the hell does that mean?
It means they have no further use for him.
- When?
- Unclear.
It could be two days, it could be two hours.
You want him back alive, we need to go now.
[saw buzzes] [squelches] [clangs]
[door opens]
Okay, I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
You never heard of the five-second rule?
[sighs]
You finished with Rebecca Bowman?
Well, she's Y'd and tied, but it's gonna be some time before I finish the full pathology.
No, we are out of time, Dan.
I need to get this girl's body home to her family.
I hope you're not asking me to rush the autopsy for the victim of an alleged serial killer.
Tell me what you have so far, then, all right?
What I've got is an autopsy in progress.
Don't test me, Dan.
Don't fucking test me right now!
Jesus Christ, Brock, relax.
Well... puncture wounds and tearing of the soft tissue are consistent with animal bites, but they were most likely caused postmortem.
Right, she was already dead when he dumped her body in the woods.
- We knew that, right?
- Yes.
But she was still alive when he filleted her chest and cut her heart out.
That's some real "Temple of Doom" shit.
So it is the same as the other two girls.
Sick son of a bitch.
I'll bet a week's pay the tox screen will find similar traces of Valium and Demerol in her system.
He probably used just enough to keep her conscious, but knock the fight out of her.
God damn it, Dan.
Just give me something.
Anything to catch this asshole.
Uh... a fingerprint, DNA, something.
This guy's good, Brock!
He covers his tracks like a pro.
- Fuck you!
You've got nothing, then.
- Actually...
I've got the opposite of nothing.
Holy shit.
[bell rings]
Woman:
I haven't seen you in here before, have I?
You don't look like our usual clientele.
I'll just have a cup of coffee.
Could I help you with something?
- Um, how much for a piece of pie?
- $3.
[coins rattle]
That's all I got.
How about a cup of coffee?
I'll pay for the pie.
- And a glass of milk?
- Sure.
Whatever you like.
[music]
What's your name?
Cherry.
What's your real name?
Jennifer.
Come on in.
Look around.
Where are your parents, Jennifer?
Don't know.
Don't care.
You have your own bathroom, Jacuzzi tub.
There's plenty of fresh towels.
Clothing in the closet.
Should all fit you nicely.
So help yourself.
Are you gonna fuck me?
I just want you to feel comfortable, nothing more.
You must be tired.
I'll let you get some rest.
You can stay as long as you like.
Hey... whose room is this?
Someone who was very special to me.
[door closes] [breathing heavily]
[music] [breathing heavily]
[breathing heavily, grunts]
[whimpering]
I'm afraid our time together has come to an end.
[screaming] [screaming continues]
Start walking.
Go.
[breathing heavily]
Keep moving.
[breathing heavily]
[groaning] Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
I got you.
I got you.
I got you.
I got you.
- It's about motherfucking time.
- Let's get you home.
[guns cocking]
- What the fuck is this?
- If you have to ask, you already know.
For future reference, we don't make deals.
Hey.
I was just wondering.
Do I look like the kind of motherfucker who wouldn't know that?
[gunshots]
[grunts] [air hisses]
Get the fuck up.
[groaning]
[groans]
Fuck.
What do you want to do with him?
Yeah, Job.
What are you gonna do now... [gunshot]
Can we go now?
Where are you going?
- Stay the fuck away from me.
- Hmm.
[grunts]
You ungrateful bitch.
I'm sorry.
Please don't hurt me.
[grunts] [shrieks]
No. [choking]
I gave you freedom!
[coughing]
I gave you a place to stay!
I gave you everything.
But it was never enough, was it?
[laughing]
[gasping]
[door opens, slams] [prisoners shouting]
Man:
Man, you got all the time in the world.
Guard:
We got two on the gate.
Man on P.A.:
C-block inmates, prepare for yard detail.
Yard detail in 15 minutes for all C-block inmates.
Smokes are being X-rayed.
They'll be waiting for you on the other side.
Thanks, but what I really need is for you to pull your head out of your ass.
I don't understand.
What the hell were you thinking shooting porn in Banshee?
You talked to Proctor.
He's getting tired of your fuckups.
- And so am I.
- I saw an opportunity to earn...
You need to get your priorities straight, boy.
Scrounging for chump change, that's for niggers and spics.
Why the fuck are we still answering to this asshole anyway?
We have an army 10 times bigger than his.
Because I say so.
There are some other reasons I don't want to get into, but for your purposes, that's the only one you need.
Do you hear me?
I hear you.
- No more fuckups.
- No, sir.
Good.
Now get the fuck out of here before I miss lunch.
It's taco Tuesday.
[music]
Kai.
I'm sorry, Miriam.
I can't legally do anything to make them release the body.
Legally?
Since when has legal ever stopped you?
I'll personally bring Rebecca home to you as soon as I possibly can, I promise.
When Rebecca left us, I prayed that she'd return.
But when you took her in,
I knew that God had forsaken my prayers.
Her blood is on your hands, Kai.
And for that, I will never forgive you.
[music]
You rescued me from that hellhole and the first place you bring me back is here?
Baby, you heartless.
I think we could all use another drink.
This is an 18-year-old bottle of Glenlivet.
I've been saving it for a special occasion.
Sugar:
Come on, Job.
Drink up.
[gasps]
I just need to get some rest.
Then I'm going to grab my take from Genoa, head back into the city, maybe set myself up with a p...
penthouse.
What?
Somebody better start talking now.
Buying them off wasn't cheap.
Leo got away with the bag.
How much?
- All of it.
- So after all that time, I got nothing.
You still got your place in the back, Job.
Carrie:
No, he's not gonna stay in a back room.
You're gonna come stay with me.
I'm gonna take care of you.
- The kids are away.
It'll be quiet.
- And what about Gordon?
I lost track.
Is he in or is he out?
Gordon didn't make it.
Thank you all for coming to get me.
Next time you can tell me why it took 20 months.
[door opens]
What the hell is this?
Brock:
Lucas Hood.
You're under arrest for the murder of Rebecca Bowman.
Brock, is this a joke?
Sir, I'm sorry, but we have a warrant.
- Brock, you know I didn't do it.
- Yeah?
Then maybe you want to tell me how your blood ended up inside of her car.
Nothing?
And I'm guessing you have no idea how you knocked her up either.
What?
Brock:
Yeah, Bunker, put the cuffs on this man.
Let's go.
Sir.
- Okay, wait a minute.
This is...
- Hey.
Cruz, stand down.
I said stand the fuck down.
Let's go.
Get him in the car.
It's okay.
Sorry.
So... did I miss anything while I was gone?

Hey.
Uh, where'd you get these burritos?
From the spot on the corner?
Mmm.
Yeah, the spot on the corner.
You know I helped a lady give birth in the kitchen?
Ugh.
NICK:
That's disgusting.
A baby in the middle of the place.
I knew that wasn't going to stop you.
Disgusting.
You didn't tell us you delivered a baby.
Baby's perfectly fine.
But let's just say I did not do a good job.
(door closes) WINSTON:
Oh, Reagan.
What's up?
Hey.
So, uh, I just jogged past a guy that's offering donkey rides for $50.
Feel like that's too much for a donkey ride, right?
NICK (mouth full):
It's a dog, not a donkey.
I know that guy.
His name is...
His name is Stan.
Stan.
S-T-A-N.
His dog's name's Cheerio.
Hold on.
It's not a donkey.
Um, it's a dog.
Okay.
(sighs) That was painful, Nick.
It's like watching Cece make a bed.
(Cece humming a tune)
Just give me the sheet!
I can't be normal around Reagan.
She's too hot and mysterious.
I mean, I haven't peed in four days, which is alarming because I have been drinking constantly.
Yep.
Nothing.
The fact of the matter is, is that she don't want to hang out with us.
She's our roommate, but she being straight up discourteous.
Reagan, why don't you join the fiesta, huh?
I'll make up a pitcher of margaritas.
That's tempting, but, uh, if I have one margarita, I'll have eight;
and if I have eight, end up riding that donkey all the way to Santa Monica, so... (laughing):
It'd be great to watch you ride a donkey!
Thanks, but no, thanks.
NICK:
There's extra toilet paper in the bathroom!
It's...
(door opens and closes)
Are you hiding toilet paper again?
I can't do this.
Did she hit us with a "No, thanks"?
How about this?
No, thanks, to your "No, thanks."
Here's what I'm gonna do--
I'm gonna make her hang out with us whether she wants to or not.
Oh, yeah, this woman just made my nonsexual to-do list.
You have a sexual to-do list?
Cece, don't ask.
Number one...
I regret it already.

Oh!

She's back in the kitchen!
She's back in the kitchen!
Nick, we're making sex.
It hasn't started yet.
It's not sex until you put the straw in the coconut.
It's called foreplay, you tween.
You don't just buy a Porsche off the lot and immediately enter it in the Groser Preis von Deutschland.
What?
The Groser Preis von Deutschland.
Just let me eat in here.
I don't want to eat around Reagan.
Why not?
Oh, I forgot that you're a bear in pants.
Will you please go eat in your room?
She's right across the hall.
She'll hear the crunching!
We need you elsewhere, Nick.
From my cold, dead hands!
That doesn't even apply.
Reagan!
(laughs)
Ooh, what a coincidence.
We're both running!
And I've been chasing you for miles like a murderer!
I kind of prefer to run alone.
You see?
That's your problem right there.
We're roommates now, and in our loft, we do things together, like a family.
Ooh, look.
A bubbler.
Oh.
Oh.
(slurping loudly)
Oh, that's so good!
Mmm.
There's a Band-Aid in there.
WOMAN:
Reagan?
Camilla.
Oh, my God.
Hi.
Why did I think you were still in Atlanta?
Oh, because last night you sent me a text saying, "Still in Atlanta."
Well, hello.
What have we here?
Back on the stick, I see.
No, no, no.
No.
No.
I'm just staying with him and his roommates.
Yeah, which is exactly why you got to start hanging out with us more.
You know, we only got you for a month.
I get you for a whole month?
I'm about to start binge-watching Ken Burns's Jazz.
Oh, Ken Burns's Jazz. (whoops)
Call you later.
I will.
Do that.
Call me, yes.
Okay, great.
I'm going to.
Okay.
Great.
Can't wait.
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?
I am hooking up with her.
I'm dating her a little bit, but I'm over it, and I'm trying to avoid her.
What are you telling people I'm here for a month for?
Oh, you see what we're doing right now?
We're vibing, we're talking about stuff!
Okay, now it's my turn.
Let me do you.
Um...
I think I swallowed a Band-Aid earlier.
Now I have to dump her, and I have never dumped anybody before.
I don't know how.
I travel so much that I usually just disappear.
Wow.
Okay.
I will help you break up with her.
Why?
'Cause you've been dumped, like, a million times?
No.
Because I'm your roommate, and we have each other's backs.
Wait a minute.
What makes you think
I've been dumped a lot?
Please.
I read you guys the moment I got there.
Nick's deal is, he honest-to-God might be 50.
Schmidt's deal is he had to Shazam "Stairway to Heaven."
And your deal is you've been dumped a lot.
You're pretty good.
You're pretty good.
SCHMIDT:
How did Nick go through so many napkins, yet get salsa everywhere?
We've got no privacy, and it has been way, way, way too long since Mama got her biscuits.
And the biscuits... are rising.
I hope they stick to the pan and get a little brown on the bottom.
I'm gonna be honest.
That went right over my head.
I just didn't get it.
I don't know...
I don't know where you're going with it.
Plus, I can't concentrate.
It's filthy in here.
How do we keep Nick out of here?
!
He thinks that
Reagan is some sort of superhuman goddess.
Okay, well, the truth of the matter is, is I kind of get it.
You know, when we first met, I had to pretend that all kinds of things were wrong with you just so I wouldn't freak out.
You know, like, I gave you a glass eye for a while.
You had a wooden foot for a short period of time.
There was one week where I pretended that you were a Democrat.
I am a Democrat.
(laughing)
Ah, that's so funny.
I love you.
Okay.
So we tell Nick she has a glass eye.
He'll spin out.
He'll think the eye is a government-issued camera taking pictures for Langley.
(scoffs) Nick's a conspiracy theorist.
It's like an Irish carnival up there-- just potato peels, broken rides, fiddle music, dreams left unfulfilled, bloodied soccer jerseys, bunch of women limping around named Moira.
Okay.
So all we have to do is find a detail that won't make him spin out.
Easy.
It'll be the opposite of easy.
It will be difficult.
Oh.
We need to come up with something so smart, so nuanced, so... unexpected, so surgical, that only a genius could think of it.
Reagan wears a wig.
What?
Get out of here.
No, it's true.
She-she told me.
Oh, she told you?
Yeah.
When?
Before.
(scoffs)
Well, the timing definitely checks out.
The only question is why.
Personal, um, lady reasons.
I don't want to touch that.
(blows through lips)
"Reagan wears a wig."
"Told you before."
Yep.
"Because of lady stuff."
Wow.
I don't buy it.
Doesn't make sense.
We failed.
Patience.
I know my boy.
But, Schmidt...
I know my boy!
Hey, Nick.
Got to get busy living or get busy dying.
Heard.
What are you doing?
What are you doing is the question.
What are you doing?
Were you just smelling my hair?
No.
I'm just Nicky being Nicky.
Sometimes I feel like you're in one of those weird man-dog body-switch movies.
You like those, too?
Neither?
(door opens and closes)
It's a wig.
(yelling):
Doesn't make sense!
What?
(chuckles)
Ding, ding.
The biscuits are ready.
Well, did you make enough for Cousin Andy?
S...
I'm-I'm gonna tell you the truth.
I don't get that one, either.
Who the hell is Cousin Andy?
I just made it up.
Mmm.
Reagan, I have been broken up with so many times in so many different places.
Um, multiple parks, coffee shops, uh, Santa's lap,
Kitchen Stadium on Iron Chef, airplanes in economy, economy select, economy comfort, platinum economy, all covered in butterflies...
I feel like we have established your credentials.
Okay.
So I'm Camilla.
Break up with me.
(clears throat)
(scoffs) Camilla...
Yes, baby.
I love you so much.
We have had a lot of really good times together, and I just...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my goodness, oh, my God!
I knew this was comin'.
Oh, my God, oh, my goodness.
What-what are you doing?
Oh, no.
Are you breaking up with me?
Why you hate me?
Why you hate me so much?
I don't...
I don't hate you.
I don't hate you.
Oh, my God, you don't?
Oh, my goodness.
So you're not breaking up with me.
We're gonna have such a happy life together.
I-I...
I am.
I am breaking up with you.
Oh, my God, you is breakin' up with me.
Why you is breakin' up with me and stuff?
Yo, this is mad crazy.
I'm pregnant with your child.
Okay.
That isn't possible.
Yeah, his name is D'Lante.
We would never name our child that.
Yeah.
D-apostrophe-Lante.
No, I can't...
Look, I can't do this.
Look, I want you to be happy.
Here.
Here's $80.
Wow.
Really?
You're just gonna bail?
Yeah.
I suck at this, obviously.
I don't want to hurt her.
Honey, sit down, sit down, sit down.
Here.
Why don't you just be honest about why you're breaking up with her?
I don't... know.
I just feel like it's over.
Let me tell you about some reasons why I've been broken up with.
Um, "you're too nasty in bed, Winston."
Or "you remind me of my brother, Winston." Or... or "Winston, you spend too much time in the butterfly house."
I have an idea.
Okay.
What if you break up with Camilla for me?
I'm sorry, what?
Because obviously you understand how it feels, and you'll be much more gentle and empathetic.
What?
No, that is the exact opposite of what we're trying to accomplish here.
This is a very important moment in your life.
You see, you have the ability to change, and that is what I find the most beautiful about human beings.
If you do it, I will do a 20-minute roommate dinner.
Okay, deal.
I been thinking...
Damn it, Miller!
Maybe Winston was right.
How well do we know this Reagan character?
I mean, sure, she wears a wig.
Not a big deal.
Or, let me ask you, is it a big deal?
Ask yourself, what type of person wears a wig?
A bald person?
Sure.
I'll say so.
They're bald.
Somebody hiding something?
Definitely.
CECE:
Okay, look.
Maybe she's not hiding anything, all right?
Beyoncé, Beyoncé wears wigs, and you would trust Beyoncé with your life.
Yeah, I'd trust Beyoncé with my life.

That's it.
Great thinking.
That's why I love you.

It's Canadian cash.
A picture of a little boy.
This woman is like an orange.
You peel a layer, there's another layer there.
You're thinking of an onion.
An orange only has one layer.
Oh, you poor thing.
Okay, someone has to put everything back exactly like they found it.
Well, it clearly is gonna be me, 'cause I'm the only one who can fold.
Nick, what are you doing?
I'm making a mess, but I'm finding the truth.
Okay, I'm gonna end this.
Nick, Reagan doesn't wear a wig.
We made the whole thing up.
But I smelled it and I saw it.
We couldn't get you out of our room.
Why would you lie to me?
Well, we wouldn't need to lie to you if you would just talk to Reagan instead of hiding out in my room with your cheap Southwestern food.
Talk to her?
Like a normal human being?
Yes, that's exactly what I want you to do.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
I have nothing in common with that woman.
She is a goddess who's descended from the heavens.
And I'm just a mud man from the bowels of Chicago.
Let's clean this place up, and let's get out of here.
She's gonna be home soon.
Wait.
What are these?
"Sarah Nevada"?
"Suzi Shimizu"?
That's Reagan's face.
These are fake I.D.'s.
Fake I.D.'s?
SCHMIDT:
Okay.
It's f... it's fake identification.
You're damn right it is, Jack.
Okay.
Okay.
Look, this is a little bit weird, but I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for this.
Maybe Nick is onto something here, okay?
Because how much do we actually really know about her?
Who has fake I.D.'s?
I'll tell you who.
Con men.
Grifters.
It's all starting to make sense to me.
Check this out.
Let me break this down for you.
Okay?
She and her bastard son...
Or her nephew.
...who she had with the Ohio State professor, go town to town, selling... let's say fake pills.
Pills.
Doctor.
Pharmacy.
Whatever she does.
To a bunch of maple-sucking tree huggers.
Aka those lovely stoners from the north, our Canadian brothers and sisters.
Let's just clean this place up, and let's get out of here. (chuckles)
(door opens) REAGAN:
Guys!
Winston made me bring home dinner.
It's Reagan.
Or is it Suzi?
Oh, Jewish God, why do you hate me?
Clean up the floor!
Okay, yeah.
She is the one who has to explain herself.
Let her come in here.
You have gone full Nick, Cece.
What does that mean?
She's bought into your nonsense!
Enough.
I'm very disappointed with you.
Put this down.
I'll-I'll fold it.
I just picked it up!
You don't know what you're doing.
Hey, Reagan, come in here!
No, no, Reagan!
Don't come in here!
There's a possum in here!
Don't come in here, 'cause there's...
What do you mean, Reagan wants to break up with me?
Who are you?
I'm her roommate.
Oh, so she sent her roommate to break up with me?
Now I have no more questions.
Great.
Then I'm out.
Blessings.
Okay, look, um,
I know this is not ideal.
But if I'm being honest, she's got a lot of work to do emotionally.
Are you really gonna let her get away with this?
You must know how this makes me feel.
You've clearly been dumped many times.
Why do people keep saying that?
You ordered a Shirley Temple.
It's a virgin Denzel.
If she wants to dump me, she should man up and look me in the eye.
You know what, she should have, and I told her that.
It's the least she could have done.
Hey, you're preaching to the choir.
Ask me how many times I've been dumped.
I don't have the... 47 times.
And once on my birthday.
And out of that 47 times and once on my birthday, do you know what part hurts the most?
Getting bailed on.
Getting bailed on.
Why do people think they can just disappear on you?
They're not thinking at all.
Except of themselves.
Let's go find her.
Hell yeah.
Ooh, wait, wait, wait, I just thought about it, and that's not a good idea.
Where is she?
How you... how you know I know where she at?
You said you're roommates.
Damn.
Bitten by my own snake.
So you all went through my room and you each have things that you would like to discuss.
Is that correct?
That's true.
Yes.
Chicago.
So-- the money, the fake I.D.'s.
I have fake I.D.'s because hospitals hate pharmaceutical reps and it gets me through the door.
I carry Canadian cash because I do a lot of business there and I don't trust banks.
Who does?
Okay.
All right, fine.
What about this, though-- your son?
He looks just like you.
That is me.
Wait.
What?
Oof.
Rough haircut.
Oh, and if you found something in my room that kind of looks like a hollowed-out hand, that's a glove.
(clears throat) So I went full Nick, huh?
Yes, you went full Nick.
Right, yeah, I see that now.
I'm full Nick every day.
Imagine how that feels.
We all owe you an apology for...
pretty much everything.
I'm sorry that we went through your room.
Well, that's not what I'm upset about.
I mean,
I went through all of your rooms when I first moved in.
Excuse me?
Wait, you went through our rooms?
Oh, no.
How else am I supposed to get to know you?
But the point is I didn't jump to conclusions.
I mean, Nick has a two-by-four in his room with a nail in it.
I didn't assume he was building a human cage.
I'm building a tree house.
You're doing wha...
you're building a tree house?
Well, why am I not involved?
Why is Cece not involved?
We want to be involved.
Oh, I'm involved.
So's Winston.
What?
Everyone's involved in the tree house but I?
Forget about it.
Reagan, how would you like to build a tree house with me?
No.
Reagan, we already got plans, we already got a two-by-four.
No.
I feel like we are really off-topic here.
What I'm trying to say is:
Why did you just assume that I'm a criminal?
Well, because these two are paranoid maniacs.
Who apparently are building a tree house together.
Not apparently.
We are.
Mm-hmm.
On the other hand, we hardly know anything about you.
Oh, my God.
Okay, that's what this is about?
Look, I'm-I'm only gonna be here for a few weeks.
There is no reason to get all emotionally involved.
Let's just keep it clean, and that way nobody gets upset.
I am so upset right now.
WINSTON:
Uh, let me get ahead of this, roomie.
I did not help out today.
Camilla.
Hi, baby, hi.
What are you doing here?
Cut the crap.
Why?
You sent him to dump me?
No. (scoffs) To dump you?
No.
Why would I do that...
Why would you do that?
NICK:
What the hell, man?
CECE:
That is crazy.
Why would anyone do that?
What's wrong with you?
(quietly):
Tell the truth, you sneaky woman.
Reagan, are you dumping me or not?
No.
Kind of.
Look, Camilla, I, uh...
I don't want to...
I don't want to hurt you.
Just say it.
Okay.
(clears throat)
The truth is that I'm a criminal.
What?
I'm a criminal.
You shouldn't be with me.
I'm disgusting.
Things I've done.
Things I'm capable of.
Hard life, short life-- I probably won't live that long.
I can't believe this.
She's a criminal.
Filthy.
Disgusting crimes.
One of the worst human beings I've ever met in my life.
And who are you?
I'm her, uh, co-criminal.
Co-gangster.
We run the streets together.
From Bangkok to Chicago to here.
Just murdering people.
My name is Nick.
On the streets, they call me, uh...
Sharky.
Sharky, that's right.
'Cause I attack from beneath up.
CECE:
It's all true, Camilla.
And her name is not Reagan.
It's Suzi Shimizu.
You're Japanese?
Very much so.
We happen... we happen to all be Japanese.
The unlucky offspring of a couple very lucky American GIs.
Unnecessary backstory.
Yeah, they call me the Moyel on the streets, 'cause I will, uh...
(clicks tongue) ...cut your penis off.
Isn't that right, Sharky?
You're on your own, Moyel.
And they call me Cece, but spelled S-I-S-I, with an accent over the last I.
I am spinning out here, Moyel.
You got to help me.
Why don't you go spin all the way over to your tree house?
Schmidt knows about the tree house?
Okay, what the hell is going on?
Winston, check for a wire-- she could be a rat.
Stop it.
This isn't real.
You're telling us we're not a Japanese crime family?
Reagan, tell me the truth.
Reagan, seriously, just stop bailing.
I'll just go.
Camilla, wait.
Look... (exhales)
This isn't working out.
But I think that it's my fault.
Because I don't let people in.
I'm sorry.
I think that you deserve a lot better than that.
Thank you.
I know that wasn't easy for you.
Okay, well, I'm gonna take off.
Do you, um, still have my blue sweater?
Yes.
Oh, no, no, no...
Uh, it's right in my room.
Right here, in the first door.
Right there.
Okay, thanks.
WINSTON:
Oh, no, no.
NICK:
That's nice.
Telling the truth works.
SCHMIDT:
Yeah, it did.
CECE:
Good job.
Wait, wait, wait, wait for it.
CAMILLA:
Freaking bitch!
(crashing)
I hate you!
I hate you so much!
Oh.
Yeah, it's the old
"I left my sweater" trick.
(Camilla roaring)
Let me tell you something, folks,
I've played that song before.
All right, well, this obviously turned out to be a huge disaster.
I hate you so much!
But... thank you.
Try sleeping on an upside down bed!
I'm proud of you.
All of you-- I mean, you guys could've bailed on me, but you didn't.
You stuck around, and you helped me lie to a psychotic woman who is now destroying all of my stuff.
(Camilla yells)
Anything to help.
It's kind of what we do.
It's how we roll.
(Camilla shrieks)
How do you think she's taking it?
What's with all these ribbons?
!
How long do you think she's gonna be in there?
I like to do about 15.
CAMILLA:
You are never gonna forget me!
You are never gonna forget Camilla!
So, what'd you bring us for dinner?
CECE:
How about this one?
Are you ready to...
soak Mama's beans?
It's working, right?
Okay, shh.
I love you.
Yeah, I love you, too.
I love you.
Let's not talk.
Okay.
(grunting)
Nick!
What?
You still can't eat in front of Reagan?
This has nothing to do with Reagan.
I...
I've just gotten used to eating in here.
It's cozy.
Why, what are you guys up to?
What?
(knock at door)
Can I come in?
My room is trashed.
This is where we eat, right?
Yes, please, please, please.
Might as well.
I mean, sure, why not?
What?
I like the way you eat a burrito.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Buenos noches!
(Winston speaking Spanish)
Aah!
Oh!
Winston!
Oh... oh...
All over the bed?
!
WINSTON:
I didn't get my huevos on you, did I?
SCHMIDT:
Close your robe!
CECE:
Okay.
Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH
Hey.
Uh, where'd you get these burritos?
From the spot on the corner?
- Mmm.
- Yeah, the spot on the corner.
You know I helped a lady give birth in the kitchen?
Ugh.
NICK:
That's disgusting.
A baby in the middle of the place.
I knew that wasn't going to stop you.
- Disgusting.
- You didn't tell us you delivered a baby.
Baby's perfectly fine.
But let's just say I did not do a good job.
- (door closes)
- WINSTON:
Oh, Reagan.
What's up?
Hey.
So, uh, I just jogged past a guy that's offering donkey rides for $50.
Feel like that's too much for a donkey ride, right?
NICK (mouth full):
It's a dog, not a donkey.
I know that guy.
His name is...
His name is Stan.
Stan.
S-T-A-N.
His dog's name's Cheerio.
Hold on.
It's not a donkey.
Um, it's a dog.
Okay.
(sighs) That was painful, Nick.
It's like watching Cece make a bed.
(Cece humming a tune)
Just give me the sheet!
I can't be normal around Reagan.
She's too hot and mysterious.
I mean, I haven't peed in four days, which is alarming because I have been drinking constantly.
Yep.
Nothing.
The fact of the matter is, is that she don't want to hang out with us.
She's our roommate, but she being straight up discourteous.
Reagan, why don't you join the fiesta, huh?
I'll make up a pitcher of margaritas.
That's tempting, but, uh, if I have one margarita, I'll have eight;
and if I have eight, end up riding that donkey all the way to Santa Monica, so... (laughing):
It'd be great to watch you ride a donkey!
- Thanks, but no, thanks.
- NICK:
There's extra toilet paper
- in the bathroom!
It's...
- (door opens and closes)
Are you hiding toilet paper again?
- I can't do this.
- Did she hit us with a "No, thanks"?
How about this?
No, thanks, to your "No, thanks."
Here's what I'm gonna do...
I'm gonna make her hang out with us whether she wants to or not.
Oh, yeah, this woman just made my nonsexual to-do list.
- You have a sexual to-do list?
- Cece, don't ask.
- Number one...
- I regret it already.
Joan Allen.
- Oh!
Nick!
- She's back in the kitchen!
She's back in the kitchen!
- Nick, we're making sex.
- It hasn't started yet.
It's not sex until you put the straw in the coconut.
It's called foreplay, you tween.
You don't just buy a Porsche off the lot and immediately enter it in the Groser Preis von Deutschland.
- What?
- The Groser Preis von Deutschland.
Just let me eat in here.
I don't want to eat around Reagan.
Why not?
Oh, I forgot that you're
- a bear in pants.
- Will you please go eat in your room?
She's right across the hall.
She'll hear the crunching!
We need you elsewhere, Nick.
From my cold, dead hands!
That doesn't even apply.
Reagan!
(laughs)
Ooh, what a coincidence.
We're both running!
And I've been chasing you for miles like a murderer!
- I kind of prefer to run alone.
- You see?
That's your problem right there.
We're roommates now, and in our loft, we do things together, like a family.
Ooh, look.
A bubbler.
Oh.
Oh.
(slurping loudly)
Oh, that's so good!
Mmm.
- There's a Band-Aid in there.
- WOMAN:
Reagan?
Camilla.
Oh, my God.
Hi.
Why did I think you were still in Atlanta?
Oh, because last night you sent me a text saying, "Still in Atlanta."
Well, hello.
What have we here?
- Back on the stick, I see.
- No, no, no.
No.
No.
I'm just staying with him and his roommates.
Yeah, which is exactly why you got to start hanging out with us more.
- You know, we only got you for a month.
- I get you for a whole month?
I'm about to start binge-watching Ken Burns's Jazz.
Oh, Ken Burns's Jazz. (whoops)
- Call you later.
I will.
- Do that.
- Call me, yes.
Okay, great.
- I'm going to.
Okay.
- Great.
- Can't wait.
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?
I am hooking up with her.
I'm dating her a little bit, but I'm over it, and I'm trying to avoid her.
What are you telling people I'm here for a month for?
Oh, you see what we're doing right now?
We're vibing, we're talking about stuff!
Okay, now it's my turn.
Let me do you.
Um...
I think I swallowed a Band-Aid earlier.
Now I have to dump her, and I have never dumped anybody before.
I don't know how.
- I travel so much that I usually just disappear.
- Wow.
Okay.
I will help you break up with her.
Why?
'Cause you've been dumped, like, a million times?
No.
Because I'm your roommate, and we have each other's backs.
Wait a minute.
What makes you think
- I've been dumped a lot?
- Please.
I read you guys the moment I got there.
Nick's deal is, he honest-to-God might be 50.
Schmidt's deal is he had to Shazam "Stairway to Heaven."
And your deal is you've been dumped a lot.
You're pretty good.
You're pretty good.
SCHMIDT:
How did Nick go through so many napkins, yet get salsa everywhere?
We've got no privacy, and it has been way, way, way too long since Mama got her biscuits.
And the biscuits... are rising.
I hope they stick to the pan and get a little brown
- on the bottom.
- I'm gonna be honest.
That went right over my head.
I just didn't get it.
I don't know...
I don't know where you're going with it.
Plus, I can't concentrate.
It's filthy in here.
How do we keep Nick out of here?
!
He thinks that
Reagan is some sort of superhuman goddess.
Okay, well, the truth of the matter is, is I kind of get it.
You know, when we first met, I had to pretend that all kinds of things were wrong with you just so I wouldn't freak out.
You know, like, I gave you a glass eye for a while.
You had a wooden foot for a short period of time.
There was one week where I pretended that you were a Democrat.
- I am a Democrat.
- (laughing)
- Ah, that's so funny.
I love you.
- Okay.
- So we tell Nick she has a glass eye.
- He'll spin out.
He'll think the eye is a government-issued camera taking pictures for Langley.
- (scoffs)
- Nick's a conspiracy theorist.
It's like an Irish carnival up there... just potato peels, broken rides, fiddle music, dreams left unfulfilled, bloodied soccer jerseys, bunch of women limping around named Moira.
Okay.
So all we have to do is find a detail that won't make him spin out.
Easy.
It'll be the opposite of easy.
- It will be difficult.
- Oh.
We need to come up with something so smart, so nuanced, so... unexpected, so surgical, that only a genius could think of it.
Reagan wears a wig.
- What?
Get out of here.
- No, it's true.
She-she told me.
- Oh, she told you?
- Yeah.
- When?
- Before.
(scoffs)
Well, the timing definitely checks out.
The only question is why.
Personal, um, lady reasons.
I don't want to touch that.
(blows through lips)
"Reagan wears a wig."
"Told you before."
- Yep.
- "Because of lady stuff."
Wow.
I don't buy it.
Doesn't make sense.
- We failed.
- Patience.
I know my boy.
- But, Schmidt...
- I know my boy!
Hey, Nick.
Got to get busy living or get busy dying.
Heard.
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing is the question.
What are you doing?
- Were you just smelling my hair?
- No.
I'm just Nicky being Nicky.
Sometimes I feel like you're in one of those weird man-dog body-switch movies.
You like those, too?
Neither?
(door opens and closes)
It's a wig.
(yelling):
Doesn't make sense!
What?
(chuckles)
Ding, ding.
The biscuits are ready.
Well, did you make enough for Cousin Andy?
S...
I'm-I'm gonna tell you the truth.
I don't get that one, either.
Who the hell is Cousin Andy?
I just made it up.
Mmm.
Reagan, I've been broken up with so many times in so many different places.
Um, multiple parks, coffee shops, uh, Santa's lap,
Kitchen Stadium on Iron Chef, airplanes in economy, economy select, economy comfort, platinum economy, all covered in butterflies...
I feel like we have established your credentials.
Okay.
So I'm Camilla.
Break up with me.
(clears throat)
(scoffs) Camilla...
Yes, baby.
I love you so much.
We have had a lot of really good times together,
- and I just...
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my goodness, oh, my God!
I knew this was comin'.
- Oh, my God, oh, my goodness.
- What-what are you doing?
Oh, no.
Are you breaking up with me?
Why you hate me?
Why you hate me so much?
- I don't...
I don't hate you.
I don't hate you.
- Oh, my God, you don't?
Oh, my goodness.
So you're not breaking up with me.
- We're gonna have such a happy life together.
- I-I...
I am.
I am breaking up with you.
Oh, my God, you is breakin' up with me.
Why you is breakin' up with me and stuff?
- Yo, this is mad crazy.
I'm pregnant with your child.
- Okay.
- That isn't possible.
- Yeah, his name is D'Lante.
We would never name our child that.
Yeah.
D-apostrophe-Lante.
No, I can't...
Look, I can't do this.
Look, I want you to be happy.
Here.
- Here's $80.
- Wow.
Really?
- You're just gonna bail?
- Yeah.
I suck at this, obviously.
- I don't want to hurt her.
- Honey, sit down, sit down, sit down.
Here.
Why don't you just be honest about why you're breaking up with her?
I don't... know.
- I just feel like it's over.
- Let me tell you about some reasons why I've been broken up with.
Um, "you're too nasty in bed, Winston."
Or "you remind me of my brother, Winston." Or... or "Winston, you spend too much time in the butterfly house."
- I have an idea.
- Okay.
What if you break up with Camilla for me?
I'm sorry, what?
Because obviously you understand how it feels, and you'll be much more gentle and empathetic.
What?
No, that is the exact opposite of what we're trying to accomplish here.
This is a very important moment in your life.
You see, you have the ability to change, and that is what I find the most beautiful about human beings.
If you do it, I will do a 20-minute roommate dinner.
Okay, deal.
- I been thinking...
- Damn it, Miller!
Maybe Winston was right.
How well do we know this Reagan character?
I mean, sure, she wears a wig.
Not a big deal.
Or, let me ask you, is it a big deal?
Ask yourself, what type of person wears a wig?
A bald person?
Sure.
I'll say so.
They're bald.
Somebody hiding something?
- Definitely.
- CECE:
Okay, look.
Maybe she's not hiding anything, all right?
Beyoncé, Beyoncé wears wigs, and you would trust Beyoncé with your life.
Yeah, I'd trust Beyoncé with my life.

We be all night.
We be all night.
Nick, is it possible that you are maybe overthinking this just a little bit, okay?
'Cause, look, Reagan is a really good roommate.
She's quiet, she pays, she takes care of her room.
Her room.
That's it.
Great thinking.
That's why I love you.
That's why.
Not physically.
Uh, but as a person.
Like, um, it's not sexual.
I love you like a mother or a sister or a girlfriend.
It's not sexual.
Her room!
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Oh!
Jackpot.
Ribbons!
Oh, these are probably Jess's.
Nick, stop.
You should not be in here.
I am learning so much about you, Reagan.
An Ohio State T-shirt.
Cash from Canada.
It's Canadian cash.
A picture of a little boy.
This woman is like an orange.
You peel a layer, there's another layer there.
You're thinking of an onion.
An orange only has one layer.
- Oh, you poor thing.
- Okay, someone has to put everything back
- exactly like they found it.
- Well, it clearly is gonna be me, 'cause I'm the only one who can fold.
Nick, what are you doing?
I'm making a mess, but I'm finding the truth.
Okay, I'm gonna end this.
Nick, Reagan doesn't wear a wig.
We made the whole thing up.
- But I smelled it and I saw it.
- We couldn't get you
- out of our room.
- Why would you lie to me?
Well, we wouldn't need to lie to you if you would just talk to Reagan instead of hiding out in my room with your cheap Southwestern food.
- Talk to her?
Like a normal human being?
- Yes,
- that's exactly what I want you to do.
- Yes.
Mm-hmm.
I have nothing in common with that woman.
She is a goddess who's descended from the heavens.
And I'm just a mud man from the bowels of Chicago.
Let's clean this place up, and let's get out of here.
- She's gonna be home soon.
- Wait.
What are these?
"Sarah Nevada"? "Suzi Shimizu"?
That's Reagan's face.
These are fake I.D.'s.
Fake I.D.'s?
SCHMIDT:
Okay.
It's f... it's fake identification.
You're damn right it is, Jack.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Look, this is a little bit weird, but I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for this.
Maybe Nick is onto something here, okay?
Because how much do we actually really know about her?
- Who has fake I.D.'s?
- I'll tell you who.
Con men.
Grifters.
It's all starting to make sense to me.
Check this out.
Let me break this down for you.
Okay?
She and her bastard son...
- Or her nephew.
- ...who she had with the Ohio State professor, go town to town, selling... let's say fake pills.
Pills.
Doctor.
Pharmacy.
Whatever she does.
To a bunch of maple-sucking tree huggers.
Aka those lovely stoners from the north, our Canadian brothers and sisters.
- Let's just clean this place up, and let's get out of here.
- (chuckles)
- (door opens)
- REAGAN:
Guys!
Winston made me bring home dinner.
- It's Reagan.
- Or is it Suzi?
Oh, Jewish God, why do you hate me?
Clean up the floor!
- Okay, yeah.
- She is the one who has to explain herself.
- Let her come in here.
- You have gone full Nick, Cece.
- What does that mean?
- She's bought into your nonsense!
Enough.
I'm very disappointed with you.
- Put this down.
I'll-I'll fold it.
- I just picked it up!
You don't know what you're doing.
- Hey, Reagan, come in here!
- No, no, Reagan!
- Don't come in here!
- There's a possum in here!
Don't come in here, 'cause there's...
What do you mean Reagan wants to break up with me?
Who are you?
- I'm her roommate.
- Oh, so she sent her roommate to break up with me?
Now I have no more questions.
Great.
Then I'm out.
Blessings.
Okay, look, um,
I know this is not ideal.
But if I'm being honest, she's got a lot
- of work to do emotionally.
- Are you really gonna let her get away with this?
You must know how this makes me feel.
You've clearly been dumped many times.
Why do people keep saying that?
You ordered a Shirley Temple.
It's a virgin Denzel.
If she wants to dump me, she should man up and look me in the eye.
You know what, she should have, and I told her that.
It's the least she could have done.
Hey, you're preaching to the choir.
Ask me how many times I've been dumped.
- I don't have the...
- 47 times.
And once on my birthday.
And out of that 47 times and once on my birthday, do you know what part hurts the most?
- Getting bailed on.
- Getting bailed on.
Why do people think they can just disappear on you?
They're not thinking at all.
Except of themselves.
Let's go find her.
Hell yeah.
Ooh, wait, wait, wait, I just thought about it,
- and that's not a good idea.
- Where is she?
How you... how you know I know where she at?
You said you're roommates.
Damn.
Bitten by my own snake.
So you all went through my room and you each have things that you would like to discuss.
Is that correct?
- That's true.
- Yes.
- Chicago.
So... the money, the fake I.D.'s.
I have fake I.D.'s because hospitals hate pharmaceutical reps and it gets me through the door.
I carry Canadian cash because I do a lot of business there and I don't trust banks.
Who does?
Okay.
All right, fine.
What about this, though... your son?
He looks just like you.
- That is me.
- Wait.
What?
Oof.
Rough haircut.
Oh, and if you found something in my room that kind of looks like a hollowed-out hand, that's a glove.
- (clears throat) So I went full Nick, huh?
- Yes, you went full Nick.
Right, yeah, I see that now.
I'm full Nick every day.
Imagine how that feels.
We all owe you an apology for... pretty much everything.
I'm sorry that we went through your room.
Well, that's not what I'm upset about.
I mean,
I went through all of your rooms when I first moved in.
- Excuse me?
- Wait, you went through our rooms?
- Oh, no.
- How else am I supposed to get to know you?
But the point is I didn't jump to conclusions.
I mean, Nick has a two-by-four in his room with a nail in it.
I didn't assume he was building a human cage.
I'm building a tree house.
You're doing wha... you're building a tree house?
Well, why am I not involved?
Why is Cece not involved?
- We want to be involved.
- Oh, I'm involved.
- So's Winston.
- What?
Everyone's involved in the tree house but I?
Forget about it.
Reagan, how would you like
- to build a tree house with me?
- No.
Reagan, we already got plans, we already got a two-by-four.
No.
I feel like we are really off-topic here.
What I'm trying to say is:
Why did you just assume that I'm a criminal?
Well, because these two are paranoid maniacs.
Who apparently are building a tree house together.
- Not apparently.
We are.
- Mm-hmm.
On the other hand, we hardly know anything about you.
Oh, my God.
Okay, that's what this is about?
Look, I'm-I'm only gonna be here for a few weeks.
There is no reason to get all emotionally involved.
Let's just keep it clean, and that way nobody gets upset.
I am so upset right now.
WINSTON:
Uh, let me get ahead of this, roomie.
I did not help out today.
Camilla.
Hi, baby, hi.
- What are you doing here?
- Cut the crap.
- Why?
- You sent him to dump me?
No. (scoffs) To dump you?
No.
Why would I do that...
Why would you do that?
- NICK:
What the hell, man?
- CECE:
That is crazy.
Why would anyone do that?
What's wrong with you?
(quietly):
Tell the truth, you sneaky woman.
Reagan, are you dumping me or not?
No.
Kind of.
Look, Camilla, I, uh...
I don't want to...
I don't want to hurt you.
Just say it.
Okay. (clears throat)
The truth is that I'm a criminal.
- What?
- I'm a criminal.
You shouldn't be with me.
I'm disgusting.
Things I've done.
Things I'm capable of.
Hard life, short life...
I probably won't live that long.
I can't believe this.
She's a criminal.
Filthy.
Disgusting crimes.
- One of the worst human beings I've ever met in my life.
- And who are you?
I'm her, uh, co-criminal.
Co-gangster.
We run the streets together.
From Bangkok to Chicago to here.
Just murdering people.
My name is Nick.
On the streets, they call me, uh...
- Sharky.
- Sharky, that's right.
'Cause I attack from beneath up.
CECE:
It's all true, Camilla.
And her name is not Reagan.
It's Suzi Shimizu.
- You're Japanese?
- Very much so.
We happen... we happen to all be Japanese.
The unlucky offspring of a couple very lucky American GIs.
- Unnecessary backstory.
- Yeah, they call me the Moyel on the streets, 'cause I will, uh... (clicks tongue) ...cut your penis off.
- Isn't that right, Sharky?
- You're on your own, Moyel.
And they call me Cece, but spelled S-I-S-I, with an accent over the last I.
I am spinning out here, Moyel.
You got to help me.
Why don't you go spin all the way over to your tree house?
- Schmidt knows about the tree house?
- Okay, what the hell is going on?
Winston, check for a wire... she could be a rat.
Stop it.
This isn't real.
You're telling us we're not a Japanese crime family?
Reagan, tell me the truth.
Reagan, seriously, just stop bailing.
I'll just go.
Camilla, wait.
Look... (exhales)
This isn't working out.
But I think that it's my fault.
Because I don't let people in.
I'm sorry.
I think that you deserve a lot better than that.
Thank you.
I know that wasn't easy for you.
Okay, well, I'm gonna take off.
- Do you, um, still have my blue sweater?
- Yes.
- Oh, no, no, no...
- Uh, it's right in my room.
Right here, in the first door.
- Right there.
- Okay, thanks.
- WINSTON:
Oh, no, no.
- NICK:
That's nice.
Telling the truth works.
SCHMIDT:
Yeah, it did.
- CECE:
Good job.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait for it.
CAMILLA:
Freaking bitch!
(crashing)
I hate you!
I hate you so much!
- Oh.
- Yeah, it's the old
- "I left my sweater" trick.
- (Camilla roaring)
Let me tell you something, folks,
I've played that song before.
All right, well, this obviously turned out to be
- a huge disaster.
- I hate you so much!
- But... thank you.
- Try sleeping on an upside down bed!
I'm proud of you.
All of you...
I mean, you guys could've bailed on me, but you didn't.
You stuck around, and you helped me lie to a psychotic woman who is now destroying all of my stuff.
(Camilla yells)
- Anything to help.
- It's kind of what we do.
- It's how we roll.
- (Camilla shrieks)
- How do you think she's taking it?
- What's with all these ribbons?
!
How long do you think she's gonna be in there?
I like to do about 15.
CAMILLA:
You are never gonna forget me!
You are never gonna forget Camilla!
So, what'd you bring us for dinner?
CECE:
How about this one?
Are you ready to... soak Mama's beans?
- It's working, right?
- Okay, shh.
I love you.
- Yeah, I love you, too.
I love you.
- Let's not talk.
Okay.
(grunting)
Nick!
- What?
- You still can't eat
- in front of Reagan?
- This has nothing to do with Reagan.
I...
I've just gotten used to eating in here.
It's cozy.
Why, what are you guys up to?
- What?
- (knock at door)
Can I come in?
My room is trashed.
This is where we eat, right?
Yes, please, please, please.
- Might as well.
- I mean, sure, why not?
What?
I like the way you eat a burrito.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
¡Buenas noches!
(Winston speaking Spanish)
- Aah!
- Oh!
- Winston!
- Oh... oh...
All over the bed?
!
WINSTON:
I didn't get my huevos on you, did I?
Close your robe!
Okay!
Hey.
Uh, where'd you get these burritos?
From the spot on the corner?
- Mmm.
- Yeah, the spot on the corner.
You know I helped a lady give birth in the kitchen?
Ugh.
NICK:
That's disgusting.
A baby in the middle of the place.
I knew that wasn't going to stop you.
- Disgusting.
- You didn't tell us you delivered a baby.
Baby's perfectly fine.
But let's just say I did not do a good job.
- (door closes)
- WINSTON:
Oh, Reagan.
What's up?
Hey.
So, uh, I just jogged past a guy that's offering donkey rides for $50.
Feel like that's too much for a donkey ride, right?
NICK (mouth full):
It's a dog, not a donkey.
I know that guy.
His name is...
His name is Stan.
Stan.
S-T-A-N.
His dog's name's Cheerio.
Hold on.
It's not a donkey.
Um, it's a dog.
Okay.
(sighs) That was painful, Nick.
It's like watching Cece make a bed.
(Cece humming a tune)
Just give me the sheet!
I can't be normal around Reagan.
She's too hot and mysterious.
I mean, I haven't peed in four days, which is alarming because I have been drinking constantly.
Yep.
Nothing.
The fact of the matter is, is that she don't want to hang out with us.
She's our roommate, but she being straight up discourteous.
Reagan, why don't you join the fiesta, huh?
I'll make up a pitcher of margaritas.
That's tempting, but, uh, if I have one margarita, I'll have eight;
and if I have eight, end up riding that donkey all the way to Santa Monica, so... (laughing):
It'd be great to watch you ride a donkey!
- Thanks, but no, thanks.
- NICK:
There's extra toilet paper
- in the bathroom!
It's...
- (door opens and closes)
Are you hiding toilet paper again?
- I can't do this.
- Did she hit us with a "No, thanks"?
How about this?
No, thanks, to your "No, thanks."
Here's what I'm gonna do...
I'm gonna make her hang out with us whether she wants to or not.
Oh, yeah, this woman just made my nonsexual to-do list.
- You have a sexual to-do list?
- Cece, don't ask.
- Number one...
- I regret it already.
Joan Allen.
- Oh!
Nick!
- She's back in the kitchen!
She's back in the kitchen!
- Nick, we're making sex.
- It hasn't started yet.
It's not sex until you put the straw in the coconut.
It's called foreplay, you tween.
You don't just buy a Porsche off the lot and immediately enter it in the Groser Preis von Deutschland.
- What?
- The Groser Preis von Deutschland.
Just let me eat in here.
I don't want to eat around Reagan.
Why not?
Oh, I forgot that you're
- a bear in pants.
- Will you please go eat in your room?
She's right across the hall.
She'll hear the crunching!
We need you elsewhere, Nick.
From my cold, dead hands!
That doesn't even apply.
Reagan!
(laughs)
Ooh, what a coincidence.
We're both running!
And I've been chasing you for miles like a murderer!
- I kind of prefer to run alone.
- You see?
That's your problem right there.
We're roommates now, and in our loft, we do things together, like a family.
Ooh, look.
A bubbler.
Oh.
Oh.
(slurping loudly)
Oh, that's so good!
Mmm.
- There's a Band-Aid in there.
- WOMAN:
Reagan?
Camilla.
Oh, my God.
Hi.
Why did I think you were still in Atlanta?
Oh, because last night you sent me a text saying, "Still in Atlanta."
Well, hello.
What have we here?
- Back on the stick, I see.
- No, no, no.
No.
No.
I'm just staying with him and his roommates.
Yeah, which is exactly why you got to start hanging out with us more.
- You know, we only got you for a month.
- I get you for a whole month?
I'm about to start binge-watching Ken Burns's Jazz.
Oh, Ken Burns's Jazz. (whoops)
- Call you later.
I will.
- Do that.
- Call me, yes.
Okay, great.
- I'm going to.
Okay.
- Great.
- Can't wait.
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?
I am hooking up with her.
I'm dating her a little bit, but I'm over it, and I'm trying to avoid her.
What are you telling people I'm here for a month for?
Oh, you see what we're doing right now?
We're vibing, we're talking about stuff!
Okay, now it's my turn.
Let me do you.
Um...
I think I swallowed a Band-Aid earlier.
Now I have to dump her, and I have never dumped anybody before.
I don't know how.
- I travel so much that I usually just disappear.
- Wow.
Okay.
I will help you break up with her.
Why?
'Cause you've been dumped, like, a million times?
No.
Because I'm your roommate, and we have each other's backs.
Wait a minute.
What makes you think
- I've been dumped a lot?
- Please.
I read you guys the moment I got there.
Nick's deal is, he honest-to-God might be 50.
Schmidt's deal is he had to Shazam "Stairway to Heaven."
And your deal is you've been dumped a lot.
You're pretty good.
You're pretty good.
SCHMIDT:
How did Nick go through so many napkins, yet get salsa everywhere?
We've got no privacy, and it has been way, way, way too long since Mama got her biscuits.
And the biscuits... are rising.
I hope they stick to the pan and get a little brown
- on the bottom.
- I'm gonna be honest.
That went right over my head.
I just didn't get it.
I don't know...
I don't know where you're going with it.
Plus, I can't concentrate.
It's filthy in here.
How do we keep Nick out of here?
!
He thinks that
Reagan is some sort of superhuman goddess.
Okay, well, the truth of the matter is, is I kind of get it.
You know, when we first met, I had to pretend that all kinds of things were wrong with you just so I wouldn't freak out.
You know, like, I gave you a glass eye for a while.
You had a wooden foot for a short period of time.
There was one week where I pretended that you were a Democrat.
- I am a Democrat.
- (laughing)
- Ah, that's so funny.
I love you.
- Okay.
- So we tell Nick she has a glass eye.
- He'll spin out.
He'll think the eye is a government-issued camera taking pictures for Langley.
- (scoffs)
- Nick's a conspiracy theorist.
It's like an Irish carnival up there... just potato peels, broken rides, fiddle music, dreams left unfulfilled, bloodied soccer jerseys, bunch of women limping around named Moira.
Okay.
So all we have to do is find a detail that won't make him spin out.
Easy.
It'll be the opposite of easy.
- It will be difficult.
- Oh.
We need to come up with something so smart, so nuanced, so... unexpected, so surgical, that only a genius could think of it.
Reagan wears a wig.
- What?
Get out of here.
- No, it's true.
She-she told me.
- Oh, she told you?
- Yeah.
- When?
- Before.
(scoffs)
Well, the timing definitely checks out.
The only question is why.
Personal, um, lady reasons.
I don't want to touch that.
(blows through lips)
"Reagan wears a wig."
"Told you before."
- Yep.
- "Because of lady stuff."
Wow.
I don't buy it.
Doesn't make sense.
- We failed.
- Patience.
I know my boy.
- But, Schmidt...
- I know my boy!
Hey, Nick.
Got to get busy living or get busy dying.
Heard.
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing is the question.
What are you doing?
- Were you just smelling my hair?
- No.
I'm just Nicky being Nicky.
Sometimes I feel like you're in one of those weird man-dog body-switch movies.
You like those, too?
Neither?
(door opens and closes)
It's a wig.
(yelling):
Doesn't make sense!
What?
(chuckles)
Ding, ding.
The biscuits are ready.
Well, did you make enough for Cousin Andy?
S...
I'm-I'm gonna tell you the truth.
I don't get that one, either.
Who the hell is Cousin Andy?
I just made it up.
Mmm.
Reagan, I've been broken up with so many times in so many different places.
Um, multiple parks, coffee shops, uh, Santa's lap,
Kitchen Stadium on Iron Chef, airplanes in economy, economy select, economy comfort, platinum economy, all covered in butterflies...
I feel like we have established your credentials.
Okay.
So I'm Camilla.
Break up with me.
(clears throat)
(scoffs) Camilla...
Yes, baby.
I love you so much.
We have had a lot of really good times together,
- and I just...
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my goodness, oh, my God!
I knew this was comin'.
- Oh, my God, oh, my goodness.
- What-what are you doing?
Oh, no.
Are you breaking up with me?
Why you hate me?
Why you hate me so much?
- I don't...
I don't hate you.
I don't hate you.
- Oh, my God, you don't?
Oh, my goodness.
So you're not breaking up with me.
- We're gonna have such a happy life together.
- I-I...
I am.
I am breaking up with you.
Oh, my God, you is breakin' up with me.
Why you is breakin' up with me and stuff?
- Yo, this is mad crazy.
I'm pregnant with your child.
- Okay.
- That isn't possible.
- Yeah, his name is D'Lante.
We would never name our child that.
Yeah.
D-apostrophe-Lante.
No, I can't...
Look, I can't do this.
Look, I want you to be happy.
Here.
- Here's $80.
- Wow.
Really?
- You're just gonna bail?
- Yeah.
I suck at this, obviously.
- I don't want to hurt her.
- Honey, sit down, sit down, sit down.
Here.
Why don't you just be honest about why you're breaking up with her?
I don't... know.
- I just feel like it's over.
- Let me tell you about some reasons why I've been broken up with.
Um, "you're too nasty in bed, Winston."
Or "you remind me of my brother, Winston." Or... or "Winston, you spend too much time in the butterfly house."
- I have an idea.
- Okay.
What if you break up with Camilla for me?
I'm sorry, what?
Because obviously you understand how it feels, and you'll be much more gentle and empathetic.
What?
No, that is the exact opposite of what we're trying to accomplish here.
This is a very important moment in your life.
You see, you have the ability to change, and that is what I find the most beautiful about human beings.
If you do it, I will do a 20-minute roommate dinner.
Okay, deal.
- I been thinking...
- Damn it, Miller!
Maybe Winston was right.
How well do we know this Reagan character?
I mean, sure, she wears a wig.
Not a big deal.
Or, let me ask you, is it a big deal?
Ask yourself, what type of person wears a wig?
A bald person?
Sure.
I'll say so.
They're bald.
Somebody hiding something?
- Definitely.
- CECE:
Okay, look.
Maybe she's not hiding anything, all right?
Beyoncé, Beyoncé wears wigs, and you would trust Beyoncé with your life.
Yeah, I'd trust Beyoncé with my life.
♪ Ride it with my surfboard ♪
♪ Surfboard, surfboard ♪
♪ Bringin' on that wood, oh, baby, bringin' on that wood!
♪
We be all night.
We be all night.
Nick, is it possible that you are maybe overthinking this just a little bit, okay?
'Cause, look, Reagan is a really good roommate.
She's quiet, she pays, she takes care of her room.
Her room.
That's it.
Great thinking.
That's why I love you.
That's why.
Not physically.
Uh, but as a person.
Like, um, it's not sexual.
I love you like a mother or a sister or a girlfriend.
It's not sexual.
Her room!
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Oh!
Jackpot.
Ribbons!
Oh, these are probably Jess's.
Nick, stop.
You should not be in here.
I am learning so much about you, Reagan.
An Ohio State T-shirt.
Cash from Canada.
It's Canadian cash.
A picture of a little boy.
This woman is like an orange.
You peel a layer, there's another layer there.
You're thinking of an onion.
An orange only has one layer.
- Oh, you poor thing.
- Okay, someone has to put everything back
- exactly like they found it.
- Well, it clearly is gonna be me, 'cause I'm the only one who can fold.
Nick, what are you doing?
I'm making a mess, but I'm finding the truth.
Okay, I'm gonna end this.
Nick, Reagan doesn't wear a wig.
We made the whole thing up.
- But I smelled it and I saw it.
- We couldn't get you
- out of our room.
- Why would you lie to me?
Well, we wouldn't need to lie to you if you would just talk to Reagan instead of hiding out in my room with your cheap Southwestern food.
- Talk to her?
Like a normal human being?
- Yes,
- that's exactly what I want you to do.
- Yes.
Mm-hmm.
I have nothing in common with that woman.
She is a goddess who's descended from the heavens.
And I'm just a mud man from the bowels of Chicago.
Let's clean this place up, and let's get out of here.
- She's gonna be home soon.
- Wait.
What are these?
"Sarah Nevada"? "Suzi Shimizu"?
That's Reagan's face.
These are fake I.D.'s.
Fake I.D.'s?
SCHMIDT:
Okay.
It's f... it's fake identification.
You're damn right it is, Jack.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Look, this is a little bit weird, but I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for this.
Maybe Nick is onto something here, okay?
Because how much do we actually really know about her?
- Who has fake I.D.'s?
- I'll tell you who.
Con men.
Grifters.
It's all starting to make sense to me.
Check this out.
Let me break this down for you.
Okay?
She and her bastard son...
- Or her nephew.
- ...who she had with the Ohio State professor, go town to town, selling... let's say fake pills.
Pills.
Doctor.
Pharmacy.
Whatever she does.
To a bunch of maple-sucking tree huggers.
Aka those lovely stoners from the north, our Canadian brothers and sisters.
- Let's just clean this place up, and let's get out of here.
- (chuckles)
- (door opens)
- REAGAN:
Guys!
Winston made me bring home dinner.
- It's Reagan.
- Or is it Suzi?
Oh, Jewish God, why do you hate me?
Clean up the floor!
- Okay, yeah.
- She is the one who has to explain herself.
- Let her come in here.
- You have gone full Nick, Cece.
- What does that mean?
- She's bought into your nonsense!
Enough.
I'm very disappointed with you.
- Put this down.
I'll-I'll fold it.
- I just picked it up!
You don't know what you're doing.
- Hey, Reagan, come in here!
- No, no, Reagan!
- Don't come in here!
- There's a possum in here!
Don't come in here, 'cause there's...
What do you mean Reagan wants to break up with me?
Who are you?
- I'm her roommate.
- Oh, so she sent her roommate to break up with me?
Now I have no more questions.
Great.
Then I'm out.
Blessings.
Okay, look, um,
I know this is not ideal.
But if I'm being honest, she's got a lot
- of work to do emotionally.
- Are you really gonna let her get away with this?
You must know how this makes me feel.
You've clearly been dumped many times.
Why do people keep saying that?
You ordered a Shirley Temple.
It's a virgin Denzel.
If she wants to dump me, she should man up and look me in the eye.
You know what, she should have, and I told her that.
It's the least she could have done.
Hey, you're preaching to the choir.
Ask me how many times I've been dumped.
- I don't have the...
- 47 times.
And once on my birthday.
And out of that 47 times and once on my birthday, do you know what part hurts the most?
- Getting bailed on.
- Getting bailed on.
Why do people think they can just disappear on you?
They're not thinking at all.
Except of themselves.
Let's go find her.
Hell yeah.
Ooh, wait, wait, wait, I just thought about it,
- and that's not a good idea.
- Where is she?
How you... how you know I know where she at?
You said you're roommates.
Damn.
Bitten by my own snake.
So you all went through my room and you each have things that you would like to discuss.
Is that correct?
- That's true.
- Yes.
- Chicago.
So... the money, the fake I.D.'s.
I have fake I.D.'s because hospitals hate pharmaceutical reps and it gets me through the door.
I carry Canadian cash because I do a lot of business there and I don't trust banks.
Who does?
Okay.
All right, fine.
What about this, though... your son?
He looks just like you.
- That is me.
- Wait.
What?
Oof.
Rough haircut.
Oh, and if you found something in my room that kind of looks like a hollowed-out hand, that's a glove.
- (clears throat) So I went full Nick, huh?
- Yes, you went full Nick.
Right, yeah, I see that now.
I'm full Nick every day.
Imagine how that feels.
We all owe you an apology for... pretty much everything.
I'm sorry that we went through your room.
Well, that's not what I'm upset about.
I mean,
I went through all of your rooms when I first moved in.
- Excuse me?
- Wait, you went through our rooms?
- Oh, no.
- How else am I supposed to get to know you?
But the point is I didn't jump to conclusions.
I mean, Nick has a two-by-four in his room with a nail in it.
I didn't assume he was building a human cage.
I'm building a tree house.
You're doing wha... you're building a tree house?
Well, why am I not involved?
Why is Cece not involved?
- We want to be involved.
- Oh, I'm involved.
- So's Winston.
- What?
Everyone's involved in the tree house but I?
Forget about it.
Reagan, how would you like
- to build a tree house with me?
- No.
Reagan, we already got plans, we already got a two-by-four.
No.
I feel like we are really off-topic here.
What I'm trying to say is:
Why did you just assume that I'm a criminal?
Well, because these two are paranoid maniacs.
Who apparently are building a tree house together.
- Not apparently.
We are.
- Mm-hmm.
On the other hand, we hardly know anything about you.
Oh, my God.
Okay, that's what this is about?
Look, I'm-I'm only gonna be here for a few weeks.
There is no reason to get all emotionally involved.
Let's just keep it clean, and that way nobody gets upset.
I am so upset right now.
WINSTON:
Uh, let me get ahead of this, roomie.
I did not help out today.
Camilla.
Hi, baby, hi.
- What are you doing here?
- Cut the crap.
- Why?
- You sent him to dump me?
No. (scoffs) To dump you?
No.
Why would I do that...
Why would you do that?
- NICK:
What the hell, man?
- CECE:
That is crazy.
Why would anyone do that?
What's wrong with you?
(quietly):
Tell the truth, you sneaky woman.
Reagan, are you dumping me or not?
No.
Kind of.
Look, Camilla, I, uh...
I don't want to...
I don't want to hurt you.
Just say it.
Okay. (clears throat)
The truth is that I'm a criminal.
- What?
- I'm a criminal.
You shouldn't be with me.
I'm disgusting.
Things I've done.
Things I'm capable of.
Hard life, short life...
I probably won't live that long.
I can't believe this.
She's a criminal.
Filthy.
Disgusting crimes.
- One of the worst human beings I've ever met in my life.
- And who are you?
I'm her, uh, co-criminal.
Co-gangster.
We run the streets together.
From Bangkok to Chicago to here.
Just murdering people.
My name is Nick.
On the streets, they call me, uh...
- Sharky.
- Sharky, that's right.
'Cause I attack from beneath up.
CECE:
It's all true, Camilla.
And her name is not Reagan.
It's Suzi Shimizu.
- You're Japanese?
- Very much so.
We happen... we happen to all be Japanese.
The unlucky offspring of a couple very lucky American GIs.
- Unnecessary backstory.
- Yeah, they call me the Moyel on the streets, 'cause I will, uh... (clicks tongue) ...cut your penis off.
- Isn't that right, Sharky?
- You're on your own, Moyel.
And they call me Cece, but spelled S-I-S-I, with an accent over the last I.
I am spinning out here, Moyel.
You got to help me.
Why don't you go spin all the way over to your tree house?
- Schmidt knows about the tree house?
- Okay, what the hell is going on?
Winston, check for a wire... she could be a rat.
Stop it.
This isn't real.
You're telling us we're not a Japanese crime family?
Reagan, tell me the truth.
Reagan, seriously, just stop bailing.
I'll just go.
Camilla, wait.
Look... (exhales)
This isn't working out.
But I think that it's my fault.
Because I don't let people in.
I'm sorry.
I think that you deserve a lot better than that.
Thank you.
I know that wasn't easy for you.
Okay, well, I'm gonna take off.
- Do you, um, still have my blue sweater?
- Yes.
- Oh, no, no, no...
- Uh, it's right in my room.
Right here, in the first door.
- Right there.
- Okay, thanks.
- WINSTON:
Oh, no, no.
- NICK:
That's nice.
Telling the truth works.
SCHMIDT:
Yeah, it did.
- CECE:
Good job.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait for it.
CAMILLA:
Freaking bitch!
(crashing)
I hate you!
I hate you so much!
- Oh.
- Yeah, it's the old
- "I left my sweater" trick.
- (Camilla roaring)
Let me tell you something, folks,
I've played that song before.
All right, well, this obviously turned out to be
- a huge disaster.
- I hate you so much!
- But... thank you.
- Try sleeping on an upside down bed!
I'm proud of you.
All of you...
I mean, you guys could've bailed on me, but you didn't.
You stuck around, and you helped me lie to a psychotic woman who is now destroying all of my stuff.
(Camilla yells)
- Anything to help.
- It's kind of what we do.
- It's how we roll.
- (Camilla shrieks)
- How do you think she's taking it?
- What's with all these ribbons?
!
How long do you think she's gonna be in there?
I like to do about 15.
CAMILLA:
You are never gonna forget me!
You are never gonna forget Camilla!
So, what'd you bring us for dinner?
CECE:
How about this one?
Are you ready to... soak Mama's beans?
- It's working, right?
- Okay, shh.
I love you.
- Yeah, I love you, too.
I love you.
- Let's not talk.
Okay.
(grunting)
Nick!
- What?
- You still can't eat
- in front of Reagan?
- This has nothing to do with Reagan.
I...
I've just gotten used to eating in here.
It's cozy.
Why, what are you guys up to?
- What?
- (knock at door)
Can I come in?
My room is trashed.
This is where we eat, right?
Yes, please, please, please.
- Might as well.
- I mean, sure, why not?
What?
I like the way you eat a burrito.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
¡Buenas noches!
(Winston speaking Spanish)
- Aah!
- Oh!
- Winston!
- Oh... oh...
All over the bed?
!
WINSTON:
I didn't get my huevos on you, did I?
Close your robe!
Okay!
Hey.
Uh, where'd you get these burritos?
From the spot on the corner?
- Mmm.
- Yeah, the spot on the corner.
You know I helped a lady give birth in the kitchen?
Ugh.
That's disgusting.
A baby in the middle of the place.
I knew that wasn't going to stop you.
- Disgusting.
- You didn't tell us you delivered a baby.
Baby's perfectly fine.
But let's just say I did not do a good job.
Oh, Reagan.
What's up?
Hey.
So, uh, I just jogged past a guy that's offering donkey rides for $50.
Feel like that's too much for a donkey ride, right?
It's a dog, not a donkey.
I know that guy.
His name is...
His name is Stan.
Stan.
S-T-A-N.
His dog's name's Cheerio.
Hold on.
It's not a donkey.
Um, it's a dog.
Okay.
That was painful, Nick.
It's like watching Cece make a bed.
Just give me the sheet!
I can't be normal around Reagan.
She's too hot and mysterious.
I mean, I haven't peed in four days, which is alarming because I have been drinking constantly.
Yep.
Nothing.
The fact of the matter is, is that she don't want to hang out with us.
She's our roommate, but she being straight up discourteous.
Reagan, why don't you join the fiesta, huh?
I'll make up a pitcher of margaritas.
That's tempting, but, uh, if I have one margarita, I'll have eight;
and if I have eight, end up riding that donkey all the way to Santa Monica, so...
It'd be great to watch you ride a donkey!
- Thanks, but no, thanks.
- There's extra toilet paper in the bathroom!
It's...
Are you hiding toilet paper again?
- I can't do this.
- Did she hit us with a "No, thanks"?
How about this?
No, thanks, to your "No, thanks."
Here's what I'm gonna do...
I'm gonna make her hang out with us whether she wants to or not.
Oh, yeah, this woman just made my nonsexual to-do list.
- You have a sexual to-do list?
- Cece, don't ask.
- Number one...
- I regret it already.
Joan Allen.
- Oh!
Nick!
- She's back in the kitchen!
She's back in the kitchen!
- Nick, we're making sex.
- It hasn't started yet.
It's not sex until you put the straw in the coconut.
It's called foreplay, you tween.
You don't just buy a Porsche off the lot and immediately enter it in the Groser Preis von Deutschland.
- What?
- The Groser Preis von Deutschland.
Just let me eat in here.
I don't want to eat around Reagan.
Why not?
Oh, I forgot that you're
- a bear in pants.
- Will you please go eat in your room?
She's right across the hall.
She'll hear the crunching!
We need you elsewhere, Nick.
From my cold, dead hands!
That doesn't even apply.
Reagan!
Ooh, what a coincidence.
We're both running!
And I've been chasing you for miles like a murderer!
- I kind of prefer to run alone.
- You see?
That's your problem right there.
We're roommates now, and in our loft, we do things together, like a family.
Ooh, look.
A bubbler.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, that's so good!
Mmm.
- There's a Band-Aid in there.
- Reagan?
Camilla.
Oh, my God.
Hi.
Why did I think you were still in Atlanta?
Oh, because last night you sent me a text saying, "Still in Atlanta."
Well, hello.
What have we here?
- Back on the stick, I see.
- No, no, no.
No.
No.
I'm just staying with him and his roommates.
Yeah, which is exactly why you got to start hanging out with us more.
- You know, we only got you for a month.
- I get you for a whole month?
I'm about to start binge-watching Ken Burns's Jazz.
Oh, Ken Burns's Jazz.
- Call you later.
I will.
- Do that.
- Call me, yes.
Okay, great.
- I'm going to.
Okay.
- Great.
- Can't wait.
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?
I am hooking up with her.
I'm dating her a little bit, but I'm over it, and I'm trying to avoid her.
What are you telling people I'm here for a month for?
Oh, you see what we're doing right now?
We're vibing, we're talking about stuff!
Okay, now it's my turn.
Let me do you.
Um...
I think I swallowed a Band-Aid earlier.
Now I have to dump her, and I have never dumped anybody before.
I don't know how.
- I travel so much that I usually just disappear.
- Wow.
Okay.
I will help you break up with her.
Why?
'Cause you've been dumped, like, a million times?
No.
Because I'm your roommate, and we have each other's backs.
Wait a minute.
What makes you think
- I've been dumped a lot?
- Please.
I read you guys the moment I got there.
Nick's deal is, he honest-to-God might be 50.
Schmidt's deal is he had to Shazam "Stairway to Heaven."
And your deal is you've been dumped a lot.
You're pretty good.
You're pretty good.
How did Nick go through so many napkins, yet get salsa everywhere?
We've got no privacy, and it has been way, way, way too long since Mama got her biscuits.
And the biscuits... are rising.
I hope they stick to the pan and get a little brown
- on the bottom.
- I'm gonna be honest.
That went right over my head.
I just didn't get it.
I don't know...
I don't know where you're going with it.
Plus, I can't concentrate.
It's filthy in here.
How do we keep Nick out of here?
!
He thinks that
Reagan is some sort of superhuman goddess.
Okay, well, the truth of the matter is, is I kind of get it.
You know, when we first met, I had to pretend that all kinds of things were wrong with you just so I wouldn't freak out.
You know, like, I gave you a glass eye for a while.
You had a wooden foot for a short period of time.
There was one week where I pretended that you were a Democrat.
I am a Democrat.
- Ah, that's so funny.
I love you.
- Okay.
- So we tell Nick she has a glass eye.
- He'll spin out.
He'll think the eye is a government-issued camera taking pictures for Langley.
Nick's a conspiracy theorist.
It's like an Irish carnival up there... just potato peels, broken rides, fiddle music, dreams left unfulfilled, bloodied soccer jerseys, bunch of women limping around named Moira.
Okay.
So all we have to do is find a detail that won't make him spin out.
Easy.
It'll be the opposite of easy.
- It will be difficult.
- Oh.
We need to come up with something so smart, so nuanced, so... unexpected, so surgical, that only a genius could think of it.
Reagan wears a wig.
- What?
Get out of here.
- No, it's true.
She-she told me.
- Oh, she told you?
- Yeah.
- When?
- Before.
Well, the timing definitely checks out.
The only question is why.
Personal, um, lady reasons.
I don't want to touch that.
"Reagan wears a wig."
"Told you before."
- Yep.
- "Because of lady stuff."
Wow.
I don't buy it.
Doesn't make sense.
- We failed.
- Patience.
I know my boy.
- But, Schmidt...
- I know my boy!
Hey, Nick.
Got to get busy living or get busy dying.
Heard.
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing is the question.
What are you doing?
- Were you just smelling my hair?
- No.
I'm just Nicky being Nicky.
Sometimes I feel like you're in one of those weird man-dog body-switch movies.
You like those, too?
Neither?
It's a wig.
Doesn't make sense!
What?
Ding, ding.
The biscuits are ready.
Well, did you make enough for Cousin Andy?
S...
I'm-I'm gonna tell you the truth.
I don't get that one, either.
Who the hell is Cousin Andy?
I just made it up.
Mmm.
Reagan, I've been broken up with so many times in so many different places.
Um, multiple parks, coffee shops, uh, Santa's lap,
Kitchen Stadium on Iron Chef, airplanes in economy, economy select, economy comfort, platinum economy, all covered in butterflies...
I feel like we have established your credentials.
Okay.
So I'm Camilla.
Break up with me.
Camilla...
Yes, baby.
I love you so much.
We have had a lot of really good times together,
- and I just...
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my goodness, oh, my God!
I knew this was comin'.
- Oh, my God, oh, my goodness.
- What-what are you doing?
Oh, no.
Are you breaking up with me?
Why you hate me?
Why you hate me so much?
- I don't...
I don't hate you.
I don't hate you.
- Oh, my God, you don't?
Oh, my goodness.
So you're not breaking up with me.
- We're gonna have such a happy life together.
- I-I...
I am.
I am breaking up with you.
Oh, my God, you is breakin' up with me.
Why you is breakin' up with me and stuff?
- Yo, this is mad crazy.
I'm pregnant with your child.
- Okay.
- That isn't possible.
- Yeah, his name is D'Lante.
We would never name our child that.
Yeah.
D-apostrophe-Lante.
No, I can't...
Look, I can't do this.
Look, I want you to be happy.
Here.
- Here's $80.
- Wow.
Really?
- You're just gonna bail?
- Yeah.
I suck at this, obviously.
- I don't want to hurt her.
- Honey, sit down, sit down, sit down.
Here.
Why don't you just be honest about why you're breaking up with her?
I don't... know.
- I just feel like it's over.
- Let me tell you about some reasons why I've been broken up with.
Um, "you're too nasty in bed, Winston."
Or "you remind me of my brother, Winston." Or... or "Winston, you spend too much time in the butterfly house."
- I have an idea.
- Okay.
What if you break up with Camilla for me?
I'm sorry, what?
Because obviously you understand how it feels, and you'll be much more gentle and empathetic.
What?
No, that is the exact opposite of what we're trying to accomplish here.
This is a very important moment in your life.
You see, you have the ability to change, and that is what I find the most beautiful about human beings.
If you do it, I will do a 20-minute roommate dinner.
Okay, deal.
- I been thinking...
- Damn it, Miller!
Maybe Winston was right.
How well do we know this Reagan character?
I mean, sure, she wears a wig.
Not a big deal.
Or, let me ask you, is it a big deal?
Ask yourself, what type of person wears a wig?
A bald person?
Sure.
I'll say so.
They're bald.
Somebody hiding something?
- Definitely.
- Okay, look.
Maybe she's not hiding anything, all right?
Beyoncé, Beyoncé wears wigs, and you would trust Beyoncé with your life.
Yeah, I'd trust Beyoncé with my life.
We be all night.
We be all night.
Nick, is it possible that you are maybe overthinking this just a little bit, okay?
'Cause, look, Reagan is a really good roommate.
She's quiet, she pays, she takes care of her room.
Her room.
That's it.
Great thinking.
That's why I love you.
That's why.
Not physically.
Uh, but as a person.
Like, um, it's not sexual.
I love you like a mother or a sister or a girlfriend.
It's not sexual.
Her room!
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Oh!
Jackpot.
Ribbons!
Oh, these are probably Jess's.
Nick, stop.
You should not be in here.
I am learning so much about you, Reagan.
An Ohio State T-shirt.
Cash from Canada.
It's Canadian cash.
A picture of a little boy.
This woman is like an orange.
You peel a layer, there's another layer there.
You're thinking of an onion.
An orange only has one layer.
- Oh, you poor thing.
- Okay, someone has to put everything back
- exactly like they found it.
- Well, it clearly is gonna be me, 'cause I'm the only one who can fold.
Nick, what are you doing?
I'm making a mess, but I'm finding the truth.
Okay, I'm gonna end this.
Nick, Reagan doesn't wear a wig.
We made the whole thing up.
- But I smelled it and I saw it.
- We couldn't get you
- out of our room.
- Why would you lie to me?
Well, we wouldn't need to lie to you if you would just talk to Reagan instead of hiding out in my room with your cheap Southwestern food.
- Talk to her?
Like a normal human being?
- Yes,
- that's exactly what I want you to do.
- Yes.
Mm-hmm.
I have nothing in common with that woman.
She is a goddess who's descended from the heavens.
And I'm just a mud man from the bowels of Chicago.
Let's clean this place up, and let's get out of here.
- She's gonna be home soon.
- Wait.
What are these?
"Sarah Nevada"? "Suzi Shimizu"?
That's Reagan's face.
These are fake I.D.'s.
Fake I.D.'s?
Okay.
It's f... it's fake identification.
You're damn right it is, Jack.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Look, this is a little bit weird, but I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for this.
Maybe Nick is onto something here, okay?
Because how much do we actually really know about her?
- Who has fake I.D.'s?
- I'll tell you who.
Con men.
Grifters.
It's all starting to make sense to me.
Check this out.
Let me break this down for you.
Okay?
She and her bastard son...
- Or her nephew.
- ...who she had with the Ohio State professor, go town to town, selling... let's say fake pills.
Pills.
Doctor.
Pharmacy.
Whatever she does.
To a bunch of maple-sucking tree huggers.
Aka those lovely stoners from the north, our Canadian brothers and sisters.
Let's just clean this place up, and let's get out of here.
Guys!
Winston made me bring home dinner.
- It's Reagan.
- Or is it Suzi?
Oh, Jewish God, why do you hate me?
Clean up the floor!
- Okay, yeah.
- She is the one who has to explain herself.
- Let her come in here.
- You have gone full Nick, Cece.
- What does that mean?
- She's bought into your nonsense!
Enough.
I'm very disappointed with you.
- Put this down.
I'll-I'll fold it.
- I just picked it up!
You don't know what you're doing.
- Hey, Reagan, come in here!
- No, no, Reagan!
- Don't come in here!
- There's a possum in here!
Don't come in here, 'cause there's...
What do you mean Reagan wants to break up with me?
Who are you?
- I'm her roommate.
- Oh, so she sent her roommate to break up with me?
Now I have no more questions.
Great.
Then I'm out.
Blessings.
Okay, look, um,
I know this is not ideal.
But if I'm being honest, she's got a lot
- of work to do emotionally.
- Are you really gonna let her get away with this?
You must know how this makes me feel.
You've clearly been dumped many times.
Why do people keep saying that?
You ordered a Shirley Temple.
It's a virgin Denzel.
If she wants to dump me, she should man up and look me in the eye.
You know what, she should have, and I told her that.
It's the least she could have done.
Hey, you're preaching to the choir.
Ask me how many times I've been dumped.
- I don't have the...
- 47 times.
And once on my birthday.
And out of that 47 times and once on my birthday, do you know what part hurts the most?
- Getting bailed on.
- Getting bailed on.
Why do people think they can just disappear on you?
They're not thinking at all.
Except of themselves.
Let's go find her.
Hell yeah.
Ooh, wait, wait, wait, I just thought about it,
- and that's not a good idea.
- Where is she?
How you... how you know I know where she at?
You said you're roommates.
Damn.
Bitten by my own snake.
So you all went through my room and you each have things that you would like to discuss.
Is that correct?
- That's true.
- Yes.
- Chicago.
So... the money, the fake I.D.'s.
I have fake I.D.'s because hospitals hate pharmaceutical reps and it gets me through the door.
I carry Canadian cash because I do a lot of business there and I don't trust banks.
Who does?
Okay.
All right, fine.
What about this, though... your son?
He looks just like you.
- That is me.
- Wait.
What?
Oof.
Rough haircut.
Oh, and if you found something in my room that kind of looks like a hollowed-out hand, that's a glove.
- So I went full Nick, huh?
- Yes, you went full Nick.
Right, yeah, I see that now.
I'm full Nick every day.
Imagine how that feels.
We all owe you an apology for... pretty much everything.
I'm sorry that we went through your room.
Well, that's not what I'm upset about.
I mean,
I went through all of your rooms when I first moved in.
- Excuse me?
- Wait, you went through our rooms?
- Oh, no.
- How else am I supposed to get to know you?
But the point is I didn't jump to conclusions.
I mean, Nick has a two-by-four in his room with a nail in it.
I didn't assume he was building a human cage.
I'm building a tree house.
You're doing wha... you're building a tree house?
Well, why am I not involved?
Why is Cece not involved?
- We want to be involved.
- Oh, I'm involved.
- So's Winston.
- What?
Everyone's involved in the tree house but I?
Forget about it.
Reagan, how would you like
- to build a tree house with me?
- No.
Reagan, we already got plans, we already got a two-by-four.
No.
I feel like we are really off-topic here.
What I'm trying to say is:
Why did you just assume that I'm a criminal?
Well, because these two are paranoid maniacs.
Who apparently are building a tree house together.
- Not apparently.
We are.
- Mm-hmm.
On the other hand, we hardly know anything about you.
Oh, my God.
Okay, that's what this is about?
Look, I'm-I'm only gonna be here for a few weeks.
There is no reason to get all emotionally involved.
Let's just keep it clean, and that way nobody gets upset.
I am so upset right now.
Uh, let me get ahead of this, roomie.
I did not help out today.
Camilla.
Hi, baby, hi.
- What are you doing here?
- Cut the crap.
- Why?
- You sent him to dump me?
No.
To dump you?
No.
Why would I do that...
Why would you do that?
- What the hell, man?
- That is crazy.
Why would anyone do that?
What's wrong with you?
Tell the truth, you sneaky woman.
Reagan, are you dumping me or not?
No.
Kind of.
Look, Camilla, I, uh...
I don't want to...
I don't want to hurt you.
Just say it.
Okay.
The truth is that I'm a criminal.
- What?
- I'm a criminal.
You shouldn't be with me.
I'm disgusting.
Things I've done.
Things I'm capable of.
Hard life, short life...
I probably won't live that long.
I can't believe this.
She's a criminal.
Filthy.
Disgusting crimes.
- One of the worst human beings I've ever met in my life.
- And who are you?
I'm her, uh, co-criminal.
Co-gangster.
We run the streets together.
From Bangkok to Chicago to here.
Just murdering people.
My name is Nick.
On the streets, they call me, uh...
- Sharky.
- Sharky, that's right.
'Cause I attack from beneath up.
It's all true, Camilla.
And her name is not Reagan.
It's Suzi Shimizu.
- You're Japanese?
- Very much so.
We happen... we happen to all be Japanese.
The unlucky offspring of a couple very lucky American GIs.
- Unnecessary backstory.
- Yeah, they call me the Moyel on the streets, 'cause I will, uh cut your penis off.
- Isn't that right, Sharky?
- You're on your own, Moyel.
And they call me Cece, but spelled S-I-S-I, with an accent over the last I.
I am spinning out here, Moyel.
You got to help me.
Why don't you go spin all the way over to your tree house?
- Schmidt knows about the tree house?
- Okay, what the hell is going on?
Winston, check for a wire... she could be a rat.
Stop it.
This isn't real.
You're telling us we're not a Japanese crime family?
Reagan, tell me the truth.
Reagan, seriously, just stop bailing.
I'll just go.
Camilla, wait.
Look...
This isn't working out.
But I think that it's my fault.
Because I don't let people in.
I'm sorry.
I think that you deserve a lot better than that.
Thank you.
I know that wasn't easy for you.
Okay, well, I'm gonna take off.
- Do you, um, still have my blue sweater?
- Yes.
- Oh, no, no, no...
- Uh, it's right in my room.
Right here, in the first door.
- Right there.
- Okay, thanks.
- Oh, no, no.
- That's nice.
Telling the truth works.
Yeah, it did.
- Good job.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait for it.
Freaking bitch!
I hate you!
I hate you so much!
- Oh.
- Yeah, it's the old
"I left my sweater" trick.
Let me tell you something, folks,
I've played that song before.
All right, well, this obviously turned out to be
- a huge disaster.
- I hate you so much!
- But... thank you.
- Try sleeping on an upside down bed!
I'm proud of you.
All of you...
I mean, you guys could've bailed on me, but you didn't.
You stuck around, and you helped me lie to a psychotic woman who is now destroying all of my stuff.
- Anything to help.
- It's kind of what we do.
It's how we roll.
- How do you think she's taking it?
- What's with all these ribbons?
!
How long do you think she's gonna be in there?
I like to do about 15.
You are never gonna forget me!
You are never gonna forget Camilla!
So, what'd you bring us for dinner?
How about this one?
Are you ready to... soak Mama's beans?
- It's working, right?
- Okay, shh.
I love you.
- Yeah, I love you, too.
I love you.
- Let's not talk.
Okay.
Nick!
- What?
- You still can't eat
- in front of Reagan?
- This has nothing to do with Reagan.
I...
I've just gotten used to eating in here.
It's cozy.
Why, what are you guys up to?
What?
Can I come in?
My room is trashed.
This is where we eat, right?
Yes, please, please, please.
- Might as well.
- I mean, sure, why not?
What?
I like the way you eat a burrito.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Â¡Buenas noches!
- Aah!
- Oh!
- Winston!
- Oh... oh...
All over the bed?
!
I didn't get my huevos on you, did I?
Close your robe!
Okay!
So, Friday night, I'm with this smokin' hot chick.
Her boyfriend was on the elevator, too.
He was even better looking.
They're making out so hard they don't even notice what comes out of her purse.
Bam!
Susan B. Anthony.
What?
Okay, what?
Another coin story?
Morning, gang.
Whoops.
Oh, thank God.
Jimmy, thank God.
Tell me about your night.
Oh!
Uh...
You're gonna like this.
I'm buckling my seat belt.
Last night, I'm in the produce department at the grocery store and I'm minding my own business.
And, uh, I'm not gonna lie,
I'm looking pretty good, right?
Mm-hmm.
Then I heard this girl call my name.
"Bimmy!"
Right? "Bimmy!"
Turns out to be my granddaughter Edie.
She calls me "Bimmy" now.
And you think that's crazy?
I looked down on their cart...
we have the same stuff.
Like baby stuff and snacks for when she comes over, and it's like, we got to start coordinating this!
(chuckling)
Anyway...
Uh...
And then...
This is the best part...
I'm, I go up to the, um, the checkout area and who's there?
Pam Anderson, Carmen Electra and Jenny McCarthy.
And they're like,
"Hey, Bimmy,
"you know, why don't you, uh, you know, come down to the MTV beach house?"
Can I see the coin again?
¶ ¶
(Jimmy groans)
When did I become so lame?
Hey, Jimmy.
What did you say to the guys in the kitchen?
They're really depressed.
A couple of them took off early.
I used to have the coolest life.
Now look at me.
I mean, I still look great...
Arguably, better.
I am getting more sleep...
You done complimenting yourself?
(snaps fingers) Something I got to do.
Cancel my morning.
I'm not sure who to call to cancel your three-hour nap.
See if you can push it to the afternoon.
Baby girl, are you excited to see your first movie with Mommy tonight?
Yeah, now that you're two, you can watch screens without the risk of developing long-term attention problems.
Like the ones Mommy has.
All right, tonight's feature presentation is The Little Mermaid!
Mm-hmm.
Oh, wait.
And if you turn down the brightness, well, you can barely see the cracks?
What?
Our daughter's not watching her first movie on a phone.
All right?
We're gonna use my set up: 50-inch LCD screen, 1080 P, 7.1 Dolby surround sound.
Hey, what's the cup holder sitch?
'Cause I'm not holding my own cup.
I have 13 cup holders.
I've had enough!
Look who it is, Edie.
Who is that?
Bimmy!
No, no, not Bimmy.
No offense, kid.
Bimmy is dead.
Bimmy!
Uh, what did I just say?
All right, everyone, do not,
I repeat, do not ask me to hang out with you tonight.
Wasn't planning on it.
I used to be Jimmy Martino, man about town.
Now I'm this boring guy who hangs out in the suburbs on the weekends with his family.
I'm-I'm...
Bimmy!
Watch yourself, sister.
Now, tonight I'm gonna get my groove back.
I'm putting the old gang back together.
That's right...
The Sat Pack.
What's the Sat Pack?
Please don't ask.
Go ahead, Gerald.
You're an adult.
Ask.
Finish your question.
Mom, I'm sorry, I have to know.
What's the Sat Pack?
(groans) The Sat Pack are my boys, okay?
And when you get us knuckleheads together... (sputters) watch out, anything can happen.
Uh, fistfights, threesomes.
We once took a trip to Mount Rushmore...
I never see these guys anymore, because I'm stuck with you people.
We call ourselves the Sat Pack, and do not,
I repeat, do not ask why.
Why do you call...
Gerald, you can see what he's doing, right?
Don't take the bait.
It's all I want to know.
It's a long story, son, but, you see...
It's because they hang out on Saturdays...
That's literally it.
Cool.
Yeah, I came up with the idea.
It's a satire on the Rat Pack.
(exhales)
Well, anyway, the point is,
I'm not hanging out with you guys tonight, okay?
Tonight I'm dead to you.
You got it?
That's fine, because we have plans tonight that have nothing to do with you.
Bruce found this great Chinese restaurant...
We get it...
Bruce used to live in China.
Look, I go to Cabo once a year...
You don't see me pushing tacos down everyone's throat.
And he is taking me out with Gerald and his girlfriend Frankie.
Oh. (Chuckles)
You're going on a double date with your son?
Man, if Ronnie from the Sat Pack were here, he'd be like, "Oh, guys, that's so lame!"
JIMMY (chuckles):
You know...
I'm gonna leave.
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
You drove all the way here just to brag about your plans tonight?
You could've called.
No, I came to pick up my, uh... my spoon.
Sat Pack!
Sat Pack!
JIMMY:
Ravi, Annelise, I'm here for pleasure tonight, so the restaurant's in your hands.
Just do what I would do.
Mm-hmm.
Suck up to celebrities and hit on women?
Got it.
Jimmy, Jimmy, I can absolutely hold down the fort tonight, or... hear me out...
I go out with you guys, we have such a good time you make me a member of the Sat Pack.
What was the first option?
You make a member of the Sat Pack.
Get back to work.
Boys!
Hey, Mr. Mom!
Hey!
What, PTA meeting run late, or were you out back pumping breast milk?
Ha-ha!
(Laughter)
I deserve that, I know.
It's been a long time, guys, but I promise I'm gonna make it up to you tonight.
Tonight's gonna be like the old days, huh?
Where's Ronnie?
I'm right here, you son of a bitch.
(restaurant chatter stops)
Ronnie, hey!
You know what?
You blow us off for months, and then you call us out of nowhere and you expect us to come running.
So I think I speak for all of us when I say...
Hit it.
¶ ¶ Ha-ha!
¶ Happy Saturday to you ¶ (laughing)
¶ I've been drinkin' since two ¶
¶ You're as sexy ¶
¶ As your mother... ¶
¶ So drop your pants and let's... ¶
Oh!
Hug.
I was gonna say hug.
Two men can't drop their pants and hug anymore?
JIMMY:
I missed you, you bastard.
Salute me.
Oh, God, yeah, this is...
this is good.
Ooh.
Cheers.
Cheers.
(laughs) This place is great, right?
They got the best soup dumplings outside of China.
What is it with these communal tables?
You know, I don't want to sit next to some weird strangers eavesdropping on our conversation.
They just got a labradoodle.
Why do I know that?
Well, so listen, I didn't just bring you guys to Din Tai Chow because they've got the best xiaolongbao.
I also came...
with some big news.
Am I gonna finally be a big brother?
(laughing):
No, that's... not possible.
I was transferred from China to the U.S.
about a month ago, right?
And everything has been wonderful.
The lab in Beijing doesn't agree.
They're calling me back.
Oh, my God.
You're leaving again?
It's crazy, I know, but it's totally out of my control.
And they're giving me a 30% raise.
And it's only gonna be for a few years.
So you brought us here to tell us that you're leaving?
No.
I brought you here to ask you if you're coming.
Will you move to China with me, Sara?
This is a big decision, I know, and I totally understand if you want to take your time.
No.
Uh... no, you don't want to... take your time, or-or-or no, you... do want to move to China?
I'm not moving to China, Bruce.
So, I heard you got a labradoodle.
Hey, okay, Edie, we're gonna watch The Little Mermaid,
Mommy's favorite non- Fast and Furious movie, and then we're gonna make a mermaid cake.
Yay!
Yay!
Okay.
First, let's figure out which one of Daddy's jillion remotes turns on the TV.
Huh?
Oh.
I think this remote turned on that remote.
Mmm.
Ah.
On demand.
Well, never seen this screen before.
Here we go. "Buy now."
"Shinjumatsu Films."
"The Littlest Fishgirl and Michu Michu."
(screams) (roars)
(gasps) Hold on, hold on.
Oh, don't look, don't look.
Oh, no, which remote is it?
Michu!
Michu!
(Edie screams, cries)
Michu!
Michu!
Ugh, Gerald!
¶ ¶
(whoops)
JIMMY:
Stevie, don't be shy.
Oop.
Whoa, whoa.
Aah.
(laughing)
Sat Pack!
Sat Pack!
Greatest group of morons you'll ever want to meet.
All right, everybody, this is Marco, he's a plastic surgeon.
Does all the big-time breast reductions in Hollywood.
And this of course is Stevie.
Stevie, uh produces the reality show about the racist family who runs a business.
And this is my best friend since I'm 20 years old,
Ronnie.
Ah, Ronnie.
Ah...
Jimmy.
Ronnie bought and sold the biggest solar company in California.
Don't worry, ladies, I don't really care about the environment.
(laughing)
Last but not least.
Ladies, they call me Ravi.
I'm in charge of all things kitchen.
Here's a little rap to remember my name.
(rapping):
Yo, my name is Rav, I fit like a glove...
Is someone's elbow on the button, guys?
Alicia, I think, uh, you and Ronnie might hit it off.
You know, he's recently single.
Oh, really?
Yes, actually, my wife just left me for another man.
Older and richer or younger and poorer?
Older and much poorer.
ALL:
Ooh.
Well, tonight's not about past mistakes.
It's about making new ones, right?
Like getting that stain out of your shirt right there.
What?
Aah, you don't have one!
Ronnie!
(laughing)
(bantering indistinctly)
They don't make men like this anymore.
Coolest of the cool.
JIMMY:
I'm coming in for the nipple.
(no audio)
(sighs) Wow, that's rough.
He really thought she was gonna move to China for him.
Talk about being on different pages.
Yeah.
L-Let's never be like that, okay?
You know, l-let's make sure we're always on the same page?
Starting now.
Do we really need to worry about that right now?
I mean, we're not even exclusive.
We're not?
(Short laugh)
Really?
You're dating other guys?
I'm sorry, Not to put you on the spot.
No, no, no, I'm just trying to count how many other guys I'm dating.
Now, this is gonna seem high because I was just in Aruba.
All right, let's just back it up.
Uh, here's what I know.
I know we haven't been dating very long, but I-I really like you.
And I-I think maybe we should be exclusive.
Now you go.
You're a really great guy.
And-and we've had a lot of fun.
Ooh, I like where this is going.
But we're obviously in very different places.
You want to move fast, maybe because you have a child.
Not sure we're looking for the same thing.
I think we should break up.
(short laugh) Wow.
It was good to have this conversation.
That way we could end things before either of us got hurt.
Ooh, are these shrimp?
Mmm.
(chuckling) Make yourselves at home.
(all chattering) Play Party Playlist.
(upbeat music starts playing) Jimmy, keep this thing going.
I'm gonna take a quick shower.
What?
Yeah.
Ronnie.
Bring it in.
Jimmy. (Laughs)
I freaking love you.
I freaking love you, man.
It's gonna get crazy tonight.
It's gonna get the craziest.
You gonna pull away?
'Cause I'm not.
I'm not pulling away.
All right, we both pull away on three.
Ready?
Yeah.
BOTH:
One, two, three.
Aah!
(Laugh) I didn't pull away.
I didn't do it.
I didn't pull it.
Never.
Dad, thank God you're here.
I need to talk to you.
Play Tender Folk Mix.
(music switches to folk) ¶ Every now and again... ¶
Hey.
What are you doing here?
I thought I was supposed to be dead to you tonight.
Okay, I'm sorry, I didn't know you had plans.
I drove all the way to Pasadena to tell you.
But I thought that was to borrow a spoon.
(sighs) Gerald...
I have the Sat Pack here.
Well, now you got the Sad Pack here, too.
Party of me.
I get it.
Clever.
Eh...
Let's move on.
What-what's up tonight?
Frankie and I broke up.
Oh, I'm sorry, son.
Thanks.
Hey, what's the ice cream situation here?
Ah, maybe it'll make me feel better just to tell you how I'm feeling:
Awful.
No, that did nothing.
God, I just want to curl up with a root beer float, depending on the ice cream situation.
Mm.
You have people here.
I'm sorry, I-I should let you go.
Okay.
It wouldn't suck to not be alone tonight.
(sighs) All right, you can stay.
But don't unload your feelings on everyone.
It's not good for you and it's not good for the party.
You need a good Sat Pack night.
This'll be good for you...
To cut loose a little bit, have some fun, break some hearts, right?
Okay.
You running with the pack tonight?
Fresh meat.
Go unclog the shower, pledge.
Just kidding.
Happy to have you.
So then the goat looks back at me and says, "You're being baad." (all laugh)
What's going on?
I'm just telling one of my funny stories.
(laughs) Hilarious.
Can I hear it?
You want me to tell the whole story again?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
There's only so many times I can hump your couch.
Shots?
None for me, thanks.
I feel like I've already taken a shot.
To the gut.
That's my son Gerald, everybody.
That's Gerald.
He, uh, he's having sort of a rough night, but he promised he wouldn't kill the vibe, right?
Oh, no, what happened?
Uh, he'll be fine, don't worry.
It's okay.
I've been sort of "forbidden" to talk about it.
Oh...
Aw.
You can tell us.
Where do I begin?
(sighs)
It's just never been a challenge for me to be vulnerable, you know?
When I was 17, I was 290 pounds.
Spoiler alert:
It wasn't all muscle.
Mmm.
So...
I guess we'll do the long-distance thing, you know?
We'll... meet up, like, once a year and talk on the phone sometimes.
Yeah.
You know, it's only a 15-hour time difference, right?
So, 8:00 p.m. for me is, like... 5:00 a.m. for me.
I'm in a great mood then.
So I only ate the veggie dumplings, so how are we gonna do the bill?
I just wish I could erase this awful feeling, you know?
Guess it'll just take time.
I think the problem is that I open myself up too easily.
Gerald, that's not a problem.
Everyone else is the problem.
Yeah, you know what, uh,
I'm exactly like Gerald.
I love to love.
I got a heart the size of a freakin' cheese wheel.
Can you move?
You're sitting on my purse.
Kind of like it?
No.
Okay, excuse me.
Hey, Jimmy, you know what the best part of having your son here is?
What?
No, I'm asking you because I can't think of anything.
Don't worry.
The key to unlock this night is coming through this door in three, two, one.
I can't believe you made me wait out there for ten minutes just so you could be dramatic.
I'm a showman.
All right, what do you got?
I made some calls, got us into a yacht party hosted by the Winklevoss twins.
A yacht party...
I like that.
I'm gonna make this up to you.
It's all good.
Boob cage can make it up to me on the boat.
You're going with us?
Who's watching my restaurant?
Ian's got it covered.
Uh, everybody?
The Sat Pack's going to a yacht party!
(excited chattering) (laughs)
(groans) These dumb remotes!
Screw it.
I'm killing the movie.
Let's just make the cake.
(rattling)
Edie?
All right, let's get our story straight.
I was teaching you to read when you tied me up and did this to yourself.
Okay, Mommy.
¶ ¶
See, Ronnie, it always works out for us.
Ten minutes we'll be on a yacht with a couple of blond twins.
Male twins but still.
I call the ugly Winklevoss.
(both laugh)
Yeah.
Plus, once we're out at sea, none of your other family members can get to us.
(laughter) (sighs)
All right, I deserve that.
Mm.
I'm just kidding with you, buddy.
Why don't we make like old times and stop and donate blood on the way to the party?
See if we can drunk faster.
(chuckles) Possibly even save a life.
(phone chimes)
Huh...
(whooping from inside limo)
Yacht party!
Yacht party!
Yacht!
Yacht!
Yacht!
Yacht!
Ya...
Where the hell are we?
Why are we stopping here?
Oh, well, you never know where a Sat Pack night's gonna take you:
Yacht party, Playboy Mansion, Sara's house.
I'll be back in five.
All right, you got five minutes of my time.
Make 'em count.
I got a yacht to catch.
What are you doing here?
I didn't tell you to come.
Well, you texted me because you wanted me to come.
Let's not do this dance.
All right, what's up?
Well, since you're here...
I'm about to get mine.
Watch and learn.
Hey.
Hi.
So, I couldn't help but notice that neither of us have boyfriends here tonight.
Oh, mine's in Sacramento for a medical convention.
Where's yours?
Ouch.
I'll take it from here.
(grunts)
I'm gay.
Thanks for talking to me about this, Alicia.
Of course.
Do you feel any better?
I'm dead inside.
I'm a husk of a man.
What the hell is taking Jimmy so long?
Move to China?
That's-that's a big ask.
Yeah.
But the old me would have done that at the drop of a hat.
My plan was always to live all over the world.
Los Angeles was just the first stop.
And then Gerald came along, and so I told myself,
"I will see the world when he moves out of the house."
Mm.
Good luck with that.
Have you seen what I pay him?
(chuckles) And then there was Edie.
(chuckles)
All of a sudden the idea of moving is just ridiculous.
Even if it's for Bruce.
Well, you know what they say.
Things happen for a reason, right?
Maybe the best guy for you is right here in Los Angeles.
You know, Ronnie's single now.
(both laugh)
All right, I'm starting to feel this wine.
Couple more glasses of this,
I would consider making a trip to Ronnie-ville.
(knocking)
What the hell is this?
Oh, hey, Ronnie!
I was just talking about how I was gonna have sex with you, but I'm not going to.
Nice to see you, too, Sara.
Jimmy, you said five minutes.
It's been 20.
Well, Sara needed me.
This is important.
All right.
I'm leaving.
Why?
Why?
Tonight was supposed to be about us.
Yeah.
And while you're sitting here, sipping on wine, I've been out, sitting on my thumb, in some driveway in the freaking boondocks.
It's Pasadena.
And it's charming.
Well, great.
Have fun.
I'll just go back out there and listen to your daughter Gerald tell me all about her problems.
All right, you know what, it's time for you to calm down, because I'm starting to see the vein.
Good!
The vein comes out for a reason.
Yeah.
You're the reason.
Yeah, well, when the vein comes out, the hand comes out, remember?
I remember.
Remember the last time your hand came out?
I did this.
Ha, ha, you like that, Grandpa?
(gasps)
'Cause I... (grunts)
Oh!
Wow.
That felt good.
I did need to cut loose.
I'm gonna go make out with Alicia real quick.
Wh... (Ronnie groans)
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Just horny.
You're always horny.
You want my forehead again?
(chuckles)
Yeah, but this time it's different.
I think I'm horny for what you have.
I'm horny for family.
I know you, Ronnie.
Someday you're gonna find out you have a kid you didn't know about, too.
Thanks, man.
Hey, guys, yeah, can we speed this up?
You're kind of making us late to the yacht party.
Ian, what are you doing here?
And who's running the restaurant?
Thank you for coming.
This was by far the best experience we've had at Jimmy's.
Whatever you're doing, don't change a thing.
Okay.
Well?
To the yacht, huh?
Definitely.
Hell yeah.
What time is it, about 1:00?
It's got to be later than that.
It's 10:30.
Oh, great, you're here!
Edie won't take a bath unless it's with you.
Bimmy.
All right.
Come on.
Come on, you.
(grunts) You're all...
(sputters)
(Vanessa laughs)
(indistinct chatter)
RONNIE:
All right, let's do this!
Yacht party!
(cheering, whooping) (door closing)
Yes, I'd like a cab to Valley Village, please.
Unbelievable.
Everything okay, Jimmy?
No, it's not okay.
I asked for one night off.
And do I get it?
No.
Because I-I got to be here for you guys.
"Dad, can you help me navigate the seas of love?"
And "Jimmy, my boyfriend's moving to China."
(squeaking) Can you comfort me?"
Never asked him.
Couldn't get him to leave.
And the worst part is I don't have a choice.
I have to be here for you now because I care about you, and it's annoying.
I can't even enjoy violent rap songs because of her.
What's wrong with Jimmy?
He's saying nice things in a mad voice.
Yeah, because I am mad.
Here.
You're taking advantage of me, and-and I am mad because it's Saturday night and I have to spend my night in a bathtub because I'm the only one in this family who knows how to make bath time fun.
(squeaking)
I'm in hell.
(blows) (jabbers)
Ooh.
So, Friday night, I'm with this smokin' hot chick.
Her boyfriend was on the elevator, too.
He was even better looking.
They're making out so hard they don't even notice what comes out of her purse.
Bam!
Susan B. Anthony.
- What?
- Okay, what?
Another coin story?
- Morning, gang.
- Whoops.
Oh, thank God.
Jimmy, thank God.
Tell me about your night.
Oh!
Uh...
You're gonna like this.
I'm buckling my seat belt.
Last night, I'm in the produce department at the grocery store and I'm minding my own business.
And, uh, I'm not gonna lie,
- I'm looking pretty good, right?
- Mm-hmm.
Then I heard this girl call my name.
"Bimmy!"
Right? "Bimmy!"
Turns out to be my granddaughter Edie.
She calls me "Bimmy" now.
And you think that's crazy?
I looked down on their cart...
we have the same stuff.
Like baby stuff and snacks for when she comes over, and it's like, we got to start coordinating this!
Anyway...
Uh...
And then... this is the best part...
I'm, I go up to the, um, the checkout area and who's there?
Pam Anderson, Carmen Electra and Jenny McCarthy.
And they're like,
"Hey, Bimmy,
"you know, why don't you, uh, you know, come down to the MTV beach house?"
Can I see the coin again?
When did I become so lame?
Hey, Jimmy.
What did you say to the guys in the kitchen?
They're really depressed.
A couple of them took off early.
I used to have the coolest life.
Now look at me.
I mean, I still look great... arguably, better.
I am getting more sleep...
You done complimenting yourself?
Something I got to do.
Cancel my morning.
I'm not sure who to call to cancel your three-hour nap.
See if you can push it to the afternoon.
Baby girl, are you excited to see your first movie with Mommy tonight?
Yeah, now that you're two, you can watch screens without the risk of developing long-term attention problems.
Like the ones Mommy has.
All right, tonight's feature presentation is The Little Mermaid!
Mm-hmm.
Oh, wait.
And if you turn down the brightness, well, you can barely see the cracks?
What?
Our daughter's not watching her first movie on a phone.
All right?
We're gonna use 50-inch LCD screen, 1080 P, 7.1 Dolby surround sound.
Hey, what's the cup holder sitch?
'Cause I'm not holding my own cup.
I have 13 cup holders.
I've had enough!
Look who it is, Edie.
Who is that?
Bimmy!
No, no, not Bimmy.
No offense, kid.
Bimmy is dead.
Bimmy!
Uh, what did I just say?
All right, everyone, do not,
I repeat, do not ask me to hang out with you tonight.
Wasn't planning on it.
I used to be Jimmy Martino, man about town.
Now I'm this boring guy who hangs out in the suburbs on the weekends with his family.
I'm-I'm...
- Bimmy!
- Watch yourself, sister.
Now, tonight I'm gonna get my groove back.
I'm putting the old gang back together.
That's right... the Sat Pack.
What's the Sat Pack?
- Please don't ask.
- Go ahead, Gerald.
You're an adult.
Ask.
Finish your question.
Mom, I'm sorry, I have to know.
What's the Sat Pack?
The Sat Pack are my boys, okay?
And when you get us knuckleheads together... watch out, anything can happen.
Uh, fistfights, threesomes.
We once took a trip to Mount Rushmore...
I never see these guys anymore, because I'm stuck with you people.
We call ourselves the Sat Pack, and do not,
I repeat, do not ask why.
- Why do you call...
- Gerald, you can see what he's doing, right?
Don't take the bait.
It's all I want to know.
It's a long story, son, but, you see...
It's because they hang out on Saturdays...
- that's literally it.
- Cool.
Yeah, I came up with the idea.
It's a satire on the Rat Pack.
Well, anyway, the point is,
I'm not hanging out with you guys tonight, okay?
Tonight I'm dead to you.
You got it?
That's fine, because we have plans tonight that have nothing to do with you.
Bruce found this great Chinese restaurant...
We get it...
Bruce used to live in China.
Look, I go to Cabo once a year... you don't see me pushing tacos down everyone's throat.
And he is taking me out with Gerald and his girlfriend Frankie.
Oh.
You're going on a double date with your son?
Man, if Ronnie from the Sat Pack were here, he'd be like, "Oh, guys, that's so lame!"
You know...
I'm gonna leave.
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
You drove all the way here just to brag about your plans tonight?
- You could've called.
- No, I came to pick up my, uh... my spoon.
Sat Pack!
Sat Pack!
Ravi, Annelise, I'm here for pleasure tonight, so the restaurant's in your hands.
- Just do what I would do.
- Mm-hmm.
Suck up to celebrities and hit on women?
Got it.
Jimmy, Jimmy, I can absolutely hold down the fort tonight, or... hear me out...
I go out with you guys, we have such a good time you make me a member of the Sat Pack.
What was the first option?
You make a member of the Sat Pack.
Get back to work.
Boys!
Hey, Mr. Mom!
Hey!
What, PTA meeting run late, or were you out back pumping breast milk?
Ha-ha!
I deserve that, I know.
It's been a long time, guys, but I promise I'm gonna make it up to you tonight.
Tonight's gonna be like the old days, huh?
Where's Ronnie?
I'm right here, you son of a bitch.
Ronnie, hey!
You know what?
You blow us off for months, and then you call us out of nowhere and you expect us to come running.
So I think I speak for all of us when I say... hit it.
Ha-ha!
♪ Happy Saturday to you ♪
♪ I've been drinkin' since two ♪
♪ You're as sexy ♪
♪ As your mother... ♪
♪ So drop your pants and let's... ♪
Oh!
Hug.
I was gonna say hug.
Two men can't drop their pants and hug anymore?
I missed you, you bastard.
Salute me.
Oh, God, yeah, this is... this is good.
Ooh.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
This place is great, right?
They got the best soup dumplings outside of China.
What is it with these communal tables?
You know, I don't want to sit next to some weird strangers eavesdropping on our conversation.
They just got a labradoodle.
Why do I know that?
Well, so listen, I didn't just bring you guys to Din Tai Chow because they've got the best xiaolongbao.
I also came... with some big news.
Am I gonna finally be a big brother?
No, that's... not possible.
I was transferred from China to the U.S.
about a month ago, right?
And everything has been wonderful.
The lab in Beijing doesn't agree.
They're calling me back.
Oh, my God.
You're leaving again?
It's crazy, I know, but it's totally out of my control.
And they're giving me a 30% raise.
And it's only gonna be for a few years.
So you brought us here to tell us that you're leaving?
No.
I brought you here to ask you if you're coming.
Will you move to China with me, Sara?
This is a big decision, I know, and I totally understand if you want to take your time.
No.
Uh... no, you don't want to... take your time, or-or-or no, you... do want to move to China?
I'm not moving to China, Bruce.
So, I heard you got a labradoodle.
Hey, okay, Edie, we're gonna watch The Little Mermaid,
Mommy's favorite non- Fast and Furious movie, and then we're gonna make a mermaid cake.
Yay!
Yay!
Okay.
First, let's figure out which one of Daddy's jillion remotes turns on the TV.
Huh?
Oh.
I think this remote turned on that remote.
Mmm.
Ah.
On demand.
Well, never seen this screen before.
Here we go. "Buy now."
"Shinjumatsu Films."
"The Littlest Fishgirl and Michu Michu."
Hold on, hold on.
Oh, don't look, don't look.
Oh, no, which remote is it?
Michu!
Michu!
Michu!
Michu!
Ugh, Gerald!
Stevie, don't be shy.
- Oop.
- Whoa, whoa.
Aah.
Sat Pack!
Sat Pack!
Greatest group of morons you'll ever want to meet.
All right, everybody, this is Marco, he's a plastic surgeon.
Does all the big-time breast reductions in Hollywood.
And this of course is Stevie.
Stevie, uh produces the reality show about the racist family who runs a business.
And this is my best friend since I'm 20 years old,
Ronnie.
- Ah, Ronnie.
- Ah...
Jimmy.
Ronnie bought and sold the biggest solar company in California.
Don't worry, ladies, I don't really care about the environment.
Last but not least.
Ladies, they call me Ravi.
I'm in charge of all things kitchen.
Here's a little rap to remember my name.
Yo, my name is Rav, I fit like a glove...
Is someone's elbow on the button, guys?
Alicia, I think, uh, you and Ronnie might hit it off.
- You know, he's recently single.
- Oh, really?
Yes, actually, my wife just left me for another man.
Older and richer or younger and poorer?
Older and much poorer.
Ooh.
Well, tonight's not about past mistakes.
It's about making new ones, right?
Like getting that stain out of your shirt right there.
- What?
- Aah, you don't have one!
Ronnie!
They don't make men like this anymore.
Coolest of the cool.
I'm coming in for the nipple.
Wow, that's rough.
He really thought she was gonna move to China for him.
Talk about being on different pages.
Yeah.
L-Let's never be like that, okay?
You know, l-let's make sure we're always on the same page?
Starting now.
Do we really need to worry about that right now?
I mean, we're not even exclusive.
We're not?
Really?
You're dating other guys?
I'm sorry, not to put you on the spot.
No, no, no, I'm just trying to count how many other guys I'm dating.
Now, this is gonna seem high because I was just in Aruba.
All right, let's just back it up.
Uh, here's what I know.
I know we haven't been dating very long, but I-I really like you.
And I-I think maybe we should be exclusive.
Now you go.
You're a really great guy.
And-and we've had a lot of fun.
Ooh, I like where this is going.
But we're obviously in very different places.
You want to move fast, maybe because you have a child.
Not sure we're looking for the same thing.
I think we should break up.
Wow.
It was good to have this conversation.
That way we could end things before either of us got hurt.
Ooh, are these shrimp?
Mmm.
Make yourselves at home.
Play Party Playlist.
Jimmy, keep this thing going.
I'm gonna take a quick shower.
- What?
- Yeah.
Ronnie.
Bring it in.
Jimmy.
- I freaking love you.
- I freaking love you, man.
It's gonna get crazy tonight.
It's gonna get the craziest.
You gonna pull away?
'Cause I'm not.
I'm not pulling away.
All right, we both pull away on three.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
One, two, three.
Aah!
I didn't pull away.
- I didn't do it.
- I didn't pull it.
Never.
Dad, thank God you're here.
I need to talk to you.
Play Tender Folk Mix.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
I thought I was supposed to be dead to you tonight.
Okay, I'm sorry, I didn't know you had plans.
I drove all the way to Pasadena to tell you.
But I thought that was to borrow a spoon.
Gerald...
I have the Sat Pack here.
Well, now you got the Sad Pack here, too.
Party of me.
I get it.
Clever.
Eh...
Let's move on.
What-what's up tonight?
Frankie and I broke up.
Oh, I'm sorry, son.
Thanks.
Hey, what's the ice cream situation here?
Ah, maybe it'll make me feel better just to tell you how I'm feeling:
awful.
No, that did nothing.
God, I just want to curl up with a root beer float, depending on the ice cream situation.
- Mm.
- You have people here.
I'm sorry, I-I should let you go.
- Okay.
- It wouldn't suck to not be alone tonight.
All right, you can stay.
But don't unload your feelings on everyone.
It's not good for you and it's not good for the party.
You need a good Sat Pack night.
This'll be good for you...
to cut loose a little bit, have some fun, break some hearts, right?
Okay.
You running with the pack tonight?
Fresh meat.
Go unclog the shower, pledge.
Just kidding.
Happy to have you.
So then the goat looks back at me and says, "You're being baad."
- What's going on?
- I'm just telling one of my funny stories.
Hilarious.
Can I hear it?
You want me to tell the whole story again?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
There's only so many times I can hump your couch.
Shots?
None for me, thanks.
I feel like I've already taken a shot.
To the gut.
That's my son Gerald, everybody.
That's Gerald.
He, uh, he's having sort of a rough night, but he promised he wouldn't kill the vibe, right?
Oh, no, what happened?
Uh, he'll be fine, don't worry.
It's okay.
I've been sort of "forbidden" to talk about it.
Oh...
Aw.
You can tell us.
Where do I begin?
It's just never been a challenge for me to be vulnerable, you know?
When I was 17, I was 290 pounds.
It wasn't all muscle.
Mmm.
So...
I guess we'll do the long-distance thing, you know?
We'll... meet up, like, once a year
- and talk on the phone sometimes.
- Yeah.
You know, it's only a 15-hour time difference, right?
So, 8:00 p.m. for me is, like... 5:00 a.m. for me.
I'm in a great mood then.
So I only ate the veggie dumplings, so how are we gonna do the bill?
I just wish I could erase this awful feeling, you know?
Guess it'll just take time.
I think the problem is that I open myself up too easily.
Gerald, that's not a problem.
Everyone else is the problem.
Yeah, you know what, uh,
I'm exactly like Gerald.
I love to love.
I got a heart the size of a freakin' cheese wheel.
Can you move?
You're sitting on my purse.
- Kind of like it?
- No.
Okay, excuse me.
Hey, Jimmy, you know what the best part of having your son here is?
What?
No, I'm asking you because I can't think of anything.
Don't worry.
The key to unlock this night is coming through this door in three, two, one.
I can't believe you made me wait out there for ten minutes just so you could be dramatic.
I'm a showman.
All right, what do you got?
I made some calls, got us into a yacht party hosted by the Winklevoss twins.
A yacht party...
I like that.
I'm gonna make this up to you.
It's all good.
Boob cage can make it up to me on the boat.
You're going with us?
Who's watching my restaurant?
Ian's got it covered.
Uh, everybody?
The Sat Pack's going to a yacht party!
These dumb remotes!
Screw it.
I'm killing the movie.
Let's just make the cake.
Edie?
All right, let's get our story straight.
I was teaching you to read when you tied me up and did this to yourself.
Okay, Mommy.
See, Ronnie, it always works out for us.
Ten minutes we'll be on a yacht with a couple of blond twins.
Male twins but still.
I call the ugly Winklevoss.
Yeah.
Plus, once we're out at sea, none of your other family members can get to us.
All right, I deserve that.
Mm.
I'm just kidding with you, buddy.
Why don't we make like old times and stop and donate blood on the way to the party?
See if we can drunk faster.
Possibly even save a life.
Huh... _
_
_
Yacht party!
Yacht party!
Yacht!
Yacht!
Yacht!
Yacht!
Ya...
Where the hell are we?
Why are we stopping here?
Oh, well, you never know where a Sat Pack night's gonna take you:
yacht party, Playboy Mansion, Sara's house.
I'll be back in five.
All right, you got five minutes of my time.
Make 'em count.
I got a yacht to catch.
What are you doing here?
I didn't tell you to come.
Well, you texted me because you wanted me to come.
Let's not do this dance.
All right, what's up?
Well, since you're here...
I'm about to get mine.
Watch and learn.
- Hey.
- Hi.
So, I couldn't help but notice that neither of us have boyfriends here tonight.
Oh, mine's in Sacramento for a medical convention.
Where's yours?
Ouch.
I'll take it from here.
I'm gay.
Thanks for talking to me about this, Alicia.
Of course.
Do you feel any better?
I'm dead inside.
I'm a husk of a man.
What the hell is taking Jimmy so long?
Move to China?
That's-that's a big ask.
Yeah.
But the old me would have done that at the drop of a hat.
My plan was always to live all over the world.
Los Angeles was just the first stop.
And then Gerald came along, and so I told myself,
"I will see the world when he moves out of the house."
Mm.
Good luck with that.
Have you seen what I pay him?
And then there was Edie.
All of a sudden the idea of moving is just ridiculous.
Even if it's for Bruce.
Well, you know what they say.
Things happen for a reason, right?
Maybe the best guy for you is right here in Los Angeles.
You know, Ronnie's single now.
All right, I'm starting to feel this wine.
Couple more glasses of this,
I would consider making a trip to Ronnie-ville.
What the hell is this?
Oh, hey, Ronnie!
I was just talking about how I was gonna have sex with you, but I'm not going to.
Nice to see you, too, Sara.
Jimmy, you said five minutes.
It's been 20.
Well, Sara needed me.
This is important.
- All right.
I'm leaving.
- Why?
Why?
Tonight was supposed to be about us.
Yeah.
And while you're sitting here, sipping on wine, I've been out, sitting on my thumb, in some driveway in the freaking boondocks.
It's Pasadena.
And it's charming.
Well, great.
Have fun.
I'll just go back out there and listen to your daughter Gerald tell me all about her problems.
All right, you know what, it's time for you to calm down, because I'm starting to see the vein.
Good!
The vein comes out for a reason.
Yeah.
You're the reason.
Yeah, well, when the vein comes out, the hand comes out, remember?
I remember.
Remember the last time your hand came out?
I did this.
Ha, ha, you like that, Grandpa?
'Cause I...
Oh!
Wow.
That felt good.
I did need to cut loose.
I'm gonna go make out with Alicia real quick.
Wh...
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Just horny.
You're always horny.
You want my forehead again?
Yeah, but this time it's different.
I think I'm horny for what you have.
I'm horny for family.
I know you, Ronnie.
Someday you're gonna find out you have a kid you didn't know about, too.
Thanks, man.
Hey, guys, yeah, can we speed this up?
You're kind of making us late to the yacht party.
Ian, what are you doing here?
And who's running the restaurant?
Thank you for coming.
This was by far the best experience we've had at Jimmy's.
Whatever you're doing, don't change a thing.
Okay.
Well?
To the yacht, huh?
Definitely.
Hell yeah.
What time is it, about 1:00?
It's got to be later than that.
It's 10:30.
Oh, great, you're here!
Edie won't take a bath unless it's with you.
Bimmy.
All right.
Come on.
Come on, you.
You're all...
All right, let's do this!
Yacht party!
Yes, I'd like a cab to Valley Village, please.
Unbelievable.
Everything okay, Jimmy?
No, it's not okay.
I asked for one night off.
And do I get it?
No.
Because I-I got to be here for you guys.
"Dad, can you help me navigate the seas of love?"
And "Jimmy, my boyfriend's moving to China.
Can you comfort me?"
Never asked him.
Couldn't get him to leave.
And the worst part is I don't have a choice.
I have to be here for you now because I care about you, and it's annoying.
I can't even enjoy violent
- rap songs because of her.
- What's wrong with Jimmy?
He's saying nice things in a mad voice.
Yeah, because I am mad.
Here.
You're taking advantage of me, and-and I am mad because it's Saturday night and I have to spend my night in a bathtub because I'm the only one in this family who knows how to make bath time fun.
I'm in hell.
Ooh.
So, Friday night, I'm with this smokin' hot chick.
Her boyfriend was on the elevator, too.
He was even better looking.
They're making out so hard they don't even notice what comes out of her purse.
Bam!
Susan B. Anthony.
- What?
- Okay, what?
Another coin story?
- Morning, gang.
- Whoops.
Oh, thank God.
Jimmy, thank God.
Tell me about your night.
Oh!
Uh...
You're gonna like this.
I'm buckling my seat belt.
Last night, I'm in the produce department at the grocery store and I'm minding my own business.
And, uh, I'm not gonna lie,
- I'm looking pretty good, right?
- Mm-hmm.
Then I heard this girl call my name.
"Bimmy!"
Right? "Bimmy!"
Turns out to be my granddaughter Edie.
She calls me "Bimmy" now.
And you think that's crazy?
I looked down on their cart...
we have the same stuff.
Like baby stuff and snacks for when she comes over, and it's like, we got to start coordinating this!
(chuckling)
Anyway...
Uh...
And then... this is the best part...
I'm, I go up to the, um, the checkout area and who's there?
Pam Anderson, Carmen Electra and Jenny McCarthy.
And they're like,
"Hey, Bimmy,
"you know, why don't you, uh, you know, come down to the MTV beach house?"
Can I see the coin again?
(Jimmy groans)
When did I become so lame?
Hey, Jimmy.
What did you say to the guys in the kitchen?
They're really depressed.
A couple of them took off early.
I used to have the coolest life.
Now look at me.
I mean, I still look great... arguably, better.
I am getting more sleep...
You done complimenting yourself?
(snaps fingers) Something I got to do.
Cancel my morning.
I'm not sure who to call to cancel your three-hour nap.
See if you can push it to the afternoon.
Baby girl, are you excited to see your first movie with Mommy tonight?
Yeah, now that you're two, you can watch screens without the risk of developing long-term attention problems.
Like the ones Mommy has.
All right, tonight's feature presentation is The Little Mermaid!
Mm-hmm.
Oh, wait.
And if you turn down the brightness, well, you can barely see the cracks?

All right?
We're gonna use my set up: 50-inch LCD screen, 1080 P, 7.1 Dolby surround sound.
Hey, what's the cup holder sitch?
'Cause I'm not holding my own cup.
I have 13 cup holders.
I've had enough!
Look who it is, Edie.
Who is that?
Bimmy!
No, no, not Bimmy.
No offense, kid.
Bimmy is dead.
Bimmy!
Uh, what did I just say?
All right, everyone, do not,
I repeat, do not ask me to hang out with you tonight.
Wasn't planning on it.
I used to be Jimmy Martino, man about town.
Now I'm this boring guy who hangs out in the suburbs on the weekends with his family.
I'm-I'm...
- Bimmy!
- Watch yourself, sister.
Now, tonight I'm gonna get my groove back.
I'm putting the old gang back together.
That's right... the Sat Pack.
What's the Sat Pack?
- Please don't ask.
- Go ahead, Gerald.
You're an adult.
Ask.
Finish your question.
Mom, I'm sorry, I have to know.
What's the Sat Pack?
- (groans)
- The Sat Pack are my boys, okay?
And when you get us knuckleheads together... (sputters) watch out, anything can happen.
Uh, fistfights, threesomes.
We once took a trip to Mount Rushmore...

You know...
I'm gonna leave.
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
You drove all the way here just to brag about your plans tonight?
- You could've called.
- No, I came to pick up my, uh... my spoon.
Sat Pack!
Sat Pack!
JIMMY:
Ravi, Annelise, I'm here for pleasure tonight, so the restaurant's in your hands.
- Just do what I would do.
- Mm-hmm.
Suck up to celebrities and hit on women?
Got it.
Jimmy, Jimmy, I can absolutely hold down the fort tonight, or... hear me out...
I go out with you guys, we have such a good time you make me a member of the Sat Pack.
What was the first option?
You make a member of the Sat Pack.
Get back to work.
Boys!
Hey, Mr. Mom!
Hey!
What, PTA meeting run late, or were you out back pumping breast milk?
Ha-ha!
(laughter)
I deserve that, I know.
It's been a long time, guys, but I promise I'm gonna make it up to you tonight.
Tonight's gonna be like the old days, huh?
Where's Ronnie?
I'm right here, you son of a bitch.

Why do I know that?
Well, so listen, I didn't just bring you guys to Din Tai Chow because they've got the best xiaolongbao.
I also came... with some big news.
Am I gonna finally be a big brother?
(laughing):
No, that's... not possible.
I was transferred from China to the U.S.
about a month ago, right?
And everything has been wonderful.
The lab in Beijing doesn't agree.
They're calling me back.
Oh, my God.
You're leaving again?
It's crazy, I know, but it's totally out of my control.
And they're giving me a 30% raise.
And it's only gonna be for a few years.
So you brought us here to tell us that you're leaving?
No.
I brought you here to ask you if you're coming.
Will you move to China with me, Sara?
This is a big decision, I know, and I totally understand if you want to take your time.
No.
Uh... no, you don't want to... take your time, or-or-or no, you... do want to move to China?
I'm not moving to China, Bruce.
So, I heard you got a labradoodle.
Hey, okay, Edie, we're gonna watch The Little Mermaid,
Mommy's favorite non- Fast and Furious movie, and then we're gonna make a mermaid cake.
Yay!
Yay!
Okay.
First, let's figure out which one of Daddy's jillion remotes turns on the TV.
Huh?
Oh.
I think this remote turned on that remote.
Mmm.
Ah.
On demand.
Well, never seen this screen before.
Here we go. "Buy now."
"Shinjumatsu Films."
"The Littlest Fishgirl and Michu Michu."

(gasps) Hold on, hold on.
Oh, don't look, don't look.
Oh, no, which remote is it?
Michu!
Michu!
(Edie screams, cries)
Michu!
Michu!
Ugh, Gerald!

Do we really need to worry about that right now?
I mean, we're not even exclusive.
We're not?
(short laugh)
Really?
You're dating other guys?
I'm sorry, not to put you on the spot.
No, no, no, I'm just trying to count how many other guys I'm dating.
Now, this is gonna seem high because I was just in Aruba.
All right, let's just back it up.
Uh, here's what I know.
I know we haven't been dating very long, but I-I really like you.
And I-I think maybe we should be exclusive.
Now you go.
You're a really great guy.
And-and we've had a lot of fun.
Ooh, I like where this is going.
But we're obviously in very different places.
You want to move fast, maybe because you have a child.
Not sure we're looking for the same thing.
I think we should break up.

It was good to have this conversation.
That way we could end things before either of us got hurt.

Hey.
What are you doing here?
I thought I was supposed to be dead to you tonight.
Okay, I'm sorry, I didn't know you had plans.
I drove all the way to Pasadena to tell you.
But I thought that was to borrow a spoon.
(sighs) Gerald...
I have the Sat Pack here.
Well, now you got the Sad Pack here, too.
Party of me.
I get it.
Clever.
Eh...
Let's move on.
What-what's up tonight?
Frankie and I broke up.
Oh, I'm sorry, son.
Thanks.
Hey, what's the ice cream situation here?
Ah, maybe it'll make me feel better just to tell you how I'm feeling:
awful.
No, that did nothing.
God, I just want to curl up with a root beer float, depending on the ice cream situation.
- Mm.
- You have people here.
I'm sorry, I-I should let you go.
- Okay.
- It wouldn't suck to not be alone tonight.
(sighs) All right, you can stay.
But don't unload your feelings on everyone.
It's not good for you and it's not good for the party.

Can I hear it?
You want me to tell the whole story again?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
There's only so many times I can hump your couch.
Shots?
None for me, thanks.
I feel like I've already taken a shot.
To the gut.
That's my son Gerald, everybody.
That's Gerald.
He, uh, he's having sort of a rough night, but he promised he wouldn't kill the vibe, right?
Oh, no, what happened?
Uh, he'll be fine, don't worry.
It's okay.
I've been sort of "forbidden" to talk about it.
Oh...
Aw.
You can tell us.
Where do I begin?

It's just never been a challenge for me to be vulnerable, you know?
When I was 17, I was 290 pounds.
Spoiler alert: it wasn't all muscle.
Mmm.
So...
I guess we'll do the long-distance thing, you know?
We'll... meet up, like, once a year
- and talk on the phone sometimes.
- Yeah.
You know, it's only a 15-hour time difference, right?
So, 8:00 p.m. for me is, like... 5:00 a.m. for me.
I'm in a great mood then.
So I only ate the veggie dumplings, so how are we gonna do the bill?
I just wish I could erase this awful feeling, you know?
Guess it'll just take time.
I think the problem is that I open myself up too easily.
Gerald, that's not a problem.
Everyone else is the problem.
Yeah, you know what, uh,
I'm exactly like Gerald.
I love to love.
I got a heart the size of a freakin' cheese wheel.
Can you move?
You're sitting on my purse.
- Kind of like it?
- No.
Okay, excuse me.
Hey, Jimmy, you know what the best part of having your son here is?
What?
No, I'm asking you because I can't think of anything.
Don't worry.

I made some calls, got us into a yacht party hosted by the Winklevoss twins.
A yacht party...
I like that.

yacht party, Playboy Mansion, Sara's house.
I'll be back in five.
All right, you got five minutes of my time.
Make 'em count.
I got a yacht to catch.
What are you doing here?
I didn't tell you to come.
Well, you texted me because you wanted me to come.
Let's not do this dance.
All right, what's up?
Well, since you're here...
I'm about to get mine.
Watch and learn.
- Hey.
- Hi.
So, I couldn't help but notice that neither of us have boyfriends here tonight.
Oh, mine's in Sacramento for a medical convention.
Where's yours?
Ouch.
I'll take it from here.

I'm gay.
Thanks for talking to me about this, Alicia.
Of course.
Do you feel any better?
I'm dead inside.
I'm a husk of a man.
What the hell is taking Jimmy so long?
Move to China?
That's-that's a big ask.
Yeah.
But the old me would have done that at the drop of a hat.
My plan was always to live all over the world.
Los Angeles was just the first stop.
And then Gerald came along, and so I told myself,
"I will see the world when he moves out of the house."
Mm.
Good luck with that.
Have you seen what I pay him?
(chuckles) And then there was Edie.
All of a sudden the idea of moving is just ridiculous.
Even if it's for Bruce.
Well, you know what they say.
Things happen for a reason, right?
Maybe the best guy for you is right here in Los Angeles.
You know, Ronnie's single now.
(both laugh)
All right, I'm starting to feel this wine.
Couple more glasses of this,
I would consider making a trip to Ronnie-ville.
(knocking)
What the hell is this?
Oh, hey, Ronnie!
I was just talking about how I was gonna have sex with you, but I'm not going to.
Nice to see you, too, Sara.
Jimmy, you said five minutes.
It's been 20.
Well, Sara needed me.
This is important.
- All right.
I'm leaving.
- Why?
Why?
Tonight was supposed to be about us.
Yeah.
And while you're sitting here, sipping on wine, I've been out, sitting on my thumb, in some driveway in the freaking boondocks.
It's Pasadena.
And it's charming.
Well, great.
Have fun.
I'll just go back out there and listen to your daughter Gerald tell me all about her problems.
All right, you know what, it's time for you to calm down, because I'm starting to see the vein.
Good!
The vein comes out for a reason.
Yeah.
You're the reason.
Yeah, well, when the vein comes out, the hand comes out, remember?
I remember.
Remember the last time your hand came out?
I did this.
Ha, ha, you like that, Grandpa?
(gasps)
'Cause I... (grunts)
Oh!
Wow.
That felt good.
I did need to cut loose.
I'm gonna go make out with Alicia real quick.
Wh... (Ronnie groans)
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Just horny.
You're always horny.
You want my forehead again?

Yeah, but this time it's different.
I think I'm horny for what you have.
I'm horny for family.
I know you, Ronnie.
Someday you're gonna find out you have a kid you didn't know about, too.
Thanks, man.
Hey, guys, yeah, can we speed this up?
You're kind of making us late to the yacht party.
Ian, what are you doing here?
And who's running the restaurant?
Thank you for coming.
This was by far the best experience we've had at Jimmy's.
Whatever you're doing, don't change a thing.
Okay.
Well?
To the yacht, huh?
Definitely.
Hell yeah.
What time is it, about 1:00?

Unbelievable.
Everything okay, Jimmy?
No, it's not okay.
I asked for one night off.
And do I get it?
No.
Because I-I got to be here for you guys.
"Dad, can you help me navigate the seas of love?"
And "Jimmy, my boyfriend's moving to China.

- Can you comfort me?"
Never asked him.
Couldn't get him to leave.
And the worst part is I don't have a choice.
I have to be here for you now because I care about you, and it's annoying.
I can't even enjoy violent
- rap songs because of her.
- What's wrong with Jimmy?
He's saying nice things in a mad voice.
Yeah, because I am mad.
Here.
You're taking advantage of me, and-and I am mad because it's Saturday night and I have to spend my night in a bathtub because I'm the only one in this family

I'm in hell.

Ooh.
Hi.
- Hi.
­ Hey, Jen.
Oh, thank you so much for doing this.
It's so great to have a lawyer in the family.
Well, of course.
Well, when Heather volunteered me, what could I say out loud?
Well, it is embarrassing.
I just assumed we had a will, but apparently not.
Um, John thinks that they cause death.
Well, I do know a lot of people who died, and every one of them had a will.
Do the math.
Right.
Yeah, no, that adds up.
Well, you... you have a will now, too,
And, um, I put everything in there that you asked for...
Not everything.
Uh, I wanted to add a couple of zingers.
"Zingers"?
Well, with both of us dead, it's gonna be kind of a sad day,
And I want people to enjoy themselves.
Yeah, it... it's why he wants our ashes shot out of a T-shirt gun.
Yeah, how about we start with this?
"We leave everything to our fish,"
And then you say, "Psych!"
Yeah.
No, little problem is that, uh, you can't really put "Psych" in a...
In a legal document.
- Oh.
Oh, okay.
­ Oh.
Yeah, I understand.
How about just, "We leave everything to our fish."
"Not!"
Yeah, you guys could go all night.
Once I leave.
Now is this distributed equally, or is it based on dire need?
Oh, don't worry, I'm sure the new owners
Will let you stay in the garage.
I don't care about the money.
I just, I want all of the photo albums.
Oh, that's sweet.
No, I...
I need to destroy the evidence of the year that I only wore men's suits.
Oh, that's right, that's the year I wore do-rags.
- I looked good.
- Oh.
And, Greg, you wore overalls and sideways painter's caps.
Yeah, people called me Dutchy Boy.
Okay, but seriously, Jen, what's in it?
Uh, no I can't... t... tell you that.
I mean, it's attorney client privilege.
Yeah, but that doesn't apply to families, does it?
Uh, I'll tell you a secret.
You want to know a secret?
I'll tell you one right now.
Tim pees sitting down.
if I'm in there,
I'm doing the word jumble.
Period.
Okay, here are the executed copies for your files.
Uh, is it too late to add in "of sound mind and dope body"?
Yes.
Ooh, I didn't realize it costs so much.
What?
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
That invoice was not supposed to be in there.
Is that what you make per hour?
What do the men get?
Um...
No, I'm not...
I'm not charging you.
Yeah, you're... you're family.
Oh, don't tell Matt that.
I just raised his rent.
I don't understand what the big deal is.
That Heather volunteered you for this,
And now we're stuck paying for it.
Yeah, but it's not even that much money.
It's just, like, filing costs and paralegal fees.
No, but it's not about the money.
I've always wanted to call the shots.
My whole life, Heather and Matt have been telling me what to do,
And now they're telling my wife what to do.
I can't have that.
No, they got to pay.
I thought you just said it wasn't about the money.
No, it's not, but, in this case, it is.
But that's just a coincidence.
Okay, listen, here's the deal.
I'll go along with this,
As long as next time my mom calls me, you answer.
So you'll be my ally.
Uh, sure.
What's up?
You're just waiting for somebody to say something, aren't you?
About what?
So, uh, I'd like to thank you all for coming.
Uh, I know that we told Mom and Dad
That we'd pay for their will, but turns out there are some administrative fees.
So, uh, evenly divided, this is what Jen and I feel that you guys owe.
Yes, and we both feel that with equal conviction.
That's right.
Oh, uh, no.
Uh, I'm not paying for that.
You offered, you pay.
Well, actually, Heather offered up Jen.
So?
We do things all the time for the family
That actually cost money.
We don't charge you guys for any of it.
This is different.
You're different.
Yeah, I...
I helped dad paint the house, and I didn't charge him for that.
Yes, you did, you charged him $600.
Well, I didn't know that you knew that.
That kind of weakens my argument.
Another amazing meal, Heather.
Oh, thanks, Dad.
For you, sir.
And I can give your wife the receipt.
What's this?
Oh, well, since you decided to charge for the things that we share, we thought it was only fair to split the cost of this meal, you know, equally.
See, this is why I said we should pay.
You know, I didn't charge for my time, but there were, unfortunately, some unavoidable fees.
Oh, okay.
Sorry, Hon, I know times are tough.
So dessert is on the house.
What's going on?
Oh, someone's trying to prove a point
Because I tried to save you from incurring an expense on your will.
Something that Jen was completely on board for.
Yes, and I am thrilled.
Look at how it's bringing us so much closer together.
- Well, if Jen wants the money this much.
- Oh, please.
I don't... this is not for me.
I thought you were my ally.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, this is not even fair.
I brought the wine.
And that wine was from our rack.
- I didn't know that you knew that.
- We all know that.
I knew about the paint job,
- I know about the wine.
- Stop.
Stop.
You know, I...
I would hope that after we're gone, you kids would come closer together and not behave like this.
No, G...
Greg started it.
It was totally Greg.
What?
No, I didn't do anything.
What are you t... ?
Okay, you know what?
Listen.
This is my fault.
Yeah, I...
I made Greg ask for the money because I am secretly greedy and, uh, now I regret that, because you loving sisters and brothers are fighting, so I...
I hope that you can all forgive me for creating this problem in your always peaceful family.
I forgive you.
Thank you, y... you are a big man.
Jen, come on, it's not your fault.
No...
Look, we got carried away.
Well, your father and I are glad that the fighting has stopped, but it really doesn't matter anyway, because we've decided to leave all the money to charity.
Oh. ­Oh. ­Okay, that is...
Psych!
Is that better than "Not"?
That was perfect.
Yes!
Okay, kiddos, today we decide where we go for family vacation.
We should use our vacation to take care of the earth.
Ooh. ­You know, like, pick up trash in the forest or in local streets.
Honey, I am so proud of you for being such a good citizen, but that is no vacation.
That is how they punish prisoners.
You guys say you care about the earth, but you're not willing to give up your vacation for it.
- That is accurate.
- I never said I cared about the earth.
How about we put it to the test... with a bet?
Ugh, you know betting is my weakness.
All right, what kind of odds are we talking here?
For one day, everyone carries around a trash bag, and all their trash goes into it.
At the end of the day, whoever has the least amount of trash wins.
And that person gets to pick where we go on vacation.
Yeah, I like it.
All right, this starts now.
I am going to win this so easily, because you guys have no idea how much trash you create, because I am the one who always picks it up.
So at the end of the day, my bag is going to be empty.
Can you hold that, please?
Gotcha.
Dang it, uh...
Sophia?
Shaking my head.
Hey, Dad, your Gene Simmons bobbleheads are here.
Ooh!
Awesome.
Can't wait...
Oh, wait a minute.
That thing's gonna be filled with styrofoam peanuts.
I just know it.
Sorry.
Can't accept it.
You're not Mr. Hughes?
No, I'm Dr. Hughes.
- This is Mr. Hughes.
- No, no, no.
I'm not 18, you can't make me.
Excuse me.
I'll sign that.
Thank you.
- She's not Mr. Hughes.
- Thank you.
All right, well, here you go, Mr. Winner.
Now, I'm pretty sure there's some extra packing in there for Gene's spinal column.
So, yeah, you enjoy that.
Son.
W... what are we doing here?
Separately, we are weak, but together... we could be less weak, you know what I'm saying?
Sorry, Dad.
I already formed an alliance with Mom.
She offered to do my laundry for life, so...
Yeah, that's pretty good.
Uh,
You don't mind if I check your guitar case, do you?
Seriously?
Mom, you gonna let her do that?
Oh, sure, go crying to your mommy.
See if she can't fluff and fold your problems away.
Ow!
See?
Some things are more important to me than choosing a vacation.
Like honesty and trust.
Busted!
You have trash in your pants.
I...
I...
Yeah, well, I bet you have trash in your bra.
He should have to eat it!
With his mouth.
My car blew a tire.
Well, alliance is over.
Good luck.
What?
Uh-oh.
Dad!
The only good thing that can come out of this is I can see my fish again.
Hey.
What's going on?
It won't flush.
I think we need a bigger toilet.
Yeah.
I've been saying that for years.
Let's take a little look-see here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Why is there a Cheesy Chip bag in this toilet?
You know those things go right through me, Dad.
I cannot believe you've been cheating.
You know, one day that's not gonna be so cute anymore.
Or... or we could form an alliance.
If you take my trash, I can win.
Then we can go wherever you want.
How do I know I can trust you?
I don't know.
You really don't.
All right, I'm in.
40 pounds for Mom.
22 pounds for Daddy.
Two pounds for Tyler,
And .7 pounds for me.
Forgot mine.
.3 pounds.
Sophia's the winner.
Yes!
All right!
I am so glad your hamster didn't die today.
So, where are we going on vacation?
Vegas, baby!
Yeah.
What?
Secret alliance.
When you give birth to them, they are very loyal to you.
You double-crossed me?
It's okay, Daddy.
I double-crossed Mommy, too.
What?
45 minutes in line to ride a plastic pig that smells like pee?
I take it back.
Picking up trash would've been better than this.
No, it's fine, it's fine.
45 minutes is not that long to wait.
Come on.
If it's your life story, and... and you looked like a beaver...
I did.
Then why is the book about a chicken?
Because if you Google "The Beaver Who Could Chew",
- inappropriate images come up.
- Yeah.
Right.
So, I have good news.
- Ooh.
- Remember my friend from high school, Grace?
Yeah, the, uh, the immigration lawyer who started that upside-down cupcake business?
No.
Who is that?
I don't know anyone like that.
- Grace is a publisher.
- Oh.
So she was talking to me about her, uh, new position in children's books, and I pitched her That idea that I've had forever.
She wants me to write the book.
- What?
Are you serious?

That's amazing!
And, no, best of all,
When I told her I had a boyfriend who was an artist, who could do killer illustrations, she said, "Great".
Great.
Here you go.
You don't want to do it?
Um, I mean, I don't know.
I'm...
I'm pretty immersed in my sketch series about human trafficking and genocide and so I...
I just, you know, I think that doing a bunch of kiddie drawings would just frankly, well, it would depress me.
She said if all goes well, it could pay, like ten grand.
And...
I went ahead and started to work on some of the ancillary characters in our book.
There's, um, there's a cute but lactose intolerant cow, a very pretty but nosy mini-horse.
Don't worry, the, um, the sexual chemistry there is just subtext.
Cool, cool, cool, but my book is called
"The Chicken Who Could Chew."
Right.
A chicken with big teeth rubbing it in the face of all the toothless chickens.
She can eat bagels.
We have to show that.
Right, but our book needs to be more than just about a chicken eating.
It needs to show the reality of being livestock in today's rough-and-tumble world.
Yeah, I'm not really a fan of rough-and-tumble for my book.
I'm thinking more feathery and cute.
I'm noticing this weird thing that you keep doing, where, you know,
I...
I keep saying "our book" and you keep saying "my book."
Oh, right, I'm...
I'm sorry.
- Mm-hmm.
­ That is weird.
I mean, they are my illustrations, so, um...
Right.
They are your illustrations, but it's my life story.
I got my adult teeth when I was six years old.
I looked like a beaver.
Everyone made fun of me, but my mom told me to be proud and show everyone what me and my big teeth could do.
If it's your life story, and... and you looked
- like a beaver...
- I did.
Then why is the book about a chicken?
Because if you Google "The Beaver Who Could Chew", inappropriate images come up.
- Right.
- Yeah.
These... these drawings are depressing.
- Well...
- And these animals are, like, third-world skinny.
That pig, I really think, should be fat.
No, but the cat's fat.
The cat with the bag of money
And the... the... the sash that says "Foreign Oil".
What if you drew something like this?
And you're taking my pencil, and, oh, good, an eraser... that's not gonna do any dam...
Calm down.
I'm not redoing it...
I'm just fixing it.
Um, just out of curiosity, how are the kids gonna know that that goat is dead if the flies-flies aren't there?
You've got to be able to take criticism, Matt.
And you've got to find yourself an illustrator who is willing to sell out the integrity of his art.
You can take away my flies, but you can't take away my freedom.
Mom?
Can you open the door, please?
It's like she was my boss again, you know, telling me what to do.
Oh...
Oh, I think this might be my fault.
I'm afraid I forced you to choose a strong woman.
Well, the same thing happened to Greg with Jen, you know?
Who's bold and wonderful and opinionated in nearly all our interactions,.
But it's fun.
It...
Oh, it's fun.
Colleen's strong, that's for sure.

They loved the realism and they thought it was a fresh new take on the struggles of toothless livestock.
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.
So what are we gonna do with all these cute little chubby animals?
We're gonna use them for the sequel:
"The Chicken Who Chewed Too Much."

Okay, I like it.
And that little sheep on the tractor

Oh, and when I start crying, don't acknowledge it, all right?
I'll stop eventually.

Well, it is embarrassing.
I just assumed we had a will, but apparently not.
Um, John thinks that they cause death.
Well, I do know a lot of people who died, and every one of them had a will.
Do the math.
Right.
Yeah, no, that adds up.
Well, you... you have a will now, too,
And, um, I put everything in there that you asked for...
Not everything.
Uh, I wanted to add a couple of zingers.
"Zingers"?
Well, with both of us dead, it's gonna be kind of a sad day,
And I want people to enjoy themselves.
Yeah, it... it's why he wants our ashes shot out of a T-shirt gun.

No, little problem is that, uh, you can't really put "Psych" in a...

Oh, thanks, Dad.
For you, sir.
And I can give your wife the receipt.
What's this?
Oh, well, since you decided to charge for the things that we share, we thought it was only fair to split the cost of this meal, you know, equally.
See, this is why I said we should pay.
You know, I didn't charge for my time, but there were, unfortunately, some unavoidable fees.
Oh, okay.
Sorry, Hon, I know times are tough.

Is there, like, a heavy metal pan flute option?

Yeah, that's better.

No, that...

I guess they forgot something.

Saldana, why are we still tied up in those hospitals?
Baby boomers.

When the group reports patient volumes, it's gonna overshoot street expectations.
We're talking 10% move.
That incremental revenue will drop right to the bottom line, that incremental revenue will drop right to the bottom line, and the stock's gonna pop like a prom queen's cherry.
Good fucking answer.

God damn it.

And you want me to tell them we're buying some fucking apple?
Sorry, axe.
I-I guess I'm just not seeing the matrix right now.
That's a little unsettling, Donnie...

I was tasked, so I supplied it.
Right, but going through your reports, I see gaps.
Like this boardwalk pipeline move... what supported it?
It was an event-driven strategy.
Okay, it was based on an unsolicited tip.
The trade was near 100,000 shares.
Close to a $2.5 million position based on a rumor.
It seemed...
Solid.
Looking at tele-comm...
This verizon trade?
Looking at tele-comm...
This verizon trade?

And the pharmaceutical trades?
That was phone-a-tip.
Incoming tip.
What am I, a fucking schmuck?
Of course I'm gonna listen.
That was a prom-night promise.
And that means...?
"Just the tip."
So, this is your entire book and trading history for the past three months?
That's right.
Wow.
Bit of a rough patch, huh?
Seriously?
Seriously?
I need to see your trades for the past 90 days.
Unless you got a Wells notice with my name on it, you're not gonna see Jack shit.
Come on, we can pull it all down from the server anyway, so you may as well cooperate.
Mm.
Good point.
Lawyer.
Your boss said you should cooperate.
Oh.
Lawyer.
Just answer the question.
You answer me one.
How much do you make?
I'm gonna need access to your files, paper, and computer.
I'm gonna need access to your files, paper, and computer.
For what?
I'm authorized to check that all trades comply...
I'm not a trader.
Whatever you call yourself, after I review...
My files are confidential.
You're not seeing them.
You can call the Attorney General if you want, and tell her I say "hi" if you do.
We had dinner last month.
Otherwise, fuck off.
Enough.
Okay?
Enough.
Enough.
Okay?
Enough.
I hope you enjoyed the lifeboat drill this morning.
Are you kidding me?
We did not do well.
In fact, we sank.
If it were a real s.E.C. Raid, we would have been fucked.
Get the fuck out of here.
I shit my pants for nothing?
I didn't do this for my amusement.
What happened to Steven birch...
Who I am sure will be cleared of any wrongdoing...
It could happen to us.
So we need to be prepared.
To that end, say "hello"
to that end, say "hello"
to our new and improved compliance department.
These assholes work here now?
That, they do.
They're here for our support and our protection, and you will not even be taking a piss without them close enough to give it a shake.
From here on, we evaluate every move...
Not just for the upside, but for its ethical grounding.
We have to be more pure than the virgin Mary before her first period.
Fuck, WAGS.
How the hell are we supposed to make any money?
How the hell are we supposed to make any money?
You think this is a joke, Victor?
You, in particular, were flagged.
Flagged?
Your short on that chip maker.
Eleva peripherals.
Netted 38% fresh blubber on that seal hunt.
Rotten carcass...
Over the line.
We're lucky the s.E.C. Hasn't come calling already.
You're done.
Fired.
Clear out.
Leave your key cards.
Leave your key cards.
This is bullshit.
I didn't do anything out-of-bounds...
No more than anyone else.
Did I sign off on that trade?
No, I did not.
Don't say anything else.
I trusted you with my name and my capital, and you fucked me.
You put us all at risk with your deceitful, illegal moves.
Now get out of here.
All right, everybody, back at it.
Play hard, play clean.
Be careful out there.
That was a hell of a public spanking.
Make sure our investors know about it.
On it.
I'm gonna make sure garth Sykes hears about it a.S.A.P.
You're gonna be a god on the street by lunchtime.
I thought I already was one.
Greater god.
Don't you fuckin' touch me!
Or my cellphone.
I was going to tell you about the compliance gag, but you didn't show up at the charity dinner, and then...
Then...
I was half a hallway from your office.
Try again.
Try again.
Honest?
It was an oversight.
No, it wasn't.
You don't make them.
And that matters.
But what matters more right now is that Victor is exactly the wrong person to fire that way.
That was spur-of-the-moment.
It was a spur-of-the-moment fuck-up.
His entire psychological makeup sets him up to react very poorly to public humiliation.
The same things that made him a profit center for you will make him a difficult adversary if he's not handled right.
He will stew and obsess and find a way to exact revenge on you.
And find a way to exact revenge on you.
Okay.
I can see that.
Will you fix it?
Go do it, please.
I made a mistake not looping you in.
I admit that.
"Mistake."
Last chance.
Okay.
It was a red team drill.
I wanted everybody to react as they would naturally.
I left you out on purpose.
I left you out on purpose.
And I will make it up to you.
Please deal with Victor.
Sean ayles, please.
It's Lara Axelrod.
Sean.
Hi.
This is the call you've been waiting for.
I wanted to talk to you about making a donation.
I figured you would.
And about naming rights.
And so the names on these buildings and so the names on these buildings become more than just identifiers.
They become signifiers of a grander age, when titans of industry understood that the purpose of their wealth was to support the performative arts to improve the quality of life for all those who live in and visit this city.
Now give me the gettysburg address.
I'm sorry.
That...
Sounded rehearsed.
I'm vamping.
I'm in a difficult spot.
No, yeah, I know.
Because what you need to tell me is that the eads family owns the naming rights to this building in perpetuity.
But I'm here offering you $100 million, which you need to extract somehow without giving me what I want.
I'm in a difficult spot.
No, yeah, I know.
Also, "performative" does not mean "performance."
Most donors like an air of...
I don't.
There are other naming opportunities on the ground that would give you the status and sense of permanence that you need.
Why is this building so important to you?
Here's why it's important to you.
It's the only way you are getting even a dollar out of me.
Now, I happen to have discovered that the remaining members of the eads family are in a financial pinch.
They need to raise cash.
And they will have a hard time and they will have a hard time getting ahold of the kind of loan they need to pay off their other loans.
So, I want you to tell them that I will pay them $25 million to allow me to replace their family name with mine.
Then I will donate the 100, and you can begin your renovations.
Oh.
There is one condition I'll need you to sign off on.
There is one condition I'll need you to sign off on.
Don't scream.
Look there.
What the fuck?
Get out.
I'm calling the police.
You don't want to do that, Tara.
Who the fuck are you?
Your newest and bestest.
You should stay and listen to me.
Or else this goes viral.
Or else this goes viral.
You're making me weak.
"You're making me weak."
We have... we have training against this.
You think you're gonna fucking blackmail me?
So what?
I fuck girls, guys.
Who cares?
Everyone fucks.
That thing has no chance to compromise me.
I hope it at least gets you off, man.
What gets me off would disturb you at such a deep level, honey, you'd be best-served never to think about it again.
You'd be best-served never to think about it again.
Folks in your line care about that kind of thing, though.
And this...
Your hair...
Which will test positive for cocaine, can be in Chuck rhoades' hands within an hour.
You're gonna watch, listen, and report, and everything's gonna be fine.
It's a lot to take in.
We've already gone through all of this crap.
I heard back from my sources.
There's a war room set up at birch's.
Lawyers, accountants...
The whole thing.
Guys at his shop are prepping their résumés.
Well, if it was just smoke, they'd issue a denial...
Keep working.
Yeah.
They're treating this article like it's a warrant.
Somebody wanted to hurt birch, and they wanted us on the ass end.
So they leaked it.
So they leaked it.
And I do not like it.
We need the reins back in our hands.
Understood.
You want me to stay on this axe/decker thing?
No.
Set that aside.
Until we know at least as much as this fucking reporter knows, let's keep the brights on Steven birch.
All right.
Get me every article
Randy kornbluth wrote in the past year.
All of Mike dimonda's articles, too.
We'll start there.
Mike.
Good parlor trick, knowing my address.
That'll look like a fun intimidation tactic when I write this up.
Oh.
You're not writing this up.
Because that would be a small win, and you're not in it for small wins.
No, you've come too far.
Too young an age for that.
I'm in it because people deserve to know the truth
I'm in it because people deserve to know the truth about power and money and...
Whoa.
Wait a minute.
What are you, Glenn greenwald all of a sudden?
Come on.
You know, I've, uh, I've been reading...
Randy kornbluth lately.
He usually covers state politics.
He hasn't had a hard business story in 18 months, but all of a sudden, he hooks into a full-blown crime story...
On Steven birch.
His article quotes former federal prosecutor James Robbins, former federal prosecutor James Robbins, who says that the connection between hedge funds and company officials must be probed.
You know who else likes quoting James Robbins?
You.
Seven times in the past six months.
He's a widely respected source with connections...
He's a fucking rent-a-quote.
I know you really wrote the birch story, and I think I know why you chose to hide that fact.
If I am such a careerist, why would I ever hide something that good?
'Cause you thought it would endear you to someone.
'Cause you thought it would endear you to someone.
What you should have done, if you were really playing an elevated game, was come to me with what you had.
See, if I had something better to give you in exchange for you holding on to it...
You have never been willing to play any kind of game with me.
I didn't know you were ready to play in the bigs, man.
Now I do.
So, these are the rules.
You tell me who fed you that...
No.
I'm gonna head inside.
Because this conversation has peaked, because this conversation has peaked, and you don't get to tell me the rules.
You're correct.
I'm not gonna write up this ambush.
But I can.
Anytime I want to.
So think about that the next time you try and bar me from a press conference or dodge my call.
Have a good night.
All right.
Thank you.
Uh...
You know what?
Here's the $20 for whatever the guy in the blue shirt back there wants.
I got you.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, guys, let's go.
Come on.
Now, you guys remember when we threw grandpa a surprise party for his birthday and we all had to keep the secret?
Yeah.
Okay.
Why do we have to keep the secret?
To make grandpa happy.
Right.
So this is like that, okay?
Right.
So this is like that, okay?
We don't tell anyone about the doughnuts to make mommy happy.
Okay?
Rhoades!
Don't you walk away before you meet my kids.
Mr. kroll, we are in a public place...
With, uh, as you say, our children.
Uh, why don't you guys go sit on the bench over there, okay?
Take your sister over there.
I-I don't need your, um...
Kindness now.
I-I needed it at sentencing.
I-I needed it at sentencing.
This is margo and Stevie.
Hello.
I kept them out of school today so we could be together because I go to prison tomorrow.
How do you live with yourself?
How?
Yeah.
I think long and hard before any prosecution in my office goes forward.
And I'm proudest of the cases I choose not to prosecute.
But when I go forward, it's full guns.
But when I go forward, it's full guns.
I made one goddamn mistake.
And who got hurt?
No one.
You could have let it go.
You committed mail fraud.
And you knew that my wife had died...
Suddenly...
And that I was desperate and lost.
Y-you read the articles.
You... you got letters from 100 people who vouched for the man that I was and would be again.
I'm what those kids have left.
And they won't have me again for four years.
And they won't have me again for four years.
Have a nice stroll with yours.
And take your fucking $20 or just...
Leave it here for the birds to pick at.
Let's go, kids.
Daddy's done with this asshole.
You wanted to see me?
Hey.
I want to give you a short that you're not gonna bail on too quick.
That you're not gonna bail on too quick.
Do you know cross-co.?
Cross-co.
Trucking.
I've been tracking it.
Mid-size firm, has a big distribution contract with that bakery company yumtime.
Been holding 50.
Fundamentals are solid.
I don't see the short play.
I don't need you to see it.
I need you to do it.
We'll get 50 on the tape.
We'll size up later.
You got a fucking problem with this?
No.
You plug that investor leakage?
I thought I'd done exactly that, but I haven't been able to get garth Sykes on the phone.
He bails, it hurts us.
Yeah.
I tried.
But I think I need you to show face with this guy.
You got this.
That's why I have you.
That fucker thinks that if you come running over here,
I'm gonna forget he fired me in front of everyone I know?
Who knows what he thinks?
Who knows what he thinks?
One minute, you're his most trusted advisor, the next, you're on the outside.
I'm here because...
I think you might make it worse for yourself, and I don't want to see that.
The money I made him...
He treated me like a lowlife.
And that's a trigger for you.
Everyone laughing at me growing up.
The dyslexia.
Even the teachers.
I sent every one of those pricks a photo of my first million-dollar bonus check.
That made you feel really good for about 24 hours, and then you hated yourself for letting them know they ever got to you.
For letting them know they ever got to you.
Kind of.
Sometimes.
This is different.
I know plenty about how axe capital works...
The dirty edge...
The proprietary trading techniques.
I know how the secret sauce is made.
Yeah.
I'm sure you could put out a schott's miscellany about the place.
Schott's?
It's like a farmer's almanac for non-farm stuff.
Then, yeah, I could put out a couple of volumes of schott's miscellany about the place.
You just need to ask yourself one question first...
Are you rich enough to never get another job?
Are you rich enough to never get another job?
I did work for that man.
Bribed an oil company c.F.O. For him...
Stop talking.
We're not in session.
That's not privileged.
Point is, I got all muddied up for him.
Hard not to rub it on his clean, white shirt now.
Remember Warren jaffin, the analyst?
Yeah.
Bright guy?
Bright guy?
That kid was sharp.
Employable?
Real sharp, yeah.
Then he balked at his bonus one year and got popped.
He got another job right away at a huge bank... $3 million a year, guaranteed.
Only, word got back to axe that Warren had badmouthed him in the interview...
Said axe wasn't generous with him.
So axe called the head of the bank, asked him to pull the offer that day, which the guy did.
Can you imagine...
How humiliating that was for Warren?
How humiliating that was for Warren?
Probably told his whole family, all his friends that he was back.
But axe didn't leave it there.
He called the president or chairman of every prime broker, bank, and fund in the industry and had him blackballed.
Put it out over the loudspeaker, direct from the principal's office...
"if you hire Warren jaffin, you are my enemy."
Do you know what Warren does now?
He's got a blog.
You've built a real life for yourself, Victor...
A long way from queens.
If axe is certain you'll act like a gentleman, he will make sure to take care of you.
You were the one that always told me to stand up for myself.
When you can win, yes.
The only way you can win now is by letting it go.
You know, I have to confess to something.
Okay.
You're not gonna like it.
Fire away.
I took the kids for doughnuts.
I know.
Kevin told me.
Good.
Oh.
You're glad he cracked?
No, I never want them to keep secrets from you.
They're gonna keep them from me their entire teenage years.
They should at least know that they always can confide in you.
And among your many gifts, that is a great one.
And among your many gifts, that is a great one.
Everyone feels like you're always on their side.
Well, I try to be, or at least...
Understand where they're coming from.
That's the wonderful part of your job.
You get to employ your empathy.
I have to be a real prick sometimes, you know?
At work.
Yeah.
Sometimes, we all do things we're not proud of at work.
Sometimes, we all do things we're not proud of at work.
Well, this is different.
When I was in the park with the kids, there was this guy who...
Specifics don't matter.
What does is, that every once in a while, there's this thing we say...
"I am never so proud as when I choose not to prosecute a case."
And that's true...
In theory.
But once in a while, I wish that I could just be more...
But once in a while, I wish that I could just be more... human.
But I haven't figured out how to do that and my job at the same time.
You know?
Being 100% good at your job... and 100% good... if you figure that one out, let's both quit and write that book.
It's a luxury to relax every once in a while, isn't it, garth?
I remember this place...
Fondly.
Look, the stability of this firm has never been in question.
I need to look into Axelrod's eyes, hear him say it.
Yeah, he will.
I just wanted to hear you first.
I may be from Kentucky, but I'm no rube.
I may be from Kentucky, but I'm no rube.
I don't bet on long shots when it comes to investing the pensions of my members.
That's why they trust me with their $5 billion.
I get nervous, I see someone like Axelrod running around spending his money like he's a goddamn rap singer.
Emcee.
Like a rap emcee.
No, some of 'em sing now.
My kids showed me.
Snoop and kid rock both.
You're right...
You are no rube.
But Bobby Axelrod isn't, either.
We've crushed the sp seven years running, we've crushed the sp seven years running, which means you have crushed the sp.
You turn over now.
Everyone beats it...
Till they don't.
When I can I see axe, talk to him about it?
You don't want to rush off now, do you?
Here's mccue.
She got some stuff on birch.
You are gonna love my nuts.
Pierre Bernard, longtime c.F.O. Of the arcadian,
Pierre Bernard, longtime c.F.O. Of the arcadian, gets passed over for c.E.O., gets censured internally for certain financial improprieties.
Press clippings I thought you might want.
And Bernard interviews for a job at birch shortly before the trades.
We have secretaries on both sides confirming the meet.
Birch's trades in arcadian occur a half-hour afterward.
We alerted our counterparts up north.
The railroad has fired Bernard.
The Canadians are considering prosecution.
He's ready to make a statement implicating birch.
He's ready to make a statement implicating birch.
At Quantico, they call a case this straightforward...
Nobody cares.
Of course not.
Why would they?
Rookies always bring up Quantico.
Uh, do you need something else?
Let me know if you need pdf backups of those.
Will do.
He is right, though.
This birch thing's a dunker.
Dominique all day.
Wilkins!
So, tomorrow morning, when the arrest warrant is issued, along with a search warrant, we meet near birch's farm, all right?
You guys take him, we take his records.
Hey, quick question.
Alan.
Are we gonna handcuff him?
Yeah, obviously.
What about the s.E.C.?
Should we alert them?
We already have.
Press?
Probably, all right?
Probably, all right?
I mean, those news cameras just have a way of showing up at the right time, don't they?
So, we're gonna hit 'em full-on, right?
Yes.
We'll get local law enforcement there on the perimeter, but with the lights out.
All right, any more questions?
Bryan?
Let's put a pin in the arrest.
Boss?
Boss?
Get birch in here.
It's time to settle.
No, no.
N-no way.
We... we have him dead to rights on this trial.
I'm first chair.
Then it's jail for this jamoke.
We have him dead to rights, so he'll fold quick, and then we get back to what we were doing...
Axelrod.
I'm not letting us follow the riderless horse any longer.
Wait.
Riderless h...
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid.
They were smart.
They sent one of their horses off in a different direction so the posse would have to split up...
So the posse would have to split up...
Get distracted.
But this was no ordinary posse.
This was a super posse...
The super posse.
Mixed group of superheroes...
A sheriff, a marshal, an Indian.
"Native American."
Sure.
And the cherokee...
Man, he could read the depth of the impression the horse's hooves made on rock.
And when he realized they were chasing a riderless horse...
And when he realized they were chasing a riderless horse... they got right back on butch's trail.
I remember now.
I watched it with my dad on one of the Saturdays he showed up.
I didn't root for the super posse.
I rooted for butch and Sundance.
Of course you did.
We all did.
But that's not who we are anymore.
How are you, Bobby?
Hey, garth.
Ken.
I'd call you "sir Ken" out of respect for your advanced age and your accomplishments, but, as much as you'd like it, you were born in Chicago, and no one born there was ever knighted.
He would like it if we called him "sir."
He is that type.
You are that type, Ken.
You are that type, Ken.
And then what would we call you, axe?
Oh, hell, Kenny, call me whatever the fuck you want.
Or better, don't ever call me.
You know the reason why you should never call me?
Because you're a poacher, Ken, and guys like garth and me, we do not like poachers.
Come drag a deer off my land, see what the fuck happens to you.
Well, now that you've joined us, let me ask you...
How you doing?
I'm gonna let you in on something here, garth.
I'm gonna let you in on something here, garth.
Hedge fund guys only ask that question when they know the other guy is running bad, which he thinks because you are sitting with him.
Oh, we're just catching up.
And you still haven't answered.
It's a "crush the other guy" business.
It's like "highlander"...
There can be only one.
I don't blame you, Ken.
I'd do the same thing.
But I'm up 32% this year, which, from what I know of your run-and-hide approach, is 30 points better than what you are at vista verde.
Is 30 points better than what you are at vista verde.
Well, you can call it what you want, but I call it "careful."
Risk-averse.
When I opened my fund,
I was very aware of the responsibility that people like garth put in my hands, which is why I hedge my investments.
I protect the downside.
I may not be a rock star, but I'm still plugging away, all these many years later.
Have fun with your plugger.
Have fun with your plugger.
Can we step away for a sec?
I love talking to you, axe, and you made us a shit ton of money, but...
I need to keep things nice and comfy...
Results and optics.
My job's to spot the fund manager taking his eye off the ball before he strikes out.
That's what my members count on.
And they see someone like Kenneth, dry ass that he is, and they see someone like Kenneth, dry ass that he is, as solid...
Part of the firmament.
Sometimes that's important.
I hear you.
And I know you hated the headline in the newspaper.
Do what you have to do.
But I hope that in the days to come, you see me as part of that firmament.
I think you will.
You've all seen the evidence we've gathered regarding your railroad trades.
If we prevail at trial...
Which we're confident we will...
The federal sentencing guidelines call for you to serve 11 years.
We understand that you have young children.
Well, maybe they'll be out of college by the time you're released.
By the time you're released.
Maybe you can make it to their weddings.
But like we told your lawyers, we're willing to forgo that for a quick plea...
An admission of guilt, a forfeiture money judgment of $386 million.
As well as the voluntary shuttering of your fund and conversion of it to a family office.
You'll no longer handle any outside money.
I can get the s.E.C. In here right now to do that if you don't agree.
So, settlement or trial?
So, settlement or trial?
We're prepared to fight this for as long as we...
I...
Came here today to take a deal.
I don't want to go to jail.
Wise choice, Mr. birch.
Stay in the light.
You won't be getting a chance like this again.
This doesn't have to be over.
I'm actually relieved we settled.
Comfortable?
For the first time all fucking day.
Well, I have someone coming in here soon, and they might be a little freaked to see their boss...
I just came by to say "thank you" and "sorry"...
Two words I don't say very often.
Two words I don't say very often.
So it's handled with Victor?
You nailed it...
On every count.
And he got paid.
I used everything I knew about him to make him capitulate.
That's why I asked you to go.
You know why I went?
For you.
You and I...
We've never let each other down in all these years.
And I wasn't about to start because you acted like that never happened.
Because you acted like that never happened.
Cut me out again...
And I'm gone.
I know.
I won't.
Ellis eads.
We are honored to share this privilege with you, Mr. Axelrod.
With you, too, Mrs. Axelrod.
There's no sharing, Ellis.
It's Axelrod hall now.
No.
Of course.
We understand.
You think you do.
Now, I saw that when I came in here, you don't remember me, Chad.
I know who you are.
But you don't actually remember.
But you don't actually remember.
We've met before.
I caddied at the spoon when I was a kid.
It was the perfect summer job.
I carried your grandfather's bag quite a few times.
Your bag, too, Chad, in the summer after middle school.
How funny that we all end up here.
Now, here's the thing.
A lot of numbers have been thrown around... 100 for the naming rights, 25 for your name to come down.
But there is one number that really matters to me...
But there is one number that really matters to me... 16.
And we'll see if you still think it's funny, Chad.
$16 is what a caddy got paid for a loop.
Four hours of humping bags, smelling sour cigars, and watching all of you lie to each other about your golf scores in the 95-degree heat, but I was happy for the job.
That 16 bucks...
And I would do two loops a day, so it was $32 on a Saturday, $32 on a Sunday.
So it was $32 on a Saturday, $32 on a Sunday.
By the end of the weekend, I'd have 64 bucks.
16 weekends, memorial to labor day, $1,024.
That was his spending money for the entire year.
He'd stretch it out until the next summer.
Pretty much.
Until...
And you were there for this, Chad...
Your grandfather asked me to read a putt on 3.
It was a left-to-right leaker, and I told him so.
I'd seen the putt all summer long.
He closed the face, pulled it, missed it by a foot.
He closed the face, pulled it, missed it by a foot.
You laughed at him.
You made fun of his eyesight.
And he turned to me, and he fired me right there.
Not from the round, but from the club.
Now, I needed that $16, but he didn't give a shit.
Because he was embarrassed to have missed a putt in front of his grandson.
Are you saying we are here because of that ancient bullshit?
That's right!
16.
Which is why I am presenting you which is why I am presenting you with a check for $25 million minus 16, which leaves you with $9 million.
That is bullshit!
This is unacceptable.
Ellis, this is bullshit.
We will walk out of here if you don't honor the full amount.
No, you won't.
You need this $9 million.
Because none of you...
Not one...
Has done a single day of work from the moment your miserable prick of a grandfather fell facedown in the sand in palm beach.
And after reviewing your holdings, and after reviewing your holdings, your business interests, your debts,
I know that this check is the only thing standing between your family and bankruptcy.
So pick it up, put it in your pocket, and walk out of here.
Or I will.
Let's get out of here.
Mnh!
Mnh!
So, now the Axelrod name will be forever affixed to this building for all time.
Or until some guy richer than me wants it to come down.

Previously on "Billions"...
When did it become a crime to succeed in this country?
Everyone has access to the information.
We just know how to analyze it better.
Suspect trading pattern on Pepsum Pharmaceuticals.
They had inside information.
You must get pings like that every day.
It's bigger than that.
All three firms have links to Bobby Axelrod.
This would be a big one.
But a good matador doesn't try to kill a fresh bull.
You wait until he's been stuck a few times.
Why aren't you prosecuting the investment banks and hedge funds for insider trading?
Go ask the 81 convicted felons of financial crimes currently serving time.
But you have a very specific conflict of interest right in your own home.
Your value to the firm is absolute.
I've been working there since before we were married and long before you were in office.
I work for the public good.
No, you work for the good of Chuck Rhoades.
Maybe sometimes they intersect.
You know the Norton place out at the beach?
I just heard Bobby Axelrod is trying to buy it.
- How much?
- $83 million.
People hate guys who buy things like that.
You said there was only one thing you were afraid of...
Guys in windbreakers walking in your office saying, "step away from the computer."
And you told me you'd make sure it wouldn't happen.
So let me make sure.
Steven Birch?
It's either him or you.
Piedmont Capital.
Yeah.
That swap deal he did on Arcadian Railroad...
Do an autopsy on the deal, you'll find yourself a pulitzer in the carcass.
Front fucking page of the post.
It's like he's daring you.
There's movement.
It's likely they've opened a case file on you.
You know what?
I'm ready.
No, Pete, the gold standard is never coming back.
And if it did, this world would be so fucked,
I'd buy space travel, not gold.
Nice pitch, though.
If I'd have known it was a gold play,
I'd have never put him through.
Always put that lunatic through.
One out of every 200 ideas he has is fucking brilliant.
I got this.
Bad idea.
"No man is a hero to his valet."
That goes double for his C.O.O., so you are fucked with me either way.
Let's take a car to the city instead of flying.
What's underneath this?
Look, if the U.S. attorney is really coming, maybe it's better if we don't make you more of a target.
And more important, Garth Sykes from flagship.
Hated seeing you on the cover of the post with that goddamned oceanfront mansion.
Teachers in that pension fund make 40 grand a year.
People who have it spend it.
People who don't have it like billies better who spend on other folks.
Charity, good works.
I do, I have, and you know it.
Today, they only remember the house.
I have a feeling there'll be another one of us on the front pages soon enough, and they'll forget about that.
But if flagship does try and withdraw...
We can't let him.
If flagship pulls its $1.5 billion, it gets public.
Other institutions go, too.
Whole thing could domino.
Get with Sykes, keep them on board.
That's just why I'm telling you to keep it a little more low-key.
Who's more low-key than me?
So, the key to bagging Axe is... ?
- Pete Decker.
- Oh.
His fund.
Has to be.
We start with Decker since he had the longest tenure at Axe Capital of anyone who left with Axe's backing.
Get me some more of those cold sesame noodles, would you?
No, these are... these are Dandan noodles.
Same fucking thing.
No.
No, one's Szechuan, the other taiwanese.
It's a whole thing.
You know, this is why I don't mind the hours.
I'm always learning something on the job.
It's incredible.
Yeah, tell him about General Tso's, Bryan.
Oh, no, he flings this shit at you, too?
Sprays it all around.
The only place you've ever been is Asia, you can't help yourself.
Here... indictments on that Ponzi thing.
Tell me about the general, Bryan.
Come on.
Well, now you've done it.
General Tso, he was a statesman in the Ging dynasty.
Suppressed a revolution.
Oh, and now he has the true glory.
A fried chicken dish named for him the world over, huh?
That was created in America.
Maybe after we nail Axe, they'll reciprocate...
Name a dish after you in China, huh?
Oh-ho.
General Chuck's?
Really, what would that...
what would that look like, a burger with the cheese cooked on the inside?
You really think I could ever be that richly honored?
Hey, I will make it so.
Not if we're still stuck.
We need to find a way to get Pete Decker on the hook, right?
Decker hires young, and he pays at the top of the range.
Now, once these guys get a taste for that kind of money, they get desperate to keep it going.
Start tracking all of his analysts and traders.
Next one makes a mistake, we're right there.
Nice move.
Just like smoking in the girls' bathroom at St. Mary's.
You had to be quick, or you'd be over a nun's knee.
That's a fun picture to have in my head.
Mm.
Yeah.
They weren't that kind of nun.
They looked like Dick Cheney.
Look at that.
That is such a shitty name on such a great building.
Oh, don't.
Don't focus on that.
Think of all the good that's going on here tonight.
Can't.
It Mars everything.
The name up there should mean something.
Should add... add to the luster of the place.
Just don't look.
I like the building.
How much?
Good question.
They're about to pass the hat.
Get rid of this for us, will you?
Mm-hmm.
- Bobby!
- Birchy!
Pchoo!
Blow it up.
Yeah, baby.
Ohhh.
Oh!
What are you doing to me?
You're making me weak.
Time to power up.
Ohh!
That hits the spot.
Mmm.
Oh, fuck.
It's work.
It's my work ring.
Jesus.
It's Kornbluth.
Thought you left white-collar crime to cover the election.
That's true, but I stumbled onto one too good to give someone else.
Get to it.
What do you know about Steven Birch and Arcadian Railroad?
What?
What do you have?
Birch made a big play in the railroad...
Captured 43% before good numbers, and expansion plans were announced with inside information.
We want to know where the U.S. attorney for the Southern district stands on an investigation.
I'm posting this on the web in five minutes.
It's already on the desk.
It'd be better with a comment for you...
But I can't wait.
It's late.
That might not be enough time to get a comment.
I'm posting it.
We can't get beat on this story.
You can't run it without a motherfucking quote.
Oh, god.
Tara Mohr?
Yeah, you're on speaker.
Financial Journal called for comment on Steven Birch.
What about him?
They're running a story that he made illegal trades on Arcadian Railroad and that the evidence is incontrovertible.
Stall while we check.
But this sounds like bullshit.
I mean, how could the paper have that before we do... or the FBI?
You know, I went to school with a few guys who work for Birch.
- You want me to...
- Yes, right now.
Get Terri McCue over at FBI up on this, too... now.
Right.
I'm not tolling any bells for you, Bobby.
Sounds a bit like you are.
There's a reason you retained my firm.
Ah, fuck the firm... a bunch of rich, young lawyers.
There's a reason you retained me... me.
And that is...
I look far enough down the road to let you avoid the speed traps.
Okay.
What do you see?
U.S. attorney needs to bag you.
Rhoades could bring it quick or take two years.
- Two years?
- Then it becomes a three-front war...
P.R., redemptions, and the government.
It's not too early to start a makeover of the firm's culture.
What fucking culture?
Big returns that beat the street by double digits year in, year out, making our investors rich?
- That culture?
- No... the rep.
Smart money... maybe a little too smart.
If they bring an action, the whole strategy becomes about leveraging a settlement...
A deferred prosecution agreement and forfeiture that lets you keep working.
And the best way to get that is to act like you'd never settle.
I'd never settle.
That's the public posture, for sure.
I'd never settle.
Yeah.
That's a good delivery.
That'll work.
- Thank you!
Thank you!
- I'm gonna go find my table.
Thank you.
How you doing?
My name is penn jillette of penn and teller, and we're gonna give as much money as we can.
I will hurt myself, then you will hurt yourself with money.
Gonna look like this.
Think about how much that hurts and think about how good you would feel if you gave a million dollars.
Who's giving a million dollars?
Stand up.
Come on!
A million dollars!
Starting at a stick.
Fuck it.
$1 million!
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Oh!
You're a good man!
No better than you.
Wonderful.
Wonderful.
That's good.
Who are the cheapskates giving a half a million?
Come on!
Come on.
Half a million up there.
Get the fuck up, or people will think I'm not paying you enough.
Can I see $250,000?
I'll get everybody standing up eventually.
They will not let Teller go unless everybody stands up.
- How about $250,000 over here?
- _.
Holy shit.
Financial journal just pasted Birch.
100 grand... stand up.
Anybody else?
Anybody making $50,000?
How about $25,000?
He's gonna want that million back.
Everybody should be standing up at this point!
Hey.
You need a minute before we...
For what?
Pump-up sesh for the morning meeting, like every week.
Not happening.
Oh, what the fuck, Wend?
I count on it.
It's how I get in there and deal with those animals.
Canceled until further notice.
You don't need it... not anymore.
You're the best P.M. on the floor.
You know it.
They're fucking sure of it.
Those animals are used to you putting them down now.
Hardly even whimper as it happens.
Our sesh, while fun, is a waste of your time.
And mine.
Go get 'em!
Fuckin' a.
You just did it, didn't you?
All right.
3 feet apart, all right?
Tres, all right?
And mucha agua en la mañana.
Can you tell him no food and lots of water in the morning?
- He knows.
- Does he?
Yeah?
'Cause I don't feel like I'm getting much back from him.
I know you get it.
You know Lu wants to do zucchini flowers on special now that the frost is gone, so let's be ready when they come in.
You got it, boss.
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
We are up 32% year-to-date, and we are open to all moneymaking ideas.
Longs, shorts, sells, covers...
all Alpha welcome.
The choppy waters out there are perfect... for us.
For the average investor, hell no.
But never forget... what's bad for him is good for us.
If... if we're as smart as we think we are.
If not, the heat'll melt us like an almond joy in The Sun.
So, are you smart enough?
Some of us fuckin' are.
How about you, Pouch?
How am I supposed to answer that?
You already have.
Sadly.
What happened on Eureka Trans-ship?
You knew they were gonna whiff their numbers.
Why didn't you bang the short harder?
You left 5 fucking percent on the table.
I thought they were gonna whiff, but I didn't know.
You are such a pussy on the short side.
Go home and get your fuckin' shinebox.
Insulted him a little bit.
Yeah, a little bit.
Axe, you saw my position.
You could have upped him.
That's what I'm paying you for.
You see an opportunity like that again, you grab it like it's a horse cock and you're Catherine the Great.
Okay, okay.
Saldana, why are we still tied up in those hospitals?
Baby boomers.
They're getting old, so they're getting sick.
When the group reports patient volumes, it's gonna overshoot street expectations.
We're talking 10% move.
That incremental revenue will drop right to the bottom line, and the stock's gonna pop like a prom queen's cherry.
Good fucking answer.
It really is.
God damn it.
Okay, new-idea time.
Donnie Caan, what do you have for us?
I think apple still has room to move north.
Really?
Our investors pay us a 3% management fee and 30% of their profits, and you want me to tell them we're buying some fucking apple?
Sorry, Axe.
I-I guess I'm just not seeing the matrix right now.
That's a little unsettling, Donnie...
Since seeing the matrix is your entire fucking job.
It's kind of like if you were a hurdler and instead of jumping over the fucking hurdles...
It's okay, Donnie.
You'll see it again.
Hang in.
Okay, guys?
Let's go out there, bring some meat back to camp.
Or some nuts.
Hunt or gather.
I'm sorry.
I tried to give you the heads-up, but...
Phones down.
We're S.E.C. Compliance.
I need all portfolio managers and analysts to return to their desks.
Traders, stay here.
Case officers will meet each pod and expect full cooperation.
Better answer their questions.
Cooperate.
This group of energy trades...
I'd like you to supply the research behind them.
I was tasked, so I supplied it.
Right, but going through your reports, I see gaps.
Like this boardwalk pipeline move...
what supported it?
It was an event-driven strategy.
Okay, it was based on an unsolicited tip.
The trade was near 100,000 shares.
Close to a $2.5 million position based on a rumor.
It seemed...
Solid.
Looking at tele-comm... this Verizon trade?
It's part of an event-driven macroplay.
Bullshit.
All right, I got a tip.
And the pharmaceutical trades?
That was phone-a-tip.
Incoming tip.
What am I, a fucking schmuck?
Of course I'm gonna listen.
That was a prom-night promise.
And that means... ?
"Just the tip."
So, this is your entire book and trading history for the past three months?
That's right.
Wow.
Bit of a rough patch, huh?
Seriously?
I need to see your trades for the past 90 days.
Unless you got a Wells notice with my name on it, you're not gonna see jack shit.
Come on, we can pull it all down from the server anyway, so you may as well cooperate.
Mm.
Good point.
Lawyer.
Your boss said you should cooperate.
Oh.
Lawyer.
Just answer the question.
You answer me one.
How much do you make?
I'm gonna need access to your files, paper, and computer.
For what?
I'm authorized to check that all trades comply...
I'm not a trader.
Whatever you call yourself, after I review...
My files are confidential.
You're not seeing them.
You can call the Attorney General if you want, and tell her I say "hi" if you do.
We had dinner last month.
Otherwise, fuck off.
Enough.
Okay?
Enough.
I hope you enjoyed the lifeboat drill this morning.
Are you kidding me?
We did not do well.
In fact, we sank.
If it were a real S.E.C. raid, we would have been fucked.
Get the fuck out of here.
I shit my pants for nothing?
I didn't do this for my amusement.
What happened to Steven Birch...
Who I am sure will be cleared of any wrongdoing...
It could happen to us.
So we need to be prepared.
To that end, say "hello"
to our new and improved compliance department.
These assholes work here now?
That, they do.
They're here for our support and our protection, and you will not even be taking a piss without them close enough to give it a shake.
From here on, we evaluate every move...
Not just for the upside, but for its ethical grounding.
We have to be more pure than the virgin Mary before her first period.
Fuck, wags.
How the hell are we supposed to make any money?
You think this is a joke, Victor?
You, in particular, were flagged.
Flagged?
Your short on that chip maker.
Eleva Peripherals.
Netted 38% fresh blubber on that seal hunt.
Rotten carcass... over the line.
We're lucky the S.E.C. hasn't come calling already.
You're done.
Fired.
Clear out.
Leave your key cards.
This is bullshit.
I didn't do anything out-of-bounds...
No more than anyone else.
Did I sign off on that trade?
No, I did not.
Don't say anything else.
I trusted you with my name and my capital, and you fucked me.
You put us all at risk with your deceitful, illegal moves.
Now get out of here.
All right, everybody, back at it.
Play hard, play clean.
Be careful out there.
That was a hell of a public spanking.
Make sure our investors know about it.
On it.
I'm gonna make sure Garth Sykes hears about it A.S.A.P.
You're gonna be a god on the street by lunchtime.
I thought I already was one.
Greater god.
Don't you fuckin' touch me!
Or my cellphone.
I was going to tell you about the compliance gag, but you didn't show up at the charity dinner, and then...
Then...
I was half a hallway from your office.
Try again.
Honest?
It was an oversight.
No, it wasn't.
You don't make them.
And that matters.
But what matters more right now is that Victor is exactly the wrong person to fire that way.
That was spur-of-the-moment.
It was a spur-of-the-moment fuck-up.
His entire psychological makeup sets him up to react very poorly to public humiliation.
The same things that made him a profit center for you will make him a difficult adversary if he's not handled right.
He will stew and obsess and find a way to exact revenge on you.
Okay.
I can see that.
Will you fix it?
Go do it, please.
I made a mistake not looping you in.
I admit that.
"Mistake."
Last chance.
Okay.
It was a red team drill.
I wanted everybody to react as they would naturally.
I left you out on purpose.
And I will make it up to you.
Please deal with Victor.
Sean Ayles, please.
It's Lara Axelrod.
Sean.
Hi.
This is the call you've been waiting for.
I wanted to talk to you about making a donation.
I figured you would.
And about naming rights.
And so the names on these buildings become more than just identifiers.
They become signifiers of a grander age, when titans of industry understood that the purpose of their wealth was to support the performative arts to improve the quality of life for all those who live in and visit this city.
Now give me the Gettysburg address.
I'm sorry.
That... sounded rehearsed.
I'm vamping.
I'm in a difficult spot.
No, yeah, I know.
Because what you need to tell me is that the Eads family owns the naming rights to this building in perpetuity.
But I'm here offering you $100 million, which you need to extract somehow without giving me what I want.
I'm in a difficult spot.
No, yeah, I know.
Also, "performative" does not mean "performance."
Most donors like an air of...
I don't.
There are other naming opportunities on the ground that would give you the status and sense of permanence that you need.
Why is this building so important to you?
Here's why it's important to you.
It's the only way you are getting even a dollar out of me.
Now, I happen to have discovered that the remaining members of the Eads family are in a financial pinch.
They need to raise cash.
And they will have a hard time getting ahold of the kind of loan they need to pay off their other loans.
So, I want you to tell them that I will pay them $25 million to allow me to replace their family name with mine.
Then I will donate the 100, and you can begin your renovations.
Oh.
There is one condition I'll need you to sign off on.
Don't scream.
Look there.
What the fuck?
Get out.
I'm calling the police.
You don't want to do that, Tara.
Who the fuck are you?
Your newest and bestest.
You should stay and listen to me.
Or else this goes viral.
You're making me weak.
"You're making me weak."
We have... we have training against this.
You think you're gonna fucking blackmail me?
So what?
I fuck girls, guys.
Who cares?
Everyone fucks.
That thing has no chance to compromise me.
I hope it at least gets you off, man.
What gets me off would disturb you at such a deep level, honey, you'd be best-served never to think about it again.
Folks in your line care about that kind of thing, though.
And this...
Your hair...
Which will test positive for cocaine, can be in Chuck Rhoades' hands within an hour.
You're gonna watch, listen, and report, and everything's gonna be fine.
It's a lot to take in.
We've already gone through all of this crap.
I heard back from my sources.
There's a war room set up at Birch's.
Lawyers, accountants... the whole thing.
Guys at his shop are prepping their résumés.
Well, if it was just smoke, they'd issue a denial...
Keep working.
Yeah.
They're treating this article like it's a warrant.
Somebody wanted to hurt Birch, and they wanted us on the ass end.
So they leaked it.
And I do not like it.
We need the reins back in our hands.
Understood.
You want me to stay on this Axe/Decker thing?
No.
Set that aside.
Until we know at least as much as this fucking reporter knows, let's keep the brights on Steven Birch.
All right.
Get me every article
Randy Kornbluth wrote in the past year.
All of Mike Dimonda's articles, too.
We'll start there.
Mike.
Good parlor trick, knowing my address.
That'll look like a fun intimidation tactic when I write this up.
Oh.
You're not writing this up.
Because that would be a small win, and you're not in it for small wins.
No, you've come too far.
Too young an age for that.
I'm in it because people deserve to know the truth
- about power and money and... whoa.
- Wait a minute.
What are you, Glenn Greenwald all of a sudden?
Come on.
You know, I've, uh, I've been reading...
Randy Kornbluth lately.
He usually covers state politics.
He hasn't had a hard business story in 18 months, but all of a sudden, he hooks into a full-blown crime story...
On Steven Birch.
His article quotes former federal prosecutor James Robbins, who says that the connection between hedge funds and company officials must be probed.
You know who else likes quoting James Robbins?
You.
Seven times in the past six months.
He's a widely respected source with connections...
He's a fucking rent-a-quote.
I know you really wrote the Birch story, and I think I know why you chose to hide that fact.
If I am such a careerist, why would I ever hide something that good?
'Cause you thought it would endear you to someone.
What you should have done, if you were really playing an elevated game, was come to me with what you had.
See, if I had something better to give you in exchange for you holding on to it...
You have never been willing to play any kind of game with me.
I didn't know you were ready to play in the bigs, man.
Now I do.
So, these are the rules.
You tell me who fed you that...
No.
I'm gonna head inside.
Because this conversation has peaked, and you don't get to tell me the rules.
You're correct.
I'm not gonna write up this ambush.
But I can.
Anytime I want to.
So think about that the next time you try and bar me from a press conference or dodge my call.
Have a good night.
All right.
Thank you.
Uh...
You know what?
Here's the $20 for whatever the guy in the blue shirt back there wants.
- I got you.
- Okay, thank you.
Okay, guys, let's go.
Come on.
Now, you guys remember when we threw grandpa a surprise party for his birthday and we all had to keep the secret?
Yeah.
Okay.
Why do we have to keep the secret?
To make Grandpa happy.
Right.
So this is like that, okay?
We don't tell anyone about the doughnuts to make Mommy happy.
Okay?
Rhoades!
Don't you walk away before you meet my kids.
Mr. Kroll, we are in a public place...
With, uh, as you say, our children.
Uh, why don't you guys go sit on the bench over there, okay?
Take your sister over there.
I-I don't need your, um...
Kindness now.
I-I needed it at sentencing.
This is Margo and Stevie.
Hello.
I kept them out of school today so we could be together because I go to prison tomorrow.
How do you live with yourself?
How?
Yeah.
I think long and hard before any prosecution in my office goes forward.
And I'm proudest of the cases I choose not to prosecute.
But when I go forward, it's full guns.
I made one goddamn mistake.
And who got hurt?
No one.
You could have let it go.
You committed mail fraud.
And you knew that my wife had died...
Suddenly...
And that I was desperate and lost.
Y-you read the articles.
You... you got letters from 100 people who vouched for the man that I was and would be again.
I'm what those kids have left.
And they won't have me again for four years.
Have a nice stroll with yours.
And take your fucking $20 or just...
leave it here for the birds to pick at.
Let's go, kids.
Daddy's done with this asshole.
You wanted to see me?
Hey.
I want to give you a short that you're not gonna bail on too quick.
Do you know Cross-co.?
Cross-co.
Trucking.
I've been tracking it.
Mid-size firm, has a big distribution contract with that bakery company Yumtime.
Been holding 50.
Fundamentals are solid.
I don't see the short play.
I don't need you to see it.
I need you to do it.
We'll get 50 on the tape.
We'll size up later.
You got a fucking problem with this?
No.
You plug that investor leakage?
I thought I'd done exactly that, but I haven't been able to get Garth Sykes on the phone.
He bails, it hurts us.
Yeah.
I tried.
But I think I need you to show face with this guy.
You got this.
That's why I have you.
That fucker thinks that if you come running over here,
I'm gonna forget he fired me in front of everyone I know?
Who knows what he thinks?
One minute, you're his most trusted advisor, the next, you're on the outside.
I'm here because...
I think you might make it worse for yourself, and I don't want to see that.
The money I made him...
He treated me like a lowlife.
And that's a trigger for you.
Everyone laughing at me growing up.
The dyslexia.
Even the teachers.
I sent every one of those pricks a photo of my first million-dollar bonus check.
That made you feel really good for about 24 hours, and then you hated yourself for letting them know they ever got to you.
Kind of.
Sometimes.
This is different.
I know plenty about how Axe Capital works...
The dirty edge...
The proprietary trading techniques.
I know how the secret sauce is made.
Yeah.
I'm sure you could put out a Schott's miscellany about the place.
Schott's?
It's like a farmer's almanac for non-farm stuff.
Then, yeah, I could put out a couple of volumes of Schott's miscellany about the place.
You just need to ask yourself one question first...
Are you rich enough to never get another job?
I did work for that man.
Bribed an oil company C.F.O. for him...
Stop talking.
We're not in session.
That's not privileged.
Point is, I got all muddied up for him.
Hard not to rub it on his clean, white shirt now.
Remember Warren Jaffin, the analyst?
Yeah.
Bright guy?
That kid was sharp.
Employable?
Real sharp, yeah.
Then he balked at his bonus one year and got popped.
He got another job right away at a huge bank... $3 million a year, guaranteed.
Only, word got back to Axe that Warren had badmouthed him in the interview...
Said Axe wasn't generous with him.
So Axe called the head of the bank, asked him to pull the offer that day, which the guy did.
Can you imagine...
How humiliating that was for Warren?
Probably told his whole family, all his friends that he was back.
But Axe didn't leave it there.
He called the president or chairman of every prime broker, bank, and fund in the industry and had him blackballed.
Put it out over the loudspeaker, direct from the principal's office...
"if you hire Warren Jaffin, you are my enemy."
Do you know what Warren does now?
He's got a blog.
You've built a real life for yourself, Victor...
A long way from Queens.
If Axe is certain you'll act like a gentleman, he will make sure to take care of you.
You were the one that always told me to stand up for myself.
When you can win, yes.
The only way you can win now is by letting it go.
You know, I have to confess to something.
Okay.
You're not gonna like it.
Fire away.
I took the kids for doughnuts.
I know.
Kevin told me.
Good.
Oh.
You're glad he cracked?
No, I never want them to keep secrets from you.
They're gonna keep them from me their entire teenage years.
They should at least know that they always can confide in you.
And among your many gifts, that is a great one.
Everyone feels like you're always on their side.
Well, I try to be, or at least...
Understand where they're coming from.
That's the wonderful part of your job.
You get to employ your empathy.
I have to be a real prick sometimes, you know?
At work.
Yeah.
Sometimes, we all do things we're not proud of at work.
Well, this is different.
When I was in the park with the kids, there was this guy who...
Specifics don't matter.
What does is, that every once in a while, there's this thing we say...
"I am never so proud as when I choose not to prosecute a case."
And that's true... in theory.
But once in a while, I wish that I could just be more human.
But I haven't figured out how to do that and my job at the same time.
You know?
Being 100% good at your job and 100% good if you figure that one out, let's both quit and write that book.
It's a luxury to relax every once in a while, isn't it, Garth?
I remember this place... fondly.
Look, the stability of this firm has never been in question.
I need to look into Axelrod's eyes, hear him say it.
Yeah, he will.
I just wanted to hear you first.
I may be from Kentucky, but I'm no rube.
I don't bet on long shots when it comes to investing the pensions of my members.
That's why they trust me with their $5 billion.
I get nervous, I see someone like Axelrod running around spending his money like he's a goddamn rap singer.
Emcee.
Like a rap emcee.
No, some of 'em sing now.
My kids showed me.
Snoop and Kid Rock both.
You're right... you are no rube.
But Bobby Axelrod isn't, either.
We've crushed the SP seven years running, which means you have crushed the SP.
You turn over now.
Everyone beats it... till they don't.
When I can I see Axe, talk to him about it?
You don't want to rush off now, do you?
Here's McCue.
She got some stuff on Birch.
You are gonna love my nuts.
Pierre Bernard, longtime C.F.O. of the Arcadian, gets passed over for C.E.O., gets censured internally for certain financial improprieties.
Press clippings I thought you might want.
And Bernard interviews for a job at Birch shortly before the trades.
We have secretaries on both sides confirming the meet.
Birch's trades in arcadian occur a half-hour afterward.
We alerted our counterparts up north.
The railroad has fired Bernard.
The Canadians are considering prosecution.
He's ready to make a statement implicating Birch.
At Quantico, they call a case this straightforward...
Nobody cares.
Of course not.
Why would they?
Rookies always bring up Quantico.
Uh, do you need something else?
Let me know if you need PDF backups of those.
Will do.
He is right, though.
This Birch thing's a dunker.
Dominique all day.
Wilkins!
So, tomorrow morning, when the arrest warrant is issued, along with a search warrant, we meet near Birch's farm, all right?
You guys take him, we take his records.
Hey, quick question.
Alan.
Are we gonna handcuff him?
Yeah, obviously.
What about the S.E.C.?
Should we alert them?
We already have.
Press?
Probably, all right?
I mean, those news cameras just have a way of showing up at the right time, don't they?
- So, we're gonna hit 'em full-on, right?
- Yes.
We'll get local law enforcement there on the perimeter, but with the lights out.
All right, any more questions?
Bryan?
Let's put a pin in the arrest.
Boss?
Get Birch in here.
It's time to settle.
No, no.
N-no way.
We... we have him dead to rights on this trial.
I'm first chair.
Then it's jail for this jamoke.
We have him dead to rights, so he'll fold quick, and then we get back to what we were doing...
Axelrod.
I'm not letting us follow the riderless horse any longer.
Wait.
Riderless h...
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
They were smart.
They sent one of their horses off in a different direction so the posse would have to split up...
Get distracted.
But this was no ordinary posse.
This was a super posse... the super posse.
Mixed group of superheroes...
A sheriff, a marshal, an Indian.
"Native American."
Sure.
And the cherokee...
Man, he could read the depth of the impression the horse's hooves made on rock.
And when he realized they were chasing a riderless horse they got right back on Butch's trail.
I remember now.
I watched it with my dad on one of the Saturdays he showed up.
I didn't root for the super posse.
I rooted for Butch and Sundance.
Of course you did.
We all did.
But that's not who we are anymore.
How are you, Bobby?
Hey, Garth.
Ken.
I'd call you "Sir Ken" out of respect for your advanced age and your accomplishments, but, as much as you'd like it, you were born in Chicago, and no one born there was ever knighted.
He would like it if we called him "Sir."
He is that type.
You are that type, Ken.
And then what would we call you, Axe?
Oh, hell, Kenny, call me whatever the fuck you want.
Or better, don't ever call me.
You know the reason why you should never call me?
Because you're a poacher, Ken, and guys like Garth and me, we do not like poachers.
Come drag a deer off my land, see what the fuck happens to you.
Well, now that you've joined us, let me ask you...
How you doing?
I'm gonna let you in on something here, Garth.
Hedge fund guys only ask that question when they know the other guy is running bad, which he thinks because you are sitting with him.
Oh, we're just catching up.
And you still haven't answered.
It's a "crush the other guy" business.
It's like "Highlander"...
there can be only one.
I don't blame you, Ken.
I'd do the same thing.
But I'm up 32% this year, which, from what I know of your run-and-hide approach, is 30 points better than what you are at vista verde.
Well, you can call it what you want, but I call it "careful."
Risk-averse.
When I opened my fund,
I was very aware of the responsibility that people like Garth put in my hands, which is why I hedge my investments.
I protect the downside.
I may not be a rock star, but I'm still plugging away, all these many years later.
Have fun with your plugger.
Can we step away for a sec?
I love talking to you, Axe, and you made us a shit ton of money, but...
I need to keep things nice and comfy...
Results and optics.
My job's to spot the fund manager taking his eye off the ball before he strikes out.
That's what my members count on.
And they see someone like Kenneth, dry ass that he is, as solid...
Part of the firmament.
Sometimes that's important.
I hear you.
And I know you hated the headline in the newspaper.
Do what you have to do.
But I hope that in the days to come, you see me as part of that firmament.
I think you will.
You've all seen the evidence we've gathered regarding your railroad trades.
If we prevail at trial... which we're confident we will...
The federal sentencing guidelines call for you to serve 11 years.
We understand that you have young children.
Well, maybe they'll be out of college by the time you're released.
Maybe you can make it to their weddings.
But like we told your lawyers, we're willing to forgo that for a quick plea...
An admission of guilt, a forfeiture money judgment of $386 million.
As well as the voluntary shuttering of your fund and conversion of it to a family office.
You'll no longer handle any outside money.
I can get the S.E.C. in here right now to do that if you don't agree.
So, settlement or trial?
We're prepared to fight this for as long as we...
I...
Came here today to take a deal.
I don't want to go to jail.
