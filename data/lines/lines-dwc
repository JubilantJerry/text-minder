'Come in, SHADO Control.
Switch in the emergency link.
Emergency link negative, sir.
I can assure you, Colonel, solar activity is minimal.
You're sure?
- What else can it be?
- A fault in the equipment.
The checks say no.
Run a new test series.
The solar wind has disrupted communications more than once.
- It's not responsible this time.
- Just run the test.
- Anything promising?
- No, not yet.
- Give me 7.
- 7 it is.
9.
9.
- Infrared.
- Infrared.
Feed out.
Thank you.
The corona would be symmetrical if there were an increase
- in the number of sunspots.
- Exactly.
No unusual solar activity.
But it all fitted.
Have you considered the possibility of outside interference?
- Go on.
- Just an idea.
Dalotek.
They're operating on limited frequencies.
They could be violating the agreement.
- Is there a way to check?
- Just one.
Well, that completes this run.
What is it?
Trouble?
Why else should we receive a visit from the military?
We're operating well within the prescribed frequencies, Colonel.
- We'll check that, Miss Carson.
- We're open to check at any time.
But to switch off the geo-scanner means a write-off for all our work.
There'd have to be adequate reason for so drastic a step.
More than adequate reason, Mr Tanner.
Our base radio lost total contact with earth half an hour ago.
- Maybe increased solar activity.
- The solar wind?
The coronagraph check shows negative.
How about a simple radio fault?
Do you check your fuses, Colonel?
We've checked everything.
Now you want to check us.
Can you think of a more logical step?
Run another communication check on Moonbase, Alec.
You ordered a continuous check 30 minutes ago.
Yes, yes.
Why don't you get some sleep?
I will.
But not until that video link is back.
Well, you've examined the frequency settings, Colonel.
I think they prove that we've followed the agreement to the letter.
You haven't intentionally been operating unlimited frequencies, but you could have used them inadvertently.
Miss Carson is in charge of the geo-scanner.
She's very experienced.
I can imagine.
Colonel, exactly how many radio failures have you had?
- One so far.
- That doesn't seem too serious.
For a military organisation, it could be catastrophic.
You're convinced that we're to blame?
It seemed the logical conclusion.
I'm glad we've been able to change your mind.
So am I. Except now it means I'm back at square one.
You'll have to excuse me, Colonel.
I have the seismic meters to service.
I'll leave you with Miss Carson.
If you have any question, ask her.
Au revoir, Colonel.
- Miss Carson, I...
- Jane.
Up here, formality's a little superfluous.
Paul.
All right.
Paul.
I have the impression you're not 100% certain we're not the source of your difficulties.
I can see I'm right.
And I suppose next time there's a radio blackout, we're going to get the blame.
No, but I shall want to make a check on the use of the scanner.
With radio failure, how can you?
We're 50 kilometres away.
We'll install a land line between here and Moonbase.
Then we'll always have a direct link.
And?
Only the geo-scanner is powerful enough to disrupt communications.
If there's another blackout and it isn't transmitting...
- We're in the clear?
- Yes.
But you'll have to take our word for it that we're not transmitting.
I'll take your word for it.
I don't think we're to blame, Paul.
I've been very careful.
So have Mark and Phil.
We'll install the land line immediately.
I'll wait for your first call.
I must go.
- Have you seen all you want?
- Yeah, I've seen about everything.
Are you satisfied?
Very.
SHADO Control to Moonbase.
Do you read me?
- SHADO Control to Moonbase...
- 'Reading you.'
'Strength 5, voice and vision.'
Immediate for Commander Straker.
- Moonbase contact re-established.
- Yes, sir.
Stand by for video circuit tests.
Land line installation complete, sir.
Right.
Dalotek Base, how's reception?
Well, our own private line.
I'm flattered.
Tell me, Jane, what do you do on your evenings off?
I know this marvellous little Italian restaurant not 200 miles from here.
How about dinner?
- Do they have fettuccine?
- 'Beautiful fettuccine.'
And a fat, Italian Mama, who does all her own cooking?
You've been there.
I'll reserve a corner table.
- We'll sit and look at the stars.
- Our only problem will be...
How the devil do we eat fettuccine through a quarter-inch space visor?
Listen, I've got a moon ship coming soon, so I'll...
I'll have to be going.
- Do we have it on positive track?
- Yes, sir.
Control to Lunar Module.
Switch to computer control for landing.
Roger.
- Landing is go.
- 'Thank you, Control.
On computer...'
- Do we still have them?
- I'm losing them.
Radio malfunction.
Control to Module.
Switch to manual.
Control to Mo...
This is Lunar Module.
I have lost you.
Maintaining computer control for landing.
Switch to manual.
We have radio blackout.
This is Lunar Module.
I repeat, Lunar Module.
I have lost you.
Maintaining control for computer landing.
Complete computer shut-down.
This is Lunar Module.
This is Lunar Module.
This is Lunar Module, switching back to manual control.
He must have switched to manual, but I think it's too late.
Get a rescue team out there.
Dalotek Base.
Yes, Paul.
But everything was turned off except the geo-scanner and that wasn't transmitting.
I see.
- What's wrong?
- Colonel Foster's coming over.
There's been an accident at Military Base.
Moon ship.
The radio blacked out and all the crew were killed.
I say you're responsible.
I understand how you feel, Colonel, but you're wrong.
I made the mistake of believing that last time.
- What do you intend to do about it?
- End your operation.
- You can't mean that.
- You don't have the authority.
I do mean it.
And I do have the authority.
- But the project's almost completed.
- I have no alternative.
I'm sorry.
- Remove the circuits.
- Don't touch the equipment!
Phil.
I can't allow this.
Those circuits are irreplaceable.
Exactly.
I'd like to speak to your commanding officer.
There isn't time, and it wouldn't matter anyway.
The circuits come out.
Put them in the Moon Mobile.
You haven't heard the last of this.
Maybe.
But we've heard the last of that.
- So what do we do now?
- What can we do?
Carry on as best we can until we receive instructions from Blake.
In the meantime we can collect our equipment from the surface.
Fine.
Phil, you take the area we worked on yesterday.
Jane, you go with him.
I'll do the section by the new crater.
OK?
- What is it?
- I'm not sure that matters.
The point is, did we damage it with our blasting?
- Or was it damaged by the meteorite?
- How did it get into the crater?
- Foster installed it.
- When?
The crater's only been there a few days.
This is getting us nowhere.
We've got to decide what to do about it.
We go outside and take a closer look.
Good idea.
The commander took the decision on the spot.
I support that decision.
'The Astrophysical Commission may disagree after talking to me.'
That's your prerogative, Mr Blake.
Meanwhile, Dalotek does what it's told.
'You'll be hearing from me. '
'Sighting, 4028.
'Confirm speed 0-SOL 8.'
I've got it.
Red alert.
Interceptors immediate launch.
- We've picked up a UFO.
- Give me the trajectory coordinates.
'Blake...
'Video link...'
Another blackout.
Try and re-set.
- Anything?
- Nothing.
- What the blazes is going on?
- We've lost them again, sir.
- And the emergency link?
- We've tried it.
- Keep trying.
- Sir.
SHADO Control to Moonbase, do you read me?
Nothing, sir.
Reed, we must get that tracker working.
I'll do my best.
If I can find the source of the trouble.
'UFO maintaining course.
Interceptors...'
'Range, 20 million miles.
'Awaiting missing timing and attack...'
'UFO maintaining...'
Lieutenant Ford.
Will you come into the office?
That library material we were running through the other day.
- Is it still set up?
- Yes, sir.
Good.
There's something in the back of my mind about one of those interviews you did back in 1969.
Something that won't quite click into place.
Which one was it, sir?
I think it was the one with Dr Stranges.
Yes.
There's nothing in that one about radio blackouts,
I can assure you, sir.
Maybe.
But there's something.
Re-run it.
Run the interview with Dr Stranges.
Channel it into Commander Straker's office.
'Yes, sir.'
- 'Dr Stranges, welcome to London.' - 'Thank you very much.'
'In this year of 1969, man has just landed on the moon 'and we're bursting with new knowledge about space.
'But we have so very little on unidentified flying objects.
'As the President of...'
I remember all this.
Let's see the second half.
Wind on.
'What is the position of the United Nations regarding UFOs?
'
'The United Nations, as a physical body, 'has never gone on record as a body, as far as UFOs are concerned.
'However, I spoke at the U.N. Outer Space Affairs Committee...'
D'you want to go on, sir?
Yes, let it run.
'... told the press,
"We have a two-fold problem facing the world today."
"Number one is the Vietnam crisis and number two, unidentified flying objects."
Maybe it was my interview with Dr Bressinger from MIT.
No.
There's just a word, a phrase.
'... they're so involved in other things 'they haven't seen the seriousness of the problem of UFOs.
'Although it's a fact that every nation...'
Let's go back.
- Where are they?
- They must be working outside.
Dalotek.
Another radio failure.
Yes.
Both our bases are in imminent danger.
Get me Tanner.
Colonel Foster.
Hello, Colonel.
We were just about to call you.
You know that installation of yours in that new crater?
What installation?
Crater 236?
If there's an installation there, Tanner, it doesn't belong to us.
- Estimated range?
- Approximately 2,0.
5 minutes from the last known trajectory termination.
Estimated target proximity of Moon Mobile?
1 minute 50.
'Out of historical interest, how long have UFOs been sighted and recorded?
'
'UFO history goes back to...'
I don't think there's anything, sir.
We checked this material carefully.
It was just a hunch.
'The Romans called them...'
- Hold it!
- '... fiery disks and the Greeks...'
Stop the tape.
- Run back a few feet.
- Go back ten feet.
'The Egyptians called them sky bolts or sky balls, 'fireballs.
- 'The Romans...'
- Fireballs.
'... fiery disks...'
What's another word for fireballs, Lieutenant?
- Thunderbolt?
- Or?
Meteorite!
Crater 236.
- Still no radio contact?
- No.
ETA crater 236, 1 minute 5.
'Range, 10 million miles.'
The position is becoming only too clear, Lieutenant.
Just as we hear that Moonbase is under attack from a UFO, radio contact is lost.
Something is jamming the signal.
I believe the cause is some sort of alien device in crater 236.
If it was sent in using an orbit, it would make us think it was a meteorite.
'Range 5 million miles.
Bearing positive.'
Do we go on without confirmation?
Our orders are to destroy the installation.
But the Dalotek base is pretty close by.
We assume Colonel Foster's thought of that.
Tanner?
90 seconds.
'I'm confirming we're going to detonate in crater 236.
'Be prepared for an explosive decompression.
Good luck.'
All right.
Get your helmets on.
- I say Foster's up to something.
- We've got no choice.
Come on.
Interceptor leader to Moonbase.
Come in, Moonbase.
'The Interceptors are in position, 'awaiting timing and attack data.'
Predict Interceptors will be in range in about 40 seconds.
If they haven't altered course.
- Estimated proximity of Moon Mobile?
- They should be on target now, sir.
They better be.
OK.
Range on target.
Range on target.
It's coming through.
Trajectory 80-3-9, 20-7-4.
Base to Interceptors, switch to computer link for course correction and missile firing sequence.
Straker.
'We've re-established contact with Moonbase, sir.'
Right.
Colonel Foster, what's the position?
'There was an alien device near the Dalotek base.'
Yes, we assumed as much.
'We have the UFO on positive track.
'The Interceptors are going in to attack.'
Missile launch, minus 8,5.
'Well done, Captain.
Return to base.'
How are the Dalotek personnel?
'They were shaken, but they're fine now.
'The Moon Mobile is bringing them back.'
Right.
You'll have to use the amnesia procedure.
'I'll take care of it.
Out.'
All this.
I see now why Commander Straker was so reluctant to have us up here.
I'd like to say, Colonel, that your position, everything you've told me, it's a safe secret with me.
Have the amnesia shots been laid on for the Dalotek team?
We'll administer them just before take-off, Colonel.
I think I'll get some rest.
See you later.
- Hello, Paul!
- Hi!
I wondered why they brought two coffee cups.
- How do you feel?
- Fine.
- Can I get you anything?
- No.
- Paul, I wanted to apologise.
- For what?
All the trouble we caused you, losing that Lunar Module.
Come and sit down.
- It wasn't your fault.
- There's nothing we could have done?
It would have happened anyway.
It was inevitable.
We never did eat that fettuccine.
We will.
But when you've forgotten about this.
Forgotten?
The amnesia shots.
But there's nothing to worry about.
Thank you.
The Dalotek team stayed on for a couple more days.
- You and Jane must have got close.
- Why don't you ask her?
Very funny.
How does that old song go?
"Love's more beautiful the second time around, just as wonderful with both feet on the ground."
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I don't think you know me, but my name's Foster.
Paul Foster.
Now, I would say you are some kind of geologist.
May I sit down?
Why, yes.
How did you know I was a geologist?
(PLAYING GUITAR)
Always wanted to be a racing driver
But I never ever, ever liked the smell of cars
I knew that I'd go far
Yeah, I knew that I'd go far
Far enough to see I'd get there without a car
Without a car
Always wanted to be just a little biz' more than clever
But I wasn't born underneath a lucky star
I knew that I'd go far
Yeah, knew that I'd go far
Far enough to see I'd get there without a star♪
Sorry to rush you, darling.
I've got a meeting at 9:45.
Jocelyn, have you got that file on George Eliot?
Yes.
- You have rung Stephen, haven't you?
- Yes.
- Oh!
Good morning, Ann.
- Good morning.
- How's Daddy?
- Fine, thank you.
- Mummy well?
- Yes.
That's good. (CLEARS THROAT)
Hello Jean, could you possibly ask Dean to come on Thursday to see Mrs Talbot?
Yes, that is tomorrow.
Uh-huh.
Okay, bye-bye-
Come and meet everybody, Peter.
Jocelyn, this is Peter Morissey, a very brilliant young writer who we've been lucky enough to sign.
Now, I think we should have a bio on him.
Have you got time to give Jocelyn it now?
- Biography?
- Yes.
- Oh, no.
Tomorrow.
- Yes.
Yes, we'll fix up some time that's mutually convenient.
Or rather, convenient for Mr Morissey.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Oh, yes, this is little Ann.
- Hello, little Ann.
- Hello.
Looks better like that.
Ann says you're a writer.
- What do you write?
- Oh, anything.
(ALL LAUGHING)
SYLVIA:
Have you read that new book?
I can't remember the author's name, but it's about this spy who flies a plane to the Arctic to break...
Ice Cool.
Why can't you remember it?
It's absolutely fantastic.
CLARKE:
Very clever actually.
Written by a chap called Alex Marvel.
- Do you know him?
- Oh, yes, Mrs Talbot is his agent.
- SYLVIA:
Really?
- The woman I work for.
CLARKE:
Very clever.
They sold the film rights and American paperback rights before it was brought out over here.
- Really?
- CLARKE:
Mmm.
I'll tell you what.
I'll have a word with him.
I'm sure we can manage something.
- That's very good of you, sir.
- That's all right.
- By the way, my name is George.
- Oh, I know.
- Well, you must call me George then.
- Thank you, sir.
- Peter, have some cake.
- Thank you.
Has Sylvia told you about the party?
Would you like to come?
No, thank you, no.
It's perfectly all right for you to come if you want to.
I'm sure, but I...
I don't think I will.
Oh.
Please yourself.
- GEORGE:
Clarke, more tea?
- Yes, please.
Thank you, sir.
GEORGE:
Would you like any?
MRS HALPERN:
Oh, no, thank you.
Well, we just made it.
I think we've got a minute or two.
- Your ticket, Peter.
- I don't have it.
Oh, hang on.
There's one coming in now.
- Have you got your...
- Oh, it's all right, Arthur.
- He'll pay at the other end, all right?
- Thank you.
Well, go on, darling.
See your guest off.
- How are you, then?
- All right.
Good.
- I'm sorry if it's been awful.
- It was all right.
But it's a bit of a long journey on your own.
Do you wanna come?
(LAUGHS)
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello.
Spear...
Spears Agency.
Oh, hello.
Yes, okay.
- HENRY:
Hello?
- Hello, Henry.
HENRY:
Did you get the supper?
PETER:
Yeah.
- Oh, hello.
- PETER:
I'm in here.
I'm Henry.
- I'll take that.
- This is Henry.
- I've introduced myself.
- Oh.
This is Ann.
- Hello, Ann.
- Hello.
- Did you get the supper?
- Yeah.
And don't screw it up, because we've got a guest.
- Hello.
- STEPHEN:
Hello.
- Who does the cooking?
- Oh, we take it in turns.
- Can I help?
- Yes.
No.
No.
Do you want some orange juice?
Or milk, if you'd like that.
I bought a bottle of wine.
I bought... (CHUCKLING)
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
STEPHEN:
Henry, I'm thinking of giving up the railways.
HENRY:
What?
- You don't want to do that.
- I'm going into aviation.
- And what as?
- I'm gonna be a pilot.
(SCOFFS)
Well, you'll be a steward or something like that.
You can't just go and be a pilot.
How about I start as a steward...
- Then what?
- Then go up to a pilot.
Eh?
What about your train?
I think I better go and get Ann on her train.
HENRY:
Have you got a train?
11:32 from Waterloo.
- Well, you've got plenty of time.
- Yeah.
ANN:
It's getting a bit late.
PETER:
Yeah, we'd better try and make it, I think.
- Why don't you stay?
- Yeah.
No, let's go.
We'll try and make it.
(SOFT ROCK SONG PLAYING)
You all right?
(WHISTLE BLOWING)
Whoa.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Oh, thank God.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.
Where have you been?
What's been going on?
I've been with Peter.
- Peter?
- Yes, I've had a lovely time.
Why didn't you ring us?
We've been terribly worried.
- We've been up all night.
- I'm sorry.
I would've rung you, but by the time I remembered, it was a bit late.
- Well, you might think of us.
- I'm sorry.
Ann, well, where have you been all night?
Where did you sleep?
I've been walking.
I think I'd better go to bed.
Night-night.
(GROANS)
- What are you going to do?
- Got to let Erica know.
- What, all of us?
- Oh, yes.
- What, you and me, and...
- Oh, yes.
I see.
Once the...
Once the...
- That's your proposition, is it?
- Once the opening is there.
- Then we're all in.
- We're all in.
- Yes.
Did you do it?
- I'm not telling you.
- No?
- No.
Well, I'll try another tack.
Well, I didn't do it, if you wanna know.
- Didn't you?
- No.
Why not?
Because a relationship isn't based on sex.
It's not a paltry love affair, the sort of thing that you're used to.
- It's a pure, spiritual love.
- Ls it?
It's love.
I love her.
Got a nice pair of tits, though, doesn't she?
- Hello, there.
- ANN:
Hello.
- Well, what kind of a day did you have?
- Fine.
Mummy wants to know whether you'd like some food.
- Oh, no, nothing, thanks.
- You sure?
No trouble, she'll make up a tray.
All right, young lady.
You do realise that you upset your mother terribly.
- Why?
- Oh, darling, staying out all night.
- The way you behaved this morning.
- Well, she knew where I was.
As far as we were concerned, dear, you were going to the cinema, then probably a drive afterwards.
Well, I can't tell you every single move I make, can I?
- No, no, all right.
- I mean, there wasn't a rail crash or anything, so nothing could have happened.
Anything could have happened.
- Well, nothing did.
- We don't know that.
What do you mean?
Oh, don't be so silly.
That's none of your business.
Now, look, Ann, we are still legally responsible for you.
Oh, fuck off!
(ROMANTIC SONG PLAYING)
- We were going to the cinema.
- Oh, yes.
- What time is the show starting?
- 7:10.
We never seem to go anywhere nowadays.
Ah!
What have we got?
- Whisky all right?
- Lovely, thank you.
Trust him to be in the bloody herbaceous border.
GEORGE:
Here we are.
Ann, why don't you take your car?
- You have a licence?
- Yes.
Thank you.
Ann's still got her provisional licence.
She failed her test.
(LAUGHING)
- Still, be practice for you, won't it?
- Yes.
Silly old sod.
How are you getting home?
Look, if you wanna bring her here, bring her here.
I don't mind.
Someone else to do the cooking, for Christ's sake.
What, you know...
I mean, what do you think?
She wouldn't like it, or something?
She's very clean.
Well, we can clean up, can't we?
Move in?
(DOOR OPENING)
- Hello, sport.
- Morning, ladies.
- How are you?
- I'm all right.
- Where have you been?
- On the freight train.
- On the job?
- Yeah.
That's nice.
What's that?
- Letters.
- Thank you.
There you go.
Peter Morissey.
Well anyway, think about it.
- Yeah, see you later.
- All right, see you later.
Goodbye, Henry.
That's not bad, is it?
All right!
"Dear Mr Morissey, I enclose a cheque for 500 as payment"
"for publication rights for your short story."
"It includes an advance for your projected novel."
"Yours, Erica Talbot."
Good old Mrs Talbot, eh?
- Saucepans.
- All right, you'll need saucepans.
- And a frying pan.
- And a frying pan.
It's a lovely place you've got here.
It is, isn't it?
- Why have you got it?
- So I can be alone.
- Do you want to be alone?
- No.
You know, you'll need a bath mat and some lavatory paper, probably.
STEPHEN:
I'm in here.
- And an aerosol.
- Yeah.
Right.
- Where...
- In the kitchen.
- Oh, yeah.
- Cupboards, oven.
- Okay.
- Sounds good.
Here you are.
Cooking oil...
Oh, yeah.
Well, they're...
coming, all right?
I haven't got any plugs for the speakers either, so you'll have to get them.
- Washing up mop.
- Eh?
- Washing up mop.
- You got this on the list?
- No.
- Aha!
- Oh, you've got one.
- I've got one.
Oh, that's very short-sighted of you.
You can get all sorts of things in tins.
Yeah, get a tin opener and you're away, aren't you?
Yeah.
Tomatoes, guavas.
When you got food, did you get salt and pepper?
Got the salt, haven't got any pepper.
Salt, Pepper...
Well, shut up.
God, I can't think.
Got to think of everything, you see.
This is a very nice-sized place for two.
PETER:
Eh?
It's just big enough for two.
Yeah, when you moving in?
No, I mean, you two.
- No, we've got one or two problems.
- What?
- I thought that's why you...
- No!
No, no, no.
It is, it's beautiful.
What?
Oh that.
And that.
- Can I give you a lift?
- No, I don't think so.
- Here we are.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
I've been thinking.
- Have you?
What about?
- I don't really want to go home.
No, it's all right.
Look, don't worry.
I'm staying the night with Peter.
No, I'm not coming home tomorrow either.
No.
Yes, of course I'm going to work tomorrow.
I'm not going mad.
All right.
Okay.
Bye.
They're going to ring me at work tomorrow.
- When you're away from me?
- Yes.
- How were they?
- Fine.
- All right?
- Yes.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
You were funny.
I've got cramp.
You're very funny.
Bloody foot...
You know what we should do today, don%you?
- What?
- Should get down to Esher and get your things.
No, I better go down when my father's not there.
- Why?
- 'Cause he might start a row.
- He's a bit earhole, is he?
- Well, he might.
- He wouldn't hit me, would he?
- No, I don't think he'd hit you.
- Would he strike me?
- He might.
- Strike me?
- Yes.
Oh, Christ, I'm not going down there then.
No, I'll go down alone and get them.
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
Do you want to do it here?
You're a sexy little beast, aren't you?
No?
- Now?
- No.
- Under the table?
- No!
Christ.
- Why?
Why not?
- Get off!
Mind my Guinness.
Look what you've done.
- It's your fault.
You're a nymphomaniac.
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
ERICA:
Peter.
Christ, here comes Roy Rogers.
He's got Trigger with him.
- Hello, Ann, how are you?
- I'm fine, thank you.
Right, dear.
Alex Marvel.
- Do you know Ann?
You do?
- Yeah, I've seen Ann before.
Yes, and this is Peter Morissey.
He's a very good writer.
- Is he?
- Really, yes.
Now, sit down, everybody.
I've got good news, Peter.
L really have.
Now get us a drink, Alex.
- What would you like?
- Champagne, I think, to celebrate.
- Of course you would like champagne.
- Yes.
Would you like to come with me, darling?
Now, you're gonna be delighted about this.
- What?
- I think we've got a deal with Titan of Munich.
- Oh, really?
- Yes.
- Do you know who they are?
- No, no, I don't.
Well, it's a production company and they want to buy one of your stories.
Are you seeing a lot of Ann?
PETER:
I see enough of her.
ERICA:
Oh!
Her father phoned me this morning, you know.
- Really?
- He's rather worried.
Hasn't heard from her.
- Well, she phones him.
- Not enough.
- Well, she phones him.
- Peter, I know it's none of my...
ALEX:
Here we are, then.
- No champagne, it's off, dear.
- All right, that'll do.
Lager for you, Guinness for you, lager for you and a Guinness for me.
Ann, Alex, I've got marvellous news.
I think I've sold his story to Titan of Munich.
And furthermore, they're going to retain him as the writer, which as you all know, is practically unheard of.
Is this the story that Peter wrote for Woman's Own?
ERICA:
Yes, it is.
Peter, can I tell you something?
I thought that story was really very good.
- Did you?
- And I don't think you should sell it to Titan of Munich.
- Now, Alex...
- And I'll tell you why. (SHUSHING)
I'll tell you why.
Because Titan of Munich or any other company like that will just ruin anything.
And that story had something.
And that story should be kept as it is.
Listen, if he wants to sell to Titan of Munich, he can write rubbish like I write and he can sell that to them.
But not a story like that.
- I'm sure it isn't rubbish.
- Oh, it is, man, come on.
- Alex, dear, you're a very good writer.
- Thank you.
But you're not a very good agent and I think you should leave that
- department to me.
- Don't sell it, Peter.
Stick to it.
Because it's a good style.
Well, it's a load of rubbish because...
I don't know why I have to justify myself, but it's a load of rubbish because I wanted some time to buy a bit of...
Bit of time when I could really write what I wanted to write, you know?
Yeah.
And that is that.
I'd...
You know, I'd go out walking somewhere on my own.
And just this sort of feel of the, of the turf.
Or the wind, or bits of twig that I'd pick up.
Just this sort of tactile thing,
I wanna get down on paper.
And I can't, yet.
You can't do it with just...
Using sort of...
But what I want to write about is not a story
with people.
It's nothing.
It's just...
Getting back to, you know, the beginning.
Writing about what it's like to go out and jump in a puddle of water.
- Kind of Andre Gide stuff.
- No, kind of Alex Marvel stuff.
But just without using any flowery...
language.
Or any sort of language whatsoever except the basics.
- I jump into a puddle of water.
- What do you want?
Everyone should know what...
What it's about.
Yeah.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Come in.
Come on, wank!
Hello.
Do you think you've been very honest?
We let you have the car.
- We trusted you...
- Oh, Christ.
To behave like an adult.
Look, I thought you and I understood each other.
I don't think we do very well.
She's very young still.
Peter, it's her state of mind that worries me, that's all.
- Or do you think she's happy?
- No, I don't.
I don't see how she can be.
- What's that?
- What?
Oh...
Some of Ann's things.
Her mother thought that...
I thought for one awful moment you were going to move in.
Good bye.
- What's that doing there?
- Better ask your father.
He brought it.
- Was he here?
- Yes, he was here.
- When?
- About an hour ago.
Came in, smacked his teeth together, and left.
So...
I mean, didn't he do anything?
What did he say?
Nothing.
Just pissed me off, that's all he did.
He just won't leave me alone.
He was around at the office with Erica the other day.
I'm so fed up with all this.
I wanna go away.
- I'll take you anywhere.
- I think it's a nice idea.
- Honolulu?
- Honolulu?
No, somewhere nice.
- Greenland?
- Yes.
With icicles on the end of your titties.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Would you like that?
- Are we really going?
- I am.
Coming?
(SIGHS)
Come on.
I got saucepans.
PETER:
Right.
Hot water bottle.
Hey, thanks for bringing me here.
Do you like it?
I mean, why are you so interested anyway?
Just interested, that's all.
You're not going to rush out into the fields, are you?
- (GIGGLING)
- Eh?
Look for the biggest bull.
No, I'm just interested in how they do it, that's all.
Well, they do it in a purely conventional way.
And anyway, I mean, it doesn't really matter because...
Why'?
Well, I mean, you get...
You are satisfied, aren't you?
Yes, I'm just interested.
I mean, you wanna dream about it because I don't know any other things.
- Don't you?
- Not really.
And I'm terribly tired.
You'd rather have a horse than me, wouldn't you?
- (LAUGHS)
- A big fat butt pig.
(GRUNTING)
Someone's coming.
Oh, it's Bill.
Highland Bill.
- Good morning.
- Hello, there.
- Oh, you brought it.
- Mmm-hmm.
That's lovely, thank you.
Why don't you try to just do it?
- Have you some bullets?
- Mmm-hmm.
Here.
- I've been digging potatoes all morning.
- Oh, right.
Come in.
Ann!
ANN:
Mmm?
- How do you do?
- Ann, this is Bill.
This is Ann.
- How do you do?
- My wife.
- Would you like some...
- Mmm.
Thanks very much.
Yes.
A bit of Highland malt.
Hey.
Thank you.
It's very nice.
- Very strong, isn't it?
- Yes.
That's the way it should be.
You know, I'm interested, 'cause I wanna go hunting, you see.
What about rabbits, are there any?
BILL:
Well, there are some, they're coming back a bit.
They come back and then they seem to... get this myxomatosis again and they get sick on the ground.
PETER:
But if I was after a rabbit, see, what would I do?
I should think that gun that you have would be the best plan.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
(GUN FIRES)
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
Hey.
Where have you been?
Hunting.
(LAUGHS) Did you catch anything?
No, I thought it might be nice if we had vegetables tonight for a change.
You didn't catch a thing?
- Not really, no.
- You've been out all day.
You haven't caught one thing?
(LAUGHS)
I've got some eggs.
(GUN FIRES)
Ann!
Ann?
- Hello.
- Hello.
What would you really like to eat tonight?
Eh?
Go on.
Well, potatoes and things.
That's what I'm making.
Don't you want any meat?
'Cause I've gotten you a rabbit.
Oh.
I don't want it.
- Why not?
- Well, I don't know what to do with it.
Well, cook it.
I don't want it.
You've got to take all the skin off and all that.
- Well, you can do that.
- I don't know how to do it.
Oh, no, take it away.
(CLEARS THROAT)
You know, I don't know what you're shooting rabbits for when you ought to be writing your book.
Oh, Christ!
- Give us a minute.
- I'm going in then.
(EXCLAIMS)
- I'm going to punish you.
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm bloody fed up with you.
- No, you're not.
- I am, I'm going to put you in.
- No, you won't.
(LAUGHING)
Oh, I love you.
(ANN LAUGHING EXCITEDLY)
(SCREAMS)
You pig!
You...
You...
I'm...
I'm fed up with you!
You really are...
You just go too bloody far!
I think you take...
Go away!
You take life far too seriously.
Oi!
Now, go away!
- Why didn't you turn the light off?
- I don't want to turn the light off.
- I want the light off.
- Well, turn it off yourself then.
- I'm fed up.
- Eh?
- I want to go home.
- Why?
I just want to go home.
- But it's lovely here.
- It's not.
- Of course it is.
- I want to go back to London.
(GROANS)
Anyway, you're not working here at all.
But we've been through all this already.
I don't need to work.
- Yes, you do need to work.
- Why?
You need to earn some money for a start.
Well, I've got some money.
You haven't got enough to live on forever.
- Well, how much do you want then?
- You live in a dream world.
- L...
- You think we can go on and on.
- Can't go on eating potatoes.
- We can...
- When do you want to go home?
- Very soon.
- When?
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.
You'd tear up my Rupert books if you could, wouldn't you?
(CHUCKLES)
(WIND HOWLING)
(SOFT ROCK SONG PLAYING)
- Why don't you go and see Erica?
- Yeah, yeah, I will.
- You ought to.
- I know what I ought to do, Ann.
What about you?
What ought you to do?
Oh, I don't suppose she'll want to see me.
I don't suppose she will.
You've got to get your book published.
Yes, I know.
(PHONE RINGING)
- Stupid.
- What?
Nothing, I was just trying to get a hold of Stephen.
Why don't you write some more short stories?
I don't want to.
Why?
You get lots of money for them.
Yeah, but I don't want to.
I think you're silly.
- Are you all right, Ann?
- Yes, of course.
I mean, you don't feel sick or anything?
- No, why should I?
- Nothing, nothing, I just...
Ann, you're not pregnant, are you?
No, no, of course I'm not.
Why did you think of that?
No reason, I just thought you...
Well, you might be.
I'm just a bit late, that's all.
- So you are pregnant, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.
- I knew you are.
- I don't know whether I am or not.
I'm going to have a test tomorrow.
Hello, love.
- Isn't there any tea?
- Oh, I'll get you some.
- Are you all right?
- It's positive.
That doesn't mean to say that it's definite.
I mean, if it was negative it would be definite, but if it's positive, that doesn't mean to say...
I see.
Well, what are we going to do?
Nothing.
We don't have to do anything, do we?
I mean, we'll just have the thing.
- Do you want it?
- Of course I want it.
I thought you wouldn't want it.
No, I want it, very much.
Well, there's your tea.
Well, you want it, don't you?
I don't want to make you do anything that you don't want to do.
Do you want it?
If you really wanted it, you wouldn't keep asking.
(CHUCKLES) Of course I want it.
- It's not a joke, you know, Peter.
- Well, who's making a joke of it?
You've got to take it seriously.
That's Stephen.
ANN:
Where?
PETER:
Over there.
Stephen!
How are you?
- Great to see you.
- Yeah.
What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- Are you sure?
Yeah.
What are you doing?
You still in the flat?
(STUTTERING) With Henry, with Henry.
Yeah, yeah.
There's the bus.
Are you coming?
No, no, I'm waiting.
- Look, come around and see us.
- Yeah, okay.
Anytime.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
What are you going to do?
Well, I'm not going to do anything, am I?
Why not?
That's the trouble with you.
You always talk about things, then you don't do anything.
Well, I can't have the bloody baby.
I mean, that's ridiculous.
No, I know, I have to go through with it, don't I?
Well, that's all right.
You're a woman.
Well, it's very easy for you to say that, isn't it?
I'm the one who has to suffer.
I detect a certain air of animosity, don%you?
Not in a bad mood, are you?
Well, of course I'm not in a bad mood.
You are in a bad mood.
- You're in a bad mood.
- I'm not.
Why don't we see some people?
- Who?
- I don't know, anyone.
Well, who do you want to see?
Just someone different, that's all.
- We're going to see Henry and Stephen?
- No, I don't mean that.
I was thinking of asking Mummy and Daddy round actually.
- Ooh.
Were you?
- Yes.
- Mmm.
- For dinner.
Dinner?
What, spam and chips in the back kitchen?
- Well, it's all right.
- Oh, they'll love that, won't they?
Well, there's nothing wrong with asking them round for dinner.
(SIGHS) No, no, no, very enjoyable.
- Yes, it'll be nice.
- Mmm.
- Won't it?
- Awfully lovely.
All right, send him in.
Hello.
- Sit down.
- Thanks.
I read your novel.
- Did you?
- Yes.
L think it has a lot of marvellous qualities about it.
I really do.
Shows great sensitivity, awareness, and I think you're going to write a very, very good book.
What do you mean?
Not this one.
Really not.
I just know you could do better.
But I spent a year on that book.
What do you mean, I could do better?
ERICA:
No, but you haven't spent a year on it.
And it shows it.
It needs pruning, cutting, shaping, discipline.
That we could do together.
If you would...
PETER:
What do you mean, "We could do it together"?
If you would rely on me because there are quite a lot of books that I have been...
PETER:
You mean you don't like it?
It isn't that I don't like it.
It really isn't that I don't like it.
It's simply that it's undisciplined and a little old-fashioned.
I'm afraid I can't agree with you because I think it's a very good book.
You just carry on publishing the old rubbish, right?
Stick to...
Where is our young genius?
- Hello, Peter.
How are you?
- All right.
ALEX:
Good to see you.
Ls this your new book?
PETER:
Yeah, my latest failure.
- Can I have a look at it?
- No, I'm afraid you can't, Alex.
- Why?
You just haven't finished it?
- No, I finished it.
But it's a load of bloody crap.
ERICA:
Peter, why not phone me when you get home?
Yeah, I'll phone you when I feel like it.
ERICA:
Sorry about that.
MAN ON TV:
When the police were finally able to enter the building, a hoard of weapons were found on the second floor.
Seventeen youths were charged with offences including possessing dangerous weapons, using threatening behaviour and resisting arrest.
With the present short-term housing...
Little shits!
- Eh?
- Bloody commentator.
Oh, yeah.
(SWITCHES OFF TV)
Isn't Stephen coming?
Yeah, he should be.
He'll be here in a minute.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just wanted to watch the programme.
Anyway, I've made you a spectacular supper.
That's all right.
Yeah, in fact, it's probably boiling over.
Hang on.
(DOORBELL RINGING)
Oh.
- Is Henry in?
- Oh, yes, come in.
HENRY:
Oh, lverna.
Hello.
- Come in.
This is Ann.
- Hello.
- And this is Peter.
- IVERNA:
Hello.
Iverna.
I was just burning the supper actually.
Peter's a writer.
- IVERNA:
What do you write for?
- Money.
Hmm.
Oh, look, I've got these copies of Black Dwarf that you wanted.
Oh, thanks.
Look, it's great, this article here.
- There.
Mmm.
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I think it's the sort of thing to interest people.
PETER:
What are you going to do with them?
Distribute them at work.
- Should go down like a bomb.
- (CHUCKLES) Don't you think so?
Have you got a revolutionary set at the agency?
Yes, we have.
Oh, you know, we print posters and we sent some money to Paris.
PETER:
That's good.
Good.
What books do you write?
- PETER:
Mainly short stories actually.
- Oh, really?
Well, that's rather difficult, isn't it?
There aren't any publishers for them, are there?
PETER:
No, I've had one or two things published in Woman's Own.
You think it's easier to write for women?
I really hadn't given it much thought.
- I better get back to the stew.
- ANN:
Where's Stephen?
HENRY:
Oh, God knows.
He's often out late.
- Do you know Stephen?
- Yes.
- ANN:
Don't you like him?
- What?
- Don't you like him?
- Well, he's uncommitted, isn't he?
He expects to be carried along.
ANN:
I think he's rather nice.
Well, I don't think being nice is what we need now.
All right, supper's ready.
And the point is, he's bothered to learn the technique, he's a craftsman.
(SCOFFS) Unlike so many of the young painters today.
Oh, but he's so much better.
L can never understand how some of these students leave college and then they're recognised as geniuses overnight.
Well, I don't mind young people getting recognition.
Why, it's a bit ridiculous, isn't it?
After all, there are many gifted people that have been working at it for years.
Well, no, it's the lack of technique that worries me.
I don't know what they teach them in the schools today.
Self-expression, isn't it?
Oh, no, self-expression, true creativity...
Well, it's the highest purpose of life.
Now, if that was learnt in the schools, fine.
You see, what we've got to guard against is self-indulgence.
Yes.
I didn't realise what a clever cook you were.
- Oh, let me help you, please.
- No, don't worry.
May I, Peter?
Thank you.
(SIGHS)
Well, that was a delicious meal.
Well, how is she?
- Fine.
- Good.
- But she's not working?
- No.
- She doesn't need to work.
- No, no, of course not.
But it's always good to have something to do.
Yeah.
- Well, it doesn't worry you?
- No, not at all.
- I mean, she finds plenty to do.
- Oh, really?
Anyway, it's not really my business.
I mean, I don't run her life for her, you know.
No.
But you have taken on a responsibility.
I mean, you don't want me to be responsible so I'm just asking whether you're satisfied about her.
Yes, I'm satisfied.
Why does she look so tired?
- More?
- Oh, no, only a cup.
Thank goodness for that.
I'm full up, dear.
- Thank you.
- Here, Peter.
Now, who wants sugar?
- Ann tells me you've written a novel.
- Yes.
And when is it coming out?
I don't really know, it's a very difficult process, publishing.
Erica's very efficient though.
I'm sure she'll get it done as quickly...
- Erica's not taking it though, is she?
- ANN:
What?
- No.
She didn't like it.
- ANN:
I didn't know.
- When did she see it?
- PETER:
Last week.
- And what have you done?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?
- Nothing.
What can I do?
She didn't like it.
Well, I mean, she's not the only agent in London, is she?
Well, if she didn't like it, I think...
- You can improve it, perhaps.
- Yes.
And try it again.
ANN:
She'd take it.
GEORGE:
I'm sure she'd like to help.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
I don't think I want to improve it very much.
Perhaps you could have a word with Erica.
- STEPHEN:
Hello, mate.
- Hello, Stephen.
I'm so sorry I missed you when you came around.
Hello.
I'm really sorry, I had to go out and see someone.
It's all right.
This is my mother and father.
This is Stephen.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
Good to see you.
It's really good to see you.
- You're seeing us.
- Yeah.
- Living in the country?
- Yeah.
- Had a nice time?
- Lovely.
Where have you been?
Sussex, on the Downs.
Marvellous.
Mmm, yeah, it's so nice.
Really green.
It's a bring down to get back to this place, isn't it?
It's such a drag up here.
Well, I think we ought to be going then.
Yes, yes, it's past our bedtime.
- I'll get your coat.
- Thanks, dear.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Good bye.
GEORGE:
Good night.
MRS HALPERN:
Goodbye, dear.
ANN:
Bye, Mummy.
And I'm sorry.
Thank God they're gone.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?
- About the book.
- Well, I didn't have an opportunity.
- And why do you have to be so rude?
- Me, rude?
He was the one that was being bloody rude.
- He wasn't, he was just going to help.
- He bloody well was.
(SHUSHING)
Why does he have to go and stick his nose into my business and tell Erica about my book?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to break it up.
No, you didn't break anything up.
- An argument.
- No, they were going anyway.
- Who?
- My parents.
- Family tiff.
- Oh.
Can I have some orange juice?
- Orange juice.
We got any orange juice?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'll get you some.
Sit down.
- When are you going to have a baby then?
- What?
- When are you going to have a baby?
- How did you know?
Well, I didn't.
I just thought...
- Are you going to have a baby?
- Yeah.
Oh, great.
Fantastic news.
- What?
- Ann's going to have a baby.
I know.
A few problems.
What problems, mate?
I suppose there aren't really, are there?
You should be pleased.
Well, I am.
I am pleased.
So, how was the country?
Oh.
All right, great, fantastic.
I was just thinking when you get back, the noise is so loud after being so quiet in the country, by comparison.
Well, I don't know why you live here, do you?
I'd live there all the time if I was you.
Hmm.
- Have you eaten?
- No.
Well, do you want something?
Stay for some supper.
- What, here?
- Yeah, why not?
Yeah.
Okay.
It'll be nice, it'll be nice.
So that we can talk.
Sorry, I broke all that up.
No, you didn't break anything up.
Really.
- Can I go to the toilet?
- Yeah.
Can I just have my... bag?
(GLASS SHATTERING)
ANN:
Stephen?
Peter!
What's he doing?
Tell him to get out of there, will you?
Tell him to get out!
Peter, what's he doing?
- It's all right.
- Get him out, will you?
Tell her it's all right.
Will you please get him out?
Please!
- Come on now.
- No, you must make him stop.
Listen, it's all right, darling.
Now, come on.
(SOBBING) Please, Peter.
Look, it's not our business.
He can't do that.
Well, we can't do anything about it.
Love, we can't run his life for him.
Well, he can't do it here.
Please, Peter.
Hey, get that thing off your arm.
(ANN CRYING)
You Okay?
Look, you don't have to go.
How long have you been taking that shit?
- Well, not long.
- But why?
- It's okay.
- You're crazy.
- You don't need it, man, you just do it.
- You're crazy, Stephen.
- I'd better go.
- No, look, you don't have to go.
Yeah, I'll go.
(ANN CONTINUES CRYING)
You frightened him.
ANN:
Oh don't be so bloody stupid.
What are you gonna do?
Well, what can I do?
It's nothing to do with us, love.
Well, you must help him.
You heard what he said.
He's just trying it, there's nothing wrong.
Well, you'd better bloody well do something about it, that's all.
I like your stuff.
Are those more of the poems?
Just a few more, yeah.
They're not finished.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
There isn't a great deal of call for poems as such, here.
Come in.
Come in!
I'll get it.
- ROGER:
Oh, it's you, Jim.
Oh, lovely.
- Ease over, please.
Stella asked me to bring the coffee.
- Sugar?
- Yeah, two, please.
This is Peter, by the way, Peter Morissey, a friend of Henry.
- Hi.
- Hello.
How are you?
Peter just sent me a...
Well, actually a poem.
Ah.
Well, Roger, that's the latest.
- Who's this from?
Samson?
- Yeah.
If the objection's "Glowing warmth," why not change it to something like,
"Snugly warm?" I mean, it's more colloquial.
- ROGER:
Yes, I like snugly warm.
- Cuddly warm?
Well, of course, it's different writing for any satirical.
Our work's much more, sort of demanding, much more disciplined.
Well, I've been working here for about 10 years and I reckon it's only about now that I'm sort of on the right wavelength.
- Are you?
- Snugly is a good word.
Bloody Samson.
Hey, Roger, got your message.
Listen, I wanna talk to you about something.
Oh, Bob, I wanted you to meet Peter Morissey.
Peter, this is Bob Good.
- Hi.
- Hello, it's nice to meet you.
Listen, I've just had feelers, little tinklet from them.
They're very happy with the last campaign, think it's great.
So much so that they'd like a new product and a new campaign.
- That's nice.
- Mmm.
Within a week.
- A week?
- Mmm.
A new dog food within a week?
- Are you visiting?
- No, no, I'm here for a job actually.
Have you ever worked in an agency before?
- No.
- Peter's a friend of Henry's.
- He writes poems.
- Oh.
Well, you'll find that the writing we do here is not geared to an esoteric audience.
It requires discipline and very demanding.
- Wouldn't you say so, Jim?
- Yeah.
- Dog food in a week?
- Yeah.
How about chewing gum for dogs?
- Stephen.
- Oh.
- Are you still here?
- What did they say?
- They said, I'm all right.
- What do you mean you're all right?
You've only been in there a couple of minutes.
No, no, I had a quick examination.
What did they do?
Did they give you an injection or anything?
No, we had a cup of tea and we had a few jellies and cakes.
Oh, come on, what did they say?
I'm all right.
I'm A-okay.
I've passed out.
Well, you can't be okay.
You've only been in there a little while.
They gave me a quick one.
They'll write me a letter.
I'll come in with you and get it straightened out.
- No, I've been in there.
- Come on, Stephen.
I don't wanna go in again.
Look, I didn't bring you all the way down here just to hear that crap.
All right.
Push off then.
I was trying to bloody help you.
Well, you helped.
You brought me down.
Now, push off.
Go on, you piss me off.
- Do you think it's a good idea?
- What?
Work?
Well, you've got to.
Yeah, I know.
But advertising?
Don't you like it?
It's all right.
- The money's good.
- Well...
And you can write when you get home in the evenings.
Yeah.
That's all right, then, isn't it?
- These are for Jonathan.
All right.
- In the post room.
Straight and right.
Look, I'll only be a minute.
I must get these off, all right?
- How was it?
- Okay.
- What did they say?
- Nothing.
- It's all right?
- Yeah, it's all right.
That's my boss.
- When's it going to be?
- Oh, months.
- Well, how long?
- Seven months.
- Can we go now?
Come on.
- Yeah.
Ann, do you want to get married?
Because I'm pregnant?
- No, uh...
- You didn't want to before.
- No.
- So, what's the difference now?
Well, somehow I think it's right that we should be married.
Because I'm pregnant?
- Peter!
- What's the matter?
Christ!
Be careful.
(SHUSHING) For Christ's sakes.
What's the matter?
- There might be somebody in there.
- Oh, yeah.
It's all right.
God!
God, they've taken everything!
- Oh, shut up, Ann.
Don't get all...
- But they have!
Shut up!
They've taken your typewriter and the record player.
L have a pair of eyes, Ann.
I can see perfectly well what they've taken.
And they haven't taken everything.
They have left the bloody bed.
Ann?
- Ann, you're not asleep, are you?
- Mmm.
Well, what we came up with was basically this.
Vitaminised sweet for dogs.
Sweet meaning, pudding?
- PETER:
Pudding, yes.
- Dessert?
PETER:
Yes.
If it's the South Atlantic you come from.
We have pudding, so why shouldn't dogs?
I mean, sure.
I think this guy could appeal.
Oh, yeah.
Then we have the strategy and the strategy is simply to convince the dog owners that no form of feeding offers their pet all the minerals and vitamins that they need.
Therefore, they must have their diet supplemented by our product.
- Let's have a bit of a test, eh?
- I think it's a good idea, yeah.
I'm sick of that bloody job.
Do you know what they said today?
What's wrong?
Hello, Peter.
Bye, Ann.
(DOOR CLOSES)
What's he doing here?
- Just dropped in.
- What did he want?
To see how I was.
Lunch.
Jog for your dog.
- Is this one of your creations?
- That's right.
Hold on, here.
Just let me finish this.
I suppose you haven't seen Stephen, have you?
- No.
Where is he?
- Oh.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
He hasn't been about for a few days.
- Hasn't he?
- No.
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.
Haven't seen him for about a week.
What, have you phoned his work or anything?
Oh, I don't know where he's working.
- Well, he's working at the station.
- No, he's not.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
He went to be an airline pilot and that's the last I saw of him.
You know what he's doing, don't you?
Haven't the faintest idea what he's doing.
Hasn't been home.
Ann!
- Peter.
- Where's Ann?
She's not here.
She's not at home.
Do you know where she is?
She's all right.
She came to ask for help.
Help?
What's the matter?
- She tried to phone you...
- Ann is not here.
- Well, I wanna bloody see her!
- Get downstairs!
- How dare you?
- Stop...
Stop it!
- Ann has lost her baby.
- What?
- She came here for help and she got it.
- Oh, God.
I begged you to be careful, but you took no notice.
- You went on your own sweet way.
- She wouldn't have done that.
- She really wanted that child.
- She didn't.
She would never have been able to cope with the child.
Could you?
Where is she?
She's in a nursing home.
She'll be there a few days.
- Can I see her?
- Of course.
- Not tonight.
- When?
Why don't you go and see her tomorrow?
- Hello.
- It's all right.
How are you?
Oh, Henry, Henry, are you going to be at home tonight?
Yes, we're having a meeting.
- Can I come around and see you?
- Well, do you have to?
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Ann Halpern.
- You've come to visit her, have you?
- Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid you can't see her now.
- Well, look, I must see her.
- Sorry, it's way past visiting hours.
What's the matter, sister?
Oh, Mr Halpern, this gentleman wants to see Ann.
Oh, surely it'll be alright.
Well, it's really late.
It's rather late.
- Yes, I know, but...
- Thank you.
Carry on.
PETER:
Hello.
How are you?
- Father's just been here, has he?
- Mmm.
Mmm, I saw him.
What did he want?
Nothing.
Well, he must have.
Didn't he say anything?
He brought those flowers.
Lovely.
He had a go at me, I suppose, did he?
Just a little quick dig in the ribs, was it?
No.
I don't know why you had to go and see him.
I mean, why didn't you come and see me?
Why didn't you come and tell me?
Be quiet.
But it has to do with me, isn't it, Ann?
Well, don't be so bloody stupid.
I mean, you go running off and you tell him the moment something happens.
Look, I didn't want the baby.
Can you understand that?
- How was she?
- Fine, fine.
She's gonna be fine.
Yes, I think so, too.
Uh...
We're going to get married.
You knew, didn't you?
Oh.
Ann didn't tell me.
Oh, well, we were always going to.
- Let me drop you somewhere.
- No, I've got the car, thank you.
(CHUCKLES) Oh, yes.
Bye-bye, Peter.
- Hello, Peter.
Tea?
- Hi.
Thank you.
- You all right?
- Fine, yeah.
- You look a bit down.
- No, not really.
Hey, I've just been talking to Roger.
He's very pleased about that campaign.
- Good.
- Yeah, he thinks you handled that really well, really professional.
That's lovely.
- Do you know what?
- Hmm?
I reckon you can look forward to better things.
- What, like another telephone?
- Yeah, red one.
- Wouldn't be bad.
- Yeah.
Okay, well, you stick at it.
Oughtn't you to be in bed?
I brought you some flowers.
- I'm sorry, darling.
- What for?
I shouldn't have done it.
Oh, that doesn't matter.
I mean, it was right for you to do it.
We just weren't ready for it, love.
Why did you tell him we were getting married?
Why didn't you?
I mean, we are, aren't we?
I didn't want them to know.
I'm really sick of this place.
L mean, if you rest for a couple of days at home, you'll be fine.
I don't want to go home.
MRS HALPERN:
Aren't you eating?
SYLVIA:
No, thank you.
GEORGE:
Oh, really?
What's happened, darling?
You loved it!
SYLVIA:
Mother.
MRS HALPERN:
She always can be so...
CLARKE:
It's one of the things that happens when you have a new member of the family on the way.
We were going to call him Horatio, weren't we, darling?
SYLVIA:
No, darling.
That's a terrible name.
CLARKE:
It isn't a terrible name.
It's a lovely name.
Why don't you call it Jean?
Well, we might have a girl, darling.
How's the writing going?
- Very well, thank you.
- Peter, what's happened about your novel?
Nothing at all, really.
I've been so busy.
- I haven't had time to do anything.
- Oh, what a pity.
You know, Erica was very impressed by it.
Was she?
Tell me, did Brooksford have a word with you?
Yes, he did.
I thought him a very pleasant man, indeed.
- You know him, do you?
- Slightly.
I suppose what you really want to do is to make a lot of money and then go off and live on a desert island and write?
- (ALL LAUGHING)
- I'm working on it.
In ten years' time you might be able to appear on Desert Island Discs.
L don't think Ann will be much use to you on the desert island, would she?
She won't at all.
She's not at all domesticated and takes hours in the bathroom, and is bad-tempered at breakfast.
GEORGE:
Oh, there's a diamond, dear.
CLARKE:
She's the most incredible bad partner to have on the tennis court.
MRS HALPERN:
I don't expect they'll play tennis either.
- She never gets up before 12:00.
- SYLVIA:
No, hardly ever.
GEORGE:
Don't take any notice, Ann.
(CHATTERING CONTINUES)
Good night.
Oh, awful, the draught.
Ann, you'll catch a cold.
Go on in.
Well, good night, Peter.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Right-Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Nice boy, Peter, he really is.
Now, pretty one, what do you want for your wedding present?
- I don't know.
- Well, you've got it.
A house.
Oh.
(CAR ENGINE ROARING)
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
Christ!
Needleman's back, is he?
(CHUCKLING) Well, that's a bloody welcome.
Where have you been then?
Huddersfield.
Yeah.
Huddersfield?
What for?
Sort meself out.
I've come back to see you.
- I was a bit worried about you.
- Hmm, were you?
Yeah, I saw what you were doing with Ann and your prospective child.
Oh, yeah.
Hmm?
Not much to say about that.
- Still on the junk, are you?
- No.
- What do you mean, no?
- I gave it up.
What?
Just like that?
Uh, not just like that, but...
- I gave it up.
- Oh, I see.
- Uh, should we go through?
- Help yourself, yeah.
Have you got any gear?
Don't know.
I got a bit of old shit in there, but it's not much use.
Well, let's try it.
- Hmm, if you like.
- Let's get really smashed, eh?
- Really stoked.
Need sugar?
- Uh, yeah.
Three.
(BOTH SINGING)
She wore her underclothes it And when she caressed me it She damn near undressed me, gor blimey
I went to the doctor, He said where did you cop her
Down the Old Kent Road it The pimple and the twinkle
On your winkie will be pinker than the red, red rose ♪
That's really cheered me up.
Where's Ann?
- Where is she then?
- She's at home.
What for?
She hasn't been very well.
She went home to get better.
- Why?
What's the matter?
- You got any skins?
Yeah, I have a pipe.
Nothing, nothing wrong with her.
She's getting better.
- What was wrong with her?
- Nothing.
It must have been something for her to go home.
She had an abortion, Stephen.
Well, you stupid bastards.
Well, it had nothing to do with me, I...
Who was it to do with then?
She went down and saw her father...
- Did you make her have it?
- No.
- Well, who made her have it?
- I don't know.
Have you split UP?
No.
We're gonna get married.
Oh, dear.
We're gonna get married.
She's having abortions you don't know about and going down there and living with those creatures.
And you're gonna get married?
What do you think that's gonna solve?
Eh?
- Ain't got much in this gear.
- Shocking, innit?
- Yeah.
- Bloody Spader.
Shall we go and see if Henry's got any?
Henry?
Oh no, I think I'd rather smoke this stuff.
Have you seen him recently?
- Yeah.
- He's got so bloody miserable.
He's goes around inventing enemies for himself and wanting to give them all final solutions.
- And his chick... (EXHALES)
- What?
Lverna?
- Jesus Christ.
- Freaky nerd.
- She really doesn't dig me.
- No.
I wish I'd brought my stuff down with me.
I left it with my mum.
- Your mum turn on?
Christ.
- Yeah.
Did you have that conversation with him about problems and solutions?
Not half.
I said I'd rather be part of a problem than the solution.
You're a bloody problem, aren't you?
At least he's got a future in it.
No future making bloody posters.
That's all he does.
He sits there all bloody day at work doing that.
- Are you there?
- Yeah.
- You're working there?
- Copywriting.
A copywriter?
What's happened to your...
What do you call it?
Your art?
- Eh?
It's a big joke now, is it?
- My art?
No.
I thought you were gonna make a lot of money out of it.
That's what I thought, but it didn't work out.
So we've just given up, have we?
- No, we haven't.
- What do we do then?
- We'll, we're writing at night.
- Are we?
- We are.
- Bloody stupid, innit?
I'm doing a lot of bloody stupid things recently.
- Yeah, you are, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.
You think you can't do it before you've got all your money scrimped and scraped?
Look, I'm just trying to make a living, all right?
No, you're not.
That'd be all right if you were just trying to make a living.
PETER:
Everybody's got to earn their living.
How's promotion, all right?
- All right.
- You're going up in the world, are you?
- I mean, I'm going up the ladder.
- Yes.
If you were only trying to make a living, that'd be fine.
But you're not, you're getting your money in and building it all around you like a little castle...
- Am I?
- Protecting yourself from the gremlins.
Oh, yes.
But I've got Ann to think of, haven't I?
- Have you considered that?
- Blaming Ann?
I'm not blaming anybody.
- Well, you just blamed Ann.
- No, I didn't blame her.
- I've got to look after her.
- You've got to protect her?
It's Ann who needs protecting?
I thought that was her old man's scene.
You've got to look after her like a little toy, like the rest of them?
Bloody stuff you've got cluttered up around this place now.
Yeah, you make me insane.
- Anyway, sod it.
- I'm off to Spain.
I'm off to sleep.
All right.
Don't hang me up all night farting or whatever to get up to.
You're right, anyway.
- Wait.
What?
- I know you're right.
Well, don't get uptight.
- What are you doing?
- Shh.
Go back to sleep.
- What time is it?
- 8:30.
- You're up early, ain't you?
- Got to go to work.
- Have you?
- Yeah.
Um, can you hang on a sec?
I'll come with you.
- Make it snappy 'cause I'm late.
- All right.
Come on, Stephen, there's the bloody bus.
I've just got to go in here.
Just a second.
- Is Mr Robinson in yet?
- WOMAN 1:
No.
They're all early starters.
- Mr Robinson there?
- WOMAN 2:
No.
He's in here.
- What do you want?
- Are you Mr Robinson's secretary?
No.
Why's my door open?
Yes?
May I help you?
No.
You can go away if you like.
What do you want with my typewriter?
Put it down!
This is a stick up!
Stick 'em up!
Well?
Is that what you want?
- Yeah.
- Well, take it then.
Let's see if it works.
If it doesn't, we'll take it back and get another.
- It's a bargain.
- It's a present for you.
Thanks.
Right.
Breakfast time.
Anything else you want?
Yes.

Sorry to rush you, darling.
I've got a meeting at 9:45.
Jocelyn, have you got that file on George Eliot?
Yes.
- You have rung Stephen, haven't you?
- Yes.
- Oh!
Good morning, Ann.
- Good morning.
- How's Daddy?
- Fine, thank you.
- Mummy well?
- Yes.
That's good.
Hello Jean, could you possibly ask Dean to come on Thursday to see Mrs Talbot?
Yes, that is tomorrow.
Uh-huh.
Okay, bye-bye-
Come and meet everybody, Peter.
Jocelyn, this is Peter Morissey, a very brilliant young writer who we've been lucky enough to sign.
Now, I think we should have a bio on him.
Have you got time to give Jocelyn it now?
- Biography?
- Yes.
- Oh, no.
Tomorrow.
- Yes.
Yes, we'll fix up some time that's mutually convenient.
Or rather, convenient for Mr Morissey.
Oh, yes, this is little Ann.
- Hello, little Ann.
- Hello.
Looks better like that.
Ann says you're a writer.
- What do you write?
- Oh, anything.
Have you read that new book?
I can't remember the author's name, but it's about this spy who flies a plane to the Arctic to break...
Ice Cool.
Why can't you remember it?
It's absolutely fantastic.
Very clever actually.
Written by a chap called Alex Marvel.
- Do you know him?
- Oh, yes, Mrs Talbot is his agent.
- Really?
- The woman I work for.
Very clever.
They sold the film rights and American paperback rights before it was brought out over here.
- Really?
- Mmm.
I'll tell you what.
I'll have a word with him.
I'm sure we can manage something.
- That's very good of you, sir.
- That's all right.
- By the way, my name is George.
- Oh, I know.
- Well, you must call me George then.
- Thank you, sir.
- Peter, have some cake.
- Thank you.
Has Sylvia told you about the party?
Would you like to come?
No, thank you, no.
It's perfectly all right for you to come if you want to.
I'm sure, but I...
I don't think I will.
Oh.
Please yourself.
- Clarke, more tea?
- Yes, please.
Thank you, sir.
- Would you like any?
- Oh, no, thank you.
Well, we just made it.
I think we've got a minute or two.
- Your ticket, Peter.
- I don't have it.
Oh, hang on.
There's one coming in now.
- Have you got your...
- Oh, it's all right, Arthur.
- He'll pay at the other end, all right?
- Thank you.
Well, go on, darling.
See your guest off.
- How are you, then?
- All right.
Good.
- I'm sorry if it's been awful.
- It was all right.
But it's a bit of a long journey on your own.
Do you wanna come?
Hello.
Spear...
Spears Agency.
Oh, hello.
Yes, okay.
- Hello?
- Hello, Henry.
- Did you get the supper?
- Yeah.
- Oh, hello.
- I'm in here.
I'm Henry.
- I'll take that.
- This is Henry.
- I've introduced myself.
- Oh.
This is Ann.
- Hello, Ann.
- Hello.
- Did you get the supper?
- Yeah.
And don't screw it up, because we've got a guest.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Who does the cooking?
- Oh, we take it in turns.
- Can I help?
- Yes.
No.
No.
Do you want some orange juice?
Or milk, if you'd like that.
I bought a bottle of wine.
I bought...
Henry, I'm thinking of giving up the railways.
What?
- You don't want to do that.
- I'm going into aviation.
- And what as?
- I'm gonna be a pilot.
Well, you'll be a steward or something like that.
You can't just go and be a pilot.
How about I start as a steward...
- Then what?
- Then go up to a pilot.
Eh?
What about your train?
I think I better go and get Ann on her train.
Have you got a train?
11:32 from Waterloo.
- Well, you've got plenty of time.
- Yeah.
It's getting a bit late.
Yeah, we'd better try and make it, I think.
- Why don't you stay?
- Yeah.
No, let's go.
We'll try and make it.
You all right?
Whoa.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Oh, thank God.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.
Where have you been?
What's been going on?
I've been with Peter.
- Peter?
- Yes, I've had a lovely time.
Why didn't you ring us?
We've been terribly worried.
- We've been up all night.
- I'm sorry.
I would've rung you, but by the time I remembered, it was a bit late.
- Well, you might think of us.
- I'm sorry.
Ann, well, where have you been all night?
Where did you sleep?
I've been walking.
I think I'd better go to bed.
Night-night.
- What are you going to do?
- Got to let Erica know.
- What, all of us?
- Oh, yes.
- What, you and me, and...
- Oh, yes.
I see.
Once the...
Once the...
- That's your proposition, is it?
- Once the opening is there.
- Then we're all in.
- We're all in.
- Yes.
Did you do it?
- I'm not telling you.
- No?
- No.
Well, I'll try another tack.
Well, I didn't do it, if you wanna know.
- Didn't you?
- No.
Why not?
Because a relationship isn't based on sex.
It's not a paltry love affair, the sort of thing that you're used to.
- It's a pure, spiritual love.
- Ls it?
It's love.
I love her.
Got a nice pair of tits, though, doesn't she?
- Hello, there.
- Hello.
- Well, what kind of a day did you have?
- Fine.
Mummy wants to know whether you'd like some food.
- Oh, no, nothing, thanks.
- You sure?
No trouble, she'll make up a tray.
All right, young lady.
You do realise that you upset your mother terribly.
- Why?
- Oh, darling, staying out all night.
- The way you behaved this morning.
- Well, she knew where I was.
As far as we were concerned, dear, you were going to the cinema, then probably a drive afterwards.
Well, I can't tell you every single move I make, can I?
- No, no, all right.
- I mean, there wasn't a rail crash or anything, so nothing could have happened.
Anything could have happened.
- Well, nothing did.
- We don't know that.
What do you mean?
Oh, don't be so silly.
That's none of your business.
Now, look, Ann, we are still legally responsible for you.
Oh, fuck off!
- We were going to the cinema.
- Oh, yes.
- What time is the show starting?
- 7:10.
We never seem to go anywhere nowadays.
Ah!
What have we got?
- Whisky all right?
- Lovely, thank you.
Trust him to be in the bloody herbaceous border.
Here we are.
Ann, why don't you take your car?
- You have a licence?
- Yes.
Thank you.
Ann's still got her provisional licence.
She failed her test.
- Still, be practice for you, won't it?
- Yes.
Silly old sod.
How are you getting home?
Look, if you wanna bring her here, bring her here.
I don't mind.
Someone else to do the cooking, for Christ's sake.
What, you know...
I mean, what do you think?
She wouldn't like it, or something?
She's very clean.
Well, we can clean up, can't we?
Move in?
- Hello, sport.
- Morning, ladies.
- How are you?
- I'm all right.
- Where have you been?
- On the freight train.
- On the job?
- Yeah.
That's nice.
What's that?
- Letters.
- Thank you.
There you go.
Peter Morissey.
Well anyway, think about it.
- Yeah, see you later.
- All right, see you later.
Goodbye, Henry.
That's not bad, is it?
All right!
"Dear Mr Morissey, I enclose a cheque for 500 as payment"
"for publication rights for your short story."
"It includes an advance for your projected novel."
"Yours, Erica Talbot."
Good old Mrs Talbot, eh?
- Saucepans.
- All right, you'll need saucepans.
- And a frying pan.
- And a frying pan.
It's a lovely place you've got here.
It is, isn't it?
- Why have you got it?
- So I can be alone.
- Do you want to be alone?
- No.
You know, you'll need a bath mat and some lavatory paper, probably.
I'm in here.
- And an aerosol.
- Yeah.
Right.
- Where...
- In the kitchen.
- Oh, yeah.
- Cupboards, oven.
- Okay.
- Sounds good.
Here you are.
Cooking oil...
Oh, yeah.
Well, they're...
coming, all right?
I haven't got any plugs for the speakers either, so you'll have to get them.
- Washing up mop.
- Eh?
- Washing up mop.
- You got this on the list?
- No.
- Aha!
- Oh, you've got one.
- I've got one.
Oh, that's very short-sighted of you.
You can get all sorts of things in tins.
Yeah, get a tin opener and you're away, aren't you?
Yeah.
Tomatoes, guavas.
When you got food, did you get salt and pepper?
Got the salt, haven't got any pepper.
Salt, Pepper...
Well, shut up.
God, I can't think.
Got to think of everything, you see.
This is a very nice-sized place for two.
Eh?
It's just big enough for two.
Yeah, when you moving in?
No, I mean, you two.
- No, we've got one or two problems.
- What?
- I thought that's why you...
- No!
No, no, no.
It is, it's beautiful.
What?
Oh that.
And that.
- Can I give you a lift?
- No, I don't think so.
- Here we are.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
I've been thinking.
- Have you?
What about?
- I don't really want to go home.
No, it's all right.
Look, don't worry.
I'm staying the night with Peter.
No, I'm not coming home tomorrow either.
No.
Yes, of course I'm going to work tomorrow.
I'm not going mad.
All right.
Okay.
Bye.
They're going to ring me at work tomorrow.
- When you're away from me?
- Yes.
- How were they?
- Fine.
- All right?
- Yes.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
You were funny.
I've got cramp.
You're very funny.
Bloody foot...
You know what we should do today, don%you?
- What?
- Should get down to Esher and get your things.
No, I better go down when my father's not there.
- Why?
- 'Cause he might start a row.
- He's a bit earhole, is he?
- Well, he might.
- He wouldn't hit me, would he?
- No, I don't think he'd hit you.
- Would he strike me?
- He might.
- Strike me?
- Yes.
Oh, Christ, I'm not going down there then.
No, I'll go down alone and get them.
Do you want to do it here?
You're a sexy little beast, aren't you?
No?
- Now?
- No.
- Under the table?
- No!
Christ.
- Why?
Why not?
- Get off!
Mind my Guinness.
Look what you've done.
- It's your fault.
You're a nymphomaniac.
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
Peter.
Christ, here comes Roy Rogers.
He's got Trigger with him.
- Hello, Ann, how are you?
- I'm fine, thank you.
Right, dear.
Alex Marvel.
- Do you know Ann?
You do?
- Yeah, I've seen Ann before.
Yes, and this is Peter Morissey.
He's a very good writer.
- Is he?
- Really, yes.
Now, sit down, everybody.
I've got good news, Peter.
L really have.
Now get us a drink, Alex.
- What would you like?
- Champagne, I think, to celebrate.
- Of course you would like champagne.
- Yes.
Would you like to come with me, darling?
Now, you're gonna be delighted about this.
- What?
- I think we've got a deal with Titan of Munich.
- Oh, really?
- Yes.
- Do you know who they are?
- No, no, I don't.
Well, it's a production company and they want to buy one of your stories.
Are you seeing a lot of Ann?
- I see enough of her.
- Oh!
Her father phoned me this morning, you know.
- Really?
- He's rather worried.
Hasn't heard from her.
- Well, she phones him.
- Not enough.
- Well, she phones him.
- Peter, I know it's none of my...
Here we are, then.
- No champagne, it's off, dear.
- All right, that'll do.
Lager for you, Guinness for you, lager for you and a Guinness for me.
Ann, Alex, I've got marvellous news.
I think I've sold his story to Titan of Munich.
And furthermore, they're going to retain him as the writer, which as you all know, is practically unheard of.
Is this the story that Peter wrote for Woman's Own?
Yes, it is.
Peter, can I tell you something?
I thought that story was really very good.
- Did you?
- And I don't think you should sell it to Titan of Munich.
- Now, Alex...
- And I'll tell you why.
I'll tell you why.
Because Titan of Munich or any other company like that will just ruin anything.
And that story had something.
And that story should be kept as it is.
Listen, if he wants to sell to Titan of Munich, he can write rubbish like I write and he can sell that to them.
But not a story like that.
- I'm sure it isn't rubbish.
- Oh, it is, man, come on.
- Alex, dear, you're a very good writer.
- Thank you.
But you're not a very good agent and I think you should leave that
- department to me.
- Don't sell it, Peter.
Stick to it.
Because it's a good style.
Well, it's a load of rubbish because...
I don't know why I have to justify myself, but it's a load of rubbish because I wanted some time to buy a bit of...
Bit of time when I could really write what I wanted to write, you know?
Yeah.
And that is that.
I'd...
You know, I'd go out walking somewhere on my own.
And just this sort of feel of the, of the turf.
Or the wind, or bits of twig that I'd pick up.
Just this sort of tactile thing,
I wanna get down on paper.
And I can't, yet.
You can't do it with just...
Using sort of...
But what I want to write about is not a story
with people.
It's nothing.
It's just...
Getting back to, you know, the beginning.
Writing about what it's like to go out and jump in a puddle of water.
- Kind of Andre Gide stuff.
- No, kind of Alex Marvel stuff.
But just without using any flowery...
language.
Or any sort of language whatsoever except the basics.
- I jump into a puddle of water.
- What do you want?
Everyone should know what...
What it's about.
Yeah.
Come in.
Come on, wank!
Hello.
Do you think you've been very honest?
We let you have the car.
- We trusted you...
- Oh, Christ.
To behave like an adult.
Look, I thought you and I understood each other.
I don't think we do very well.
She's very young still.
Peter, it's her state of mind that worries me, that's all.
- Or do you think she's happy?
- No, I don't.
I don't see how she can be.
- What's that?
- What?
Oh...
Some of Ann's things.
Her mother thought that...
I thought for one awful moment you were going to move in.
Good bye.
- What's that doing there?
- Better ask your father.
He brought it.
- Was he here?
- Yes, he was here.
- When?
- About an hour ago.
Came in, smacked his teeth together, and left.
So...
I mean, didn't he do anything?
What did he say?
Nothing.
Just pissed me off, that's all he did.
He just won't leave me alone.
He was around at the office with Erica the other day.
I'm so fed up with all this.
I wanna go away.
- I'll take you anywhere.
- I think it's a nice idea.
- Honolulu?
- Honolulu?
No, somewhere nice.
- Greenland?
- Yes.
With icicles on the end of your titties.
Would you like that?
- Are we really going?
- I am.
Coming?
Come on.
I got saucepans.
Right.
Hot water bottle.
Hey, thanks for bringing me here.
Do you like it?
I mean, why are you so interested anyway?
Just interested, that's all.
You're not going to rush out into the fields, are you?
Eh?
Look for the biggest bull.
No, I'm just interested in how they do it, that's all.
Well, they do it in a purely conventional way.
And anyway, I mean, it doesn't really matter because...
Why'?
Well, I mean, you get...
You are satisfied, aren't you?
Yes, I'm just interested.
I mean, you wanna dream about it because I don't know any other things.
- Don't you?
- Not really.
And I'm terribly tired.
You'd rather have a horse than me, wouldn't you?
A big fat butt pig.
Someone's coming.
Oh, it's Bill.
Highland Bill.
- Good morning.
- Hello, there.
- Oh, you brought it.
- Mmm-hmm.
That's lovely, thank you.
Why don't you try to just do it?
- Have you some bullets?
- Mmm-hmm.
Here.
- I've been digging potatoes all morning.
- Oh, right.
Come in.
Ann!
Mmm?
- How do you do?
- Ann, this is Bill.
This is Ann.
- How do you do?
- My wife.
- Would you like some...
- Mmm.
Thanks very much.
Yes.
A bit of Highland malt.
Hey.
Thank you.
It's very nice.
- Very strong, isn't it?
- Yes.
That's the way it should be.
You know, I'm interested, 'cause I wanna go hunting, you see.
What about rabbits, are there any?
Well, there are some, they're coming back a bit.
They come back and then they seem to... get this myxomatosis again and they get sick on the ground.
But if I was after a rabbit, see, what would I do?
I should think that gun that you have would be the best plan.
Hey.
Where have you been?
Hunting.
Did you catch anything?
No, I thought it might be nice if we had vegetables tonight for a change.
You didn't catch a thing?
- Not really, no.
- You've been out all day.
You haven't caught one thing?
I've got some eggs.
Ann!
Ann?
- Hello.
- Hello.
What would you really like to eat tonight?
Eh?
Go on.
Well, potatoes and things.
That's what I'm making.
Don't you want any meat?
'Cause I've gotten you a rabbit.
Oh.
I don't want it.
- Why not?
- Well, I don't know what to do with it.
Well, cook it.
I don't want it.
You've got to take all the skin off and all that.
- Well, you can do that.
- I don't know how to do it.
Oh, no, take it away.
You know, I don't know what you're shooting rabbits for when you ought to be writing your book.
Oh, Christ!
- Give us a minute.
- I'm going in then.
- I'm going to punish you.
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm bloody fed up with you.
- No, you're not.
- I am, I'm going to put you in.
- No, you won't.
Oh, I love you.
You pig!
You...
You...
I'm...
I'm fed up with you!
You really are...
You just go too bloody far!
I think you take...
Go away!
You take life far too seriously.
Oi!
Now, go away!
- Why didn't you turn the light off?
- I don't want to turn the light off.
- I want the light off.
- Well, turn it off yourself then.
- I'm fed up.
- Eh?
- I want to go home.
- Why?
I just want to go home.
- But it's lovely here.
- It's not.
- Of course it is.
- I want to go back to London.
Anyway, you're not working here at all.
But we've been through all this already.
I don't need to work.
- Yes, you do need to work.
- Why?
You need to earn some money for a start.
Well, I've got some money.
You haven't got enough to live on forever.
- Well, how much do you want then?
- You live in a dream world.
- L...
- You think we can go on and on.
- Can't go on eating potatoes.
- We can...
- When do you want to go home?
- Very soon.
- When?
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.
You'd tear up my Rupert books if you could, wouldn't you?
- Why don't you go and see Erica?
- Yeah, yeah, I will.
- You ought to.
- I know what I ought to do, Ann.
What about you?
What ought you to do?
Oh, I don't suppose she'll want to see me.
I don't suppose she will.
You've got to get your book published.
Yes, I know.
- Stupid.
- What?
Nothing, I was just trying to get a hold of Stephen.
Why don't you write some more short stories?
I don't want to.
Why?
You get lots of money for them.
Yeah, but I don't want to.
I think you're silly.
- Are you all right, Ann?
- Yes, of course.
I mean, you don't feel sick or anything?
- No, why should I?
- Nothing, nothing, I just...
Ann, you're not pregnant, are you?
No, no, of course I'm not.
Why did you think of that?
No reason, I just thought you...
Well, you might be.
I'm just a bit late, that's all.
- So you are pregnant, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.
- I knew you are.
- I don't know whether I am or not.
I'm going to have a test tomorrow.
Hello, love.
- Isn't there any tea?
- Oh, I'll get you some.
- Are you all right?
- It's positive.
That doesn't mean to say that it's definite.
I mean, if it was negative it would be definite, but if it's positive, that doesn't mean to say...
I see.
Well, what are we going to do?
Nothing.
We don't have to do anything, do we?
I mean, we'll just have the thing.
- Do you want it?
- Of course I want it.
I thought you wouldn't want it.
No, I want it, very much.
Well, there's your tea.
Well, you want it, don't you?
I don't want to make you do anything that you don't want to do.
Do you want it?
If you really wanted it, you wouldn't keep asking.
Of course I want it.
- It's not a joke, you know, Peter.
- Well, who's making a joke of it?
You've got to take it seriously.
That's Stephen.
Where?
Over there.
Stephen!
How are you?
- Great to see you.
- Yeah.
What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- Are you sure?
Yeah.
What are you doing?
You still in the flat?
With Henry, with Henry.
Yeah, yeah.
There's the bus.
Are you coming?
No, no, I'm waiting.
- Look, come around and see us.
- Yeah, okay.
Anytime.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
What are you going to do?
Well, I'm not going to do anything, am I?
Why not?
That's the trouble with you.
You always talk about things, then you don't do anything.
Well, I can't have the bloody baby.
I mean, that's ridiculous.
No, I know, I have to go through with it, don't I?
Well, that's all right.
You're a woman.
Well, it's very easy for you to say that, isn't it?
I'm the one who has to suffer.
I detect a certain air of animosity, don%you?
Not in a bad mood, are you?
Well, of course I'm not in a bad mood.
You are in a bad mood.
- You're in a bad mood.
- I'm not.
Why don't we see some people?
- Who?
- I don't know, anyone.
Well, who do you want to see?
Just someone different, that's all.
- We're going to see Henry and Stephen?
- No, I don't mean that.
I was thinking of asking Mummy and Daddy round actually.
- Ooh.
Were you?
- Yes.
- Mmm.
- For dinner.
Dinner?
What, spam and chips in the back kitchen?
- Well, it's all right.
- Oh, they'll love that, won't they?
Well, there's nothing wrong with asking them round for dinner.
No, no, no, very enjoyable.
- Yes, it'll be nice.
- Mmm.
- Won't it?
- Awfully lovely.
All right, send him in.
Hello.
- Sit down.
- Thanks.
I read your novel.
- Did you?
- Yes.
L think it has a lot of marvellous qualities about it.
I really do.
Shows great sensitivity, awareness, and I think you're going to write a very, very good book.
What do you mean?
Not this one.
Really not.
I just know you could do better.
But I spent a year on that book.
What do you mean, I could do better?
No, but you haven't spent a year on it.
And it shows it.
It needs pruning, cutting, shaping, discipline.
That we could do together.
If you would...
What do you mean, "We could do it together"?
If you would rely on me because there are quite a lot of books that I have been...
You mean you don't like it?
It isn't that I don't like it.
It really isn't that I don't like it.
It's simply that it's undisciplined and a little old-fashioned.
I'm afraid I can't agree with you because I think it's a very good book.
You just carry on publishing the old rubbish, right?
Stick to...
Where is our young genius?
- Hello, Peter.
How are you?
- All right.
Good to see you.
Ls this your new book?
Yeah, my latest failure.
- Can I have a look at it?
- No, I'm afraid you can't, Alex.
- Why?
You just haven't finished it?
- No, I finished it.
But it's a load of bloody crap.
Peter, why not phone me when you get home?
Yeah, I'll phone you when I feel like it.
Sorry about that.
When the police were finally able to enter the building, a hoard of weapons were found on the second floor.
Seventeen youths were charged with offences including possessing dangerous weapons, using threatening behaviour and resisting arrest.
With the present short-term housing...
Little shits!
- Eh?
- Bloody commentator.
Oh, yeah.
Isn't Stephen coming?
Yeah, he should be.
He'll be here in a minute.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just wanted to watch the programme.
Anyway, I've made you a spectacular supper.
That's all right.
Yeah, in fact, it's probably boiling over.
Hang on.
Oh.
- Is Henry in?
- Oh, yes, come in.
Oh, lverna.
Hello.
- Come in.
This is Ann.
- Hello.
- And this is Peter.
- Hello.
Iverna.
I was just burning the supper actually.
Peter's a writer.
- What do you write for?
- Money.
Hmm.
Oh, look, I've got these copies of Black Dwarf that you wanted.
Oh, thanks.
Look, it's great, this article here.
- There.
Mmm.
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I think it's the sort of thing to interest people.
What are you going to do with them?
Distribute them at work.
- Should go down like a bomb.
- Don't you think so?
Have you got a revolutionary set at the agency?
Yes, we have.
Oh, you know, we print posters and we sent some money to Paris.
That's good.
Good.
What books do you write?
- Mainly short stories actually.
- Oh, really?
Well, that's rather difficult, isn't it?
There aren't any publishers for them, are there?
No, I've had one or two things published in Woman's Own.
You think it's easier to write for women?
I really hadn't given it much thought.
- I better get back to the stew.
- Where's Stephen?
Oh, God knows.
He's often out late.
- Do you know Stephen?
- Yes.
- Don't you like him?
- What?
- Don't you like him?
- Well, he's uncommitted, isn't he?
He expects to be carried along.
I think he's rather nice.
Well, I don't think being nice is what we need now.
All right, supper's ready.
And the point is, he's bothered to learn the technique, he's a craftsman.
Unlike so many of the young painters today.
Oh, but he's so much better.
L can never understand how some of these students leave college and then they're recognised as geniuses overnight.
Well, I don't mind young people getting recognition.
Why, it's a bit ridiculous, isn't it?
After all, there are many gifted people that have been working at it for years.
Well, no, it's the lack of technique that worries me.
I don't know what they teach them in the schools today.
Self-expression, isn't it?
Oh, no, self-expression, true creativity...
Well, it's the highest purpose of life.
Now, if that was learnt in the schools, fine.
You see, what we've got to guard against is self-indulgence.
Yes.
I didn't realise what a clever cook you were.
- Oh, let me help you, please.
- No, don't worry.
May I, Peter?
Thank you.
Well, that was a delicious meal.
Well, how is she?
- Fine.
- Good.
- But she's not working?
- No.
- She doesn't need to work.
- No, no, of course not.
But it's always good to have something to do.
Yeah.
- Well, it doesn't worry you?
- No, not at all.
- I mean, she finds plenty to do.
- Oh, really?
Anyway, it's not really my business.
I mean, I don't run her life for her, you know.
No.
But you have taken on a responsibility.
I mean, you don't want me to be responsible so I'm just asking whether you're satisfied about her.
Yes, I'm satisfied.
Why does she look so tired?
- More?
- Oh, no, only a cup.
Thank goodness for that.
I'm full up, dear.
- Thank you.
- Here, Peter.
Now, who wants sugar?
- Ann tells me you've written a novel.
- Yes.
And when is it coming out?
I don't really know, it's a very difficult process, publishing.
Erica's very efficient though.
I'm sure she'll get it done as quickly...
- Erica's not taking it though, is she?
- What?
- No.
She didn't like it.
- I didn't know.
- When did she see it?
- Last week.
- And what have you done?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?
- Nothing.
What can I do?
She didn't like it.
Well, I mean, she's not the only agent in London, is she?
Well, if she didn't like it, I think...
- You can improve it, perhaps.
- Yes.
And try it again.
- She'd take it.
- I'm sure she'd like to help.
I don't think I want to improve it very much.
Perhaps you could have a word with Erica.
- Hello, mate.
- Hello, Stephen.
I'm so sorry I missed you when you came around.
Hello.
I'm really sorry, I had to go out and see someone.
It's all right.
This is my mother and father.
This is Stephen.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
Good to see you.
It's really good to see you.
- You're seeing us.
- Yeah.
- Living in the country?
- Yeah.
- Had a nice time?
- Lovely.
Where have you been?
Sussex, on the Downs.
Marvellous.
Mmm, yeah, it's so nice.
Really green.
It's a bring down to get back to this place, isn't it?
It's such a drag up here.
Well, I think we ought to be going then.
Yes, yes, it's past our bedtime.
- I'll get your coat.
- Thanks, dear.
Good bye.
- Good night.
- Goodbye, dear.
Bye, Mummy.
And I'm sorry.
Thank God they're gone.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?
- About the book.
- Well, I didn't have an opportunity.
- And why do you have to be so rude?
- Me, rude?
He was the one that was being bloody rude.
- He wasn't, he was just going to help.
- He bloody well was.
Why does he have to go and stick his nose into my business and tell Erica about my book?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to break it up.
No, you didn't break anything up.
- An argument.
- No, they were going anyway.
- Who?
- My parents.
- Family tiff.
- Oh.
Can I have some orange juice?
- Orange juice.
We got any orange juice?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'll get you some.
Sit down.
- When are you going to have a baby then?
- What?
- When are you going to have a baby?
- How did you know?
Well, I didn't.
I just thought...
- Are you going to have a baby?
- Yeah.
Oh, great.
Fantastic news.
- What?
- Ann's going to have a baby.
I know.
A few problems.
What problems, mate?
I suppose there aren't really, are there?
You should be pleased.
Well, I am.
I am pleased.
So, how was the country?
Oh.
All right, great, fantastic.
I was just thinking when you get back, the noise is so loud after being so quiet in the country, by comparison.
Well, I don't know why you live here, do you?
I'd live there all the time if I was you.
Hmm.
- Have you eaten?
- No.
Well, do you want something?
Stay for some supper.
- What, here?
- Yeah, why not?
Yeah.
Okay.
It'll be nice, it'll be nice.
So that we can talk.
Sorry, I broke all that up.
No, you didn't break anything up.
Really.
- Can I go to the toilet?
- Yeah.
Can I just have my... bag?
Stephen?
Peter!
What's he doing?
Tell him to get out of there, will you?
Tell him to get out!
Peter, what's he doing?
- It's all right.
- Get him out, will you?
Tell her it's all right.
Will you please get him out?
Please!
- Come on now.
- No, you must make him stop.
Listen, it's all right, darling.
Now, come on.
Please, Peter.
Look, it's not our business.
He can't do that.
Well, we can't do anything about it.
Love, we can't run his life for him.
Well, he can't do it here.
Please, Peter.
Hey, get that thing off your arm.
You Okay?
Look, you don't have to go.
How long have you been taking that shit?
- Well, not long.
- But why?
- It's okay.
- You're crazy.
- You don't need it, man, you just do it.
- You're crazy, Stephen.
- I'd better go.
- No, look, you don't have to go.
Yeah, I'll go.
You frightened him.
Oh don't be so bloody stupid.
What are you gonna do?
Well, what can I do?
It's nothing to do with us, love.
Well, you must help him.
You heard what he said.
He's just trying it, there's nothing wrong.
Well, you'd better bloody well do something about it, that's all.
I like your stuff.
Are those more of the poems?
Just a few more, yeah.
They're not finished.
There isn't a great deal of call for poems as such, here.
Come in.
Come in!
I'll get it.
- Oh, it's you, Jim.
Oh, lovely.
- Ease over, please.
Stella asked me to bring the coffee.
- Sugar?
- Yeah, two, please.
This is Peter, by the way, Peter Morissey, a friend of Henry.
- Hi.
- Hello.
How are you?
Peter just sent me a...
Well, actually a poem.
Ah.
Well, Roger, that's the latest.
- Who's this from?
Samson?
- Yeah.
If the objection's "Glowing warmth," why not change it to something like,
"Snugly warm?" I mean, it's more colloquial.
- Yes, I like snugly warm.
- Cuddly warm?
Well, of course, it's different writing for any satirical.
Our work's much more, sort of demanding, much more disciplined.
Well, I've been working here for about 10 years and I reckon it's only about now that I'm sort of on the right wavelength.
- Are you?
- Snugly is a good word.
Bloody Samson.
Hey, Roger, got your message.
Listen, I wanna talk to you about something.
Oh, Bob, I wanted you to meet Peter Morissey.
Peter, this is Bob Good.
- Hi.
- Hello, it's nice to meet you.
Listen, I've just had feelers, little tinklet from them.
They're very happy with the last campaign, think it's great.
So much so that they'd like a new product and a new campaign.
- That's nice.
- Mmm.
Within a week.
- A week?
- Mmm.
A new dog food within a week?
- Are you visiting?
- No, no, I'm here for a job actually.
Have you ever worked in an agency before?
- No.
- Peter's a friend of Henry's.
- He writes poems.
- Oh.
Well, you'll find that the writing we do here is not geared to an esoteric audience.
It requires discipline and very demanding.
- Wouldn't you say so, Jim?
- Yeah.
- Dog food in a week?
- Yeah.
How about chewing gum for dogs?
- Stephen.
- Oh.
- Are you still here?
- What did they say?
- They said, I'm all right.
- What do you mean you're all right?
You've only been in there a couple of minutes.
No, no, I had a quick examination.
What did they do?
Did they give you an injection or anything?
No, we had a cup of tea and we had a few jellies and cakes.
Oh, come on, what did they say?
I'm all right.
I'm A-okay.
I've passed out.
Well, you can't be okay.
You've only been in there a little while.
They gave me a quick one.
They'll write me a letter.
I'll come in with you and get it straightened out.
- No, I've been in there.
- Come on, Stephen.
I don't wanna go in again.
Look, I didn't bring you all the way down here just to hear that crap.
All right.
Push off then.
I was trying to bloody help you.
Well, you helped.
You brought me down.
Now, push off.
Go on, you piss me off.
- Do you think it's a good idea?
- What?
Work?
Well, you've got to.
Yeah, I know.
But advertising?
Don't you like it?
It's all right.
- The money's good.
- Well...
And you can write when you get home in the evenings.
Yeah.
That's all right, then, isn't it?
- These are for Jonathan.
All right.
- In the post room.
Straight and right.
Look, I'll only be a minute.
I must get these off, all right?
- How was it?
- Okay.
- What did they say?
- Nothing.
- It's all right?
- Yeah, it's all right.
That's my boss.
- When's it going to be?
- Oh, months.
- Well, how long?
- Seven months.
- Can we go now?
Come on.
- Yeah.
Ann, do you want to get married?
Because I'm pregnant?
- No, uh...
- You didn't want to before.
- No.
- So, what's the difference now?
Well, somehow I think it's right that we should be married.
Because I'm pregnant?
- Peter!
- What's the matter?
Christ!
Be careful.
For Christ's sakes.
What's the matter?
- There might be somebody in there.
- Oh, yeah.
It's all right.
God!
God, they've taken everything!
- Oh, shut up, Ann.
Don't get all...
- But they have!
Shut up!
They've taken your typewriter and the record player.
L have a pair of eyes, Ann.
I can see perfectly well what they've taken.
And they haven't taken everything.
They have left the bloody bed.
Ann?
- Ann, you're not asleep, are you?
- Mmm.
Well, what we came up with was basically this.
Vitaminised sweet for dogs.
Sweet meaning, pudding?
- Pudding, yes.
- Dessert?
Yes.
If it's the South Atlantic you come from.
We have pudding, so why shouldn't dogs?
I mean, sure.
I think this guy could appeal.
Oh, yeah.
Then we have the strategy and the strategy is simply to convince the dog owners that no form of feeding offers their pet all the minerals and vitamins that they need.
Therefore, they must have their diet supplemented by our product.
- Let's have a bit of a test, eh?
- I think it's a good idea, yeah.
I'm sick of that bloody job.
Do you know what they said today?
What's wrong?
Hello, Peter.
Bye, Ann.
What's he doing here?
- Just dropped in.
- What did he want?
To see how I was.
Lunch.
Jog for your dog.
- Is this one of your creations?
- That's right.
Hold on, here.
Just let me finish this.
I suppose you haven't seen Stephen, have you?
- No.
Where is he?
- Oh.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
He hasn't been about for a few days.
- Hasn't he?
- No.
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.
Haven't seen him for about a week.
What, have you phoned his work or anything?
Oh, I don't know where he's working.
- Well, he's working at the station.
- No, he's not.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
He went to be an airline pilot and that's the last I saw of him.
You know what he's doing, don't you?
Haven't the faintest idea what he's doing.
Hasn't been home.
Ann!
- Peter.
- Where's Ann?
She's not here.
She's not at home.
Do you know where she is?
She's all right.
She came to ask for help.
Help?
What's the matter?
- She tried to phone you...
- Ann is not here.
- Well, I wanna bloody see her!
- Get downstairs!
- How dare you?
- Stop...
Stop it!
- Ann has lost her baby.
- What?
- She came here for help and she got it.
- Oh, God.
I begged you to be careful, but you took no notice.
- You went on your own sweet way.
- She wouldn't have done that.
- She really wanted that child.
- She didn't.
She would never have been able to cope with the child.
Could you?
Where is she?
She's in a nursing home.
She'll be there a few days.
- Can I see her?
- Of course.
- Not tonight.
- When?
Why don't you go and see her tomorrow?
- Hello.
- It's all right.
How are you?
Oh, Henry, Henry, are you going to be at home tonight?
Yes, we're having a meeting.
- Can I come around and see you?
- Well, do you have to?
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Ann Halpern.
- You've come to visit her, have you?
- Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid you can't see her now.
- Well, look, I must see her.
- Sorry, it's way past visiting hours.
What's the matter, sister?
Oh, Mr Halpern, this gentleman wants to see Ann.
Oh, surely it'll be alright.
Well, it's really late.
It's rather late.
- Yes, I know, but...
- Thank you.
Carry on.
Hello.
How are you?
- Father's just been here, has he?
- Mmm.
Mmm, I saw him.
What did he want?
Nothing.
Well, he must have.
Didn't he say anything?
He brought those flowers.
Lovely.
He had a go at me, I suppose, did he?
Just a little quick dig in the ribs, was it?
No.
I don't know why you had to go and see him.
I mean, why didn't you come and see me?
Why didn't you come and tell me?
Be quiet.
But it has to do with me, isn't it, Ann?
Well, don't be so bloody stupid.
I mean, you go running off and you tell him the moment something happens.
Look, I didn't want the baby.
Can you understand that?
- How was she?
- Fine, fine.
She's gonna be fine.
Yes, I think so, too.
Uh...
We're going to get married.
You knew, didn't you?
Oh.
Ann didn't tell me.
Oh, well, we were always going to.
- Let me drop you somewhere.
- No, I've got the car, thank you.
Oh, yes.
Bye-bye, Peter.
- Hello, Peter.
Tea?
- Hi.
Thank you.
- You all right?
- Fine, yeah.
- You look a bit down.
- No, not really.
Hey, I've just been talking to Roger.
He's very pleased about that campaign.
- Good.
- Yeah, he thinks you handled that really well, really professional.
That's lovely.
- Do you know what?
- Hmm?
I reckon you can look forward to better things.
- What, like another telephone?
- Yeah, red one.
- Wouldn't be bad.
- Yeah.
Okay, well, you stick at it.
Oughtn't you to be in bed?
I brought you some flowers.
- I'm sorry, darling.
- What for?
I shouldn't have done it.
Oh, that doesn't matter.
I mean, it was right for you to do it.
We just weren't ready for it, love.
Why did you tell him we were getting married?
Why didn't you?
I mean, we are, aren't we?
I didn't want them to know.
I'm really sick of this place.
L mean, if you rest for a couple of days at home, you'll be fine.
I don't want to go home.
- Aren't you eating?
- No, thank you.
Oh, really?
What's happened, darling?
You loved it!
- Mother.
- She always can be so...
It's one of the things that happens when you have a new member of the family on the way.
We were going to call him Horatio, weren't we, darling?
No, darling.
That's a terrible name.
It isn't a terrible name.
It's a lovely name.
Why don't you call it Jean?
Well, we might have a girl, darling.
How's the writing going?
- Very well, thank you.
- Peter, what's happened about your novel?
Nothing at all, really.
I've been so busy.
- I haven't had time to do anything.
- Oh, what a pity.
You know, Erica was very impressed by it.
Was she?
Tell me, did Brooksford have a word with you?
Yes, he did.
I thought him a very pleasant man, indeed.
- You know him, do you?
- Slightly.
I suppose what you really want to do is to make a lot of money and then go off and live on a desert island and write?
I'm working on it.
In ten years' time you might be able to appear on Desert Island Discs.
L don't think Ann will be much use to you on the desert island, would she?
She won't at all.
She's not at all domesticated and takes hours in the bathroom, and is bad-tempered at breakfast.
Oh, there's a diamond, dear.
She's the most incredible bad partner to have on the tennis court.
I don't expect they'll play tennis either.
- She never gets up before 12:00.
- No, hardly ever.
Don't take any notice, Ann.
Good night.
Oh, awful, the draught.
Ann, you'll catch a cold.
Go on in.
Well, good night, Peter.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Right-Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Nice boy, Peter, he really is.
Now, pretty one, what do you want for your wedding present?
- I don't know.
- Well, you've got it.
A house.
Oh.
Christ!
Needleman's back, is he?
Well, that's a bloody welcome.
Where have you been then?
Huddersfield.
Yeah.
Huddersfield?
What for?
Sort meself out.
I've come back to see you.
- I was a bit worried about you.
- Hmm, were you?
Yeah, I saw what you were doing with Ann and your prospective child.
Oh, yeah.
Hmm?
Not much to say about that.
- Still on the junk, are you?
- No.
- What do you mean, no?
- I gave it up.
What?
Just like that?
Uh, not just like that, but...
- I gave it up.
- Oh, I see.
- Uh, should we go through?
- Help yourself, yeah.
Have you got any gear?
Don't know.
I got a bit of old shit in there, but it's not much use.
Well, let's try it.
- Hmm, if you like.
- Let's get really smashed, eh?
- Really stoked.
Need sugar?
- Uh, yeah.
Three.
She wore her underclothes it And when she caressed me it She damn near undressed me, gor blimey
I went to the doctor, He said where did you cop her
Down the Old Kent Road it The pimple and the twinkle
On your winkie will be pinker than the red, red rose ♪
That's really cheered me up.
Where's Ann?
- Where is she then?
- She's at home.
What for?
She hasn't been very well.
She went home to get better.
- Why?
What's the matter?
- You got any skins?
Yeah, I have a pipe.
Nothing, nothing wrong with her.
She's getting better.
- What was wrong with her?
- Nothing.
It must have been something for her to go home.
She had an abortion, Stephen.
Well, you stupid bastards.
Well, it had nothing to do with me, I...
Who was it to do with then?
She went down and saw her father...
- Did you make her have it?
- No.
- Well, who made her have it?
- I don't know.
Have you split UP?
No.
We're gonna get married.
Oh, dear.
We're gonna get married.
She's having abortions you don't know about and going down there and living with those creatures.
And you're gonna get married?
What do you think that's gonna solve?
Eh?
- Ain't got much in this gear.
- Shocking, innit?
- Yeah.
- Bloody Spader.
Shall we go and see if Henry's got any?
Henry?
Oh no, I think I'd rather smoke this stuff.
Have you seen him recently?
- Yeah.
- He's got so bloody miserable.
He's goes around inventing enemies for himself and wanting to give them all final solutions.
- And his chick...
- What?
Lverna?
- Jesus Christ.
- Freaky nerd.
- She really doesn't dig me.
- No.
I wish I'd brought my stuff down with me.
I left it with my mum.
- Your mum turn on?
Christ.
- Yeah.
Did you have that conversation with him about problems and solutions?
Not half.
I said I'd rather be part of a problem than the solution.
You're a bloody problem, aren't you?
At least he's got a future in it.
No future making bloody posters.
That's all he does.
He sits there all bloody day at work doing that.
- Are you there?
- Yeah.
- You're working there?
- Copywriting.
A copywriter?
What's happened to your...
What do you call it?
Your art?
- Eh?
It's a big joke now, is it?
- My art?
No.
I thought you were gonna make a lot of money out of it.
That's what I thought, but it didn't work out.
So we've just given up, have we?
- No, we haven't.
- What do we do then?
- We'll, we're writing at night.
- Are we?
- We are.
- Bloody stupid, innit?
I'm doing a lot of bloody stupid things recently.
- Yeah, you are, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.
You think you can't do it before you've got all your money scrimped and scraped?
Look, I'm just trying to make a living, all right?
No, you're not.
That'd be all right if you were just trying to make a living.
Everybody's got to earn their living.
How's promotion, all right?
- All right.
- You're going up in the world, are you?
- I mean, I'm going up the ladder.
- Yes.
If you were only trying to make a living, that'd be fine.
But you're not, you're getting your money in and building it all around you like a little castle...
- Am I?
- Protecting yourself from the gremlins.
Oh, yes.
But I've got Ann to think of, haven't I?
- Have you considered that?
- Blaming Ann?
I'm not blaming anybody.
- Well, you just blamed Ann.
- No, I didn't blame her.
- I've got to look after her.
- You've got to protect her?
It's Ann who needs protecting?
I thought that was her old man's scene.
You've got to look after her like a little toy, like the rest of them?
Bloody stuff you've got cluttered up around this place now.
Yeah, you make me insane.
- Anyway, sod it.
- I'm off to Spain.
I'm off to sleep.
All right.
Don't hang me up all night farting or whatever to get up to.
You're right, anyway.
- Wait.
What?
- I know you're right.
Well, don't get uptight.
- What are you doing?
- Shh.
Go back to sleep.
- What time is it?
- 8:30.
- You're up early, ain't you?
- Got to go to work.
- Have you?
- Yeah.
Um, can you hang on a sec?
I'll come with you.
- Make it snappy 'cause I'm late.
- All right.
Come on, Stephen, there's the bloody bus.
I've just got to go in here.
Just a second.
- Is Mr Robinson in yet?
- No.
They're all early starters.
- Mr Robinson there?
- No.
He's in here.
- What do you want?
- Are you Mr Robinson's secretary?
No.
Why's my door open?
Yes?
May I help you?
No.
You can go away if you like.
What do you want with my typewriter?
Put it down!
This is a stick up!
Stick 'em up!
Well?
Is that what you want?
- Yeah.
- Well, take it then.
Let's see if it works.
If it doesn't, we'll take it back and get another.
- It's a bargain.
- It's a present for you.
Thanks.
Right.
Breakfast time.
Anything else you want?
Yes.

Open the gate!
Open it!
Oboshi!
Sir!
Koman, let me in.
It's Gengobe.
Koman, open up!
Koman, what's wrong?
Get a hold of yourself!
You scared me.
I almost pushed this big pin right... through my ear.
Was it a dream?
A dream?
You were groaning about something.
What was it about?
It was a very strange dream.
You were lying... over there with your... face on the floor.
Just a dream!
You're mean.
What happened to me?
It was nothing.
I've forgotten it already.
You're awfully mean.
Come on, tell me.
Don't worry, maybe it wasn't you at all.
So you were with some other girl, weren't you?
Dreams are the mirror of the true heart!
Tell me just who she was, Gengobe!
Don't talk foolishly.
You are the only girl I care for, anywhere.
Is that really true?
I don't lie to you.
What is this tattoo?
"Godairiki"
"Godairiki is a pledge of eternal love."
It makes me blush to say it, but it is a Godairiki love pledge tattoo.
An oath to never be touched by another man.
For whom?
You're cruel to ask.
It is for you.
Look closely.
Who else would it be?
For me?
That is a lie.
You're so cruel.
It hurts, so this must not be a dream.
Even if it's a dream,
I want to live for love alone.
Gengobe, please make me your wife.
Koman.
Who is it?
It's Hachiemon.
I've come home.
You're early.
I came fast with good news.
How is everyone at home?
Very well.
But, sir,
What has happened here?
I sold everything to pay my debts.
Not the hanging scroll by Eitoku!
Yes, that too.
But it was an heirloom.
I know.
But, that still wasn't enough.
The landlord comes day and night, demanding more rent.
I can't even sleep.
Are you in your right mind, sir?
That doesn't matter.
You have no right to question me.
Hachiemon.
Have you ever heard the proverb, "everything in nothing?"
No, I haven't.
It means that all is in a lack of everything.
It's full of meaning.
Do you mean to say that the vixen in there...
Is what you call something in nothing?
What do you mean calling me a vixen?
!
I've become his wife this very day.
What?
As I'm Gengobe's wife you mustn't talk to me like that!
This is a crazed vixen.
You shut up and get out of here!
Gengobe, say something!
Gengobe!
Oh, how cruel.
So your promise was a lie?
Koman, I think you should go for now.
Oh, you are against me now too...
See now?
Get out!
I won't forget this!
Don't push me so much!
And don't come back!
Gengobe, you have made me very sad today.
Don't look so glum.
With Koman here, even this empty house is like a garden, but your glum face makes me nervous.
Are you serious, sir?
What if I am?
How cruel!
At first I believed you dedicated to the vendetta, but you spend your money on prostitutes,
while your man Tokuemon has set himself up as priest of Aizome Temple... in Yotsuya, and is trying to gather the money you lost... in order to get you back in good with Oboshi,
so you can be part of the revenge.
And then when you some forty men take your own lives after it's done,
I plan to do the same.
Here I come back and find you with that... famous geisha Koman of Nakacho, for whom... you have sold all your household goods.
You can't be sane!
Do you still call yourself a samurai?
Is this the end of Soemon Funakura, the retainer of the Enya family?
You are probably angry with me for saying this, but please give Koman up.
I beg of you!
Are you finished?
You're a good actor!
A most amusing show!
What?
!
I have my reasons.
Don't worry yourself.
You mean this is to fool the enemies?
Of course!
If that's true, I'm very happy.
Please forgive my rudeness.
Now you sound like Soemon of the Enya family again.
Don't talk so loud.
The walls have ears!
I am the poor samurai Gengobe Satsuma to the outside world right now.
Yes, Gengobe, sir, and I have good news.
Look at this.
100 ryo?
!
The men at home all got together to thank you for past favors.
Some sold fields and others borrowed to make this 100 ryo for you.
With this you must pay the government money you lost... and become one with Oboshi and the others as an honorable samurai once more.
Please accept this for that purpose.
Is that the way it is?
Thank you so much.
I'm out of breath!
What is it now?
!
I forgot something very important.
Oh, here it is!
I'm so careless!
Gengobe!
Koman doesn't want to go back to Nakamachi.
I have to talk to Hachiemon just now.
Yes, I understand.
I have to go as I have a customer.
A geisha has to be nice even if she doesn't like her customer.
Sorry I bothered you.
100 ryo!
I had given up on ever getting so much together again.
You did a good job.
Thanks again.
It makes me happy just to see you so happy.
Please go early tomorrow morning and get your name... on the list with Oboshi and the others.
Yes, I'll do just that.
This cloth is perfect for wrapping the money.
I can't thank you enough.
"An hour later..."
Pardon my intrusion.
Who is it?
Sangoro of Sasanoya.
I've important business with you, sir.
Sorry to bother you so late.
Thanks for your patronage, Gengobe.
What is it?
Koman asked me to give you this letter.
Please read it and go see her.
You're lucky to have a woman so in love with you.
She does seem to have something important to talk to me about.
Not tonight, sir.
Have you forgotten what you just said?
He cannot possibly go tonight.
So just get off with the other rats.
Hachiemon is right.
I'll stay home tonight.
Now you are talking like yourself, sir.
If you let things go, you may get yourself killed for it.
Sir, you are too young to know real love.
Are you going to let poor Koman die?
Then you'll find me your enemy and have a fight on your hands.
All joking aside, sir, didn't you know that... a Kono samurai came to pay Koman's debts?
I heard she had such a customer, but didn't... know he was going to pay and take her away.
Why didn't she tell me?
She was here twice.
Oh, I see what it was.
She came here to try to find some way to tell you, but was too shy to come out and say it.
After all a geisha is for buying and selling.
She kept quiet so as not to cause you undue worry.
I'm sure.
As soon as she got home from here, she began crying and throwing things.
Before long that Kono samurai will be there.
I shudder to think of what she must be going through now.
Poor girl.
Please go and console her a little now, sir.
Sir, you must be strong against... the tricks of that vixen.
You're right.
But why is Koman acting that way just now?
Then, sir, is it all right to go back... and tell Koman that Gengobe is cold and... cruel and that she should forget him?
That's just what we want you to tell her.
If you do that, sir, you will never see Koman again, and won't... be welcome at the shop.
So I have to go make the girl cry, do I?
Wait, Sangoro!
What?
You're impatient.
I'll go with you.
That's the way!
Have you changed your mind so soon, sir?
Oh, please hear me, and stay here tonight!
You shut up and watch the house for me.
No, I won't.
Are you trying to make your master angry?
No, not me!
Then stay!
But I don't have anything to give the landlord... if he comes for the rent.
There're enough umbrellas for that.
No, there aren't.
Pay him with this hair pin.
It was made by Goto.
But, sir, must you?
Let's go!
Follow me.
Oh, dear!
He must really be in love with that vixen!
What shall I do?
!
And with all his debts too.
Even made by Goto, will one of a pair satisfy the landlord?
Oh, the 100 ryo!
Master!
"A tea house in Fukagawa."
- No, I won't give in!
- Now, don't get excited.
After all I've given her, why does Koman reject Banemon?
!
Because I don't like you.
Don't like me?
Listen, Koman.
You're my sister, but I won't let you be so selfish!
I don't like him and I won't go with him!
I'm the one that signed for the loan, so don't be rough with her or I'll be in trouble.
Banemon promises to let you live as you like, so if you say yes... you will save you and me both from a lot of worry and trouble.
And me as a samurai!
She just won't listen to anything I say.
Have another drink and be calm.
Drink?
A good idea!
Pour for me!
Don't be so angry.
Koman must have some reason for refusing.
Torazo, you must know.
Tell me her reason!
It is nothing unusual.
It is just that Koman has a lover.
Is he a samurai or a townsman?
He is a no-good ronin named Gengobe.
I don't know why she likes him.
He is a beggar!
But he was originally a man of position, even so he doesn't mind that I'm a geisha.
He still wants me.
But he was already a penniless beggar before he fell for you.
That's the way they talk.
I feel sick.
I feel even worse.
If I only had money.
Your Gengobe could never get together 100 ryo, no matter how he tried, but I have it right here to pay right now.
Think which of us can take care of you best.
He is right.
The 100 ryo is most important.
He is a very good offer, Koman.
Right!
Forget that man and take Banemon.
Be my wife!
No, I won't!
Look at this!
It's the Godairiki pledge to never let another man touch me.
My heart is locked against any man except Gengobe.
You'll not open it with your gold key!
I am Samurai Gengobe's wife.
So you refuse me?
Yes, with all my heart.
And this is all Gengobe's fault.
Damn!
I'll kill him!
Careful, Gengobe may be listening.
Then tell him to get 100 ryo!
Where'd he get it?
!
He'd never even get together a few shu!
He'd run off with his tail between his legs.
Just a minute!
I am that Gengobe Satsuma!
Oh, Gengobe, I'm glad you are here.
So this is.
I told you not to gossip!
We heard all you said!
Who do you think you are calling a beggar?
!
Watch your tongues!
But I didn't.
You won't get off so easy as that!
What'll we do with them, sir?
You people.
Please forgive us.
I beg of you!
I, Gengobe, will now pay Koman's debts.
100 ryo in pure gold!
That's right.
And I receive Koman in return.
How's that?
!
Who said Gengobe couldn't get together even a few shu?
!
Don't make me laugh!
I've served him for some time and know... that he always has 100 ryo in his pocket.
Come on, Koman!
Then I will.
I'm so happy, Gengobe!
What have you done, sir?
!
That 100 ryo was gathered so you could participate in the vendetta.
Where're you going, sir?
I mustn't be seen here.
I'm going.
But, sir, doesn't it make you angry... to hear them talking about you like that?
It makes me mad.
Let's go in there!
Listen, Gengobe is here!
Oh, Gengobe, I'm glad you are here.
So this is.
I told you not to gossip!
We heard all you said!
Who do you think you are calling this man a beggar?
!
Don't make me laugh!
Who said Gengobe couldn't get together even a few shus?
He always has 100 ryo or so in his pocket.
Sangoro, don't talk so big.
As you said, sir, you can do as you please with this woman.
I'm a beggar as you say and have no right to stand in your way... whatever you do with her.
What are you saying?
Where does that leave Koman and me?
Gengobe, thanks for taking care of me and my sister.
You have given us a very good life all this time.
Tramping in like this,
I thought you'd have 100 ryo.
This is a real joke!
Chohachi, that goes without saying.
He may have been a fine samurai before, but... now he's nothing compared to me, Banemon of the Konos.
Oh, please, sir.
Say something back to him!
No, he's right.
Leave him alone.
So, ladies' man, money and power has done it.
Pardon me.
Do you really mean I must be his wife?
Be happy!
Goodbye!
What're you doing?
How can I live after... the man I love has abandoned me?
There's nothing for her to do but die.
Sir, you have disappointed us!
Go ahead and die!
I'd be much obliged to Gengobe if he let you.
Die if you like!
Koman, wouldn't you rather be mine?
How horrible!
Let me go!
Don't be stupid!
Oh, Gengobe, you're so very cruel!
Don't force me to live in shame!
I live in the same shame.
Goodbye!
Farewell, until we meet in that world.
Wait!
Do you really feel that strongly?
Yes.
I, Gengobe, hereby pay Koman's ransom debts.
But that's 100 ryo.
Right!
100 ryo!
Here is the 100 ryo, take it, and I receive Koman in return!
It's 100 ryo in pure gold!
You can't judge a man by the way he looks!
Just look at this!
This is the Gengobe I, Sangoro, call my lord and master!
I'm a ronin, but still a samurai.
I'm happy to meet you Banemon!
What's this?
!
But first of all, no one has any objections to my ransoming Koman with this 100 ryo?
None at all.
Wait!
I object!
What are you doing here?
I was afraid this is what you would do.
And after I warned and scolded you so.
Water spilled from a bowl doesn't return.
But that 100 ryo was gathered by those... back home for you to make a come back.
Shut up!
You don't know my heart!
Let's get better acquainted, Banemon!
I would like to, but I have a stomach-ache.
Wait, you samurai!
What a dull samurai!
Now all the tears are over, I mean to make Koman my wife.
Come with me, Koman.
Oh, Gengobe, you just make me so happy...
Oh, sir.
Please wait a moment.
What do you mean, wait?
It is true that you paid Koman's ransom, but unfortunately, she has a husband.
Koman has a husband?
!
Right, and unless she breaks with him.
Is this true, Koman?
Answer me!
Who is the man?
!
Well, he...
Sangoro, who is Koman's husband?
It is me.
What?
You?
Yes, I'm her husband, and Koman is my wife.
I tried to find a patron for her.
You've been a good patron.
So the two of you have worked together... to lead me into this deep situation?
You bastards!
Well, it isn't easy to sit by and... watch your own wife with another man.
And, Koman, did you fool me too?
I know you are mad, but there were deep reasons.
Please believe my heart.
Shut up, you stupid woman!
Shut up!
It was my mistake to be bewitched by her, but you are really terrible to try... to rob a man of his property this way!
It's money, not duty that keeps you alive!
You inhuman bastard!
Stop, Master, your life is too important!
Don't try to stop me!
Endure this.
Please don't do it!
Come cut us down if you want to, but remember that...
Koman is my legal wife, not yours.
Cut away if you like, it's your loss!
You and your beastly insults.
It's my sin to have been born a woman.
Please forgive me, and kill me now.
You filthy thing!
Get away from me!
Quiet!
You are inhuman!
But, Master, you must save yourself from all this.
Think of yourself!
Don't kill them.
Let's go home.
Oh, Sangoro, you are too cruel.
Oh, my poor heart.
Your woman's heart may find it hard, but...
I have to get 100 ryo no matter what to get... my father to forgive me and take me back.
Since he disowned me ten years ago.
I was worried, but it all came out alright.
Here is your 100 ryo.
Thanks.
You all put on a real good show.
There'll be some for the rest of us?
Don't worry.
Go on and warm up some saké.
OK.
I'll be home waiting for you.
"Later the same night..."
Koman, you are the only one I love.
Is that the truth?
I wouldn't lie...
What is this tattoo?
It is embarrassing to say, but... it is a pledge to never let another man touch me.
A pledge of love.
Love for whom?
Oh, you're cruel.
It is you.
Who else would it be?
We'll change it to "Precious Sangoro."
It stings!
A sly rewrite!
But maybe she really felt the original.
Stupid!
She loves only "precious" me!
You're awful!
Look at that!
And look at this!
What'll you do now?
But Gengobe must be awful angry.
Did you fall for him a little after all?
Don't be silly!
A geisha lives a life of lies.
But they say truth Is born from lies.
Oh, Kikuno, you too?
You did put it on pretty strong.
How can I live, abandoned by my love?
And Gengobe overdid the lover role too.
If I were him, I think I would have been more careful with the gold.
This "gold" won't get by me!
How's this?
You planned that!
Oh, you inhuman bastards!
Unfortunately, she has a husband.
It is me.
It is me.
It is me.
It is me.
Don't be so glum.
You're scaring me.
I just feel uneasy.
You'll feel alright after a good sleep.
I want to get this money to my father... and get him to take me back as his son.
And you can show him his grandson.
I wonder how our son is.
Let's go get him from foster parents tomorrow.
Yes, and we'll live together happily, and find some new way to make a living.
And I'll work too.
Oh, please, make me feel warm.
Oh, damn!
Looks like I have to run.
That's the way!
And I fly into a check!
You got him!
How about it?
Can you get away now, Gengobe?
I'm done for!
Look, he's sleeping.
That's only natural, because it's almost three a.m. already.
They make me nervous!
I'm getting excited too.
Let's go, Kikuno.
Not here!
In there then?
Oh, you!
We'll see you all later.
Damn them all!
So that leaves us two.
Well, let's go to bed too.
Guess we may as well.
Who is it?
Inosuke?
"Several days later..."
"The place is now Yotsuya..."
Yes, I'm glad you granted my request.
A blessing from the gods.
Since then, I became a priest and have spent my time serving the gods.
But I never forget my lord's revenge.
Enya's old retainers loiter about here... but the most pitiful Is Soemon Funakura.
He didn't have the 100 ryo necessary to become one of the revengers, so I have done everything I could to gather it for him, but failed at every turn.
And now here you are offering that amount for my use.
It must have been difficult for you to raise.
Yes, we two worked hard to make it.
You did a very good job!
I forgive you and take you back as my son.
Thank you.
Listen, Koman, he forgave me!
Oh, I'm so happy.
I really thank you.
You must have endured a lot too.
Thank you.
Then do you approve of us too?
Of course.
Sentaro took a fine bride.
Thank you so very much.
Congratulations.
Is that my grandson?
Yes.
Have a good look at him.
What a lovely baby.
I must tell Soemon right away, and introduce you to him.
Please do.
I'll go see if he's home.
Is he staying here?
He's been staying in the cottage a few days.
He went to see someone today and isn't back.
I'll give him the money as soon as he returns.
You can meet him tomorrow.
He's been quite depressed lately.
This money will surely cheer him up.
You certainly did well to make this 100 ryo.
"Wanted for Five Murders.
Reward for Information."
Oh, big brother!
Oh, you are back.
How is the house?
Thanks for taking care of us.
Don't thank me, just pay the rent!
You're awful cold to your little sister!
Business is business.
You've got something interesting there.
How about a drink?
I've something to do first.
But get it warm and I'll be back later.
He's always like that.
That's a load off my shoulders, to get my father's forgiveness after ten years.
Let's celebrate!
But I was really worried he would ask how we got the money.
We could have told him anything.
But us together in peace is like a dream.
Look at his face...
Saké really tastes great tonight.
But that night in Fukagawa was scary!
But we got away!
I didn't think we would.
It was sad for the others.
Yes.
Kikuno died in place of me.
Don't talk like that.
You'll make the saké sour.
What would you do if Gengobe showed up?
He wouldn't come here.
He's a wanted man.
Oh, he may be out there watching us now.
Don't say things like that!
I feel creepy!
If he shows up here, I'll take him right to the authorities!
After all, he's a wanted murderer.
Are you really as brave as all that?
No, I'm really scared.
Why ruin a celebration with talk like that?
!
Good fortune has finally come our way.
But I'm just not used to happiness yet.
Our hard times did go on for a long time.
Won't you please.
Take good care of me?
Don't cry.
Let's cook,
and celebrate.
Go get some wood.
We didn't buy any.
Then rip off some paneling.
We should ask the landlord.
Silly!
The landlord Is your brother.
What's his is ours.
What's ours is ours.
Stop!
I think brother's come back.
Is it you, Brother?
Gengobe!
You two look settled in.
I'm happy for you.
Glad to see you well too...
Since we last met in Fukagawa,
I heard you had moved to this area so I came to visit.
And I brought you some saké as a gift.
Thank you.
Ah, come right on in.
You've got a nice place here.
Come right in.
Before there were all sorts of mistakes...
You must be angry, but we can explain it all.
Thanks for coming all this way to visit...
Open that saké.
Oh, no, we couldn't possibly drink it.
Remember that I am the samurai Gengobe.
I don't hold any grudge against Koman.
You mean you will forget everything?
Just as water dries as the days pass.
Don't worry.
I wish to continue being good friends as we always were.
What welcome words.
Come anytime at all.
So open my saké and let's drink to that.
As you say.
Relax and drink.
Oh, no, I insist you drink mine tonight.
I have some warmed just right.
Pour him a drink.
Please have a drink.
I accept your hospitality.
This reminds me of the night we first met in Fukagawa.
Koman, sing me a song, like that night.
What're they up to?
This brings back memories.
It was all just a dream.
That was a dream, and this is a dream.
The flower's red fades like your love, and... my sadness is like the eternal flow of water.
Please sing one more.
What'll it be?
Oh, Gengobe, there was one you always used to ask for, wasn't there, Gengobe, sir?
You remember, Gengobe, what was it, Gengobe?
Oh yes, it was "Chrysanthemum Dew."
Will you sing it for me, Koman?
"Victim Number Two"
This is the place.
You're sure?
Yes, there's no mistake.
He is definitely Gengobe Satsuma?
Right.
My reward?
You're a nuisance!
Nobody wanted your information anyway!
But the poster said he was wanted and promised a reward.
Put out your hand, you noisy nuisance!
Oh, thank you.
But this is only a tiny copper coin!
Things have gotten noisy out front.
Oh, it's the neighbors.
Is Sangoro at home?
Yes.
Just a minute.
Sangoro?
That is Gengobe, the Fukagawa murderer?
Yes, it is.
You go back in and tie him up, and bring him out here to me.
Not me.
You're the official here.
Go tie him up yourself.
If I could, I wouldn't ask you to do it.
You can do it easiest of us all.
That's not my job.
Please go on in.
What's happening here, Sangoro?
Are you Gengobe?
I am.
Did you commit those murders in Fukagawa?
Sir, I am a ronin, but still a warrior.
I do not kill women and children.
You have the wrong man.
But we have a witness.
A witness?
Where is he?
That man there.
Oh, no, sir, not me.
This is the first I've even heard about it.
So Sangoro is the witness against me?
Oh, no, not me.
I don't know anything.
Right.
We know nothing about it.
Is there any definite evidence to prove.
Who the murderer is?
Yes, we have very clear evidence.
Have you ever seen this bodkin before?
That bodkin!
This is one of a pair belonging to you.
This was at the scene of the murders.
Clear evidence.
Let us tie you up.
Wait!
You have the wrong man!
He's not the Fukagawa murderer.
What?
Who are you?
Hachiemon!
What are you doing here?
!
If that bodkin proves who the murderer is, then it is someone else.
It is not Gengobe.
You're protecting me?
Don't try protecting your master!
Move!
What man would protect such a disloyal master?
Who do you say did the murders?
It was me.
Do you have proof?
I do.
I have the mate to that bodkin.
This is certain evidence.
It is the mate.
But why did you kill them?
Koman and Sangoro cheated Gengobe.
So I killed their cohorts, but...
I regret that I didn't get them as well.
I have been trying to kill them ever since that time.
I came out of hiding when I heard that...
Gengobe was about to be caught in place of me.
Please take me, the real murderer.
Tie me up and take me to prison.
Your story holds water and you have evidence.
I arrest you for the Fukagawa murders.
Tie him up!
Please let me suffer the shame of arrest... by having my own master tie me up.
Me tie you up?
I will, but in my heart.
Don't waste your heart on prayers for me, but go join the others... as a true samurai instead.
If only you do that, I will be in heaven.
And so just forget that beastly woman... and don't let her make you waver, sir.
Do only that for me, sir.
Tie up the criminal, Gengobe!
Please tie me up, sir.
Forgive me.
I die happy.
Take him away!
Goodbye, my master.
And you two started all this!
Please forgive me.
Don't blame Koman.
Your anger is natural, but I did it for him.
We're not even human, please overlook us.
My servant's words moved me deeply.
Koman, I give you up from this moment on.
We thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
Lift your faces.
If you're sincere, drink the saké that I brought you.
Goodbye.
We're saved!
Quick, bring salt!
Out with the demons!
Let the good in!
That's a relief!
I thought any minute was going to be the end, but here we are.
I'm so weak that I can't stand up.
I thought we were done for too.
Let's celebrate!
That's cold.
Have some that's heated.
That's a good idea.
To our happiness!
"Victim Number Three"
What a mess that was!
Come on in!
Is it all ready?
Have a drink!
Things would have been bad without me.
I didn't know you were here.
You really saved our lives.
I saved your lives.
Have one more as our gratitude.
Gratitude?
One drink isn't enough.
But Brother...
You think I don't know you took 100 ryo from Gengobe?
I know the whole story.
You're awful.
We don't have that money now.
You can't fool me like you did him!
We know that.
But that money all went to our Lord for a special purpose.
Who's that?
I've never seen him, but his name is Soemon Funakura.
So you're Enya supporters?
That's interesting.
I'm a Kono retainer.
So that means we are enemies.
Oh, no, just my father used to work for Enya.
Don't speak of us as your enemies!
It's suddenly cold.
Koman, build up the fire.
Sorry I neglected it.
It has gotten cold!
That's the wall!
You'll pay for that!
Don't get so angry.
We forgot to buy wood, and started using this.
Stop joking and use what's under the floor.
Oh, is there some here?
Cheer up now.
Oh, it's all gone, but there's more here.
Cold saké is just fine.
Oh, look what I found here.
What's this?
It looks like a floor plan.
A carpenter of the Konos lived here.
A secret way into the alcove.
A trapdoor on the veranda.
This may be the Kono mansion floor plan!
If it is...
This is a real find!
I won't let you keep it!
Please give it back!
What'll you do with it?
Stop it!
Brother!
Maybe in this saké...
You gave me poisoned saké!
Why would we do that to you, Brother?
!
He got what was meant for us!
Then Gengobe!
Damn!
This is a scheme of the Enya family!
I'll pay you back for all this!
Then it's the end for us.
I'm sorry!
Get away!
No, stop it!
Please...
Please, stop!
Don't look!
Close your eyes!
This is terrible!
Koman, I've killed your brother, and now we're enemies!
There's nothing else left for me to do!
Goodbye, Koman!
Let me die!
If you're going to die, kill me first!
But if we die, what will happen to our baby?
Settle down!
We can die any time.
Take this floor plan to your father now.
We can die any time.
You're right.
I had forgotten this.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Wait a minute.
Take this just in case.
Right.
You clean up here.
Take care.
We'll never leave you alone again.
You've had lots of troubles too.
You were born under a sad star.
Namu Amida Butsu.
What a terrible fate.
"Gengobe, at that time..."
Gengobe...
Gengobe...
It's me, Gengobe.
So you didn't drink the saké I brought?
Is Sangoro here?
No, he's out.
Out?
You're not lying, are you?
It's true.
You're always full of tricks.
"HELL"
So you have a son?
I didn't notice earlier.
It's clear who his father is.
He looks just like Sangoro.
You really made a fool of me, with a son too, didn't you, Koman?
Oh no, I didn't make a fool of you.
Your love was all a planned trick.
Oh no, never that.
Then why, with a son and husband, did you promise to be my wife?
And even your tattoo pledge probably...
No.
That tattoo...
Fake too?
Let me see it.
"Precious Sangoro?"
Eternal proof of your treachery, here on your arm for all to see.
You cheated me at every turn!
Forgive me.
I can explain everything!
No explanations!
That tattoo is clear proof.
I see everything clearly now!
I'll kill you and Sangoro both!
A warrior, and I let a woman do this to me?
Please forgive me and let me live!
Then tell me where Sangoro is!
I don't know!
Tell me, or this is what you get!
Shut up!
The child is innocent!
Then tell me!
I don't know and wouldn't tell even if I did!
Stubborn woman, talk!
Your "Precious Sangoro!"
Is this the arm?
I'm ready to die!
kill me!
I won't blame you for it, but don't hurt my child!
Please don't take the life of my child!
You want pity for him?
Then pity him by killing him yourself.
Why did you think it's necessary to kill my innocent child?
!
A demon!
You're a demon!
A horrid demon!
It was you two who made me a demon!
Die, Koman!
"This world is a sea of blood."
Sengoro, someone's coming.
You have committed murder.
Hide in that coffin.
And don't come out until I tell you to.
I wanted to drink to our future together.
But in your present situation, that is no longer possible.
What a pitiful woman!
All you can do now is quietly go on your way to Buddhahood.
When I gave that 100 ryo for you,
I was willing to give up everything for you, no matter what others would say of me.
It was with that 100 ryo that I made the most definite decision of my life.
All that's left now is eternal,
All enveloping darkness.
Is there anything else where you are, Koman?
Is there true Godairiki in that world?
Won't you say something to me?
Answer me!
Who's there?
It's me, Tokuemon.
I have been waiting for you to return.
Please look at this, Soemon.
What's this?
My son Sentaro and his wife have come back, after many trials and tribulations.
My son killed his wife's brother... to get this floor plan of the Kono mansion.
Soemon, please meet my pitiful son... and give him a word of encouragement.
What do you mean, giving these to me?
It's too late now.
What?
Hachiemon got me 100 ryo which I used to ransom a geisha.
Then she cheated me and,
I killed many in hate.
I know I was a fool, but...
I am the man who committed the 5 Fukagawa murders.
What?
But...
Gengobe is the name I have been using.
Hachiemon was arrested in place of me.
I no longer have the right or the desire... to be counted among the faithful retainers.
I only regret that I let that rascal...
Sangoro get away alive.
Sangoro?
That is my son Sentaro's childhood name.
And I've heard his wife was a geisha.
Does that mean?
This is my cloth, so this 100 ryo!
Gengobe is Soemon?
!
Sengoro!
Your anger is only natural, but my son left home very young and had never seen your face.
He knew you as Gengobe.
Please forgive my pitiful son.
We can forgive, but Koman's life is gone.
Something happened to Koman?
Look!
This is her head.
I killed both Koman and her son too.
Sentaro!
Sangoro!
Goodbye, sir!
I killed Koman's brother.
I must die.
My wife and son are dead.
I have no desire to live without them.
Wait!
Don't be hasty, Sentaro!
I don't want to hear or see any more.
Even if there is sunlight, this maggot can abide only in deepest darkness.
I have lived a useless life.
Koman!
Soemon!
Namu Amida Butsu...
"Several months later..."
"the Enya retainers carried out their vendetta."

Open the gate!
Open it!
Oboshi!
Sir!
Koman, let me in.
It's Gengobe.
Koman, open up!
Koman, what's wrong?
Get a hold of yourself!
You scared me.
I almost pushed this big pin right... through my ear.
Was it a dream?
A dream?
You were groaning about something.
What was it about?
It was a very strange dream.
You were lying... over there with your... face on the floor.
Just a dream!
You're mean.
What happened to me?
It was nothing.
I've forgotten it already.
You're awfully mean.
Come on, tell me.
Don't worry, maybe it wasn't you at all.
So you were with some other girl, weren't you?
Dreams are the mirror of the true heart!
Tell me just who she was, Gengobe!
Don't talk foolishly.
You are the only girl I care for, anywhere.
Is that really true?
I don't lie to you.
What is this tattoo?
"Godairiki"
"Godairiki is a pledge of eternal love. "
It makes me blush to say it, but it is a Godairiki love pledge tattoo.
An oath to never be touched by another man.
For whom?
You're cruel to ask.
It is for you.
Look closely.
Who else would it be?
For me?
That is a lie.
You're so cruel.
It hurts, so this must not be a dream.
Even if it's a dream,
I want to live for love alone.
Gengobe, please make me your wife.
Koman.
Who is it?
It's Hachiemon.
I've come home.
You're early.
I came fast with good news.
How is everyone at home?
Very well.
But, sir,
What has happened here?
I sold everything to pay my debts.
Not the hanging scroll by Eitoku!
Yes, that too.
But it was an heirloom.
I know.
But, that still wasn't enough.
The landlord comes day and night, demanding more rent.
I can't even sleep.
Are you in your right mind, sir?
That doesn't matter.
You have no right to question me.
Hachiemon.
Have you ever heard the proverb, "everything in nothing?"
No, I haven't.
It means that all is in a lack of everything.
It's full of meaning.
Do you mean to say that the vixen in there...
Is what you call something in nothing?
What do you mean calling me a vixen?
!
I've become his wife this very day.
What?
As I'm Gengobe's wife you mustn't talk to me like that!
This is a crazed vixen.
You shut up and get out of here!
Gengobe, say something!
Gengobe!
Oh, how cruel.
So your promise was a lie?
Koman, I think you should go for now.
Oh, you are against me now too...
See now?
Get out!
I won't forget this!
Don't push me so much!
And don't come back!
Gengobe, you have made me very sad today.
Don't look so glum.
With Koman here, even this empty house is like a garden, but your glum face makes me nervous.
Are you serious, sir?
What if I am?
How cruel!
At first I believed you dedicated to the vendetta, but you spend your money on prostitutes,
while your man Tokuemon has set himself up as priest of Aizome Temple... in Yotsuya, and is trying to gather the money you lost... in order to get you back in good with Oboshi,
so you can be part of the revenge.
And then when you some forty men take your own lives after it's done,
I plan to do the same.
Here I come back and find you with that... famous geisha Koman of Nakacho, for whom... you have sold all your household goods.
You can't be sane!
Do you still call yourself a samurai?
Is this the end of Soemon Funakura, the retainer of the Enya family?
You are probably angry with me for saying this, but please give Koman up.
I beg of you!
Are you finished?
You're a good actor!
A most amusing show!
What?
!
I have my reasons.
Don't worry yourself.
You mean this is to fool the enemies?
Of course!
If that's true, I'm very happy.
Please forgive my rudeness.
Now you sound like Soemon of the Enya family again.
Don't talk so loud.
The walls have ears!
I am the poor samurai Gengobe Satsuma to the outside world right now.
Yes, Gengobe, sir, and I have good news.
Look at this.
100 ryo?
!
The men at home all got together to thank you for past favors.
Some sold fields and others borrowed to make this 100 ryo for you.
With this you must pay the government money you lost... and become one with Oboshi and the others as an honorable samurai once more.
Please accept this for that purpose.
Is that the way it is?
Thank you so much.
I'm out of breath!
What is it now?
!
I forgot something very important.
Oh, here it is!
I'm so careless!
Gengobe!
Koman doesn't want to go back to Nakamachi.
I have to talk to Hachiemon just now.
Yes, I understand.
I have to go as I have a customer.
A geisha has to be nice even if she doesn't like her customer.
Sorry I bothered you.
100 ryo!
I had given up on ever getting so much together again.
You did a good job.
Thanks again.
It makes me happy just to see you so happy.
Please go early tomorrow morning and get your name... on the list with Oboshi and the others.
Yes, I'll do just that.
This cloth is perfect for wrapping the money.
I can't thank you enough.
"An hour later... "
Pardon my intrusion.
Who is it?
Sangoro of Sasanoya.
I've important business with you, sir.
Sorry to bother you so late.
Thanks for your patronage, Gengobe.
What is it?
Koman asked me to give you this letter.
Please read it and go see her.
You're lucky to have a woman so in love with you.
She does seem to have something important to talk to me about.
Not tonight, sir.
Have you forgotten what you just said?
He cannot possibly go tonight.
So just get off with the other rats.
Hachiemon is right.
I'll stay home tonight.
Now you are talking like yourself, sir.
If you let things go, you may get yourself killed for it.
Sir, you are too young to know real love.
Are you going to let poor Koman die?
Then you'll find me your enemy and have a fight on your hands.
All joking aside, sir, didn't you know that... a Kono samurai came to pay Koman's debts?
I heard she had such a customer, but didn't... know he was going to pay and take her away.
Why didn't she tell me?
She was here twice.
Oh, I see what it was.
She came here to try to find some way to tell you, but was too shy to come out and say it.
After all a geisha is for buying and selling.
She kept quiet so as not to cause you undue worry.
I'm sure.
As soon as she got home from here, she began crying and throwing things.
Before long that Kono samurai will be there.
I shudder to think of what she must be going through now.
Poor girl.
Please go and console her a little now, sir.
Sir, you must be strong against... the tricks of that vixen.
You're right.
But why is Koman acting that way just now?
Then, sir, is it all right to go back... and tell Koman that Gengobe is cold and... cruel and that she should forget him?
That's just what we want you to tell her.
If you do that, sir, you will never see Koman again, and won't... be welcome at the shop.
So I have to go make the girl cry, do I?
Wait, Sangoro!
What?
You're impatient.
I'll go with you.
That's the way!
Have you changed your mind so soon, sir?
Oh, please hear me, and stay here tonight!
You shut up and watch the house for me.
No, I won't.
Are you trying to make your master angry?
No, not me!
Then stay!
But I don't have anything to give the landlord... if he comes for the rent.
There're enough umbrellas for that.
No, there aren't.
Pay him with this hair pin.
It was made by Goto.
But, sir, must you?
Let's go!
Follow me.
Oh, dear!
He must really be in love with that vixen!
What shall I do?
!
And with all his debts too.
Even made by Goto, will one of a pair satisfy the landlord?
Oh, the 100 ryo!
Master!
"A tea house in Fukagawa. "
- No, I won't give in!
- Now, don't get excited.
After all I've given her, why does Koman reject Banemon?
!
Because I don't like you.
Don't like me?
Listen, Koman.
You're my sister, but I won't let you be so selfish!
I don't like him and I won't go with him!
I'm the one that signed for the loan, so don't be rough with her or I'll be in trouble.
Banemon promises to let you live as you like, so if you say yes... you will save you and me both from a lot of worry and trouble.
And me as a samurai!
She just won't listen to anything I say.
Have another drink and be calm.
Drink?
A good idea!
Pour for me!
Don't be so angry.
Koman must have some reason for refusing.
Torazo, you must know.
Tell me her reason!
It is nothing unusual.
It is just that Koman has a lover.
Is he a samurai or a townsman?
He is a no-good ronin named Gengobe.
I don't know why she likes him.
He is a beggar!
But he was originally a man of position, even so he doesn't mind that I'm a geisha.
He still wants me.
But he was already a penniless beggar before he fell for you.
That's the way they talk.
I feel sick.
I feel even worse.
If I only had money.
Your Gengobe could never get together 100 ryo, no matter how he tried, but I have it right here to pay right now.
Think which of us can take care of you best.
He is right.
The 100 ryo is most important.
He is a very good offer, Koman.
Right!
Forget that man and take Banemon.
Be my wife!
No, I won't!
Look at this!
It's the Godairiki pledge to never let another man touch me.
My heart is locked against any man except Gengobe.
You'll not open it with your gold key!
I am Samurai Gengobe's wife.
So you refuse me?
Yes, with all my heart.
And this is all Gengobe's fault.
Damn!
I'll kill him!
Careful, Gengobe may be listening.
Then tell him to get 100 ryo!
Where'd he get it?
!
He'd never even get together a few shu!
He'd run off with his tail between his legs.
Just a minute!
I am that Gengobe Satsuma!
Oh, Gengobe, I'm glad you are here.
So this is.
I told you not to gossip!
We heard all you said!
Who do you think you are calling a beggar?
!
Watch your tongues!
But I didn't.
You won't get off so easy as that!
What'll we do with them, sir?
You people.
Please forgive us.
I beg of you!
I, Gengobe, will now pay Koman's debts.
100 ryo in pure gold!
That's right.
And I receive Koman in return.
How's that?
!
Who said Gengobe couldn't get together even a few shu?
!
Don't make me laugh!
I've served him for some time and know... that he always has 100 ryo in his pocket.
Come on, Koman!
Then I will.
I'm so happy, Gengobe!
What have you done, sir?
!
That 100 ryo was gathered so you could participate in the vendetta.
Where're you going, sir?
I mustn't be seen here.
I'm going.
But, sir, doesn't it make you angry... to hear them talking about you like that?
It makes me mad.
Let's go in there!
Listen, Gengobe is here!
Oh, Gengobe, I'm glad you are here.
So this is.
I told you not to gossip!
We heard all you said!
Who do you think you are calling this man a beggar?
!
Don't make me laugh!
Who said Gengobe couldn't get together even a few shus?
He always has 100 ryo or so in his pocket.
Sangoro, don't talk so big.
As you said, sir, you can do as you please with this woman.
I'm a beggar as you say and have no right to stand in your way... whatever you do with her.
What are you saying?
Where does that leave Koman and me?
Gengobe, thanks for taking care of me and my sister.
You have given us a very good life all this time.
Tramping in like this,
I thought you'd have 100 ryo.
This is a real joke!
Chohachi, that goes without saying.
He may have been a fine samurai before, but... now he's nothing compared to me, Banemon of the Konos.
Oh, please, sir.
Say something back to him!
No, he's right.
Leave him alone.
So, ladies' man, money and power has done it.
Pardon me.
Do you really mean I must be his wife?
Be happy!
Goodbye!
What're you doing?
How can I live after... the man I love has abandoned me?
There's nothing for her to do but die.
Sir, you have disappointed us!
Go ahead and die!
I'd be much obliged to Gengobe if he let you.
Die if you like!
Koman, wouldn't you rather be mine?
How horrible!
Let me go!
Don't be stupid!
Oh, Gengobe, you're so very cruel!
Don't force me to live in shame!
I live in the same shame.
Goodbye!
Farewell, until we meet in that world.
Wait!
Do you really feel that strongly?
Yes.
I, Gengobe, hereby pay Koman's ransom debts.
But that's 100 ryo.
Right!
100 ryo!
Here is the 100 ryo, take it, and I receive Koman in return!
It's 100 ryo in pure gold!
You can't judge a man by the way he looks!
Just look at this!
This is the Gengobe I, Sangoro, call my lord and master!
I'm a ronin, but still a samurai.
I'm happy to meet you Banemon!
What's this?
!
But first of all, no one has any objections to my ransoming Koman with this 100 ryo?
None at all.
Wait!
I object!
What are you doing here?
I was afraid this is what you would do.
And after I warned and scolded you so.
Water spilled from a bowl doesn't return.
But that 100 ryo was gathered by those... back home for you to make a come back.
Shut up!
You don't know my heart!
Let's get better acquainted, Banemon!
I would like to, but I have a stomach-ache.
Wait, you samurai!
What a dull samurai!
Now all the tears are over, I mean to make Koman my wife.
Come with me, Koman.
Oh, Gengobe, you just make me so happy...
Oh, sir.
Please wait a moment.
What do you mean, wait?
It is true that you paid Koman's ransom, but unfortunately, she has a husband.
Koman has a husband?
!
Right, and unless she breaks with him.
Is this true, Koman?
Answer me!
Who is the man?
!
Well, he...
Sangoro, who is Koman's husband?
It is me.
What?
You?
Yes, I'm her husband, and Koman is my wife.
I tried to find a patron for her.
You've been a good patron.
So the two of you have worked together... to lead me into this deep situation?
You bastards!
Well, it isn't easy to sit by and... watch your own wife with another man.
And, Koman, did you fool me too?
I know you are mad, but there were deep reasons.
Please believe my heart.
Shut up, you stupid woman!
Shut up!
It was my mistake to be bewitched by her, but you are really terrible to try... to rob a man of his property this way!
It's money, not duty that keeps you alive!
You inhuman bastard!
Stop, Master, your life is too important!
Don't try to stop me!
Endure this.
Please don't do it!
Come cut us down if you want to, but remember that...
Koman is my legal wife, not yours.
Cut away if you like, it's your loss!
You and your beastly insults.
It's my sin to have been born a woman.
Please forgive me, and kill me now.
You filthy thing!
Get away from me!
Quiet!
You are inhuman!
But, Master, you must save yourself from all this.
Think of yourself!
Don't kill them.
Let's go home.
Oh, Sangoro, you are too cruel.
Oh, my poor heart.
Your woman's heart may find it hard, but...
I have to get 100 ryo no matter what to get... my father to forgive me and take me back.
Since he disowned me ten years ago.
I was worried, but it all came out alright.
Here is your 100 ryo.
Thanks.
You all put on a real good show.
There'll be some for the rest of us?
Don't worry.
Go on and warm up some saké.
OK.
I'll be home waiting for you.
"Later the same night... "
Koman, you are the only one I love.
Is that the truth?
I wouldn't lie...
What is this tattoo?
It is embarrassing to say, but... it is a pledge to never let another man touch me.
A pledge of love.
Love for whom?
Oh, you're cruel.
It is you.
Who else would it be?
We'll change it to "Precious Sangoro. "
It stings!
A sly rewrite!
But maybe she really felt the original.
Stupid!
She loves only "precious" me!
You're awful!
Look at that!
And look at this!
What'll you do now?
But Gengobe must be awful angry.
Did you fall for him a little after all?
Don't be silly!
A geisha lives a life of lies.
But they say truth Is born from lies.
Oh, Kikuno, you too?
You did put it on pretty strong.
How can I live, abandoned by my love?
And Gengobe overdid the lover role too.
If I were him, I think I would have been more careful with the gold.
This "gold" won't get by me!
How's this?
You planned that!
Oh, you inhuman bastards!
Unfortunately, she has a husband.
It is me.
It is me.
It is me.
It is me.
Don't be so glum.
You're scaring me.
I just feel uneasy.
You'll feel alright after a good sleep.
I want to get this money to my father... and get him to take me back as his son.
And you can show him his grandson.
I wonder how our son is.
Let's go get him from foster parents tomorrow.
Yes, and we'll live together happily, and find some new way to make a living.
And I'll work too.
Oh, please, make me feel warm.
Oh, damn!
Looks like I have to run.
That's the way!
And I fly into a check!
You got him!
How about it?
Can you get away now, Gengobe?
I'm done for!
Look, he's sleeping.
That's only natural, because it's almost three a. m. already.
They make me nervous!
I'm getting excited too.
Let's go, Kikuno.
Not here!
In there then?
Oh, you!
We'll see you all later.
Damn them all!
So that leaves us two.
Well, let's go to bed too.
Guess we may as well.
Who is it?
Inosuke?
"Several days later... "
"The place is now Yotsuya... "
Yes, I'm glad you granted my request.
A blessing from the gods.
Since then, I became a priest and have spent my time serving the gods.
But I never forget my lord's revenge.
Enya's old retainers loiter about here... but the most pitiful Is Soemon Funakura.
He didn't have the 100 ryo necessary to become one of the revengers, so I have done everything I could to gather it for him, but failed at every turn.
And now here you are offering that amount for my use.
It must have been difficult for you to raise.
Yes, we two worked hard to make it.
You did a very good job!
I forgive you and take you back as my son.
Thank you.
Listen, Koman, he forgave me!
Oh, I'm so happy.
I really thank you.
You must have endured a lot too.
Thank you.
Then do you approve of us too?
Of course.
Sentaro took a fine bride.
Thank you so very much.
Congratulations.
Is that my grandson?
Yes.
Have a good look at him.
What a lovely baby.
I must tell Soemon right away, and introduce you to him.
Please do.
I'll go see if he's home.
Is he staying here?
He's been staying in the cottage a few days.
He went to see someone today and isn't back.
I'll give him the money as soon as he returns.
You can meet him tomorrow.
He's been quite depressed lately.
This money will surely cheer him up.
You certainly did well to make this 100 ryo.
"Wanted for Five Murders.
Reward for Information. "
Oh, big brother!
Oh, you are back.
How is the house?
Thanks for taking care of us.
Don't thank me, just pay the rent!
You're awful cold to your little sister!
Business is business.
You've got something interesting there.
How about a drink?
I've something to do first.
But get it warm and I'll be back later.
He's always like that.
That's a load off my shoulders, to get my father's forgiveness after ten years.
Let's celebrate!
But I was really worried he would ask how we got the money.
We could have told him anything.
But us together in peace is like a dream.
Look at his face...
Saké really tastes great tonight.
But that night in Fukagawa was scary!
But we got away!
I didn't think we would.
It was sad for the others.
Yes.
Kikuno died in place of me.
Don't talk like that.
You'll make the saké sour.
What would you do if Gengobe showed up?
He wouldn't come here.
He's a wanted man.
Oh, he may be out there watching us now.
Don't say things like that!
I feel creepy!
If he shows up here, I'll take him right to the authorities!
After all, he's a wanted murderer.
Are you really as brave as all that?
No, I'm really scared.
Why ruin a celebration with talk like that?
!
Good fortune has finally come our way.
But I'm just not used to happiness yet.
Our hard times did go on for a long time.
Won't you please.
Take good care of me?
Don't cry.
Let's cook,
and celebrate.
Go get some wood.
We didn't buy any.
Then rip off some paneling.
We should ask the landlord.
Silly!
The landlord Is your brother.
What's his is ours.
What's ours is ours.
Stop!
I think brother's come back.
Is it you, Brother?
Gengobe!
You two look settled in.
I'm happy for you.
Glad to see you well too...
Since we last met in Fukagawa,
I heard you had moved to this area so I came to visit.
And I brought you some saké as a gift.
Thank you.
Ah, come right on in.
You've got a nice place here.
Come right in.
Before there were all sorts of mistakes...
You must be angry, but we can explain it all.
Thanks for coming all this way to visit...
Open that saké.
Oh, no, we couldn't possibly drink it.
Remember that I am the samurai Gengobe.
I don't hold any grudge against Koman.
You mean you will forget everything?
Just as water dries as the days pass.
Don't worry.
I wish to continue being good friends as we always were.
What welcome words.
Come anytime at all.
So open my saké and let's drink to that.
As you say.
Relax and drink.
Oh, no, I insist you drink mine tonight.
I have some warmed just right.
Pour him a drink.
Please have a drink.
I accept your hospitality.
This reminds me of the night we first met in Fukagawa.
Koman, sing me a song, like that night.
What're they up to?
This brings back memories.
It was all just a dream.
That was a dream, and this is a dream.
The flower's red fades like your love, and... my sadness is like the eternal flow of water.
Please sing one more.
What'll it be?
Oh, Gengobe, there was one you always used to ask for, wasn't there, Gengobe, sir?
You remember, Gengobe, what was it, Gengobe?
Oh yes, it was "Chrysanthemum Dew. "
Will you sing it for me, Koman?
"Victim Number Two"
This is the place.
You're sure?
Yes, there's no mistake.
He is definitely Gengobe Satsuma?
Right.
My reward?
You're a nuisance!
Nobody wanted your information anyway!
But the poster said he was wanted and promised a reward.
Put out your hand, you noisy nuisance!
Oh, thank you.
But this is only a tiny copper coin!
Things have gotten noisy out front.
Oh, it's the neighbors.
Is Sangoro at home?
Yes.
Just a minute.
Sangoro?
That is Gengobe, the Fukagawa murderer?
Yes, it is.
You go back in and tie him up, and bring him out here to me.
Not me.
You're the official here.
Go tie him up yourself.
If I could, I wouldn't ask you to do it.
You can do it easiest of us all.
That's not my job.
Please go on in.
What's happening here, Sangoro?
Are you Gengobe?
I am.
Did you commit those murders in Fukagawa?
Sir, I am a ronin, but still a warrior.
I do not kill women and children.
You have the wrong man.
But we have a witness.
A witness?
Where is he?
That man there.
Oh, no, sir, not me.
This is the first I've even heard about it.
So Sangoro is the witness against me?
Oh, no, not me.
I don't know anything.
Right.
We know nothing about it.
Is there any definite evidence to prove.
Who the murderer is?
Yes, we have very clear evidence.
Have you ever seen this bodkin before?
That bodkin!
This is one of a pair belonging to you.
This was at the scene of the murders.
Clear evidence.
Let us tie you up.
Wait!
You have the wrong man!
He's not the Fukagawa murderer.
What?
Who are you?
Hachiemon!
What are you doing here?
!
If that bodkin proves who the murderer is, then it is someone else.
It is not Gengobe.
You're protecting me?
Don't try protecting your master!
Move!
What man would protect such a disloyal master?
Who do you say did the murders?
It was me.
Do you have proof?
I do.
I have the mate to that bodkin.
This is certain evidence.
It is the mate.
But why did you kill them?
Koman and Sangoro cheated Gengobe.
So I killed their cohorts, but...
I regret that I didn't get them as well.
I have been trying to kill them ever since that time.
I came out of hiding when I heard that...
Gengobe was about to be caught in place of me.
Please take me, the real murderer.
Tie me up and take me to prison.
Your story holds water and you have evidence.
I arrest you for the Fukagawa murders.
Tie him up!
Please let me suffer the shame of arrest... by having my own master tie me up.
Me tie you up?
I will, but in my heart.
Don't waste your heart on prayers for me, but go join the others... as a true samurai instead.
If only you do that, I will be in heaven.
And so just forget that beastly woman... and don't let her make you waver, sir.
Do only that for me, sir.
Tie up the criminal, Gengobe!
Please tie me up, sir.
Forgive me.
I die happy.
Take him away!
Goodbye, my master.
And you two started all this!
Please forgive me.
Don't blame Koman.
Your anger is natural, but I did it for him.
We're not even human, please overlook us.
My servant's words moved me deeply.
Koman, I give you up from this moment on.
We thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
Lift your faces.
If you're sincere, drink the saké that I brought you.
Goodbye.
We're saved!
Quick, bring salt!
Out with the demons!
Let the good in!
That's a relief!
I thought any minute was going to be the end, but here we are.
I'm so weak that I can't stand up.
I thought we were done for too.
Let's celebrate!
That's cold.
Have some that's heated.
That's a good idea.
To our happiness!
"Victim Number Three"
What a mess that was!
Come on in!
At it all ready?
Have a drink!
Thing would have been bad without me.
I didn't know you were here.
You really saved our lives.
I saved you lives.
Have one more as our gratitude.
Gratitude?
One drink isn't enough.
But Brother...
You think I don't know you took 100 ryo from Gengobe?
I know the whole story.
You're awful.
We don't have that money now.
You can't fool me like you did him!
We know that.
But that money all went to our Lord for a special purpose.
Who's that?
I've never seen him, but his name is Soemon Funakura.
So you're Enya supporters?
That's interesting.
I'm a Kono retainer.
So that means we are enemies.
Oh, no, just my father used to work for Enya.
Don't speak of us as your enemies!
It's suddenly cold.
Koman, build up the fire.
Sorry I neglected it.
It has gotten cold!
That's the wall!
You'll pay for that!
Don't get so angry.
We forgot to buy wood, and started using this.
Stop joking and use what's under the floor.
Oh, is there some here?
Cheer up now.
Oh, it's All gone, but there's more here.
Cold saké is just fine.
Oh, look what I found here.
What's this?
It looks like a floor plan.
A carpenter of the Konos lived here.
A secret way into the alcove.
A trapdoor on the veranda.
This may be the Kono mansion floor plan!
If it is...
This is a real find!
I won't let you keep it!
Please give it back!
What'll you do with it?
Stop it!
Brother!
Maybe in this saké...
You gave me poisoned saké!
Why would we do that to you, Brother?
!
He got what was meant for us!
Then Gengobe!
Damn!
This is a scheme of the Enya family!
I'll pay you back for all this!
Then it's the end for us.
I'm sorry!
Get away!
No, stop it!
Please...
Please, stop!
Don't look!
Close your eyes!
This is terrible!
Koman, I've killed your brother, and now we're enemies!
There's nothing else left for me to do!
Goodbye, Koman!
Let me die!
If you're going to die, kill me first!
But if we die, what will happen to our baby?
Settle down!
We can die any time.
Take this floor plan to your father now.
We can die any time.
You're right.
I had forgotten this.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Wait a minute.
Take this just in case.
Right.
You clean up here.
Take care.
We'll never leave you alone again.
You've had lots of troubles too.
You were born under a sad star.
Namu Amida Butsu.
What a terrible fate.
"Gengobe, at that time... "
Gengobe...
Gengobe...
It's me, Gengobe.
So you didn't drink the saké I brought?
Is Sangoro here?
No, he's out.
Out?
You're not lying, are you?
It's true.
You're always full of tricks.
"HELL"
So you have a son?
I didn't notice earlier.
It's clear who his father is.
He looks just like Sangoro.
You really made a fool of me, with a son too, didn't you, Koman?
Oh no, I didn't make a fool of you.
Your love was all a planned trick.
Oh no, never that.
Then why, with a son and husband, did you promise to be my wife?
And even your tattoo pledge probably...
No.
That tattoo...
Fake too?
Let me see it.
"Precious Sangoro?"
eternal proof of your treachery, here on your arm for All to see.
You cheated me at every turn!
Forgive me.
I can explain everything!
No explanations!
That tattoo is clear proof.
I see everything clearly now!
I'll kill you and Sangoro both!
A warrior, and I let a woman do this to me?
Please forgive me and let me live!
Then tell me where Sangoro is!
I don't know!
Tell, or this is what you get!
Shut up!
The child is innocent!
Then tell me!
I don't know and wouldn't tell even if I did!
Stubborn woman, talk!
Your "Precious Sangoro! "
Is this the arm?
I'm ready to die!
kill me!
I won't blame you for it, but don't hurt my child!
Please don't take the life of my child!
You want pity for him?
Then pity him by killing him yourself.
Why did you think it's necessary to kill my innocent child?
!
A demon!
You're a demon!
A horrid demon!
It was you two who made me a demon!
Die, Koman!
"This world is a sea of blood. "
Sengoro, someone's coming.
You have committed murder.
Hide in that coffin.
And don't come out until I tell you to.
I wanted to drink to our future together.
But in your present situation, that is no longer possible.
What a pitiful woman!
All you can do now is quietly go on your way to Buddhahood.
When I gave that 100 ryo for you,
I was willing to give up everything for you, no matter what others would say of me.
It was with that 100 ryo that I made the most definite decision of my life.
All that's left now is eternal,
All enveloping darkness.
Is there anything else where you are, Koman?
Is there true Godairiki in that world?
Won't you say something to me?
Answer me!
Who's there?
It's me, Tokuemon.
I have been waiting for you to return.
Please look at this, Soemon.
What's this?
My son Sentaro and his wife have come back, after many trials and tribulations.
My son killed his wife's brother... to get this floor plan of the Kono mansion.
Soemon, please meet my pitiful son... and give him a word of encouragement.
What do you mean, giving these to me?
It's too late now.
What?
Hachiemon got me 100 ryo which I used to ransom a geisha.
Then she cheated me and,
I killed many in hate.
I know I was a fool, but...
I am the man who committed the 5 Fukagawa murders.
What?
But...
Gengobe is the name I have been using.
Hachiemon was arrested in place of me.
I no longer have the right or the desire... to be counted among the faithful retainers.
I only regret that I let that rascal...
Sangoro get away alive.
Sangoro?
That is my son Sentaro's childhood name.
And I've heard his wife was a geisha.
Does that mean?
This is my cloth, so this 100 ryo!
Gengobe is Soemon?
!
Sengoro!
Your anger is only natural, but my son left home very young and had never seen your face.
He knew you as Gengobe.
Please forgive my pitiful son.
We can forgive, but Koman's life is gone.
Something happened to Koman?
Look!
This is her head.
I killed both Koman and her son too.
Sentaro!
Sangoro!
Goodbye, sir!
I killed Koman's brother.
I must die.
My wife and son are dead.
I have no desire to live without them.
Wait!
Don't be hasty, Sentaro!
I don't want to hear or see any more.
Even if there is sunlight, this maggot can abide only in deepest darkness.
I have lived a useless life.
Koman!
Soemon!
Namu Amida Butsu...
"several months later... "
"the Enya retainers carried out their vendetta. "
"But Soemon Funakura was not among them. "

Open the gate!
Open it!
Oboshi!
Sir!
Koman, let me in.
It's Gengobe.
Koman, open up!
Koman, what's wrong?
Get a hold of yourself!
You scared me.
I almost pushed this big pin right... through my ear.
Was it a dream?
A dream?
You were groaning about something.
What was it about?
It was a very strange dream.
You were lying... over there with your... face on the floor.
Just a dream!
You're mean.
What happened to me?
It was nothing.
I've forgotten it already.
You're awfully mean.
Come on, tell me.
Don't worry, maybe it wasn't you at all.
So you were with some other girl, weren't you?
Dreams are the mirror of the true heart!
Tell me just who she was, Gengobe!
Don't talk foolishly.
You are the only girl I care for, anywhere.
Is that really true?
I don't lie to you.
What is this tattoo?
"Godairiki"
"Godairiki is a pledge of eternal love. "
It makes me blush to say it, but it is a Godairiki love pledge tattoo.
An oath to never be touched by another man.
For whom?
You're cruel to ask.
It is for you.
Look closely.
Who else would it be?
For me?
That is a lie.
You're so cruel.
It hurts, so this must not be a dream.
Even if it's a dream,
I want to live for love alone.
Gengobe, please make me your wife.
Koman.
Who is it?
It's Hachiemon.
I've come home.
You're early.
I came fast with good news.
How is everyone at home?
Very well.
But, sir,
What has happened here?
I sold everything to pay my debts.
Not the hanging scroll by Eitoku!
Yes, that too.
But it was an heirloom.
I know.
But, that still wasn't enough.
The landlord comes day and night, demanding more rent.
I can't even sleep.
Are you in your right mind, sir?
That doesn't matter.
You have no right to question me.
Hachiemon.
Have you ever heard the proverb, "everything in nothing?"
No, I haven't.
It means that all is in a lack of everything.
It's full of meaning.
Do you mean to say that the vixen in there...
Is what you call something in nothing?
What do you mean calling me a vixen?
!
I've become his wife this very day.
What?
As I'm Gengobe's wife you mustn't talk to me like that!
This is a crazed vixen.
You shut up and get out of here!
Gengobe, say something!
Gengobe!
Oh, how cruel.
So your promise was a lie?
Koman, I think you should go for now.
Oh, you are against me now too...
See now?
Get out!
I won't forget this!
Don't push me so much!
And don't come back!
Gengobe, you have made me very sad today.
Don't look so glum.
With Koman here, even this empty house is like a garden, but your glum face makes me nervous.
Are you serious, sir?
What if I am?
How cruel!
At first I believed you dedicated to the vendetta, but you spend your money on prostitutes,
while your man Tokuemon has set himself up as priest of Aizome Temple... in Yotsuya, and is trying to gather the money you lost... in order to get you back in good with Oboshi,
so you can be part of the revenge.
And then when you some forty men take your own lives after it's done,
I plan to do the same.
Here I come back and find you with that... famous geisha Koman of Nakacho, for whom... you have sold all your household goods.
You can't be sane!
Do you still call yourself a samurai?
Is this the end of Soemon Funakura, the retainer of the Enya family?
You are probably angry with me for saying this, but please give Koman up.
I beg of you!
Are you finished?
You're a good actor!
A most amusing show!
What?
!
I have my reasons.
Don't worry yourself.
You mean this is to fool the enemies?
Of course!
If that's true, I'm very happy.
Please forgive my rudeness.
Now you sound like Soemon of the Enya family again.
Don't talk so loud.
The walls have ears!
I am the poor samurai Gengobe Satsuma to the outside world right now.
Yes, Gengobe, sir, and I have good news.
Look at this.
100 ryo?
!
The men at home all got together to thank you for past favors.
Some sold fields and others borrowed to make this 100 ryo for you.
With this you must pay the government money you lost... and become one with Oboshi and the others as an honorable samurai once more.
Please accept this for that purpose.
Is that the way it is?
Thank you so much.
I'm out of breath!
What is it now?
!
I forgot something very important.
Oh, here it is!
I'm so careless!
Gengobe!
Koman doesn't want to go back to Nakamachi.
I have to talk to Hachiemon just now.
Yes, I understand.
I have to go as I have a customer.
A geisha has to be nice even if she doesn't like her customer.
Sorry I bothered you.
100 ryo!
I had given up on ever getting so much together again.
You did a good job.
Thanks again.
It makes me happy just to see you so happy.
Please go early tomorrow morning and get your name... on the list with Oboshi and the others.
Yes, I'll do just that.
This cloth is perfect for wrapping the money.
I can't thank you enough.
"An hour later... "
Pardon my intrusion.
Who is it?
Sangoro of Sasanoya.
I've important business with you, sir.
Sorry to bother you so late.
Thanks for your patronage, Gengobe.
What is it?
Koman asked me to give you this letter.
Please read it and go see her.
You're lucky to have a woman so in love with you.
She does seem to have something important to talk to me about.
Not tonight, sir.
Have you forgotten what you just said?
He cannot possibly go tonight.
So just get off with the other rats.
Hachiemon is right.
I'll stay home tonight.
Now you are talking like yourself, sir.
If you let things go, you may get yourself killed for it.
Sir, you are too young to know real love.
Are you going to let poor Koman die?
Then you'll find me your enemy and have a fight on your hands.
All joking aside, sir, didn't you know that... a Kono samurai came to pay Koman's debts?
I heard she had such a customer, but didn't... know he was going to pay and take her away.
Why didn't she tell me?
She was here twice.
Oh, I see what it was.
She came here to try to find some way to tell you, but was too shy to come out and say it.
After all a geisha is for buying and selling.
She kept quiet so as not to cause you undue worry.
I'm sure.
As soon as she got home from here, she began crying and throwing things.
Before long that Kono samurai will be there.
I shudder to think of what she must be going through now.
Poor girl.
Please go and console her a little now, sir.
Sir, you must be strong against... the tricks of that vixen.
You're right.
But why is Koman acting that way just now?
Then, sir, is it all right to go back... and tell Koman that Gengobe is cold and... cruel and that she should forget him?
That's just what we want you to tell her.
If you do that, sir, you will never see Koman again, and won't... be welcome at the shop.
So I have to go make the girl cry, do I?
Wait, Sangoro!
What?
You're impatient.
I'll go with you.
That's the way!
Have you changed your mind so soon, sir?
Oh, please hear me, and stay here tonight!
You shut up and watch the house for me.
No, I won't.
Are you trying to make your master angry?
No, not me!
Then stay!
But I don't have anything to give the landlord... if he comes for the rent.
There're enough umbrellas for that.
No, there aren't.
Pay him with this hair pin.
It was made by Goto.
But, sir, must you?
Let's go!
Follow me.
Oh, dear!
He must really be in love with that vixen!
What shall I do?
!
And with all his debts too.
Even made by Goto, will one of a pair satisfy the landlord?
Oh, the 100 ryo!
Master!
"A tea house in Fukagawa. "
- No, I won't give in!
- Now, don't get excited.
After all I've given her, why does Koman reject Banemon?
!
Because I don't like you.
Don't like me?
Listen, Koman.
You're my sister, but I won't let you be so selfish!
I don't like him and I won't go with him!
I'm the one that signed for the loan, so don't be rough with her or I'll be in trouble.
Banemon promises to let you live as you like, so if you say yes... you will save you and me both from a lot of worry and trouble.
And me as a samurai!
She just won't listen to anything I say.
Have another drink and be calm.
Drink?
A good idea!
Pour for me!
Don't be so angry.
Koman must have some reason for refusing.
Torazo, you must know.
Tell me her reason!
It is nothing unusual.
It is just that Koman has a lover.
Is he a samurai or a townsman?
He is a no-good ronin named Gengobe.
I don't know why she likes him.
He is a beggar!
But he was originally a man of position, even so he doesn't mind that I'm a geisha.
He still wants me.
But he was already a penniless beggar before he fell for you.
That's the way they talk.
I feel sick.
I feel even worse.
If I only had money.
Your Gengobe could never get together 100 ryo, no matter how he tried, but I have it right here to pay right now.
Think which of us can take care of you best.
He is right.
The 100 ryo is most important.
He is a very good offer, Koman.
Right!
Forget that man and take Banemon.
Be my wife!
No, I won't!
Look at this!
It's the Godairiki pledge to never let another man touch me.
My heart is locked against any man except Gengobe.
You'll not open it with your gold key!
I am Samurai Gengobe's wife.
So you refuse me?
Yes, with all my heart.
And this is all Gengobe's fault.
Damn!
I'll kill him!
Careful, Gengobe may be listening.
Then tell him to get 100 ryo!
Where'd he get it?
!
He'd never even get together a few shu!
He'd run off with his tail between his legs.
Just a minute!
I am that Gengobe Satsuma!
Oh, Gengobe, I'm glad you are here.
So this is.
I told you not to gossip!
We heard all you said!
Who do you think you are calling a beggar?
!
Watch your tongues!
But I didn't.
You won't get off so easy as that!
What'll we do with them, sir?
You people.
Please forgive us.
I beg of you!
I, Gengobe, will now pay Koman's debts.
100 ryo in pure gold!
That's right.
And I receive Koman in return.
How's that?
!
Who said Gengobe couldn't get together even a few shu?
!
Don't make me laugh!
I've served him for some time and know... that he always has 100 ryo in his pocket.
Come on, Koman!
Then I will.
I'm so happy, Gengobe!
What have you done, sir?
!
That 100 ryo was gathered so you could participate in the vendetta.
Where're you going, sir?
I mustn't be seen here.
I'm going.
But, sir, doesn't it make you angry... to hear them talking about you like that?
It makes me mad.
Let's go in there!
Listen, Gengobe is here!
Oh, Gengobe, I'm glad you are here.
So this is.
I told you not to gossip!
We heard all you said!
Who do you think you are calling this man a beggar?
!
Don't make me laugh!
Who said Gengobe couldn't get together even a few shus?
He always has 100 ryo or so in his pocket.
Sangoro, don't talk so big.
As you said, sir, you can do as you please with this woman.
I'm a beggar as you say and have no right to stand in your way... whatever you do with her.
What are you saying?
Where does that leave Koman and me?
Gengobe, thanks for taking care of me and my sister.
You have given us a very good life all this time.
Tramping in like this,
I thought you'd have 100 ryo.
This is a real joke!
Chohachi, that goes without saying.
He may have been a fine samurai before, but... now he's nothing compared to me, Banemon of the Konos.
Oh, please, sir.
Say something back to him!
No, he's right.
Leave him alone.
So, ladies' man, money and power has done it.
Pardon me.
Do you really mean I must be his wife?
Be happy!
Goodbye!
What're you doing?
How can I live after... the man I love has abandoned me?
There's nothing for her to do but die.
Sir, you have disappointed us!
Go ahead and die!
I'd be much obliged to Gengobe if he let you.
Die if you like!
Koman, wouldn't you rather be mine?
How horrible!
Let me go!
Don't be stupid!
Oh, Gengobe, you're so very cruel!
Don't force me to live in shame!
I live in the same shame.
Goodbye!
Farewell, until we meet in that world.
Wait!
Do you really feel that strongly?
Yes.
I, Gengobe, hereby pay Koman's ransom debts.
But that's 100 ryo.
Right!
100 ryo!
Here is the 100 ryo, take it, and I receive Koman in return!
It's 100 ryo in pure gold!
You can't judge a man by the way he looks!
Just look at this!
This is the Gengobe I, Sangoro, call my lord and master!
I'm a ronin, but still a samurai.
I'm happy to meet you Banemon!
What's this?
!
But first of all, no one has any objections to my ransoming Koman with this 100 ryo?
None at all.
Wait!
I object!
What are you doing here?
I was afraid this is what you would do.
And after I warned and scolded you so.
Water spilled from a bowl doesn't return.
But that 100 ryo was gathered by those... back home for you to make a come back.
Shut up!
You don't know my heart!
Let's get better acquainted, Banemon!
I would like to, but I have a stomach-ache.
Wait, you samurai!
What a dull samurai!
Now all the tears are over, I mean to make Koman my wife.
Come with me, Koman.
Oh, Gengobe, you just make me so happy...
Oh, sir.
Please wait a moment.
What do you mean, wait?
It is true that you paid Koman's ransom, but unfortunately, she has a husband.
Koman has a husband?
!
Right, and unless she breaks with him.
Is this true, Koman?
Answer me!
Who is the man?
!
Well, he...
Sangoro, who is Koman's husband?
It is me.
What?
You?
Yes, I'm her husband, and Koman is my wife.
I tried to find a patron for her.
You've been a good patron.
So the two of you have worked together... to lead me into this deep situation?
You bastards!
Well, it isn't easy to sit by and... watch your own wife with another man.
And, Koman, did you fool me too?
I know you are mad, but there were deep reasons.
Please believe my heart.
Shut up, you stupid woman!
Shut up!
It was my mistake to be bewitched by her, but you are really terrible to try... to rob a man of his property this way!
It's money, not duty that keeps you alive!
You inhuman bastard!
Stop, Master, your life is too important!
Don't try to stop me!
Endure this.
Please don't do it!
Come cut us down if you want to, but remember that...
Koman is my legal wife, not yours.
Cut away if you like, it's your loss!
You and your beastly insults.
It's my sin to have been born a woman.
Please forgive me, and kill me now.
You filthy thing!
Get away from me!
Quiet!
You are inhuman!
But, Master, you must save yourself from all this.
Think of yourself!
Don't kill them.
Let's go home.
Oh, Sangoro, you are too cruel.
Oh, my poor heart.
Your woman's heart may find it hard, but...
I have to get 100 ryo no matter what to get... my father to forgive me and take me back.
Since he disowned me ten years ago.
I was worried, but it all came out alright.
Here is your 100 ryo.
Thanks.
You all put on a real good show.
There'll be some for the rest of us?
Don't worry.
Go on and warm up some saké.
OK.
I'll be home waiting for you.
"Later the same night... "
Koman, you are the only one I love.
Is that the truth?
I wouldn't lie...
What is this tattoo?
It is embarrassing to say, but... it is a pledge to never let another man touch me.
A pledge of love.
Love for whom?
Oh, you're cruel.
It is you.
Who else would it be?
We'll change it to "Precious Sangoro. "
It stings!
A sly rewrite!
But maybe she really felt the original.
Stupid!
She loves only "precious" me!
You're awful!
Look at that!
And look at this!
What'll you do now?
But Gengobe must be awful angry.
Did you fall for him a little after all?
Don't be silly!
A geisha lives a life of lies.
But they say truth Is born from lies.
Oh, Kikuno, you too?
You did put it on pretty strong.
How can I live, abandoned by my love?
And Gengobe overdid the lover role too.
If I were him, I think I would have been more careful with the gold.
This "gold" won't get by me!
How's this?
You planned that!
Oh, you inhuman bastards!
Unfortunately, she has a husband.
It is me.
It is me.
It is me.
It is me.
Don't be so glum.
You're scaring me.
I just feel uneasy.
You'll feel alright after a good sleep.
I want to get this money to my father... and get him to take me back as his son.
And you can show him his grandson.
I wonder how our son is.
Let's go get him from foster parents tomorrow.
Yes, and we'll live together happily, and find some new way to make a living.
And I'll work too.
Oh, please, make me feel warm.
Oh, damn!
Looks like I have to run.
That's the way!
And I fly into a check!
You got him!
How about it?
Can you get away now, Gengobe?
I'm done for!
Look, he's sleeping.
That's only natural, because it's almost three a. m. already.
They make me nervous!
I'm getting excited too.
Let's go, Kikuno.
Not here!
In there then?
Oh, you!
We'll see you all later.
Damn them all!
So that leaves us two.
Well, let's go to bed too.
Guess we may as well.
Who is it?
Inosuke?
"Several days later... "
"The place is now Yotsuya... "
Yes, I'm glad you granted my request.
A blessing from the gods.
Since then, I became a priest and have spent my time serving the gods.
But I never forget my lord's revenge.
Enya's old retainers loiter about here... but the most pitiful is Soemon Funakura.
He didn't have the 100 ryo necessary to become one of the revengers, so I have done everything I could to gather it for him, but failed at every turn.
And now here you are offering that amount for my use.
It must have been difficult for you to raise.
Yes, we two worked hard to make it.
You did a very good job!
I forgive you and take you back as my son.
Thank you.
Listen, Koman, he forgave me!
Oh, I'm so happy.
I really thank you.
You must have endured a lot too.
Thank you.
Then do you approve of us too?
Of course.
Sentaro took a fine bride.
Thank you so very much.
Congratulations.
Is that my grandson?
Yes.
Have a good look at him.
What a lovely baby.
I must tell Soemon right away, and introduce you to him.
Please do.
I'll go see if he's home.
Is he staying here?
He's been staying in the cottage a few days.
He went to see someone today and isn't back.
I'll give him the money as soon as he returns.
You can meet him tomorrow.
He's been quite depressed lately.
This money will surely cheer him up.
You certainly did well to make this 100 ryo.
"Wanted for Five Murders.
Reward for Information. "
Oh, big brother!
Oh, you are back.
How is the house?
Thanks for taking care of us.
Don't thank me, just pay the rent!
You're awful cold to your little sister!
Business is business.
You've got something interesting there.
How about a drink?
I've something to do first.
But get it warm and I'll be back later.
He's always like that.
That's a load off my shoulders, to get my father's forgiveness after ten years.
Let's celebrate!
But I was really worried he would ask how we got the money.
We could have told him anything.
But us together in peace is like a dream.
Look at his face...
Saké really tastes great tonight.
But that night in Fukagawa was scary!
But we got away!
I didn't think we would.
It was sad for the others.
Yes.
Kikuno died in place of me.
Don't talk like that.
You'll make the saké sour.
What would you do if Gengobe showed up?
He wouldn't come here.
He's a wanted man.
Oh, he may be out there watching us now.
Don't say things like that!
I feel creepy!
If he shows up here, I'll take him right to the authorities!
After all, he's a wanted murderer.
Are you really as brave as all that?
No, I'm really scared.
Why ruin a celebration with talk like that?
!
Good fortune has finally come our way.
But I'm just not used to happiness yet.
Our hard times did go on for a long time.
Won't you please.
Take good care of me?
Don't cry.
Let's cook,
and celebrate.
Go get some wood.
We didn't buy any.
Then rip off some paneling.
We should ask the landlord.
Silly!
The landlord is your brother.
What's his is ours.
What's ours is ours.
Stop!
I think brother's come back.
Is it you, Brother?
Gengobe!
You two look settled in.
I'm happy for you.
Glad to see you well too...
Since we last met in Fukagawa,
I heard you had moved to this area, so I came to visit.
And I brought you some saké as a gift.
Thank you.
Ah, come right on in.
You've got a nice place here.
Come right in.
Before there were all sorts of mistakes...
You must be angry, but we can explain it all.
Thanks for coming all this way to visit...
Open that saké.
Oh, no, we couldn't possibly drink it.
Remember that I am the samurai Gengobe.
I don't hold any grudge against Koman.
You mean you will forget everything?
Just as water dries as the days pass.
Don't worry.
I wish to continue being good friends as we always were.
What welcome words.
Come anytime at all.
So open my saké and let's drink to that.
As you say.
Relax and drink.
Oh, no, I insist you drink mine tonight.
I have some warmed just right.
Pour him a drink.
Please have a drink.
I accept your hospitality.
This reminds me of the night we first met in Fukagawa.
Koman, sing me a song, like that night.
What're they up to?
This brings back memories.
It was all just a dream.
That was a dream, and this is a dream.
The flower's red fades like your love, and... my sadness is like the eternal flow of water.
Please sing one more.
What'll it be?
Oh, Gengobe, there was one you always used to ask for, wasn't there, Gengobe, sir?
You remember, Gengobe, what was it, Gengobe?
Oh yes, it was "Chrysanthemum Dew. "
Will you sing it for me, Koman?
"Victim Number Two"
This is the place.
You're sure?
Yes, there's no mistake.
He is definitely Gengobe Satsuma?
Right.
My reward?
You're a nuisance!
Nobody wanted your information anyway!
But the poster said he was wanted and promised a reward.
Put out your hand, you noisy nuisance!
Oh, thank you.
But this is only a tiny copper coin!
Things have gotten noisy out front.
Oh, it's the neighbors.
Is Sangoro at home?
Yes.
Just a minute.
Sangoro?
That is Gengobe, the Fukagawa murderer?
Yes, it is.
You go back in and tie him up, and bring him out here to me.
Not me.
You're the official here.
Go tie him up yourself.
If I could, I wouldn't ask you to do it.
You can do it easiest of us all.
That's not my job.
Please go on in.
What's happening here, Sangoro?
Are you Gengobe?
I am.
Did you commit those murders in Fukagawa?
Sir, I am a ronin, but still a warrior.
I do not kill women and children.
You have the wrong man.
But we have a witness.
A witness?
Where is he?
That man there.
Oh, no, sir, not me.
This is the first I've even heard about it.
So Sangoro is the witness against me?
Oh, no, not me.
I don't know anything.
Right.
We know nothing about it.
Is there any definite evidence to prove.
Who the murderer is?
Yes, we have very clear evidence.
Have you ever seen this bodkin before?
That bodkin!
This is one of a pair belonging to you.
This was at the scene of the murders.
Clear evidence.
Let us tie you up.
Wait!
You have the wrong man!
He's not the Fukagawa murderer.
What?
Who are you?
Hachiemon!
What are you doing here?
!
If that bodkin proves who the murderer is, then it is someone else.
It is not Gengobe.
You're protecting me?
Don't try protecting your master!
Move!
What man would protect such a disloyal master?
Who do you say did the murders?
It was me.
Do you have proof?
I do.
I have the mate to that bodkin.
This is certain evidence.
It is the mate.
But why did you kill them?
Koman and Sangoro cheated Gengobe.
So I killed their cohorts, but...
I regret that I didn't get them as well.
I have been trying to kill them ever since that time.
I came out of hiding when I heard that...
Gengobe was about to be caught in place of me.
Please take me, the real murderer.
Tie me up and take me to prison.
Your story holds water and you have evidence.
I arrest you for the Fukagawa murders.
Tie him up!
Please let me suffer the shame of arrest... by having my own master tie me up.
Me tie you up?
I will, but in my heart.
Don't waste your heart on prayers for me, but go join the others... as a true samurai instead.
If only you do that, I will be in heaven.
And so just forget that beastly woman... and don't let her make you waver, sir.
Do only that for me, sir.
Tie up the criminal, Gengobe!
Please tie me up, sir.
Forgive me.
I die happy.
Take him away!
Goodbye, my master.
And you two started all this!
Please forgive me.
Don't blame Koman.
Your anger is natural, but I did it for him.
We're not even human, please overlook us.
My servant's words moved me deeply.
Koman, I give you up from this moment on.
We thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
Lift your faces.
If you're sincere, drink the saké that I brought you.
Goodbye.
We're saved!
Quick, bring salt!
Out with the demons!
Let the good in!
That's a relief!
I thought any minute was going to be the end, but here we are.
I'm so weak that I can't stand up.
I thought we were done for too.
Let's celebrate!
That's cold.
Have some that's heated.
That's a good idea.
To our happiness!
"Victim Number Three"
What a mess that was!
Come on in!
At it all ready?
Have a drink!
Thing would have been bad without me.
I didn't know you were here.
You really saved our lives.
I saved you lives.
Have one more as our gratitude.
Gratitude?
One drink isn't enough.
But Brother...
You think I don't know you took 100 ryo from Gengobe?
I know the whole story.
You're awful.
We don't have that money now.
You can't fool me like you did him!
We know that.
But that money all went to our Lord for a special purpose.
Who's that?
I've never seen him, but his name is Soemon Funakura.
So you're Enya supporters?
That's interesting.
I'm a Kono retainer.
So that means we are enemies.
Oh, no, just my father used to work for Enya.
Don't speak of us as your enemies!
It's suddenly cold.
Koman, build up the fire.
Sorry I neglected it.
It has gotten cold!
That's the wall!
You'll pay for that!
Don't get so angry.
We forgot to buy wood, and started using this.
Stop joking and use what's under the floor.
Oh, is there some here?
Cheer up now.
Oh, it's all gone, but there's more here.
Cold saké is just fine.
Oh, look what I found here.
What's this?
It looks like a floor plan.
A carpenter of the Konos lived here.
A secret way into the alcove.
A trapdoor on the veranda.
This may be the Kono mansion floor plan!
If it is...
This is a real find!
I won't let you keep it!
Please give it back!
What'll you do with it?
Stop it!
Brother!
Maybe in this saké...
You gave me poisoned saké!
Why would we do that to you, Brother?
!
He got what was meant for us!
Then Gengobe!
Damn!
This is a scheme of the Enya family!
I'll pay you back for all this!
Then it's the end for us.
I'm sorry!
Get away!
No, stop it!
Please...
Please, stop!
Don't look!
Close your eyes!
This is terrible!
Koman, I've killed your brother, and now we're enemies!
There's nothing else left for me to do!
Goodbye, Koman!
Let me die!
If you're going to die, kill me first!
But if we die, what will happen to our baby?
Settle down!
We can die any time.
Take this floor plan to your father now.
We can die any time.
You're right.
I had forgotten this.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Wait a minute.
Take this just in case.
Right.
You clean up here.
Take care.
We'll never leave you alone again.
You've had lots of troubles too.
You were born under a sad star.
Namu Amida Butsu.
What a terrible fate.
"Gengobe, at that time... "
Gengobe...
Gengobe...
It's me, Gengobe.
So you didn't drink the saké I brought?
Is Sangoro here?
No, he's out.
Out?
You're not lying, are you?
It's true.
You're always full of tricks.
"HELL"
So you have a son?
I didn't notice earlier.
It's clear who his father is.
He looks just like Sangoro.
You really made a fool of me, with a son too, didn't you, Koman?
Oh no, I didn't make a fool of you.
Your love was all a planned trick.
Oh no, never that.
Then why, with a son and husband, did you promise to be my wife?
And even your tattoo pledge probably...
No.
That tattoo...
Fake too?
Let me see it.
"Precious Sangoro?"
Eternal proof of your treachery, here on your arm for all to see.
You cheated me at every turn!
Forgive me.
I can explain everything!
No explanations!
That tattoo is clear proof.
I see everything clearly now!
I'll kill you and Sangoro both!
A warrior, and I let a woman do this to me?
Please forgive me and let me live!
Then tell me where Sangoro is!
I don't know!
Tell, or this is what you get!
Shut up!
The child is innocent!
Then tell me!
I don't know and wouldn't tell even if I did!
Stubborn woman, talk!
Your "Precious Sangoro! "
Is this the arm?
I'm ready to die!
kill me!
I won't blame you for it, but don't hurt my child!
Please don't take the life of my child!
You want pity for him?
Then pity him by killing him yourself.
Why did you think it's necessary to kill my innocent child?
!
A demon!
You're a demon!
A horrid demon!
It was you two who made me a demon!
Die, Koman!
"This world is a sea of blood. "
Sengoro, someone's coming.
You have committed murder.
Hide in that coffin.
And don't come out until I tell you to.
I wanted to drink to our future together.
But in your present situation, that is no longer possible.
What a pitiful woman!
All you can do now is quietly go on your way to Buddhahood.
When I gave that 100 ryo for you,
I was willing to give up everything for you, no matter what others would say of me.
It was with that 100 ryo that I made the most definite decision of my life.
All that's left now is eternal,
All enveloping darkness.
Is there anything else where you are, Koman?
Is there true Godairiki in that world?
Won't you say something to me?
Answer me!
Who's there?
It's me, Tokuemon.
I have been waiting for you to return.
Please look at this, Soemon.
What's this?
My son Sentaro and his wife have come back, after many trials and tribulations.
My son killed his wife's brother... to get this floor plan of the Kono mansion.
Soemon, please meet my pitiful son... and give him a word of encouragement.
What do you mean, giving these to me?
It's too late now.
What?
Hachiemon got me 100 ryo which I used to ransom a geisha.
Then she cheated me and,
I killed many in hate.
I know I was a fool, but...
I am the man who committed the 5 Fukagawa murders.
What?
But...
Gengobe is the name I have been using.
Hachiemon was arrested in place of me.
I no longer have the right or the desire... to be counted among the faithful retainers.
I only regret that I let that rascal...
Sangoro get away alive.
Sangoro?
That is my son Sentaro's childhood name.
And I've heard his wife was a geisha.
Does that mean?
This is my cloth, so this 100 ryo!
Gengobe is Soemon?
!
Sengoro!
Your anger is only natural, but my son left home very young and had never seen your face.
He knew you as Gengobe.
Please forgive my pitiful son.
We can forgive, but Koman's life is gone.
Something happened to Koman?
Look!
This is her head.
I killed both Koman and her son too.
Sentaro!
Sangoro!
Goodbye, sir!
I killed Koman's brother.
I must die.
My wife and son are dead.
I have no desire to live without them.
Wait!
Don't be hasty, Sentaro!
I don't want to hear or see any more.
Even if there is sunlight, this maggot can abide only in deepest darkness.
I have lived a useless life.
Koman!
Soemon!
Namu Amida Butsu...
"Several months later... "
"the Enya retainers carried out their vendetta. "
"But Soemon Funakura was not among them. "
A color film in monochrome.
Hello?
Paris?
May I speak to Louis Roy?
Louis Roy, like your King Louis, backwards.
Exactly.
Louis?
It's Pierre.
I'm fine, thanks.
Brazil?
Two months of lovely weather, and otherwise ghastly.
You'll have them in a month.
Three articles, like we agreed.
What bullshit!
The Paris newspaper won't take me on at the moment.
Didn't they promise, more or less?
Not definitely.
They've got financial problems.
And I will too, soon.
Won't they pay for the Brazil articles?
Yes, but not much.
I'll have to freelance.
Take up Bernard's offer for that television job.
Oh, right.
I can't write a script for Bernard and my Brazil articles.
Write it with someone else.
With whom?
I don't know.
Your hairy writer friend, Paul.
Not a bad idea.
Paul?
Paul!
A call for you.
Who is it?
Richard Nixon.
Or Leonid Brezhnev.
I don't know which.
One or the other.
That's fine.
Thanks, Paul.
See you soon.
I might not come to work on Monday morning.
Or Monday afternoon.
Maybe not for the whole month.
We're fed up with your comings and goings.
That's our arrangement, I'm not at your beck and call.
He works when he feels like it.
Great!
Isn't it?
Elsewhere, I work harder for nothing.
That's your business.
Exactly, that's my business.
You got on our nerves with your mucking about.
Pack it up!
Paul lived in a secluded spot, but not for love of nature.
He appreciated tranquility, but it was a small house, and the rent was only 100 francs a month, and he appreciated that even more.
We find ourselves in the country's western frontier, two steps from the border, and Switzerland seems to be left behind.
We turn our backs on her.
On the other side of this no-man's land lies France.
A country where one never knows what the next year, or month, will have in store.
Despite appearances, which one should never trust,
Paul was not a plasterer, or a singer, but a writer.
This was October 25th.
The weather was rather dull.
Come in!
Come in!
You've brought a suitcase?
Are you gonna take the job?
- Have you decided?
- No.
But I live 10 miles away, and it's cold.
I've brought my things, in case I stay.
Good thinking!
Well?
You know Bernard, the guy from TV?
- No.
- Nevermind.
He's a friend.
I'm doing a job for him because I need the cash.
I've got to write a story, a script, based on a year old news item.
He wants to film it, and he'll pay in advance.
But since I have to write my Brazil articles,
I'd like for you to help me with it.
OK?
- It depends.
- Depends on what?
Lots of things.
Has your scribbling ever brought in 2,000 francs in a month?
Not counting the poems your wife writes!
Listen.
We'll make 4,000 francs.
We can do the job in one month, they've allowed three.
What more do you want?
I'd like to know the subject, and how we tackle it.
I don't work to order.
- Tell me about the event.
- Very simple.
A story which fizzled out.
A man whose niece lived with him claimed she shot him with his Army rifle.
The bullet hit him in the shoulder.
She denied everything.
She claims the old man hurt himself cleaning his rifle.
There were no witnesses, they both maintained their statements, and the case was dropped.
That's all.
Strange.
There's a press clipping about it, up there.
Bernard would like a sort of sociological study.
The girl's name is Rosemonde.
Rosemonde?
I'd forgotten that.
Doesn't sound bad, Rosemonde.
So?
Hold on.
Are you staying?
- Interested?
- Yes, I am.
How will we work?
Together is more complicated.
We'll make it however you like.
Have you got a calendar with Saints' Days?
- Saints?
- Yes, saints.
Maybe in my diary...
Yeah, here they are...
- What are you looking for?
- Hold on.
Here.
I found it.
April 30th, St. Rosemonde.
As I thought, it's a calendar name.
So what?
- That explains it.
- Explains what?
That the girl wanted to kill her uncle.
Our names are in the calendar, but we don't kill uncles.
Let me explain.
It happened like this:
Rosemonde comes from a big family.
In big families, when the usual names have been exhausted on the first-born brats, the parents run out of ideas, and start using calendar names.
Thus: a big family a swarm of noisy little brats.
A big family means a country family.
They couldn't afford the housing racket in town.
So they live in the country, but not any old stretch of country,
Catholic country, still a little backward.
Contraception unknown, calendar saints, and all that.
The father's a blockhead, education leaves a lot to be desired.
And why does Rosemonde live in town?
That's easy: the father can't make ends meet.
He'll never make a go of things.
Salvation: a brother in town, comfortably off, room to spare, easily put upon.
So he's landed with the girl, and there's one less at home to feed.
What does Rosemonde do in town?
She does miserable jobs, unskilled jobs.
She starts to run wild.
Uncle tries to straighten her out.
They quarrel.
One day he's cleaning his army rifle, and inevitably, Rosemonde being who she is, a shot's fired.
Not a bad story.
I'll stay.
What's your opinion?
Not bad.
There's just one little problem.
Which is?
What about the facts?
I've been stating the facts for five minutes, apart from some minor details.
I feel I've earned my living, today.
Good.
But it may all be a dream.
Why use your imagination when the story actually happened?
The girl and the uncle exist.
They live here somewhere.
I'm interested in facts, in reality.
We must start by coming to grips with that.
You can elaborate later.
First we make inquiries.
I'm not a cop.
- Like a journalist!
- I'm not a journalist!
You work as a plasterer so that you can write what you like.
Good.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
I'll make some coffee.
When you get the sausage, make sure to tie it well.
So we've agreed?
The water's ready.
We'll go about it based on your idea.
You'll write the girl's story as you see it.
I'll visit people with my tape recorder.
and collect as much information as I can, so that you can build your story around it.
Later on we'll go over it all together.
Sound good?
Yeah.
Don't forget, I don't want to know anything about her.
Bring back all you can get on the others.
Warm woolen underpants for winter!
Warm woolen socks for winter!
A pad of special paper!
A deluxe fountain pen!
- And where's the cash?
- In the Bank.
- Sugar?
- Two lumps.
My wife needs my share now.
Whenever you like.
First, Pierre had to find Rosemonde.
Despite some difficulties due to Rosemonde's personality,
Pierre conducted his inquiries with gusto.
She didn't stay more than a month.
You should've seen her room.
An unholy mess!
We've had all sorts here, but she took the cake!
I always say, whenever someone can't be on time
She was often 15 minutes late- something's not right.
- Where does she work now?
- I don't know.
She lives in Onex.
I've got her address in my bag.
The investigation began on October 27th.
Today was November 1st.
May I speak with you?
I'm a reporter.
Would you like to come in?
It's a little hard to explain.
It's about your spot of trouble last year, although that's not the main thing.
Really, I'd like to get to know you.
I'm writing a story about someone like you.
I'd like to chat.
I can come back later, if you're busy.
This may sound odd, but my job is made up of odd things.
Isn't it Rosemonde you want to speak to?
- Aren't you Rosemonde?
- No.
I'm Suzanne.
- But she does live here?
- Yes, but she's not in yet.
Would you like to wait?
- Are you on the Pill?
- Yeah.
All the time?
You should be like a Boy Scout: always ready.
Roger was ready for anything.
Rosemonde prepared herself for damnation.
Are you a reporter?
Anyway, no more about that uncle business.
That's been shelved.
Let's talk about other things.
Like what?
I don't know...about you, for instance.
About your job.
That can wait until hell freezes over!
What can one say about a job?
If Rosemonde tells you about her life, as you say, would you pay her for that?
That could be arranged.
- Is it too long?
- No, I think it's fine.
- I found the girl!
- Bravo!
- Do you want to meet her?
- Definitely not.
She's a bit alright.
I already knew that.
She's even better than you imagine.
I can't see her with a rifle.
I doubt she fired the shot.
Still, everything points to the contrary!
This is Vladimir.
He practices here when his wife can't stand it any longer.
He can keep you company.
Where shall I go?
Up to my room.
You didn't say much on the phone.
But I've got nothing to hide.
You're a journalist?
Yeah.
Have I disturbed your dinner?
No, no, I just finished.
I always eat very early.
Is this the famous rifle?
Yes, that's my army rifle.
Isn't it terrible, to think I was almost killed by it?
The weapon I served with for 30 years?
Through years of looking after it, one gets attached.
It's become more than just a rifle.
For us, it's almost a symbol of our freedom.
It means something to us.
To see it turned on you one day...
True, that's somewhat of a paradox.
She had run-ins with the police before.
It was over a stolen car.
Not to mention, her illegitimate child.
At seventeen!
She's a bad lot!
My brother's not a bad guy, but he never did anything with his life.
Still, it was a big, fine family.
She came from a big family?
Yes, she was put in my care when she was fifteen, so that she could go to school in town.
It meant one less mouth to feed at home.
At fifteen she ran around with delinquents, got up at 10 in the morning, and finally ended up meddling in crime.
Did she have any cause?
No, that's just it!
That's what I don't understand.
While she was here, we treated her like our own daughter.
But she couldn't escape her destiny.
It could well have cost me my life.
- Do you want to see my scar?
- No, it's not necessary.
The worst place is where the bullet came out.
I get awful pains when we have our famous north wind.
Unlike the uncle, Paul liked the wind very much.
Paul waited for two days, but there was no wind.
I've had it.
After work, I always feel like yelling or breaking something.
When I feel up to it, I go swimming.
Be patient.
In 40 years, you can retire.
Have you worked there long?
Three months already, but it feels like a lifetime.
I'll stay six months at the most.
- Will you get a pension?
- No.
That's my big regret.
Sometimes I imagine how
I'd get up at 10, flop around in slippers, make some coffee, run a bath, go down
and fetch the paper.
At lunch time I'd rustle up a meal.
What a life!
A monthly pension.
Card games at the pub.
A dream!
Yes, but by then one's too old.
That's true.
One no longer makes love.
Great!
There's a jukebox.
Do you have a coin?
Sit over here.
A cup of coffee.
Do you want anything?
And a coke.
This isn't ideal for a chat.
You can take me home later.
We can talk there.
What are you doing?
Taking your picture.
Is that okay?
I look a sight.
What will you do with them?
Nothing.
They're for my friend, for our work.
- Really?
- Of course.
What did you think?
Alright.
But I want to see them.
I'll give them to you if you like.
Wait, let me tidy up.
You look gorgeous, stay like that.
I'll be right back.
Move a little.
Walk a bit, from right to left.
Now sit on the table.
Just relax.
Perfect.
The last ones are the best.
I think that'll do.
Anyway, this is less dangerous than a rifle.
Was it a shotgun?
No, an Army rifle.
- Will you see my uncle?
- Probably.
He'll say I tried to shoot him, the old liar.
He hated me, because I'd had it with being his maid.
I couldn't even have lifted his rifle!
Those things are heavy!
Did you see it happen?
No, I was in the other room.
He was fiddling with his rifle.
Cleaning it for the umpteenth time.
I'd seen him the moment before.
Suddenly I heard a huge bang.
I rushed in and found my uncle on the floor.
You should have seen it!
I called the doctor.
Afterwards he called the police.
That's how it all started.
He put the blame on me.
- Did you hate him?
- Me?
No.
He's just an old prick, that's all.
As simple as that?
Aren't you working?
- I'll finish this game first.
- Are you working upstairs?
No, down here.
I need space to walk around.
I have a lot of people:
A big family, a maimed uncle, a big rifle, defense of our freedom, and that's not all.
For your poems you only have to picture the inside of your skull.
How's it going with Pierre?
Fine.
It's a good time.
It's a change for me.
I'm between a blank page and a construction site.
Do you want something to eat?
No, I'm not hungry.
Are you crazy?
They'll throw us out.
Should we go to my place to record?
If you want.
Finish your drink.
When I was small,
I went on lots of country walks with my older brother.
His big specialty was breaking windows, especially in winter, when he could make snowballs.
He was real strong.
His snowballs were like stones.
Once my father thrashed us, but he discovered my brother was stronger than him.
He never touched us after that.
I've always loved the sound of breaking windows.
You mentioned your father.
Oh god, my father...
He never had a steady job, it all depended.
When he had too much to drink, all hell broke loose at home.
He works at a sawmill now.
And your mother?
I love her, she's great.
We get along.
I visit her from time to time.
With all the kids she's brought into the world...
How many brothers and sisters?
Ten.
Ten?
- Eleven, counting you?
- Yeah.
I was the seventh.
Mother's never worn out.
She adores the little brats.
When I had a kid...
- A kid?
- Yeah, that was six years ago.
- I wanted to keep it.
- But you couldn't.
Why not?
You weren't married, were you?
No, but I wanted to keep it.
Mother took him at once.
What was one more or less to her?
Simple as that.
What's the child's name?
- Jean.
- A boy?
Yes.
My uncle thought that I was a bitch.
He wanted to put me in reform school.
No, that was after the car business.
That was nothing.
Albert, a friend of mine, had taken a car to go for a drive.
We had a drink in the village, and a cop asked for our papers just as we were leaving.
They only took my name, but they nabbed Albert.
No, wait, I had to go to court.
And reform school?
I never went.
What for?
Then I started as a dressmaker's apprentice.
That satisfied my uncle.
- Are you a dressmaker?
- No, I never finished.
Why not?
I don't like dressmaking.
Pierre thought that was as good a reason as any.
And Paul wrote:
"Heliodore", that was Rosemonde's name in the story,
"had little taste for what is called a trade."
"Where one learns an honest, which means poor, living."
"Where one's at everyone's beck and call."
"Where freedom means a quick smoke in the bathroom."
I was told I was pretty enough to be a hostess.
A stewardess, perhaps?
No, you need languages for that.
Some other hostess.
A department store hostess, with a little hat?
Maybe, but I like to dress how I like.
I don't like uniforms.
What did you do after the dressmaking?
Mostly housework for my uncle.
I was used to such work.
There was always plenty at home, scrubbing my brothers and sisters.
I did some other jobs too.
I was a salesgirl, and I worked in a macaroni factory.
But not for long.
Others stay.
I never do.
I'm not quite normal.
At least that's what people say.
"It slowly dawned on Heliodore that it was not the others, but she who was normal."
"That her desires were basically normal."
"Consequently, what wasn't normal had to be outside her, since she and the world didn't hit it off."
Once I went to the Riviera with Albert.
He had his own car then.
My uncle informed the police.
I'd gone off without telling him.
He thought I'd gone off on the loose.
Anyway, they never found us.
It was fantastic!
We went where we liked, slept on the beach.
One evening...
I nearly recorded some porn for you!
That was the last time I saw the sea.
Uncle takes his holidays in the mountains, in a total dump.
He took me there once.
There were two old bags who sang after dinner.
I never left my room.
He almost called the police to have them pry me out.
You don't like them much, do you?
Who, the cops?
I couldn't care less.
Were you involved with them before?
Me?
No, I never did a thing.
My brother, when he was working on a farm, did something stupid once.
The cops came to our house.
And then, when my father slugged a guy, they came again.
And after the thing with my uncle, they hounded me for ages.
Until finally, they left me alone.
And now?
Now?
I feel old.
Even more so than before.
I wonder what will become of me.
I never used to worry about that.
But nevermind.
That's enough for now.
Turn that thing off.
How often must I tell you that people eat what you handle?
Tidy your hair or wear a cap.
Come in!
Is that you?
No, it's me..
What are you doing here?
Aren't you working today?
Is it raining?
No, I went swimming.
A day off?
No, I quit.
Did they fire you?
Lay you off?
No, I left.
I was fed up.
- Do you need money?
- No.
I wanted to see you.
Good idea.
No, bad idea.
It's a good idea, but now's not a good time.
I was hoping you might cheer me up.
Not now.
I don't want to lose my train of thought.
Come back this evening.
You're not much fun!
I don't want to go anywhere.
May I stay here?
I won't say a word.
If you like.
The question of Swiss capital investment in Brazil gave Pierre trouble.
Two hours have passed since Rosemonde arrived.
Outside it was pitch dark.
It's pitch dark out.
I'm staying.
Fine, stay.
I'm sleeping here.
Fine, sleep here.
I'm sleeping in your bed.
I'm staying, I'm sleeping in your bed, and I'm sleeping with you.
I'm staying, I'm sleeping in your bed, and I'm sleeping with you.
I'm taking off my skirt.
Where's the bathroom?
Downstairs,
First door on your left.
No, right.
Is your novel almost finished?
Is your novel almost finished?
Is it all about me?
No, it's about Brazil.
Have you been there?
Really?
The Carnival in Rio, is that in Brazil?
Have you seen it?
No!
Sorry.
Can I watch TV?
Quietly?
.
Very quietly.
How's it work?
Turn the little knob on the left.
I'll be done in a couple minutes.
Are you a nice guy?
Very nice.
Me too.
It depends on the person.
Sometimes I'm terrible.
I'm wild, you know.
But I'm easily tamed.
I believe you.
That's it.
I'm stopping.
I'm hungry.
Are you?
I'll heat the stew Paul made for lunch.
Who is Paul?
My friend.
We work together.
I'll have some too.
Can I stay?
I don't want to go out in this weather.
I wouldn't have let you go, anyway.
Your thigh touched my hand in passing.
I noticed.
How did it feel?
Soft.
Here I am.
- How's your little family?
- Good.
Really good?
Yes, sure.
In the midst of total moral misery.
Fantastic!
One makes do with what one can.
- And how are you?
- Alright.
- Have you been working?
- A little.
I left my deluxe pen here.
- It's in my room.
- You used it?
I told you never to touch it!
I used it to sign a letter.
I didn't eat it.
Go get it, see for yourself.
There's a girl in your room.
How do you know?
It smells good.
She's asleep.
Aren't you asleep?
Pierre said you were.
I was, earlier.
Good morning, then.
Excuse me.
No harm done.
The girl wasn't asleep.
The girl is Rosemonde.
I got you, didn't I?
You've seen her, after all.
You didn't picture her like that?
She's pretty, isn't she?
I forgot to take my pen.
I came for something, but I already forgot what it was.
You know how to make coffee?
Of course.
Will you make some?
Yes.
I'll call you when it's ready.
I'll call you then.
Paul had problems.
Since he had met Rosemonde three days ago, everything looked different.
Only time remained the same.
It passed.
It's November 23rd.
You shouldn't have slept with Rosemonde.
Why not?
Wouldn't you like to?
It's going to complicate our work.
What do you mean?
We're almost done.
We know a lot about her and about her past.
I've talked to her uncle, her old boss, her coworkers.
I looked up her file at the paper.
I've seen the cops.
Now it's up to you.
I know.
I haven't written a line since I met her.
I knew it would change everything.
Die Ereignisse verwirren mich.
Two Rosemondes are one too many.
And which one's superfluous?
Mine, not the real one.
I've gotta start over.
I have to know more about the real one.
Where are the recordings?
In the bathroom.
I listened to them while I cut my toenails.
The entrance is around back.
Where's the door?
What do you want?
I'm a Civil Defense Inspector.
A real inspector or a phony?
Paul, come here!
A Civil Defense Inspector.
A real one!
Spiritual Defense Section.
Spiritual Defense Section!
What do you wish to inspect?
I'm checking, to see if everyone has their Red Book on Civil Defense.
- I threw mine away.
- Are you sure?
I'm positive.
I must enter that in the "Got Rid of Deliberately" column.
I regret that I'm obliged to do so.
It doesn't add up to much.
Nothing?
You're better at reporting shady investments in Brazil.
Nevertheless, I'll take it.
I'll go home and rewrite the thing in peace.
We'll never finish!
Now I feel I know nothing about Rosemonde.
A reporter repeats his information.
I look for the meaning in mine.
Can you give me a ride home?
Now?
What about your bike?
Do you know how cold it is out?
Why don't you buy a car?
It's pretentious to bike, these days.
I can't afford a car.
You know that.
Get a loan!
Debts are the foundation of sound household economics.
Anyway, they practically give old Mini's away.
- Really?
Where?
- Nearby.
Why don't you want to stay?
My daughter wants to see me.
Children!
Why have them at all?
It's the first law of nature.
So that we feel the burden of existence.
It's to clip our wings.
- For all that.
- In this case...
So, I'll take you home.
Let's have coffee first.
I'm sad.
I think I'm going to sing.
Don't forget to give me the uncle's address.
Her attitude at school was only the start of her delinquency.
The police soon got to know her.
It ended with an attempted murder.
A rifle bullet at point blank range spares no one.
See for yourself.
I'll show you the scar.
No, I don't need to see it.
You're like your colleague, frightened to see a wound.
We both live sheltered lives.
Three days earlier, on November 25th, the migrant worker-trashmen suddenly went on strike.
It was called "A brutal strike!" because it was unexpected and therefore intolerable.
In actuality, the strike was a threat to order and cleanliness, nothing more.
Have you seen the famous scar?
Me?
How awful!
It would turn my stomach.
Has he ever insisted that you see it?
I haven't been there since it happened.
What was it like when you went to live there at sixteen?
When I was sixteen?
Help me answer an ad, and I'll tell you all about it.
I'll tell you everything I did when I was sixteen.
You'll be so shocked, you'll leave me alone.
I already told big Pierre, and I'm not going over it again with li'l Paul.
C'mon, help.
Programmer.
What's that?
Not a job for me, I bet.
Secretary, cook, concierge... salesgirl...
I always talk back to the customers.
Housekeeper, bookstore helper...
Assistant, male, female...
I'll end up stuffing sausage in a bloody factory.
God!
My neck aches from the thought of it.
I always catch it in my neck and forehead.
I'm never going back to their bloody, shitty sausage factory!
Not me!
Never again!
That's it.
My neck aches.
I'm gonna go make myself an aspirin sandwich.
I have a cure for that.
Here, let me.
I met a girl at Pierre's, her name's Zoe.
We made love.
I think it was mainly because of her name.
She had very round breasts.
It's the first time since we've been together.
That shows how time passes.
You're getting old, Paul.
I worked, too.
Badly.
Because of Rosemonde, not Zoe.
Your life's a bit complicated at the moment, darling.
A bit.
I'd like to read you a piece by Heine, which I just found.
He wrote it in 1828.
I'll read it to you.
"We'll have a lovely day!" called my travelling companion."
"We'll have a lovely day!" My heart repeated the words...
"in adoration, and trembled with joy and melancholy."
"Yes, it will be a beautiful day,
"the sun of freedom will warm the earth with more happiness...
"than the noble night stars."
"A new generation will arise,
"conceived in freely chosen embraces,
"not in the bed of duty, or under control of the clergy."
"With free birth,
"free thoughts and feelings will be born, too,
"of which we, the enslaved, have not the slightest inkling."
"Oh!
Just as little as they will know...
"the frightful night of shadows in which we had to live,
"and the horrible battles we fought against hideous specters,
"obtuse owls, and criminal hypocrites."
Don't forget to type that page.
Here's the loveliest of all roses.
Are you working?
Aren't you always working?
I earn a poor living, by the sweat of my brow.
Your fridge is almost empty.
Really?
That doesn't surprise me.
Paul's economizing.
He feeds me nothing but potatoes.
He prepares them twenty-seven ways.
That's impossible.
Ask him.
He's got a sack full in the kitchen.
I'll put some on to boil.
I saw butter in the fridge.
Potatoes at four o"clock?
I'm hungry.
Suzanne's been gone for days.
There's nothing left at home.
You don't have any money?
I'll give you some.
Thanks.
This goes in the same line?
No, this line goes first, then this one, then the other.
I'm going to visit my mother and my son.
Take Paul with you.
He's dying to meet your family, and know your background.
Why don't we all go?
To the country?
I've got to work.
Our village has a quiet little inn, you could work there.
A quiet little inn?
With big country beds, and down comforters?
On the road to adventure!
What quiet!
I think that Paul is going to sing.
No, I was wrong.
Did you bring warm clothes?
My gloves are in the glove compartment.
Winters are chilly in our valley.
Paul, according to you, what are we doing?
Riding down the road in a car.
What I mean is,
Do you think this trip will help our work?
Or are we merely wasting time?
This isn't very serious.
But it's very nice.
I think it's indispensable.
I'm astonished by your doubts.
You don't have any?
Sure I do, but they're different.
After two hours, all distances being short in our little country, they arrived in a beautiful valley.
So, here we are in this awful valley.
Stop here.
I'll walk the rest of the way.
But it's raining.
If my father sees me arrive with you two nitwits, he'll smash everything.
I'll see you at the hotel.
I'd say that you're the nitwit.
No, you are!
Hey!
Where is the hotel?
Down there, on the left.
God, it's cold in this dump!
What a godforsaken place.
Sublime and lugubrious country!
I'd like to see where she lives.
I'll wait till her old man takes off.
What a delightful spot.
What shall we do?
Find the hotel.
I'm cold, hungry, and I need a drink.
My back aches and I'm fed up.
It's not bad, really.
I'll be able to write in peace, while you roam around.
You can report back to me every evening.
As you say, it's not bad!
Still, watch out for Rosemonde's father.
Approach him slowly, little by little, encircle him.
Like the Indians in westerns.
Should I stick feathers in my hair?
Good god, it's cold here!
When you get off the plane in Rio, the first thing that hits you is the humidity.
You smell a mixture of sea salt, pepper, slight putrefaction, pimento, dust, mangroves,
A fantastic sensation...
I'm gonna explore.
And I'm gonna go back to Brazil.
See you later.
Paul wrote in his notebook:
"The lovely little salamander...
"It's black, with yellowish-orange spots."
"The salamander is venomous.
It's the fire's spirit.
"Flames cannot harm it."
Pierre thought:
"What's the point of realizing there's a connection...
"between the crushing of bodies down there...
"and the crushing of the spirit here?"
One could only know it, say it... and still it would roll like a pebble down the gray stream of news.
That's where my father works.
Is he there now?
Yeah.
That's him, the guy over there.
So now's a good time to visit your mother.
He wouldn't have eaten you.
I fry the onions separately, and put the sauce aside for the moment.
He couldn't care less about your cooking.
But I do.
He's not a cook, he writes books.
You write books?
I always say, "Education's a great thing."
Rosemonde's mother, who usually judged people correctly, was wrong this time.
Paul had never studied.
He left school at fifteen.
Did you go to school here?
Yeah, but only for a year.
Before that, we lived in a small town in France.
We moved a lot.
We lived in a sort of farm over there, once.
How was school?
Here it was alright.
But in town it was a disaster.
I don't know.
I didn't like it anymore.
It's really not too warm here.
- Are the winters long?
- Here?
It drags on for at least six months, here.
- You get used to it.
- I couldn't.
You do look sad!
Pierre says you sing when you're sad.
Sing something.
It'll warm you up.
- My voice is frozen.
- Try it anyway.
What should I sing?
"Once there was a Swedish countess."
"She was so beautiful and pale."
"Forester, forester,
"my garter is undone."
"Forester, kneel and fasten it, do not fear."
When you sleep with a woman, do you do the usual, or do you have special tricks?
Very special!
Slut!
Peasant clod!
This is what happened.
The uncle was here, Rosemonde was here.
He cleaned his rifle like this.
The bullet hit the wall back there, behind him.
I checked the room.
Think about it:
How could Rosemonde have shot that way, with the table there?
What's your point?
You talk a lot of nonsense.
And you get on my nerves!
We're stuck.
What are we doing here?
Can you tell me?
Nothing, absolutely nothing.
We're just mucking about.
Oh, happiness is so close!
I feel it coming.
Don't you?
Oh, happiness is so close!
Oh, happiness is so far away and prehistory is so long!
Slowly we approach death.
Before capitalism, in all its perversity, kicks the bucket, and before bureaucracy, with its dull dogmas, passes away, there'll be a lot of bloodshed!
Oh, happiness is so close!
Oh, happiness is so far away!
Are we lost?
No, we can get out that way.
On the path.
- That path?
- Yeah, this way.
This is the way to the Promised Land!
You think?
The exit looks rather blocked.
We have no choice.
It's either this way to the Promised Land, or this way...to barbarism,
and the programmed intoxication brought about by technocrats.
With the approval of the silent majority.
That's right!
Oh, happiness is so close.
Oh, happiness is so far away...
A silent majority is composed of people like us, with arms and legs, who, from time to time, isolated by the secrecy of polling booths lined up like urinals, vote for louses and scoundrels.
Here's the bill for our four days here.
That's not bad.
No, but it's bad if you consider that we're practically broke.
How much have you got left of your share?
Not much, once we pay this.
Where'd it go?
Did you blow it all in a month?
I paid a few things.
You had debts, too?
No, just things to be paid.
- Let's do our accounts.
- What for?
If there's no cash, there's no cash.
How much did you give Rosemonde?
Five hundred, I think.
We owed her that, at least.
We've gotta find a way out.
That's for sure.
We're gonna have to take emergency measures.
What's more,
I feel like our story has reached a dead end.
A dead end?
We have to start over.
In the first person this time.
We know Rosemonde too well.
It hampers our story.
Only she can put us straight.
I'm twenty-three.
If I had been born six days later,
I would've been named Heliodore.
My breasts are small.
I like the shape of my legs.
I'm blonde.
I've always fended for myself, and I like it.
Are you awake?
Estelle quit, so I spoke to the boss about you.
You can start tomorrow, if you want.
They have a hard time getting salesgirls.
You spoke to him?
It's easy, honest.
I'll help you at first.
People hate my independence, they try to break me down.
They say I'm lazy, unruly and hysterical.
Shoes, shoes, shoes...
Why do you always take on pretty girls who are hopeless?
Look how she's dressed: for the beach!
Old crows don't sell anything nowadays, mother.
She told one customer his shoes were rotten.
Tell her to do her job properly.
Go on, tell her!
Get a move on!
How do you like it here?
It's alright.
How would you like to go for a ride in my Alfa?
I'd prefer a motorcycle.
Do you have a motorcycle?
No, I don't.
Too bad.
I guess you'll have to take your mother for a ride then.
Happily.
We won't bother you again.
But to finish this, we need to know a few more things.
You were 15 when you left home.
How'd that come about?
What were your thoughts at the time?
When I was fifteen?
When I was fifteen,
I had cute little feet.
One day I went to the ball in glass slippers.
There I met the King's son, who had great big feet, with big toes.
Nicer than yours.
And your shoes are ugly and dirty!
I'm like a dog on all fours these days, seeing nothing but feet.
All I see in the street are people's dreadful shoes.
All I hear are the sounds of their soles, it's terrible!
And all those disgusting socks!
You look so funny.
Like Laurel and Hardy.
No work today.
- Why not?
- Because it's Sunday.
Because we're stuck.
We're at a dead end with Rosemonde.
What do we do now?
- We'll read the papers.
- They give me hives.
We're bored, aren't we?
Well, it is Sunday.
Do you want to sing?
No, I'd rather chew my balls.
Listen, there's an idea I've had for a long time.
It needs two to work it, and you're just right.
What cheek!
Pestering us like that!
On Sunday, no less, and in our Geneva trams!
This is inconceivable!
Give us some peace and quiet!
No one complains!
Are you all cowards?
All you do is read the paper!
Haven't you had enough of Italians and Spaniards without Turks, too?
It's unbelievable!
I'm telling you, sir.
Listen to me, madam.
Soon we'll have negroes dancing in our trams!
Drums and all.
Cowards!
You're all cowards!
Can't you make him shut up?
Do it yourself, if you're so clever.
You keep your mouth shut!
He's right, we're foreigners.
Exactly, foreigners in our own country!
It was December 12th.
The tram business nearly came to a nasty end when they told the passengers it was only a joke.
Sleeping like angels!
It's awkward for you.
Only you and the boss have keys.
That would seem to narrow the line of questioning.
You went to bed early last night and slept soundly.
I told you.
Suzanne can confirm it.
Work here long?
A few days.
- And before?
- At Sogex.
Why did you leave Sogex?
I didn't like it.
Do you like it here?
It's okay.
Hi.
How are you?
What time is it?
3:30.
Not working this afternoon?
And you?
Is your story almost finished?
We're rather stuck.
You don't look very chipper yourself.
I'm not going back to the shop.
Why not?
I left, that's all.
It's not the first time.
Get in a fight?
We can't help you much, this time.
The finances of our little household are in crisis, about to pass from a cyclic to an endemic state.
Know what that means?
This is cyclic.
And this is endemic.
I haven't asked for anything!
What happened?
She quit, as usual.
We could title our story:
"Rosemonde, Just Passing Through."
The cops are after me again.
They were in the shop today, questioning people.
The shop was robbed last night.
Naturally they questioned me most of all.
I know they suspect me, it was clear.
So I acted a bit pissed at them.
After lunch, I didn't go back.
To hell with the place!
You had nothing to do with it?
Of course not.
Was there a break-in?
That's just it.
Someone had the keys.
My key was in my coat.
I'm not a sleepwalker!
- And Roger?
- What about him?
He could have taken the key.
No one touched it!
And I haven't seen Roger in a week!
What is he to you?
I like him.
It's the same with him as it is with you.
What can be done?
You, Rosemonde, pulled the trigger on your uncle.
Yes, it was me.
I didn't mean to, it happened in the heat of the moment.
I'd been fed up with the old fool for some time.
He always found piddling jobs for me, like in the Army.
He preached at me all the time.
I've been scared of my temper ever since.
I don't know what to do anymore...
You better go away.
I know people you could stay with in Paris.
Why should she go to Paris?
You should go to Paris.
That's a stupid idea, it'll only confirm the police's suspicion.
It won't be long until she finds a clue leading to Roger.
- She has to go back to work.
- I won't go.
Not long.
Just a few days.
Just long enough to dispel their suspicions.
I won't go!
Just a few days.
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.
Ready?
What shall I tell them about yesterday afternoon?
I don't know...
Say that the questioning upset you.
Let's go.
I don't want to go.
I'm not going.
Come on.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Because it's amusing.
What's amusing?
I've lived with your doppelganger for a month.
Whenever I went to my room, I knew you'd be there.
I invented you.
Only the shot at your uncle was a reality.
Now you're a reality.
That amuses me.
How did you know I pulled the trigger?
It was a gamble.
I could've gone to prison for a long time.
- How long?
- I don't know.
I imagined you differently, a little fatter, more countrified.
How fat?
Fat as a pig?
No.
Lovely, strapping, beautiful.
Do you like girls like that?
Is your wife like that?
No, she's very slim.
You were very funny.
You knew what you wanted.
And what do you want?
From life?
No, from me.
What do you want?
Me?
I don't know really.
But you do know.
I want people to get off my back.
That's not easy.
No one wants me the way I am.
No one?
Am I no one?
And Pierre?
And Suzanne?
You had three lovers in my story.
- All at once?
- No, one after the other.
You preferred one of them.
What did he look like?
He was...brawny.
Like this.
Like a construction worker I know.
- Was he handsome?
- Magnificent.
He had big hands.
Above all, he was clever.
He showed you the difference between breaking a window and breaking a window.
He taught you how to distinguish friend from foe, and not to break windows on your own anymore.
He explained why your enemies are your enemies.
Did I understand?
Yes, you got the gist.
Why do you write stories?
I'm just doing my bit.
In your story, do they know the truth about the rifle shot?
- Who?
- The cops.
No.
It was quite natural.
It wasn't your fault the rifle was handy.
It had to be of some use one day.
It was better the bullet went here than here.
Did you explain why your fat girl fired?
Why?
She couldn't not be her true self forever.
But the act itself wasn't important.
The important thing is what set things in motion.
The freedom to be yourself is systematically denied to too many people.
- Tell me her story again.
- You'll be late.
- Who were her enemies?
- The same as yours.
And who are my enemies?
Think.
Obviously the foreman at the factory the little boss of the shoe store, his mummy my uncle's cops, and the shoe store's cops.
The boss of law, the boss of sausages, the boss of boots, and the boss of cops!
I'll stop by the shop later.
Good morning, miss.
I'd like to buy a pair of shoes.
This way.
What do you have in mind?
I'd like shoes to put my feet in.
Shoes to walk in, simple shoes.
I think I've got just the thing.
How did it go?
It went alright.
Is he the little boss man?
Shall I punch his face in?
Have you got cash on you?
Yes, twenty francs.
Well, aren't you rich!
I'll see what I have at that price.
What size?
Like this, perhaps?
Nice and warm.
Too warm.
These are no good.
Neither are these.
These are practical.
A bit big.
That's better.
So are these...
That's the left.
And the right?
That looks nice.
But a little too small.
Soft.
Comfortable.
They fit like a glove!
You think?
They're elegant!
Then I'll keep them on, if they're so elegant.
- Sure you're alright?
- Yes, don't worry.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Au revoir, mademoiselle.
Au revoir, mademoiselle?
The second one this week buying tennis shoes...
In December!
Couldn't we use these notes?
No, you can't rehash stuff like that.
So we'll forget the adventures of the lovely Rosemonde?
Yes.
It's not my decision, it was decided by the facts.
Rosemonde engulfed us.
Shit!
What about the television money?
Another little debt.
Anyway, you didn't want to work on it.
I did at first.
I lured you into it.
I'll take responsibility.
That'll teach me.
Someone's knocking.
- Someone to inspect the place.
- Again!
Spiritual Defense were already here.
I represent your landlord's interest.
I'm here to evaluate your furniture.
Huh?
Why?
You signed a lease, which you clearly did not read.
It states that your belongings must equal the value of eighteen months rent.
In your case that's exactly 6,300 francs.
What's the point of all this?
In case non-payment of rent necessitates seizure of your effects.
In case you didn't know, your rent has not been paid in four months.
- Four months?
- Yes.
- Are you the boss?
- Excuse me?
Are you director of the estate?
No, I'm head clerk.
Now, how much is this lot worth?
I don't know.
Do your job, estimate, evaluate.
You sure have a strange job.
What do you mean?
You're not the boss but you have to act like you are.
I'm his legal representative.
What will become of you when property is nationalized?
That day still seems far away.
I'm not sure it will ever come in our country.
And even if it did, there are ways to get around it.
It just takes imagination.
I know a guy who succeeded by inventing a new way of squeezing mayonnaise.
Before, they were ordinary bottles and the mayonaisse squirted out.
He had a brilliant idea of chamfering the edge of the hole so the mayonaisse comes out all twisted and ribbed.
It looks great on sliced hard-boiled eggs.
He made a fortune, and now he's the boss.
The value of the furnishings amounted to scarcely 750 francs.
And that was a generous estimate.
The inspector took note, and left.
What a mess!
I made a decision.
I'm going to Paris.
I've had enough of this awful town.
And the papers, too.
Here or there...
Paris is also unbearable.
That's their problem.
At least I'm not at home there.
Does the Paris paper pay you?
A little.
I'll get by.
I'll find a place to sleep.
And I'll run up debts.
Devaluation is faster in France, and lawsuits are slower here.
I'll sell my car.
Catherine will take the apartment.
If you need a room in town...
Let me give you my phone number.
What's the matter?
You must be crazy.
It looks nice.
You have nice legs.
What are you doing?
Are you mad?
Sir!
Your salesgirl is mad!
She's getting fresh with me!
What happened?
I don't know what came over me.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, madam.
I'll handle it.
I've never seen the likes of it!
Do you need money for Christmas?
When's Christmas?
In five days.
Unfathomable sadness!
- How many days off do we have?
- Three.
What a waste!
Jesus and Maria!
He's sad.
He's going to sing.
It's too early.
I never sing before ten.
Written anything lately?
The story of a girl who tried to kill her uncle.
A serious thing?
An erotic tale?
Not at all.
What are you doing?
Rosemonde!
Yes, sir?
Come here!
You must leave here at once!
Get out!
You're completely mad.
You're a little slut!
Go on, get!
Unbelievable!
Goodbye, madam.
Sir.
Thank you very, very much.
It was the 20th of December.
The so-called holidays approached menacingly.
The crowds assaulted the shops, in accordance with mercantile law.
A tendency towards marked schizophrenia was evident, a sickness which threatened to engulf the entire social strata.
It still hadn't snowed, which, for this time of year, was actually not the least bit unusual.
A color film in monochrome.
Hello?
Paris?
May I speak to Louis Roy?
Louis Roy, like your King Louis, backwards.
Exactly.
Louis?
It's Pierre.
I'm fine, thanks.
Brazil?
Two months of lovely weather, and otherwise ghastly.
You'll have them in a month.
Three articles, like we agreed.
What bullshit!
The Paris newspaper won't take me on at the moment.
Didn't they promise, more or less?
Not definitely.
They've got financial problems.
And I will too, soon.
Won't they pay for the Brazil articles?
Yes, but not much.
I'll have to freelance.
Take up Bernard's offer for that television job.
Oh, right.
I can't write a script for Bernard and my Brazil articles.
Write it with someone else.
With whom?
I don't know.
Your hairy writer friend, Paul.
Not a bad idea.
Paul?
Paul!
A call for you.
Who is it?
Richard Nixon.
Or Leonid Brezhnev.
I don't know which.
One or the other.
That's fine.
Thanks, Paul.
See you soon.
I might not come to work on Monday morning.
Or Monday afternoon.
Maybe not for the whole month.
We're fed up with your comings and goings.
That's our arrangement, I'm not at your beck and call.
He works when he feels like it.
Great!
Isn't it?
Elsewhere, I work harder for nothing.
That's your business.
Exactly, that's my business.
You got on our nerves with your mucking about.
Pack it up!
Paul lived in a secluded spot, but not for love of nature.
He appreciated tranquility, but it was a small house, and the rent was only 100 francs a month, and he appreciated that even more.
We find ourselves in the country's western frontier, two steps from the border, and Switzerland seems to be left behind.
We turn our backs on her.
On the other side of this no-man's land lies France.
A country where one never knows what the next year, or month, will have in store.
Despite appearances, which one should never trust,
Paul was not a plasterer, or a singer, but a writer.
This was October 25th.
The weather was rather dull.
Come in!
Come in!
You've brought a suitcase?
Are you gonna take the job?
- Have you decided?
- No.
But I live 10 miles away, and it's cold.
I've brought my things, in case I stay.
Good thinking!
Well?
You know Bernard, the guy from TV?
- No.
- Nevermind.
He's a friend.
I'm doing a job for him because I need the cash.
I've got to write a story, a script, based on a year old news item.
He wants to film it, and he'll pay in advance.
But since I have to write my Brazil articles,
I'd like for you to help me with it.
OK?
- It depends.
- Depends on what?
Lots of things.
Has your scribbling ever brought in 2,000 francs in a month?
Not counting the poems your wife writes!
Listen.
We'll make 4,000 francs.
We can do the job in one month, they've allowed three.
What more do you want?
I'd like to know the subject, and how we tackle it.
I don't work to order.
- Tell me about the event.
- Very simple.
A story which fizzled out.
A man whose niece lived with him claimed she shot him with his Army rifle.
The bullet hit him in the shoulder.
She denied everything.
She claims the old man hurt himself cleaning his rifle.
There were no witnesses, they both maintained their statements, and the case was dropped.
That's all.
Strange.
There's a press clipping about it, up there.
Bernard would like a sort of sociological study.
The girl's name is Rosemonde.
Rosemonde?
I'd forgotten that.
Doesn't sound bad, Rosemonde.
So?
Hold on.
Are you staying?
- Interested?
- Yes, I am.
How will we work?
Together is more complicated.
We'll make it however you like.
Have you got a calendar with Saints' Days?
- Saints?
- Yes, saints.
Maybe in my diary...
Yeah, here they are...
- What are you looking for?
- Hold on.
Here.
I found it.
April 30th, St. Rosemonde.
As I thought, it's a calendar name.
So what?
- That explains it.
- Explains what?
That the girl wanted to kill her uncle.
Our names are in the calendar, but we don't kill uncles.
Let me explain.
It happened like this:
Rosemonde comes from a big family.
In big families, when the usual names have been exhausted on the first-born brats, the parents run out of ideas, and start using calendar names.
Thus: a big family a swarm of noisy little brats.
A big family means a country family.
They couldn't afford the housing racket in town.
So they live in the country, but not any old stretch of country,
Catholic country, still a little backward.
Contraception unknown, calendar saints, and all that.
The father's a blockhead, education leaves a lot to be desired.
And why does Rosemonde live in town?
That's easy: the father can't make ends meet.
He'll never make a go of things.
Salvation: a brother in town, comfortably off, room to spare, easily put upon.
So he's landed with the girl, and there's one less at home to feed.
What does Rosemonde do in town?
She does miserable jobs, unskilled jobs.
She starts to run wild.
Uncle tries to straighten her out.
They quarrel.
One day he's cleaning his army rifle, and inevitably, Rosemonde being who she is, a shot's fired.
Not a bad story.
I'll stay.
What's your opinion?
Not bad.
There's just one little problem.
Which is?
What about the facts?
I've been stating the facts for five minutes, apart from some minor details.
I feel I've earned my living, today.
Good.
But it may all be a dream.
Why use your imagination when the story actually happened?
The girl and the uncle exist.
They live here somewhere.
I'm interested in facts, in reality.
We must start by coming to grips with that.
You can elaborate later.
First we make inquiries.
I'm not a cop.
- Like a journalist!
- I'm not a journalist!
You work as a plasterer so that you can write what you like.
Good.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
I'll make some coffee.
When you get the sausage, make sure to tie it well.
So we've agreed?
The water's ready.
We'll go about it based on your idea.
You'll write the girl's story as you see it.
I'll visit people with my tape recorder.
and collect as much information as I can, so that you can build your story around it.
Later on we'll go over it all together.
Sound good?
Yeah.
Don't forget, I don't want to know anything about her.
Bring back all you can get on the others.
Warm woolen underpants for winter!
Warm woolen socks for winter!
A pad of special paper!
A deluxe fountain pen!
- And where's the cash?
- In the Bank.
- Sugar?
- Two lumps.
My wife needs my share now.
Whenever you like.
First, Pierre had to find Rosemonde.
Despite some difficulties due to Rosemonde's personality,
Pierre conducted his inquiries with gusto.
She didn't stay more than a month.
You should've seen her room.
An unholy mess!
We've had all sorts here, but she took the cake!
I always say, whenever someone can't be on time
--She was often 15 minutes late-- something's not right.
- Where does she work now?
- I don't know.
She lives in Onex.
I've got her address in my bag.
The investigation began on October 27th.
Today was November 1st.
May I speak with you?
I'm a reporter.
Would you like to come in?
It's a little hard to explain.
It's about your spot of trouble last year, although that's not the main thing.
Really, I'd like to get to know you.
I'm writing a story about someone like you.
I'd like to chat.
I can come back later, if you're busy.
This may sound odd, but my job is made up of odd things.
Isn't it Rosemonde you want to speak to?
- Aren't you Rosemonde?
- No.
I'm Suzanne.
- But she does live here?
- Yes, but she's not in yet.
Would you like to wait?
- Are you on the Pill?
- Yeah.
All the time?
You should be like a Boy Scout:
always ready.
Roger was ready for anything.
Rosemonde prepared herself for damnation.
Are you a reporter?
Anyway, no more about that uncle business.
That's been shelved.
Let's talk about other things.
Like what?
I don't know...about you, for instance.
About your job.
That can wait until hell freezes over!
What can one say about a job?
If Rosemonde tells you about her life, as you say, would you pay her for that?
That could be arranged.
- Is it too long?
- No, I think it's fine.
- I found the girl!
- Bravo!
- Do you want to meet her?
- Definitely not.
She's a bit alright.
I already knew that.
She's even better than you imagine.
I can't see her with a rifle.
I doubt she fired the shot.
Still, everything points to the contrary!
This is Vladimir.
He practices here when his wife can't stand it any longer.
He can keep you company.
Where shall I go?
Up to my room.
You didn't say much on the phone.
But I've got nothing to hide.
You're a journalist?
Yeah.
Have I disturbed your dinner?
No, no, I just finished.
I always eat very early.
Is this the famous rifle?
Yes, that's my army rifle.
Isn't it terrible, to think I was almost killed by it?
The weapon I served with for 30 years?
Through years of looking after it, one gets attached.
It's become more than just a rifle.
For us, it's almost a symbol of our freedom.
It means something to us.
To see it turned on you one day...
True, that's somewhat of a paradox.
She had run-ins with the police before.
It was over a stolen car.
Not to mention, her illegitimate child.
At seventeen!
She's a bad lot!
My brother's not a bad guy, but he never did anything with his life.
Still, it was a big, fine family.
She came from a big family?
Yes, she was put in my care when she was fifteen, so that she could go to school in town.
It meant one less mouth to feed at home.
At fifteen she ran around with delinquents, got up at 10 in the morning, and finally ended up meddling in crime.
Did she have any cause?
No, that's just it!
That's what I don't understand.
While she was here, we treated her like our own daughter.
But she couldn't escape her destiny.
It could well have cost me my life.
- Do you want to see my scar?
- No, it's not necessary.
The worst place is where the bullet came out.
I get awful pains when we have our famous north wind.
Unlike the uncle, Paul liked the wind very much.
Paul waited for two days, but there was no wind.
I've had it.
After work, I always feel like yelling or breaking something.
When I feel up to it, I go swimming.
Be patient.
In 40 years, you can retire.
Have you worked there long?
Three months already, but it feels like a lifetime.
I'll stay six months at the most.
- Will you get a pension?
- No.
That's my big regret.
Sometimes I imagine how
I'd get up at 10, flop around in slippers, make some coffee, run a bath, go down
and fetch the paper.
At lunch time I'd rustle up a meal.
What a life!
A monthly pension.
Card games at the pub.
A dream!
Yes, but by then one's too old.
That's true.
One no longer makes love.
Great!
There's a jukebox.
Do you have a coin?
Sit over here.
A cup of coffee.
Do you want anything?
And a coke.
This isn't ideal for a chat.
You can take me home later.
We can talk there.
What are you doing?
Taking your picture.
Is that okay?
I look a sight.
What will you do with them?
Nothing.
They're for my friend, for our work.
- Really?
- Of course.
What did you think?
Alright.
But I want to see them.
I'll give them to you if you like.
Wait, let me tidy up.
You look gorgeous, stay like that.
I'll be right back.
Move a little.
Walk a bit, from right to left.
Now sit on the table.
Just relax.
Perfect.
The last ones are the best.
I think that'll do.
Anyway, this is less dangerous than a rifle.
Was it a shotgun?
No, an Army rifle.
- Will you see my uncle?
- Probably.
He'll say I tried to shoot him, the old liar.
He hated me, because I'd had it with being his maid.
I couldn't even have lifted his rifle!
Those things are heavy!
Did you see it happen?
No, I was in the other room.
He was fiddling with his rifle.
Cleaning it for the umpteenth time.
I'd seen him the moment before.
Suddenly I heard a huge bang.
I rushed in and found my uncle on the floor.
You should have seen it!
I called the doctor.
Afterwards he called the police.
That's how it all started.
He put the blame on me.
- Did you hate him?
- Me?
No.
He's just an old prick, that's all.
As simple as that?
Aren't you working?
- I'll finish this game first.
- Are you working upstairs?
No, down here.
I need space to walk around.
I have a lot of people:
A big family, a maimed uncle, a big rifle, defense of our freedom, and that's not all.
For your poems you only have to picture the inside of your skull.
How's it going with Pierre?
Fine.
It's a good time.
It's a change for me.
I'm between a blank page and a construction site.
Do you want something to eat?
No, I'm not hungry.
Are you crazy?
They'll throw us out.
Should we go to my place to record?
If you want.
Finish your drink.
When I was small,
I went on lots of country walks with my older brother.
His big specialty was breaking windows, especially in winter, when he could make snowballs.
He was real strong.
His snowballs were like stones.
Once my father thrashed us, but he discovered my brother was stronger than him.
He never touched us after that.
I've always loved the sound of breaking windows.
You mentioned your father.
Oh god, my father...
He never had a steady job, it all depended.
When he had too much to drink, all hell broke loose at home.
He works at a sawmill now.
And your mother?
I love her, she's great.
We get along.
I visit her from time to time.
With all the kids she's brought into the world...
How many brothers and sisters?
Ten.
Ten?
- Eleven, counting you?
- Yeah.
I was the seventh.
Mother's never worn out.
She adores the little brats.
When I had a kid...
- A kid?
- Yeah, that was six years ago.
- I wanted to keep it.
- But you couldn't.
Why not?
You weren't married, were you?
No, but I wanted to keep it.
Mother took him at once.
What was one more or less to her?
Simple as that.
What's the child's name?
- Jean.
- A boy?
Yes.
My uncle thought that I was a bitch.
He wanted to put me in reform school.
No, that was after the car business.
That was nothing.
Albert, a friend of mine, had taken a car to go for a drive.
We had a drink in the village, and a cop asked for our papers just as we were leaving.
They only took my name, but they nabbed Albert.
No, wait, I had to go to court.
And reform school?
I never went.
What for?
Then I started as a dressmaker's apprentice.
That satisfied my uncle.
- Are you a dressmaker?
- No, I never finished.
Why not?
I don't like dressmaking.
Pierre thought that was as good a reason as any.
And Paul wrote:
"Heliodore", that was Rosemonde's name in the story,
"had little taste for what is called a trade."
"Where one learns an honest, which means poor, living."
"Where one's at everyone's beck and call."
"Where freedom means a quick smoke in the bathroom."
I was told I was pretty enough to be a hostess.
A stewardess, perhaps?
No, you need languages for that.
Some other hostess.
A department store hostess, with a little hat?
Maybe, but I like to dress how I like.
I don't like uniforms.
What did you do after the dressmaking?
Mostly housework for my uncle.
I was used to such work.
There was always plenty at home, scrubbing my brothers and sisters.
I did some other jobs too.
I was a salesgirl, and I worked in a macaroni factory.
But not for long.
Others stay.
I never do.
I'm not quite normal.
At least that's what people say.
"It slowly dawned on Heliodore that it was not the others, but she who was normal."
"That her desires were basically normal."
"Consequently, what wasn't normal had to be outside her, since she and the world didn't hit it off."
Once I went to the Riviera with Albert.
He had his own car then.
My uncle informed the police.
I'd gone off without telling him.
He thought I'd gone off on the loose.
Anyway, they never found us.
It was fantastic!
We went where we liked, slept on the beach.
One evening...
I nearly recorded some porn for you!
That was the last time I saw the sea.
Uncle takes his holidays in the mountains, in a total dump.
He took me there once.
There were two old bags who sang after dinner.
I never left my room.
He almost called the police to have them pry me out.
You don't like them much, do you?
Who, the cops?
I couldn't care less.
Were you involved with them before?
Me?
No, I never did a thing.
My brother, when he was working on a farm, did something stupid once.
The cops came to our house.
And then, when my father slugged a guy, they came again.
And after the thing with my uncle, they hounded me for ages.
Until finally, they left me alone.
And now?
Now?
I feel old.
Even more so than before.
I wonder what will become of me.
I never used to worry about that.
But nevermind.
That's enough for now.
Turn that thing off.
How often must I tell you that people eat what you handle?
Tidy your hair or wear a cap.
Come in!
Is that you?
No, it's me..
What are you doing here?
Aren't you working today?
Is it raining?
No, I went swimming.
A day off?
No, I quit.
Did they fire you?
Lay you off?
No, I left.
I was fed up.
- Do you need money?
- No.
I wanted to see you.
Good idea.
No, bad idea.
It's a good idea, but now's not a good time.
I was hoping you might cheer me up.
Not now.
I don't want to lose my train of thought.
Come back this evening.
You're not much fun!
I don't want to go anywhere.
May I stay here?
I won't say a word.
If you like.
The question of Swiss capital investment in Brazil gave Pierre trouble.
Two hours have passed since Rosemonde arrived.
Outside it was pitch dark.
It's pitch dark out.
I'm staying.
Fine, stay.
I'm sleeping here.
Fine, sleep here.
I'm sleeping in your bed.
I'm staying, I'm sleeping in your bed, and I'm sleeping with you.
I'm staying, I'm sleeping in your bed, and I'm sleeping with you.
I'm taking off my skirt.
Where's the bathroom?
Downstairs,
First door on your left.
No, right.
Is your novel almost finished?
Is your novel almost finished?
Is it all about me?
No, it's about Brazil.
Have you been there?
Really?
The Carnival in Rio, is that in Brazil?
Have you seen it?
No!
Sorry.
Can I watch TV?
Quietly?
.
Very quietly.
How's it work?
Turn the little knob on the left.
I'll be done in a couple minutes.
Are you a nice guy?
Very nice.
Me too.
It depends on the person.
Sometimes I'm terrible.
I'm wild, you know.
But I'm easily tamed.
I believe you.
That's it.
I'm stopping.
I'm hungry.
Are you?
I'll heat the stew Paul made for lunch.
Who is Paul?
My friend.
We work together.
I'll have some too.
Can I stay?
I don't want to go out in this weather.
I wouldn't have let you go, anyway.
Your thigh touched my hand in passing.
I noticed.
How did it feel?
Soft.
Here I am.
- How's your little family?
- Good.
Really good?
Yes, sure.
In the midst of total moral misery.
Fantastic!
One makes do with what one can.
- And how are you?
- Alright.
- Have you been working?
- A little.
I left my deluxe pen here.
- It's in my room.
- You used it?
I told you never to touch it!
I used it to sign a letter.
I didn't eat it.
Go get it, see for yourself.
There's a girl in your room.
How do you know?
It smells good.
She's asleep.
Aren't you asleep?
Pierre said you were.
I was, earlier.
Good morning, then.
Excuse me.
No harm done.
The girl wasn't asleep.
The girl is Rosemonde.
I got you, didn't I?
You've seen her, after all.
You didn't picture her like that?
She's pretty, isn't she?
I forgot to take my pen.
I came for something, but I already forgot what it was.
You know how to make coffee?
Of course.
Will you make some?
Yes.
I'll call you when it's ready.
I'll call you then.
Paul had problems.
Since he had met Rosemonde three days ago, everything looked different.
Only time remained the same.
It passed.
It's November 23rd.
You shouldn't have slept with Rosemonde.
Why not?
Wouldn't you like to?
It's going to complicate our work.
What do you mean?
We're almost done.
We know a lot about her and about her past.
I've talked to her uncle, her old boss, her coworkers.
I looked up her file at the paper.
I've seen the cops.
Now it's up to you.
I know.
I haven't written a line since I met her.
I knew it would change everything.
Die Ereignisse verwirren mich.
Two Rosemondes are one too many.
And which one's superfluous?
Mine, not the real one.
I've gotta start over.
I have to know more about the real one.
Where are the recordings?
In the bathroom.
I listened to them while I cut my toenails.
The entrance is around back.
Where's the door?
What do you want?
I'm a Civil Defense Inspector.
A real inspector or a phony?
Paul, come here!
A Civil Defense Inspector.
A real one!
Spiritual Defense Section.
Spiritual Defense Section!
What do you wish to inspect?
I'm checking, to see if everyone has their Red Book on Civil Defense.
- I threw mine away.
- Are you sure?
I'm positive.
I must enter that in the "Got Rid of Deliberately" column.
I regret that I'm obliged to do so.
It doesn't add up to much.
Nothing?
You're better at reporting shady investments in Brazil.
Nevertheless, I'll take it.
I'll go home and rewrite the thing in peace.
We'll never finish!
Now I feel I know nothing about Rosemonde.
A reporter repeats his information.
I look for the meaning in mine.
Can you give me a ride home?
Now?
What about your bike?
Do you know how cold it is out?
Why don't you buy a car?
It's pretentious to bike, these days.
I can't afford a car.
You know that.
Get a loan!
Debts are the foundation of sound household economics.
Anyway, they practically give old Mini's away.
- Really?
Where?
- Nearby.
Why don't you want to stay?
My daughter wants to see me.
Children!
Why have them at all?
It's the first law of nature.
So that we feel the burden of existence.
It's to clip our wings.
- For all that.
- In this case...
So, I'll take you home.
Let's have coffee first.
I'm sad.
I think I'm going to sing.
Don't forget to give me the uncle's address.
Her attitude at school was only the start of her delinquency.
The police soon got to know her.
It ended with an attempted murder.
A rifle bullet at point blank range spares no one.
See for yourself.
I'll show you the scar.
No, I don't need to see it.
You're like your colleague, frightened to see a wound.
We both live sheltered lives.
Three days earlier, on November 25th, the migrant worker-trashmen suddenly went on strike.
It was called "A brutal strike!" because it was unexpected and therefore intolerable.
In actuality, the strike was a threat to order and cleanliness, nothing more.
Have you seen the famous scar?
Me?
How awful!
It would turn my stomach.
Has he ever insisted that you see it?
I haven't been there since it happened.
What was it like when you went to live there at sixteen?
When I was sixteen?
Help me answer an ad, and I'll tell you all about it.
I'll tell you everything I did when I was sixteen.
You'll be so shocked, you'll leave me alone.
I already told big Pierre, and I'm not going over it again with li'l Paul.
C'mon, help.
Programmer.
What's that?
Not a job for me, I bet.
Secretary, cook, concierge... salesgirl...
I always talk back to the customers.
Housekeeper, bookstore helper...
Assistant, male, female...
I'll end up stuffing sausage in a bloody factory.
God!
My neck aches from the thought of it.
I always catch it in my neck and forehead.
I'm never going back to their bloody, shitty sausage factory!
Not me!
Never again!
That's it.
My neck aches.
I'm gonna go make myself an aspirin sandwich.
I have a cure for that.
Here, let me.
I met a girl at Pierre's, her name's Zoe.
We made love.
I think it was mainly because of her name.
She had very round breasts.
It's the first time since we've been together.
That shows how time passes.
You're getting old, Paul.
I worked, too.
Badly.
Because of Rosemonde, not Zoe.
Your life's a bit complicated at the moment, darling.
A bit.
I'd like to read you a piece by Heine, which I just found.
He wrote it in 1828.
I'll read it to you.
"We'll have a lovely day!" called my travelling companion."
"We'll have a lovely day!" My heart repeated the words...
"in adoration, and trembled with joy and melancholy."
"Yes, it will be a beautiful day,
"the sun of freedom will warm the earth with more happiness...
"than the noble night stars."
"A new generation will arise,
"conceived in freely chosen embraces,
"not in the bed of duty, or under control of the clergy."
"With free birth,
"free thoughts and feelings will be born, too,
"of which we, the enslaved, have not the slightest inkling."
"Oh!
Just as little as they will know...
"the frightful night of shadows in which we had to live,
"and the horrible battles we fought against hideous specters,
"obtuse owls, and criminal hypocrites."
Don't forget to type that page.
Here's the loveliest of all roses.
Are you working?
Aren't you always working?
I earn a poor living, by the sweat of my brow.
Your fridge is almost empty.
Really?
That doesn't surprise me.
Paul's economizing.
He feeds me nothing but potatoes.
He prepares them twenty-seven ways.
That's impossible.
Ask him.
He's got a sack full in the kitchen.
I'll put some on to boil.
I saw butter in the fridge.
Potatoes at four o"clock?
I'm hungry.
Suzanne's been gone for days.
There's nothing left at home.
You don't have any money?
I'll give you some.
Thanks.
This goes in the same line?
No, this line goes first, then this one, then the other.
I'm going to visit my mother and my son.
Take Paul with you.
He's dying to meet your family, and know your background.
Why don't we all go?
To the country?
I've got to work.
Our village has a quiet little inn, you could work there.
A quiet little inn?
With big country beds, and down comforters?
On the road to adventure!
What quiet!
I think that Paul is going to sing.
No, I was wrong.
Did you bring warm clothes?
My gloves are in the glove compartment.
Winters are chilly in our valley.
Paul, according to you, what are we doing?
Riding down the road in a car.
What I mean is,
Do you think this trip will help our work?
Or are we merely wasting time?
This isn't very serious.
But it's very nice.
I think it's indispensable.
I'm astonished by your doubts.
You don't have any?
Sure I do, but they're different.
After two hours, all distances being short in our little country, they arrived in a beautiful valley.
So, here we are in this awful valley.
Stop here.
I'll walk the rest of the way.
But it's raining.
If my father sees me arrive with you two nitwits, he'll smash everything.
I'll see you at the hotel.
I'd say that you're the nitwit.
No, you are!
Hey!
Where is the hotel?
Down there, on the left.
God, it's cold in this dump!
What a godforsaken place.
Sublime and lugubrious country!
I'd like to see where she lives.
I'll wait till her old man takes off.
What a delightful spot.
What shall we do?
Find the hotel.
I'm cold, hungry, and I need a drink.
My back aches and I'm fed up.
It's not bad, really.
I'll be able to write in peace, while you roam around.
You can report back to me every evening.
As you say, it's not bad!
Still, watch out for Rosemonde's father.
Approach him slowly, little by little, encircle him.
Like the Indians in westerns.
Should I stick feathers in my hair?
Good god, it's cold here!
When you get off the plane in Rio, the first thing that hits you is the humidity.
You smell a mixture of sea salt, pepper, slight putrefaction, pimento, dust, mangroves,
A fantastic sensation...
I'm gonna explore.
And I'm gonna go back to Brazil.
See you later.
Paul wrote in his notebook:
"The lovely little salamander...
855 01:17:30,320 -- 01:17:
"belongs to the lizard family."
"It's black, with yellowish-orange spots."
"The salamander is venomous.
It's the fire's spirit.
"Flames cannot harm it."
Pierre thought:
"What's the point of realizing there's a connection...
"between the crushing of bodies down there...
"and the crushing of the spirit here?"
One could only know it, say it... and still it would roll like a pebble down the gray stream of news.
That's where my father works.
Is he there now?
Yeah.
That's him, the guy over there.
So now's a good time to visit your mother.
He wouldn't have eaten you.
I fry the onions separately, and put the sauce aside for the moment.
He couldn't care less about your cooking.
But I do.
He's not a cook, he writes books.
You write books?
I always say, "Education's a great thing."
Rosemonde's mother, who usually judged people correctly, was wrong this time.
Paul had never studied.
He left school at fifteen.
Did you go to school here?
Yeah, but only for a year.
Before that, we lived in a small town in France.
We moved a lot.
We lived in a sort of farm over there, once.
How was school?
Here it was alright.
But in town it was a disaster.
I don't know.
I didn't like it anymore.
It's really not too warm here.
- Are the winters long?
- Here?
It drags on for at least six months, here.
- You get used to it.
- I couldn't.
You do look sad!
Pierre says you sing when you're sad.
Sing something.
It'll warm you up.
- My voice is frozen.
- Try it anyway.
What should I sing?
"Once there was a Swedish countess."
"She was so beautiful and pale."
"Forester, forester,
"my garter is undone."
"Forester, kneel and fasten it, do not fear."
When you sleep with a woman, do you do the usual, or do you have special tricks?
Very special!
Slut!
Peasant clod!
This is what happened.
The uncle was here, Rosemonde was here.
He cleaned his rifle like this.
The bullet hit the wall back there, behind him.
I checked the room.
Think about it:
How could Rosemonde have shot that way, with the table there?
What's your point?
You talk a lot of nonsense.
And you get on my nerves!
We're stuck.
What are we doing here?
Can you tell me?
Nothing, absolutely nothing.
We're just mucking about.
Oh, happiness is so close!
I feel it coming.
Don't you?
Oh, happiness is so close!
Oh, happiness is so far away and prehistory is so long!
Slowly we approach death.
Before capitalism, in all its perversity, kicks the bucket, and before bureaucracy, with its dull dogmas, passes away, there'll be a lot of bloodshed!
Oh, happiness is so close!
Oh, happiness is so far away!
Are we lost?
No, we can get out that way.
On the path.
- That path?
- Yeah, this way.
This is the way to the Promised Land!
You think?
The exit looks rather blocked.
We have no choice.
It's either this way to the Promised Land, or this way...to barbarism,
and the programmed intoxication brought about by technocrats.
With the approval of the silent majority.
That's right!
Oh, happiness is so close.
Oh, happiness is so far away...
A silent majority is composed of people like us, with arms and legs, who, from time to time, isolated by the secrecy of polling booths lined up like urinals, vote for louses and scoundrels.
Here's the bill for our four days here.
That's not bad.
No, but it's bad if you consider that we're practically broke.
How much have you got left of your share?
Not much, once we pay this.
Where'd it go?
Did you blow it all in a month?
I paid a few things.
You had debts, too?
No, just things to be paid.
- Let's do our accounts.
- What for?
If there's no cash, there's no cash.
How much did you give Rosemonde?
Five hundred, I think.
We owed her that, at least.
We've gotta find a way out.
That's for sure.
We're gonna have to take emergency measures.
What's more,
I feel like our story has reached a dead end.
A dead end?
We have to start over.
In the first person this time.
We know Rosemonde too well.
It hampers our story.
Only she can put us straight.
I'm twenty-three.
If I had been born six days later,
I would've been named Heliodore.
My breasts are small.
I like the shape of my legs.
I'm blonde.
I've always fended for myself, and I like it.
Are you awake?
Estelle quit, so I spoke to the boss about you.
You can start tomorrow, if you want.
They have a hard time getting salesgirls.
You spoke to him?
It's easy, honest.
I'll help you at first.
People hate my independence, they try to break me down.
They say I'm lazy, unruly and hysterical.
Shoes, shoes, shoes...
Why do you always take on pretty girls who are hopeless?
Look how she's dressed: for the beach!
Old crows don't sell anything nowadays, mother.
She told one customer his shoes were rotten.
Tell her to do her job properly.
Go on, tell her!
Get a move on!
How do you like it here?
It's alright.
How would you like to go for a ride in my Alfa?
I'd prefer a motorcycle.
Do you have a motorcycle?
No, I don't.
Too bad.
I guess you'll have to take your mother for a ride then.
Happily.
We won't bother you again.
But to finish this, we need to know a few more things.
You were 15 when you left home.
How'd that come about?
What were your thoughts at the time?
When I was fifteen?
When I was fifteen,
I had cute little feet.
One day I went to the ball in glass slippers.
There I met the King's son, who had great big feet, with big toes.
Nicer than yours.
And your shoes are ugly and dirty!
I'm like a dog on all fours these days, seeing nothing but feet.
All I see in the street are people's dreadful shoes.
All I hear are the sounds of their soles, it's terrible!
And all those disgusting socks!
You look so funny.
Like Laurel and Hardy.
No work today.
- Why not?
- Because it's Sunday.
Because we're stuck.
We're at a dead end with Rosemonde.
What do we do now?
- We'll read the papers.
- They give me hives.
We're bored, aren't we?
Well, it is Sunday.
Do you want to sing?
No, I'd rather chew my balls.
Listen, there's an idea I've had for a long time.
It needs two to work it, and you're just right.
What cheek!
Pestering us like that!
On Sunday, no less, and in our Geneva trams!
This is inconceivable!
Give us some peace and quiet!
No one complains!
Are you all cowards?
All you do is read the paper!
Haven't you had enough of Italians and Spaniards without Turks, too?
It's unbelievable!
I'm telling you, sir.
Listen to me, madam.
Soon we'll have negroes dancing in our trams!
Drums and all.
Cowards!
You're all cowards!
Can't you make him shut up?
Do it yourself, if you're so clever.
You keep your mouth shut!
He's right, we're foreigners.
Exactly, foreigners in our own country!
It was December 12th.
The tram business nearly came to a nasty end when they told the passengers it was only a joke.
Sleeping like angels!
It's awkward for you.
Only you and the boss have keys.
That would seem to narrow the line of questioning.
You went to bed early last night and slept soundly.
I told you.
Suzanne can confirm it.
Work here long?
A few days.
- And before?
- At Sogex.
Why did you leave Sogex?
I didn't like it.
Do you like it here?
It's okay.
Hi.
How are you?
What time is it?
3:30.
Not working this afternoon?
And you?
Is your story almost finished?
We're rather stuck.
You don't look very chipper yourself.
I'm not going back to the shop.
Why not?
I left, that's all.
It's not the first time.
Get in a fight?
We can't help you much, this time.
The finances of our little household are in crisis, about to pass from a cyclic to an endemic state.
Know what that means?
This is cyclic.
And this is endemic.
I haven't asked for anything!
What happened?
She quit, as usual.
We could title our story:
"Rosemonde, Just Passing Through."
The cops are after me again.
They were in the shop today, questioning people.
The shop was robbed last night.
Naturally they questioned me most of all.
I know they suspect me, it was clear.
So I acted a bit pissed at them.
After lunch, I didn't go back.
To hell with the place!
You had nothing to do with it?
Of course not.
Was there a break-in?
That's just it.
Someone had the keys.
My key was in my coat.
I'm not a sleepwalker!
- And Roger?
- What about him?
He could have taken the key.
No one touched it!
And I haven't seen Roger in a week!
What is he to you?
I like him.
It's the same with him as it is with you.
What can be done?
You, Rosemonde, pulled the trigger on your uncle.
Yes, it was me.
I didn't mean to, it happened in the heat of the moment.
I'd been fed up with the old fool for some time.
He always found piddling jobs for me, like in the Army.
He preached at me all the time.
I've been scared of my temper ever since.
I don't know what to do anymore...
You better go away.
I know people you could stay with in Paris.
Why should she go to Paris?
You should go to Paris.
That's a stupid idea, it'll only confirm the police's suspicion.
It won't be long until she finds a clue leading to Roger.
- She has to go back to work.
- I won't go.
Not long.
Just a few days.
Just long enough to dispel their suspicions.
I won't go!
Just a few days.
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.
Ready?
What shall I tell them about yesterday afternoon?
I don't know...
Say that the questioning upset you.
Let's go.
I don't want to go.
I'm not going.
Come on.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Because it's amusing.
What's amusing?
I've lived with your doppelganger for a month.
Whenever I went to my room, I knew you'd be there.
I invented you.
Only the shot at your uncle was a reality.
Now you're a reality.
That amuses me.
How did you know I pulled the trigger?
It was a gamble.
I could've gone to prison for a long time.
- How long?
- I don't know.
I imagined you differently, a little fatter, more countrified.
How fat?
Fat as a pig?
No.
Lovely, strapping, beautiful.
Do you like girls like that?
Is your wife like that?
No, she's very slim.
You were very funny.
You knew what you wanted.
And what do you want?
From life?
No, from me.
What do you want?
Me?
I don't know really.
But you do know.
I want people to get off my back.
That's not easy.
No one wants me the way I am.
No one?
Am I no one?
And Pierre?
And Suzanne?
You had three lovers in my story.
- All at once?
- No, one after the other.
You preferred one of them.
What did he look like?
He was...brawny.
Like this.
Like a construction worker I know.
- Was he handsome?
- Magnificent.
He had big hands.
Above all, he was clever.
He showed you the difference between breaking a window and breaking a window.
He taught you how to distinguish friend from foe, and not to break windows on your own anymore.
He explained why your enemies are your enemies.
Did I understand?
Yes, you got the gist.
Why do you write stories?
I'm just doing my bit.
In your story, do they know the truth about the rifle shot?
- Who?
- The cops.
No.
It was quite natural.
It wasn't your fault the rifle was handy.
It had to be of some use one day.
It was better the bullet went here than here.
Did you explain why your fat girl fired?
Why?
She couldn't not be her true self forever.
But the act itself wasn't important.
The important thing is what set things in motion.
The freedom to be yourself is systematically denied to too many people.
- Tell me her story again.
- You'll be late.
- Who were her enemies?
- The same as yours.
And who are my enemies?
Think.
Obviously the foreman at the factory the little boss of the shoe store, his mummy my uncle's cops, and the shoe store's cops.
The boss of law, the boss of sausages, the boss of boots, and the boss of cops!
I'll stop by the shop later.
Good morning, miss.
I'd like to buy a pair of shoes.
This way.
What do you have in mind?
I'd like shoes to put my feet in.
Shoes to walk in, simple shoes.
I think I've got just the thing.
How did it go?
It went alright.
Is he the little boss man?
Shall I punch his face in?
Have you got cash on you?
Yes, twenty francs.
Well, aren't you rich!
I'll see what I have at that price.
What size?
Like this, perhaps?
Nice and warm.
Too warm.
These are no good.
Neither are these.
These are practical.
A bit big.
That's better.
So are these...
That's the left.
And the right?
That looks nice.
But a little too small.
Soft.
Comfortable.
They fit like a glove!
You think?
They're elegant!
Then I'll keep them on, if they're so elegant.
- Sure you're alright?
- Yes, don't worry.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Au revoir, mademoiselle.
Au revoir, mademoiselle?
The second one this week buying tennis shoes...
In December!
Couldn't we use these notes?
No, you can't rehash stuff like that.
So we'll forget the adventures of the lovely Rosemonde?
Yes.
It's not my decision, it was decided by the facts.
Rosemonde engulfed us.
Shit!
What about the television money?
Another little debt.
Anyway, you didn't want to work on it.
I did at first.
I lured you into it.
I'll take responsibility.
That'll teach me.
Someone's knocking.
- Someone to inspect the place.
- Again!
Spiritual Defense were already here.
I represent your landlord's interest.
I'm here to evaluate your furniture.
Huh?
Why?
You signed a lease, which you clearly did not read.
It states that your belongings must equal the value of eighteen months rent.
In your case that's exactly 6,300 francs.
What's the point of all this?
In case non-payment of rent necessitates seizure of your effects.
In case you didn't know, your rent has not been paid in four months.
- Four months?
- Yes.
- Are you the boss?
- Excuse me?
Are you director of the estate?
No, I'm head clerk.
Now, how much is this lot worth?
I don't know.
Do your job, estimate, evaluate.
You sure have a strange job.
What do you mean?
You're not the boss but you have to act like you are.
I'm his legal representative.
What will become of you when property is nationalized?
That day still seems far away.
I'm not sure it will ever come in our country.
And even if it did, there are ways to get around it.
It just takes imagination.
I know a guy who succeeded by inventing a new way of squeezing mayonnaise.
Before, they were ordinary bottles and the mayonaisse squirted out.
He had a brilliant idea of chamfering the edge of the hole so the mayonaisse comes out all twisted and ribbed.
It looks great on sliced hard-boiled eggs.
He made a fortune, and now he's the boss.
The value of the furnishings amounted to scarcely 750 francs.
And that was a generous estimate.
The inspector took note, and left.
What a mess!
I made a decision.
I'm going to Paris.
I've had enough of this awful town.
And the papers, too.
Here or there...
Paris is also unbearable.
That's their problem.
At least I'm not at home there.
Does the Paris paper pay you?
A little.
I'll get by.
I'll find a place to sleep.
And I'll run up debts.
Devaluation is faster in France, and lawsuits are slower here.
I'll sell my car.
Catherine will take the apartment.
If you need a room in town...
Let me give you my phone number.
What's the matter?
You must be crazy.
It looks nice.
You have nice legs.
What are you doing?
Are you mad?
Sir!
Your salesgirl is mad!
She's getting fresh with me!
What happened?
I don't know what came over me.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, madam.
I'll handle it.
I've never seen the likes of it!
Do you need money for Christmas?
When's Christmas?
In five days.
Unfathomable sadness!
- How many days off do we have?
- Three.
What a waste!
Jesus and Maria!
He's sad.
He's going to sing.
It's too early.
I never sing before ten.
Written anything lately?
The story of a girl who tried to kill her uncle.
A serious thing?
An erotic tale?
Not at all.
What are you doing?
Rosemonde!
Yes, sir?
Come here!
You must leave here at once!
Get out!
You're completely mad.
You're a little slut!
Go on, get!
Unbelievable!
Goodbye, madam.
Sir.
Thank you very, very much.
It was the 20th of December.
The so-called holidays approached menacingly.
The crowds assaulted the shops, in accordance with mercantile law.
A tendency towards marked schizophrenia was evident, a sickness which threatened to engulf the entire social strata.
It still hadn't snowed, which, for this time of year, was actually not the least bit unusual.
A color film in monochrome.
Hello?
Paris?
May I speak to Louis Roy?
Louis Roy, like your King Louis, backwards.
Exactly.
Louis?
It's Pierre.
I'm fine, thanks.
Brazil?
Two months of lovely weather, and otherwise ghastly.
You'll have them in a month.
Three articles, like we agreed.
What bullshit!
The Paris newspaper won't take me on at the moment.
Didn't they promise, more or less?
Not definitely.
They've got financial problems.
And I will too, soon.
Won't they pay for the Brazil articles?
Yes, but not much.
I'll have to freelance.
Take up Bernard's offer for that television job.
Oh, right.
I can't write a script for Bernard and my Brazil articles.
Write it with someone else.
With whom?
I don't know.
Your hairy writer friend, Paul.
Not a bad idea.
Paul?
Paul!
A call for you.
Who is it?
Richard Nixon.
Or Leonid Brezhnev.
I don't know which.
One or the other.
That's fine.
Thanks, Paul.
See you soon.
I might not come to work on Monday morning.
Or Monday afternoon.
Maybe not for the whole month.
We're fed up with your comings and goings.
That's our arrangement, I'm not at your beck and call.
He works when he feels like it.
Great!
Isn't it?
Elsewhere, I work harder for nothing.
That's your business.
Exactly, that's my business.
You got on our nerves with your mucking about.
Pack it up!
Paul lived in a secluded spot, but not for love of nature.
He appreciated tranquility, but it was a small house, and the rent was only 100 francs a month, and he appreciated that even more.
We find ourselves in the country's western frontier, two steps from the border, and Switzerland seems to be left behind.
We turn our backs on her.
On the other side of this no-man's land lies France.
A country where one never knows what the next year, or month, will have in store.
Despite appearances, which one should never trust,
Paul was not a plasterer, or a singer, but a writer.
This was October 25th.
The weather was rather dull.
Come in!
Come in!
You've brought a suitcase?
Are you gonna take the job?
- Have you decided?
- No.
But I live 10 miles away, and it's cold.
I've brought my things, in case I stay.
Good thinking!
Well?
You know Bernard, the guy from TV?
- No.
- Nevermind.
He's a friend.
I'm doing a job for him because I need the cash.
I've got to write a story, a script, based on a year old news item.
He wants to film it, and he'll pay in advance.
But since I have to write my Brazil articles,
I'd like for you to help me with it.
OK?
- It depends.
- Depends on what?
Lots of things.
Has your scribbling ever brought in 2,000 francs in a month?
Not counting the poems your wife writes!
Listen.
We'll make 4,000 francs.
We can do the job in one month, they've allowed three.
What more do you want?
I'd like to know the subject, and how we tackle it.
I don't work to order.
- Tell me about the event.
- Very simple.
A story which fizzled out.
A man whose niece lived with him claimed she shot him with his Army rifle.
The bullet hit him in the shoulder.
She denied everything.
She claims the old man hurt himself cleaning his rifle.
There were no witnesses, they both maintained their statements, and the case was dropped.
That's all.
Strange.
There's a press clipping about it, up there.
Bernard would like a sort of sociological study.
The girl's name is Rosemonde.
Rosemonde?
I'd forgotten that.
Doesn't sound bad, Rosemonde.
So?
Hold on.
Are you staying?
- Interested?
- Yes, I am.
How will we work?
Together is more complicated.
We'll make it however you like.
Have you got a calendar with Saints' Days?
- Saints?
- Yes, saints.
Maybe in my diary...
Yeah, here they are...
- What are you looking for?
- Hold on.
Here.
I found it.
April 30th, St. Rosemonde.
As I thought, it's a calendar name.
So what?
- That explains it.
- Explains what?
That the girl wanted to kill her uncle.
Our names are in the calendar, but we don't kill uncles.
Let me explain.
It happened like this:
Rosemonde comes from a big family.
In big families, when the usual names have been exhausted on the first-born brats, the parents run out of ideas, and start using calendar names.
Thus: a big family a swarm of noisy little brats.
A big family means a country family.
They couldn't afford the housing racket in town.
So they live in the country, but not any old stretch of country,
Catholic country, still a little backward.
Contraception unknown, calendar saints, and all that.
The father's a blockhead, education leaves a lot to be desired.
And why does Rosemonde live in town?
That's easy: the father can't make ends meet.
He'll never make a go of things.
Salvation: a brother in town, comfortably off, room to spare, easily put upon.
So he's landed with the girl, and there's one less at home to feed.
What does Rosemonde do in town?
She does miserable jobs, unskilled jobs.
She starts to run wild.
Uncle tries to straighten her out.
They quarrel.
One day he's cleaning his army rifle, and inevitably, Rosemonde being who she is, a shot's fired.
Not a bad story.
I'll stay.
What's your opinion?
Not bad.
There's just one little problem.
Which is?
What about the facts?
I've been stating the facts for five minutes, apart from some minor details.
I feel I've earned my living, today.
Good.
But it may all be a dream.
Why use your imagination when the story actually happened?
The girl and the uncle exist.
They live here somewhere.
I'm interested in facts, in reality.
We must start by coming to grips with that.
You can elaborate later.
First we make inquiries.
I'm not a cop.
- Like a journalist!
- I'm not a journalist!
You work as a plasterer so that you can write what you like.
Good.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
I'll make some coffee.
When you get the sausage, make sure to tie it well.
So we've agreed?
The water's ready.
We'll go about it based on your idea.
You'll write the girl's story as you see it.
I'll visit people with my tape recorder.
and collect as much information as I can, so that you can build your story around it.
Later on we'll go over it all together.
Sound good?
Yeah.
Don't forget, I don't want to know anything about her.
Bring back all you can get on the others.
Warm woolen underpants for winter!
Warm woolen socks for winter!
A pad of special paper!
A deluxe fountain pen!
- And where's the cash?
- In the Bank.
- Sugar?
- Two lumps.
My wife needs my share now.
Whenever you like.
First, Pierre had to find Rosemonde.
Despite some difficulties due to Rosemonde's personality,
Pierre conducted his inquiries with gusto.
She didn't stay more than a month.
You should've seen her room.
An unholy mess!
We've had all sorts here, but she took the cake!
I always say, whenever someone can't be on time
--She was often 15 minutes late-- something's not right.
- Where does she work now?
- I don't know.
She lives in Onex.
I've got her address in my bag.
The investigation began on October 27th.
Today was November 1st.
May I speak with you?
I'm a reporter.
Would you like to come in?
It's a little hard to explain.
It's about your spot of trouble last year, although that's not the main thing.
Really, I'd like to get to know you.
I'm writing a story about someone like you.
I'd like to chat.
I can come back later, if you're busy.
This may sound odd, but my job is made up of odd things.
Isn't it Rosemonde you want to speak to?
- Aren't you Rosemonde?
- No.
I'm Suzanne.
- But she does live here?
- Yes, but she's not in yet.
Would you like to wait?
- Are you on the Pill?
- Yeah.
All the time?
You should be like a Boy Scout: always ready.
Roger was ready for anything.
Rosemonde prepared herself for damnation.
Are you a reporter?
Anyway, no more about that uncle business.
That's been shelved.
Let's talk about other things.
Like what?
I don't know...about you, for instance.
About your job.
That can wait until hell freezes over!
What can one say about a job?
If Rosemonde tells you about her life, as you say, would you pay her for that?
That could be arranged.
- Is it too long?
- No, I think it's fine.
- I found the girl!
- Bravo!
- Do you want to meet her?
- Definitely not.
She's a bit alright.
I already knew that.
She's even better than you imagine.
I can't see her with a rifle.
I doubt she fired the shot.
Still, everything points to the contrary!
This is Vladimir.
He practices here when his wife can't stand it any longer.
He can keep you company.
Where shall I go?
Up to my room.
You didn't say much on the phone.
But I've got nothing to hide.
You're a journalist?
Yeah.
Have I disturbed your dinner?
No, no, I just finished.
I always eat very early.
Is this the famous rifle?
Yes, that's my army rifle.
Isn't it terrible, to think I was almost killed by it?
The weapon I served with for 30 years?
Through years of looking after it, one gets attached.
It's become more than just a rifle.
For us, it's almost a symbol of our freedom.
It means something to us.
To see it turned on you one day...
True, that's somewhat of a paradox.
She had run-ins with the police before.
It was over a stolen car.
Not to mention, her illegitimate child.
At seventeen!
She's a bad lot!
My brother's not a bad guy, but he never did anything with his life.
Still, it was a big, fine family.
She came from a big family?
Yes, she was put in my care when she was fifteen, so that she could go to school in town.
It meant one less mouth to feed at home.
At fifteen she ran around with delinquents, got up at 10 in the morning, and finally ended up meddling in crime.
Did she have any cause?
No, that's just it!
That's what I don't understand.
While she was here, we treated her like our own daughter.
But she couldn't escape her destiny.
It could well have cost me my life.
- Do you want to see my scar?
- No, it's not necessary.
The worst place is where the bullet came out.
I get awful pains when we have our famous north wind.
Unlike the uncle, Paul liked the wind very much.
Paul waited for two days, but there was no wind.
I've had it.
After work, I always feel like yelling or breaking something.
When I feel up to it, I go swimming.
Be patient.
In 40 years, you can retire.
Have you worked there long?
Three months already, but it feels like a lifetime.
I'll stay six months at the most.
- Will you get a pension?
- No.
That's my big regret.
Sometimes I imagine how
I'd get up at 10, flop around in slippers, make some coffee, run a bath, go down
and fetch the paper.
At lunch time I'd rustle up a meal.
What a life!
A monthly pension.
Card games at the pub.
A dream!
Yes, but by then one's too old.
That's true.
One no longer makes love.
Great!
There's a jukebox.
Do you have a coin?
Sit over here.
A cup of coffee.
Do you want anything?
And a coke.
This isn't ideal for a chat.
You can take me home later.
We can talk there.
What are you doing?
Taking your picture.
Is that okay?
I look a sight.
What will you do with them?
Nothing.
They're for my friend, for our work.
- Really?
- Of course.
What did you think?
Alright.
But I want to see them.
I'll give them to you if you like.
Wait, let me tidy up.
You look gorgeous, stay like that.
I'll be right back.
Move a little.
Walk a bit, from right to left.
Now sit on the table.
Just relax.
Perfect.
The last ones are the best.
I think that'll do.
Anyway, this is less dangerous than a rifle.
Was it a shotgun?
No, an Army rifle.
- Will you see my uncle?
- Probably.
He'll say I tried to shoot him, the old liar.
He hated me, because I'd had it with being his maid.
I couldn't even have lifted his rifle!
Those things are heavy!
Did you see it happen?
No, I was in the other room.
He was fiddling with his rifle.
Cleaning it for the umpteenth time.
I'd seen him the moment before.
Suddenly I heard a huge bang.
I rushed in and found my uncle on the floor.
You should have seen it!
I called the doctor.
Afterwards he called the police.
That's how it all started.
He put the blame on me.
- Did you hate him?
- Me?
No.
He's just an old prick, that's all.
As simple as that?
Aren't you working?
- I'll finish this game first.
- Are you working upstairs?
No, down here.
I need space to walk around.
I have a lot of people:
A big family, a maimed uncle, a big rifle, defense of our freedom, and that's not all.
For your poems you only have to picture the inside of your skull.
How's it going with Pierre?
Fine.
It's a good time.
It's a change for me.
I'm between a blank page and a construction site.
Do you want something to eat?
No, I'm not hungry.
Are you crazy?
They'll throw us out.
Should we go to my place to record?
If you want.
Finish your drink.
When I was small,
I went on lots of country walks with my older brother.
His big specialty was breaking windows, especially in winter, when he could make snowballs.
He was real strong.
His snowballs were like stones.
Once my father thrashed us, but he discovered my brother was stronger than him.
He never touched us after that.
I've always loved the sound of breaking windows.
You mentioned your father.
Oh god, my father...
He never had a steady job, it all depended.
When he had too much to drink, all hell broke loose at home.
He works at a sawmill now.
And your mother?
I love her, she's great.
We get along.
I visit her from time to time.
With all the kids she's brought into the world...
How many brothers and sisters?
Ten.
Ten?
- Eleven, counting you?
- Yeah.
I was the seventh.
Mother's never worn out.
She adores the little brats.
When I had a kid...
- A kid?
- Yeah, that was six years ago.
- I wanted to keep it.
- But you couldn't.
Why not?
You weren't married, were you?
No, but I wanted to keep it.
Mother took him at once.
What was one more or less to her?
Simple as that.
What's the child's name?
- Jean.
- A boy?
Yes.
My uncle thought that I was a bitch.
He wanted to put me in reform school.
No, that was after the car business.
That was nothing.
Albert, a friend of mine, had taken a car to go for a drive.
We had a drink in the village, and a cop asked for our papers just as we were leaving.
They only took my name, but they nabbed Albert.
No, wait, I had to go to court.
And reform school?
I never went.
What for?
Then I started as a dressmaker's apprentice.
That satisfied my uncle.
- Are you a dressmaker?
- No, I never finished.
Why not?
I don't like dressmaking.
Pierre thought that was as good a reason as any.
And Paul wrote:
"Heliodore", that was Rosemonde's name in the story,
"had little taste for what is called a trade."
"Where one learns an honest, which means poor, living."
"Where one's at everyone's beck and call."
"Where freedom means a quick smoke in the bathroom."
I was told I was pretty enough to be a hostess.
A stewardess, perhaps?
No, you need languages for that.
Some other hostess.
A department store hostess, with a little hat?
Maybe, but I like to dress how I like.
I don't like uniforms.
What did you do after the dressmaking?
Mostly housework for my uncle.
I was used to such work.
There was always plenty at home, scrubbing my brothers and sisters.
I did some other jobs too.
I was a salesgirl, and I worked in a macaroni factory.
But not for long.
Others stay.
I never do.
I'm not quite normal.
At least that's what people say.
"It slowly dawned on Heliodore that it was not the others, but she who was normal."
"That her desires were basically normal."
"Consequently, what wasn't normal had to be outside her, since she and the world didn't hit it off."
Once I went to the Riviera with Albert.
He had his own car then.
My uncle informed the police.
I'd gone off without telling him.
He thought I'd gone off on the loose.
Anyway, they never found us.
It was fantastic!
We went where we liked, slept on the beach.
One evening...
I nearly recorded some porn for you!
That was the last time I saw the sea.
Uncle takes his holidays in the mountains, in a total dump.
He took me there once.
There were two old bags who sang after dinner.
I never left my room.
He almost called the police to have them pry me out.
You don't like them much, do you?
Who, the cops?
I couldn't care less.
Were you involved with them before?
Me?
No, I never did a thing.
My brother, when he was working on a farm, did something stupid once.
The cops came to our house.
And then, when my father slugged a guy, they came again.
And after the thing with my uncle, they hounded me for ages.
Until finally, they left me alone.
And now?
Now?
I feel old.
Even more so than before.
I wonder what will become of me.
I never used to worry about that.
But nevermind.
That's enough for now.
Turn that thing off.
How often must I tell you that people eat what you handle?
Tidy your hair or wear a cap.
Come in!
Is that you?
No, it's me..
What are you doing here?
Aren't you working today?
Is it raining?
No, I went swimming.
A day off?
No, I quit.
Did they fire you?
Lay you off?
No, I left.
I was fed up.
- Do you need money?
- No.
I wanted to see you.
Good idea.
No, bad idea.
It's a good idea, but now's not a good time.
I was hoping you might cheer me up.
Not now.
I don't want to lose my train of thought.
Come back this evening.
You're not much fun!
I don't want to go anywhere.
May I stay here?
I won't say a word.
If you like.
The question of Swiss capital investment in Brazil gave Pierre trouble.
Two hours have passed since Rosemonde arrived.
Outside it was pitch dark.
It's pitch dark out.
I'm staying.
Fine, stay.
I'm sleeping here.
Fine, sleep here.
I'm sleeping in your bed.
I'm staying, I'm sleeping in your bed, and I'm sleeping with you.
I'm staying, I'm sleeping in your bed, and I'm sleeping with you.
I'm taking off my skirt.
Where's the bathroom?
Downstairs,
First door on your left.
No, right.
Is your novel almost finished?
Is your novel almost finished?
Is it all about me?
No, it's about Brazil.
Have you been there?
Really?
The Carnival in Rio, is that in Brazil?
Have you seen it?
No!
Sorry.
Can I watch TV?
Quietly?
.
Very quietly.
How's it work?
Turn the little knob on the left.
I'll be done in a couple minutes.
Are you a nice guy?
Very nice.
Me too.
It depends on the person.
Sometimes I'm terrible.
I'm wild, you know.
But I'm easily tamed.
I believe you.
That's it.
I'm stopping.
I'm hungry.
Are you?
I'll heat the stew Paul made for lunch.
Who is Paul?
My friend.
We work together.
I'll have some too.
Can I stay?
I don't want to go out in this weather.
I wouldn't have let you go, anyway.
Your thigh touched my hand in passing.
I noticed.
How did it feel?
Soft.
Here I am.
- How's your little family?
- Good.
Really good?
Yes, sure.
In the midst of total moral misery.
Fantastic!
One makes do with what one can.
- And how are you?
- Alright.
- Have you been working?
- A little.
I left my deluxe pen here.
- It's in my room.
- You used it?
I told you never to touch it!
I used it to sign a letter.
I didn't eat it.
Go get it, see for yourself.
There's a girl in your room.
How do you know?
It smells good.
She's asleep.
Aren't you asleep?
Pierre said you were.
I was, earlier.
Good morning, then.
Excuse me.
No harm done.
The girl wasn't asleep.
The girl is Rosemonde.
I got you, didn't I?
You've seen her, after all.
You didn't picture her like that?
She's pretty, isn't she?
I forgot to take my pen.
I came for something, but I already forgot what it was.
You know how to make coffee?
Of course.
Will you make some?
Yes.
I'll call you when it's ready.
I'll call you then.
Paul had problems.
Since he had met Rosemonde three days ago, everything looked different.
Only time remained the same.
It passed.
It's November 23rd.
You shouldn't have slept with Rosemonde.
Why not?
Wouldn't you like to?
It's going to complicate our work.
What do you mean?
We're almost done.
We know a lot about her and about her past.
I've talked to her uncle, her old boss, her coworkers.
I looked up her file at the paper.
I've seen the cops.
Now it's up to you.
I know.
I haven't written a line since I met her.
I knew it would change everything.
Die Ereignisse verwirren mich.
Two Rosemondes are one too many.
And which one's superfluous?
Mine, not the real one.
I've gotta start over.
I have to know more about the real one.
Where are the recordings?
In the bathroom.
I listened to them while I cut my toenails.
The entrance is around back.
Where's the door?
What do you want?
I'm a Civil Defense Inspector.
A real inspector or a phony?
Paul, come here!
A Civil Defense Inspector.
A real one!
Spiritual Defense Section.
Spiritual Defense Section!
What do you wish to inspect?
I'm checking, to see if everyone has their Red Book on Civil Defense.
- I threw mine away.
- Are you sure?
I'm positive.
I must enter that in the "Got Rid of Deliberately" column.
I regret that I'm obliged to do so.
It doesn't add up to much.
Nothing?
You're better at reporting shady investments in Brazil.
Nevertheless, I'll take it.
I'll go home and rewrite the thing in peace.
We'll never finish!
Now I feel I know nothing about Rosemonde.
A reporter repeats his information.
I look for the meaning in mine.
Can you give me a ride home?
Now?
What about your bike?
Do you know how cold it is out?
Why don't you buy a car?
It's pretentious to bike, these days.
I can't afford a car.
You know that.
Get a loan!
Debts are the foundation of sound household economics.
Anyway, they practically give old Mini's away.
- Really?
Where?
- Nearby.
Why don't you want to stay?
My daughter wants to see me.
Children!
Why have them at all?
It's the first law of nature.
So that we feel the burden of existence.
It's to clip our wings.
- For all that.
- In this case...
So, I'll take you home.
Let's have coffee first.
I'm sad.
I think I'm going to sing.
Don't forget to give me the uncle's address.
Her attitude at school was only the start of her delinquency.
The police soon got to know her.
It ended with an attempted murder.
A rifle bullet at point blank range spares no one.
See for yourself.
I'll show you the scar.
No, I don't need to see it.
You're like your colleague, frightened to see a wound.
We both live sheltered lives.
Three days earlier, on November 25th, the migrant worker-trashmen suddenly went on strike.
It was called "A brutal strike!" because it was unexpected and therefore intolerable.
In actuality, the strike was a threat to order and cleanliness, nothing more.
Have you seen the famous scar?
Me?
How awful!
It would turn my stomach.
Has he ever insisted that you see it?
I haven't been there since it happened.
What was it like when you went to live there at sixteen?
When I was sixteen?
Help me answer an ad, and I'll tell you all about it.
I'll tell you everything I did when I was sixteen.
You'll be so shocked, you'll leave me alone.
I already told big Pierre, and I'm not going over it again with li'l Paul.
C'mon, help.
Programmer.
What's that?
Not a job for me, I bet.
Secretary, cook, concierge... salesgirl...
I always talk back to the customers.
Housekeeper, bookstore helper...
Assistant, male, female...
I'll end up stuffing sausage in a bloody factory.
God!
My neck aches from the thought of it.
I always catch it in my neck and forehead.
I'm never going back to their bloody, shitty sausage factory!
Not me!
Never again!
That's it.
My neck aches.
I'm gonna go make myself an aspirin sandwich.
I have a cure for that.
Here, let me.
I met a girl at Pierre's, her name's Zoe.
We made love.
I think it was mainly because of her name.
She had very round breasts.
It's the first time since we've been together.
That shows how time passes.
You're getting old, Paul.
I worked, too.
Badly.
Because of Rosemonde, not Zoe.
Your life's a bit complicated at the moment, darling.
A bit.
I'd like to read you a piece by Heine, which I just found.
He wrote it in 1828.
I'll read it to you.
"We'll have a lovely day!" called my travelling companion."
"We'll have a lovely day!" My heart repeated the words...
"in adoration, and trembled with joy and melancholy."
"Yes, it will be a beautiful day,
"the sun of freedom will warm the earth with more happiness...
"than the noble night stars."
"A new generation will arise,
"conceived in freely chosen embraces,
"not in the bed of duty, or under control of the clergy."
"With free birth,
"free thoughts and feelings will be born, too,
"of which we, the enslaved, have not the slightest inkling."
"Oh!
Just as little as they will know...
"the frightful night of shadows in which we had to live,
"and the horrible battles we fought against hideous specters,
"obtuse owls, and criminal hypocrites."
Don't forget to type that page.
Here's the loveliest of all roses.
Are you working?
Aren't you always working?
I earn a poor living, by the sweat of my brow.
Your fridge is almost empty.
Really?
That doesn't surprise me.
Paul's economizing.
He feeds me nothing but potatoes.
He prepares them twenty-seven ways.
That's impossible.
Ask him.
He's got a sack full in the kitchen.
I'll put some on to boil.
I saw butter in the fridge.
Potatoes at four o"clock?
I'm hungry.
Suzanne's been gone for days.
There's nothing left at home.
You don't have any money?
I'll give you some.
Thanks.
This goes in the same line?
No, this line goes first, then this one, then the other.
I'm going to visit my mother and my son.
Take Paul with you.
He's dying to meet your family, and know your background.
Why don't we all go?
To the country?
I've got to work.
Our village has a quiet little inn, you could work there.
A quiet little inn?
With big country beds, and down comforters?
On the road to adventure!
What quiet!
I think that Paul is going to sing.
No, I was wrong.
Did you bring warm clothes?
My gloves are in the glove compartment.
Winters are chilly in our valley.
Paul, according to you, what are we doing?
Riding down the road in a car.
What I mean is,
Do you think this trip will help our work?
Or are we merely wasting time?
This isn't very serious.
But it's very nice.
I think it's indispensable.
I'm astonished by your doubts.
You don't have any?
Sure I do, but they're different.
After two hours, all distances being short in our little country, they arrived in a beautiful valley.
So, here we are in this awful valley.
Stop here.
I'll walk the rest of the way.
But it's raining.
If my father sees me arrive with you two nitwits, he'll smash everything.
I'll see you at the hotel.
I'd say that you're the nitwit.
No, you are!
Hey!
Where is the hotel?
Down there, on the left.
God, it's cold in this dump!
What a godforsaken place.
Sublime and lugubrious country!
I'd like to see where she lives.
I'll wait till her old man takes off.
What a delightful spot.
What shall we do?
Find the hotel.
I'm cold, hungry, and I need a drink.
My back aches and I'm fed up.
It's not bad, really.
I'll be able to write in peace, while you roam around.
You can report back to me every evening.
As you say, it's not bad!
Still, watch out for Rosemonde's father.
Approach him slowly, little by little, encircle him.
Like the Indians in westerns.
Should I stick feathers in my hair?
Good god, it's cold here!
When you get off the plane in Rio, the first thing that hits you is the humidity.
You smell a mixture of sea salt, pepper, slight putrefaction, pimento, dust, mangroves,
A fantastic sensation...
I'm gonna explore.
And I'm gonna go back to Brazil.
See you later.
Paul wrote in his notebook:
"The lovely little salamander...
855 01:17:30,320 -- 01:17:
"belongs to the lizard family."
"It's black, with yellowish-orange spots."
"The salamander is venomous.
It's the fire's spirit.
"Flames cannot harm it."
Pierre thought:
"What's the point of realizing there's a connection...
"between the crushing of bodies down there...
"and the crushing of the spirit here?"
One could only know it, say it... and still it would roll like a pebble down the gray stream of news.
That's where my father works.
Is he there now?
Yeah.
That's him, the guy over there.
So now's a good time to visit your mother.
He wouldn't have eaten you.
I fry the onions separately, and put the sauce aside for the moment.
He couldn't care less about your cooking.
But I do.
He's not a cook, he writes books.
You write books?
I always say, "Education's a great thing."
Rosemonde's mother, who usually judged people correctly, was wrong this time.
Paul had never studied.
He left school at fifteen.
Did you go to school here?
Yeah, but only for a year.
Before that, we lived in a small town in France.
We moved a lot.
We lived in a sort of farm over there, once.
How was school?
Here it was alright.
But in town it was a disaster.
I don't know.
I didn't like it anymore.
It's really not too warm here.
- Are the winters long?
- Here?
It drags on for at least six months, here.
- You get used to it.
- I couldn't.
You do look sad!
Pierre says you sing when you're sad.
Sing something.
It'll warm you up.
- My voice is frozen.
- Try it anyway.
What should I sing?
"Once there was a Swedish countess."
"She was so beautiful and pale."
"Forester, forester,
"my garter is undone."
"Forester, kneel and fasten it, do not fear."
When you sleep with a woman, do you do the usual, or do you have special tricks?
Very special!
Slut!
Peasant clod!
This is what happened.
The uncle was here, Rosemonde was here.
He cleaned his rifle like this.
The bullet hit the wall back there, behind him.
I checked the room.
Think about it:
How could Rosemonde have shot that way, with the table there?
What's your point?
You talk a lot of nonsense.
And you get on my nerves!
We're stuck.
What are we doing here?
Can you tell me?
Nothing, absolutely nothing.
We're just mucking about.
Oh, happiness is so close!
I feel it coming.
Don't you?
Oh, happiness is so close!
Oh, happiness is so far away and prehistory is so long!
Slowly we approach death.
Before capitalism, in all its perversity, kicks the bucket, and before bureaucracy, with its dull dogmas, passes away, there'll be a lot of bloodshed!
Oh, happiness is so close!
Oh, happiness is so far away!
Are we lost?
No, we can get out that way.
On the path.
- That path?
- Yeah, this way.
This is the way to the Promised Land!
You think?
The exit looks rather blocked.
We have no choice.
It's either this way to the Promised Land, or this way...to barbarism,
and the programmed intoxication brought about by technocrats.
With the approval of the silent majority.
That's right!
Oh, happiness is so close.
Oh, happiness is so far away...
A silent majority is composed of people like us, with arms and legs, who, from time to time, isolated by the secrecy of polling booths lined up like urinals, vote for louses and scoundrels.
Here's the bill for our four days here.
That's not bad.
No, but it's bad if you consider that we're practically broke.
How much have you got left of your share?
Not much, once we pay this.
Where'd it go?
Did you blow it all in a month?
I paid a few things.
You had debts, too?
No, just things to be paid.
- Let's do our accounts.
- What for?
If there's no cash, there's no cash.
How much did you give Rosemonde?
Five hundred, I think.
We owed her that, at least.
We've gotta find a way out.
That's for sure.
We're gonna have to take emergency measures.
What's more,
I feel like our story has reached a dead end.
A dead end?
We have to start over.
In the first person this time.
We know Rosemonde too well.
It hampers our story.
Only she can put us straight.
I'm twenty-three.
If I had been born six days later,
I would've been named Heliodore.
My breasts are small.
I like the shape of my legs.
I'm blonde.
I've always fended for myself, and I like it.
Are you awake?
Estelle quit, so I spoke to the boss about you.
You can start tomorrow, if you want.
They have a hard time getting salesgirls.
You spoke to him?
It's easy, honest.
I'll help you at first.
People hate my independence, they try to break me down.
They say I'm lazy, unruly and hysterical.
Shoes, shoes, shoes...
Why do you always take on pretty girls who are hopeless?
Look how she's dressed: for the beach!
Old crows don't sell anything nowadays, mother.
She told one customer his shoes were rotten.
Tell her to do her job properly.
Go on, tell her!
Get a move on!
How do you like it here?
It's alright.
How would you like to go for a ride in my Alfa?
I'd prefer a motorcycle.
Do you have a motorcycle?
No, I don't.
Too bad.
I guess you'll have to take your mother for a ride then.
Happily.
We won't bother you again.
But to finish this, we need to know a few more things.
You were 15 when you left home.
How'd that come about?
What were your thoughts at the time?
When I was fifteen?
When I was fifteen,
I had cute little feet.
One day I went to the ball in glass slippers.
There I met the King's son, who had great big feet, with big toes.
Nicer than yours.
And your shoes are ugly and dirty!
I'm like a dog on all fours these days, seeing nothing but feet.
All I see in the street are people's dreadful shoes.
All I hear are the sounds of their soles, it's terrible!
And all those disgusting socks!
You look so funny.
Like Laurel and Hardy.
No work today.
- Why not?
- Because it's Sunday.
Because we're stuck.
We're at a dead end with Rosemonde.
What do we do now?
- We'll read the papers.
- They give me hives.
We're bored, aren't we?
Well, it is Sunday.
Do you want to sing?
No, I'd rather chew my balls.
Listen, there's an idea I've had for a long time.
It needs two to work it, and you're just right.
What cheek!
Pestering us like that!
On Sunday, no less, and in our Geneva trams!
This is inconceivable!
Give us some peace and quiet!
No one complains!
Are you all cowards?
All you do is read the paper!
Haven't you had enough of Italians and Spaniards without Turks, too?
It's unbelievable!
I'm telling you, sir.
Listen to me, madam.
Soon we'll have negroes dancing in our trams!
Drums and all.
Cowards!
You're all cowards!
Can't you make him shut up?
Do it yourself, if you're so clever.
You keep your mouth shut!
He's right, we're foreigners.
Exactly, foreigners in our own country!
It was December 12th.
The tram business nearly came to a nasty end when they told the passengers it was only a joke.
Sleeping like angels!
It's awkward for you.
Only you and the boss have keys.
That would seem to narrow the line of questioning.
You went to bed early last night and slept soundly.
I told you.
Suzanne can confirm it.
Work here long?
A few days.
- And before?
- At Sogex.
Why did you leave Sogex?
I didn't like it.
Do you like it here?
It's okay.
Hi.
How are you?
What time is it?
3:30.
Not working this afternoon?
And you?
Is your story almost finished?
We're rather stuck.
You don't look very chipper yourself.
I'm not going back to the shop.
Why not?
I left, that's all.
It's not the first time.
Get in a fight?
We can't help you much, this time.
The finances of our little household are in crisis, about to pass from a cyclic to an endemic state.
Know what that means?
This is cyclic.
And this is endemic.
I haven't asked for anything!
What happened?
She quit, as usual.
We could title our story:
"Rosemonde, Just Passing Through."
The cops are after me again.
They were in the shop today, questioning people.
The shop was robbed last night.
Naturally they questioned me most of all.
I know they suspect me, it was clear.
So I acted a bit pissed at them.
After lunch, I didn't go back.
To hell with the place!
You had nothing to do with it?
Of course not.
Was there a break-in?
That's just it.
Someone had the keys.
My key was in my coat.
I'm not a sleepwalker!
- And Roger?
- What about him?
He could have taken the key.
No one touched it!
And I haven't seen Roger in a week!
What is he to you?
I like him.
It's the same with him as it is with you.
What can be done?
You, Rosemonde, pulled the trigger on your uncle.
Yes, it was me.
I didn't mean to, it happened in the heat of the moment.
I'd been fed up with the old fool for some time.
He always found piddling jobs for me, like in the Army.
He preached at me all the time.
I've been scared of my temper ever since.
I don't know what to do anymore...
You better go away.
I know people you could stay with in Paris.
Why should she go to Paris?
You should go to Paris.
That's a stupid idea, it'll only confirm the police's suspicion.
It won't be long until she finds a clue leading to Roger.
- She has to go back to work.
- I won't go.
Not long.
Just a few days.
Just long enough to dispel their suspicions.
I won't go!
Just a few days.
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.
Ready?
What shall I tell them about yesterday afternoon?
I don't know...
Say that the questioning upset you.
Let's go.
I don't want to go.
I'm not going.
Come on.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Because it's amusing.
What's amusing?
I've lived with your doppelganger for a month.
Whenever I went to my room, I knew you'd be there.
I invented you.
Only the shot at your uncle was a reality.
Now you're a reality.
That amuses me.
How did you know I pulled the trigger?
It was a gamble.
I could've gone to prison for a long time.
- How long?
- I don't know.
I imagined you differently, a little fatter, more countrified.
How fat?
Fat as a pig?
No.
Lovely, strapping, beautiful.
Do you like girls like that?
Is your wife like that?
No, she's very slim.
You were very funny.
You knew what you wanted.
And what do you want?
From life?
No, from me.
What do you want?
Me?
I don't know really.
But you do know.
I want people to get off my back.
That's not easy.
No one wants me the way I am.
No one?
Am I no one?
And Pierre?
And Suzanne?
You had three lovers in my story.
- All at once?
- No, one after the other.
You preferred one of them.
What did he look like?
He was...brawny.
Like this.
Like a construction worker I know.
- Was he handsome?
- Magnificent.
He had big hands.
Above all, he was clever.
He showed you the difference between breaking a window and breaking a window.
He taught you how to distinguish friend from foe, and not to break windows on your own anymore.
He explained why your enemies are your enemies.
Did I understand?
Yes, you got the gist.
Why do you write stories?
I'm just doing my bit.
In your story, do they know the truth about the rifle shot?
- Who?
- The cops.
No.
It was quite natural.
It wasn't your fault the rifle was handy.
It had to be of some use one day.
It was better the bullet went here than here.
Did you explain why your fat girl fired?
Why?
She couldn't not be her true self forever.
But the act itself wasn't important.
The important thing is what set things in motion.
The freedom to be yourself is systematically denied to too many people.
- Tell me her story again.
- You'll be late.
- Who were her enemies?
- The same as yours.
And who are my enemies?
Think.
Obviously the foreman at the factory the little boss of the shoe store, his mummy my uncle's cops, and the shoe store's cops.
The boss of law, the boss of sausages, the boss of boots, and the boss of cops!
I'll stop by the shop later.
Good morning, miss.
I'd like to buy a pair of shoes.
This way.
What do you have in mind?
I'd like shoes to put my feet in.
Shoes to walk in, simple shoes.
I think I've got just the thing.
How did it go?
It went alright.
Is he the little boss man?
Shall I punch his face in?
Have you got cash on you?
Yes, twenty francs.
Well, aren't you rich!
I'll see what I have at that price.
What size?
Like this, perhaps?
Nice and warm.
Too warm.
These are no good.
Neither are these.
These are practical.
A bit big.
That's better.
So are these...
That's the left.
And the right?
That looks nice.
But a little too small.
Soft.
Comfortable.
They fit like a glove!
You think?
They're elegant!
Then I'll keep them on, if they're so elegant.
- Sure you're alright?
- Yes, don't worry.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Au revoir, mademoiselle.
Au revoir, mademoiselle?
The second one this week buying tennis shoes...
In December!
Couldn't we use these notes?
No, you can't rehash stuff like that.
So we'll forget the adventures of the lovely Rosemonde?
Yes.
It's not my decision, it was decided by the facts.
Rosemonde engulfed us.
Shit!
What about the television money?
Another little debt.
Anyway, you didn't want to work on it.
I did at first.
I lured you into it.
I'll take responsibility.
That'll teach me.
Someone's knocking.
- Someone to inspect the place.
- Again!
Spiritual Defense were already here.
I represent your landlord's interest.
I'm here to evaluate your furniture.
Huh?
Why?
You signed a lease, which you clearly did not read.
It states that your belongings must equal the value of eighteen months rent.
In your case that's exactly 6,300 francs.
What's the point of all this?
In case non-payment of rent necessitates seizure of your effects.
In case you didn't know, your rent has not been paid in four months.
- Four months?
- Yes.
- Are you the boss?
- Excuse me?
Are you director of the estate?
No, I'm head clerk.
Now, how much is this lot worth?
I don't know.
Do your job, estimate, evaluate.
You sure have a strange job.
What do you mean?
You're not the boss but you have to act like you are.
I'm his legal representative.
What will become of you when property is nationalized?
That day still seems far away.
I'm not sure it will ever come in our country.
And even if it did, there are ways to get around it.
It just takes imagination.
I know a guy who succeeded by inventing a new way of squeezing mayonnaise.
Before, they were ordinary bottles and the mayonaisse squirted out.
He had a brilliant idea of chamfering the edge of the hole so the mayonaisse comes out all twisted and ribbed.
It looks great on sliced hard-boiled eggs.
He made a fortune, and now he's the boss.
The value of the furnishings amounted to scarcely 750 francs.
And that was a generous estimate.
The inspector took note, and left.
What a mess!
I made a decision.
I'm going to Paris.
I've had enough of this awful town.
And the papers, too.
Here or there...
Paris is also unbearable.
That's their problem.
At least I'm not at home there.
Does the Paris paper pay you?
A little.
I'll get by.
I'll find a place to sleep.
And I'll run up debts.
Devaluation is faster in France, and lawsuits are slower here.
I'll sell my car.
Catherine will take the apartment.
If you need a room in town...
Let me give you my phone number.
What's the matter?
You must be crazy.
It looks nice.
You have nice legs.
What are you doing?
Are you mad?
Sir!
Your salesgirl is mad!
She's getting fresh with me!
What happened?
I don't know what came over me.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, madam.
I'll handle it.
I've never seen the likes of it!
Do you need money for Christmas?
When's Christmas?
In five days.
Unfathomable sadness!
- How many days off do we have?
- Three.
What a waste!
Jesus and Maria!
He's sad.
He's going to sing.
It's too early.
I never sing before ten.
Written anything lately?
The story of a girl who tried to kill her uncle.
A serious thing?
An erotic tale?
Not at all.
What are you doing?
Rosemonde!
Yes, sir?
Come here!
You must leave here at once!
Get out!
You're completely mad.
You're a little slut!
Go on, get!
Unbelievable!
Goodbye, madam.
Sir.
Thank you very, very much.
It was the 20th of December.
The so-called holidays approached menacingly.
The crowds assaulted the shops, in accordance with mercantile law.
A tendency towards marked schizophrenia was evident, a sickness which threatened to engulf the entire social strata.
It still hadn't snowed, which, for this time of year, was actually not the least bit unusual.
A color film in monochrome.
Hello?
Paris?
May I speak to Louis Roy?
Louis Roy, like your King Louis, backwards.
Exactly.
Louis?
It's Pierre.
I'm fine, thanks.
Brazil?
Two months of lovely weather, and otherwise ghastly.
You'll have them in a month.
Three articles, like we agreed.
What bullshit!
The Paris newspaper won't take me on at the moment.
Didn't they promise, more or less?
Not definitely.
They've got financial problems.
And I will too, soon.
Won't they pay for the Brazil articles?
Yes, but not much.
I'll have to freelance.
Take up Bernard's offer for that television job.
Oh, right.
I can't write a script for Bernard and my Brazil articles.
Write it with someone else.
With whom?
I don't know.
Your hairy writer friend, Paul.
Not a bad idea.
Paul?
Paul!
A call for you.
Who is it?
Richard Nixon.
Or Leonid Brezhnev.
I don't know which.
One or the other.
That's fine.
Thanks, Paul.
See you soon.
I might not come to work on Monday morning.
Or Monday afternoon.
Maybe not for the whole month.
We're fed up with your comings and goings.
That's our arrangement, I'm not at your beck and call.
He works when he feels like it.
Great!
Isn't it?
Elsewhere, I work harder for nothing.
That's your business.
Exactly, that's my business.
You got on our nerves with your mucking about.
Pack it up!
Paul lived in a secluded spot, but not for love of nature.
He appreciated tranquility, but it was a small house, and the rent was only 100 francs a month, and he appreciated that even more.
We find ourselves in the country's western frontier, two steps from the border, and Switzerland seems to be left behind.
We turn our backs on her.
On the other side of this no-man's land lies France.
A country where one never knows what the next year, or month, will have in store.
Despite appearances, which one should never trust,
Paul was not a plasterer, or a singer, but a writer.
This was October 25th.
The weather was rather dull.
Come in!
Come in!
You've brought a suitcase?
Are you gonna take the job?
- Have you decided?
- No.
But I live 10 miles away, and it's cold.
I've brought my things, in case I stay.
Good thinking!
Well?
You know Bernard, the guy from TV?
- No.
- Nevermind.
He's a friend.
I'm doing a job for him because I need the cash.
I've got to write a story, a script, based on a year old news item.
He wants to film it, and he'll pay in advance.
But since I have to write my Brazil articles,
I'd like for you to help me with it.
OK?
- It depends.
- Depends on what?
Lots of things.
Has your scribbling ever brought in 2,000 francs in a month?
Not counting the poems your wife writes!
Listen.
We'll make 4,000 francs.
We can do the job in one month, they've allowed three.
What more do you want?
I'd like to know the subject, and how we tackle it.
I don't work to order.
- Tell me about the event.
- Very simple.
A story which fizzled out.
A man whose niece lived with him claimed she shot him with his Army rifle.
The bullet hit him in the shoulder.
She denied everything.
She claims the old man hurt himself cleaning his rifle.
There were no witnesses, they both maintained their statements, and the case was dropped.
That's all.
Strange.
There's a press clipping about it, up there.
Bernard would like a sort of sociological study.
The girl's name is Rosemonde.
Rosemonde?
I'd forgotten that.
Doesn't sound bad, Rosemonde.
So?
Hold on.
Are you staying?
- Interested?
- Yes, I am.
How will we work?
Together is more complicated.
We'll make it however you like.
Have you got a calendar with Saints' Days?
- Saints?
- Yes, saints.
Maybe in my diary...
Yeah, here they are...
- What are you looking for?
- Hold on.
Here.
I found it.
April 30th, St. Rosemonde.
As I thought, it's a calendar name.
So what?
- That explains it.
- Explains what?
That the girl wanted to kill her uncle.
Our names are in the calendar, but we don't kill uncles.
Let me explain.
It happened like this:
Rosemonde comes from a big family.
In big families, when the usual names have been exhausted on the first-born brats, the parents run out of ideas, and start using calendar names.
Thus: a big family a swarm of noisy little brats.
A big family means a country family.
They couldn't afford the housing racket in town.
So they live in the country, but not any old stretch of country,
Catholic country, still a little backward.
Contraception unknown, calendar saints, and all that.
The father's a blockhead, education leaves a lot to be desired.
And why does Rosemonde live in town?
That's easy: the father can't make ends meet.
He'll never make a go of things.
Salvation: a brother in town, comfortably off, room to spare, easily put upon.
So he's landed with the girl, and there's one less at home to feed.
What does Rosemonde do in town?
She does miserable jobs, unskilled jobs.
She starts to run wild.
Uncle tries to straighten her out.
They quarrel.
One day he's cleaning his army rifle, and inevitably, Rosemonde being who she is, a shot's fired.
Not a bad story.
I'll stay.
What's your opinion?
Not bad.
There's just one little problem.
Which is?
What about the facts?
I've been stating the facts for five minutes, apart from some minor details.
I feel I've earned my living, today.
Good.
But it may all be a dream.
Why use your imagination when the story actually happened?
The girl and the uncle exist.
They live here somewhere.
I'm interested in facts, in reality.
We must start by coming to grips with that.
You can elaborate later.
First we make inquiries.
I'm not a cop.
- Like a journalist!
- I'm not a journalist!
You work as a plasterer so that you can write what you like.
Good.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
I'll make some coffee.
When you get the sausage, make sure to tie it well.
So we've agreed?
The water's ready.
We'll go about it based on your idea.
185 00:15:37,187 -- 00:15:39,495 You'll write the girl's story as you see it.
I'll visit people with my tape recorder.
and collect as much information as I can, so that you can build your story around it.
Later on we'll go over it all together.
Sound good?
Yeah.
Don't forget, I don't want to know anything about her.
Bring back all you can get on the others.
Warm woolen underpants for winter!
Warm woolen socks for winter!
A pad of special paper!
A deluxe fountain pen!
- And where's the cash?
- In the Bank.
- Sugar?
- Two lumps.
My wife needs my share now.
Whenever you like.
First, Pierre had to find Rosemonde.
Despite some difficulties due to Rosemonde's personality,
Pierre conducted his inquiries with gusto.
She didn't stay more than a month.
You should've seen her room.
An unholy mess!
We've had all sorts here, but she took the cake!
I always say, whenever someone can't be on time
--She was often 15 minutes late-- something's not right.
- Where does she work now?
- I don't know.
She lives in Onex.
I've got her address in my bag.
The investigation began on October 27th.
Today was November 1st.
May I speak with you?
I'm a reporter.
Would you like to come in?
It's a little hard to explain.
It's about your spot of trouble last year, although that's not the main thing.
Really, I'd like to get to know you.
I'm writing a story about someone like you.
I'd like to chat.
I can come back later, if you're busy.
This may sound odd, but my job is made up of odd things.
Isn't it Rosemonde you want to speak to?
- Aren't you Rosemonde?
- No.
I'm Suzanne.
- But she does live here?
- Yes, but she's not in yet.
Would you like to wait?
- Are you on the Pill?
- Yeah.
All the time?
You should be like a Boy Scout:
always ready.
Roger was ready for anything.
Rosemonde prepared herself for damnation.
Are you a reporter?
Anyway, no more about that uncle business.
That's been shelved.
Let's talk about other things.
Like what?
I don't know...about you, for instance.
About your job.
That can wait until hell freezes over!
What can one say about a job?
If Rosemonde tells you about her life, as you say, would you pay her for that?
That could be arranged.
- Is it too long?
- No, I think it's fine.
- I found the girl!
- Bravo!
- Do you want to meet her?
- Definitely not.
She's a bit alright.
I already knew that.
She's even better than you imagine.
I can't see her with a rifle.
I doubt she fired the shot.
Still, everything points to the contrary!
This is Vladimir.
He practices here when his wife can't stand it any longer.
He can keep you company.
Where shall I go?
Up to my room.
You didn't say much on the phone.
But I've got nothing to hide.
You're a journalist?
Yeah.
Have I disturbed your dinner?
No, no, I just finished.
I always eat very early.
Is this the famous rifle?
Yes, that's my army rifle.
Isn't it terrible, to think I was almost killed by it?
The weapon I served with for 30 years?
Through years of looking after it, one gets attached.
It's become more than just a rifle.
For us, it's almost a symbol of our freedom.
It means something to us.
To see it turned on you one day...
True, that's somewhat of a paradox.
She had run-ins with the police before.
It was over a stolen car.
Not to mention, her illegitimate child.
At seventeen!
She's a bad lot!
My brother's not a bad guy, but he never did anything with his life.
Still, it was a big, fine family.
She came from a big family?
Yes, she was put in my care when she was fifteen, so that she could go to school in town.
It meant one less mouth to feed at home.
At fifteen she ran around with delinquents, got up at 10 in the morning, and finally ended up meddling in crime.
Did she have any cause?
No, that's just it!
That's what I don't understand.
While she was here, we treated her like our own daughter.
But she couldn't escape her destiny.
It could well have cost me my life.
- Do you want to see my scar?
- No, it's not necessary.
The worst place is where the bullet came out.
I get awful pains when we have our famous north wind.
Unlike the uncle, Paul liked the wind very much.
Paul waited for two days, but there was no wind.
I've had it.
After work, I always feel like yelling or breaking something.
When I feel up to it, I go swimming.
Be patient.
In 40 years, you can retire.
Have you worked there long?
Three months already, but it feels like a lifetime.
I'll stay six months at the most.
- Will you get a pension?
- No.
That's my big regret.
Sometimes I imagine how
I'd get up at 10, flop around in slippers, make some coffee, run a bath, go down
and fetch the paper.
At lunch time I'd rustle up a meal.
What a life!
A monthly pension.
Card games at the pub.
A dream!
Yes, but by then one's too old.
That's true.
One no longer makes love.
Great!
There's a jukebox.
Do you have a coin?
Sit over here.
A cup of coffee.
Do you want anything?
And a coke.
This isn't ideal for a chat.
You can take me home later.
We can talk there.
What are you doing?
Taking your picture.
Is that okay?
I look a sight.
What will you do with them?
Nothing.
They're for my friend, for our work.
- Really?
- Of course.
What did you think?
Alright.
But I want to see them.
I'll give them to you if you like.
Wait, let me tidy up.
You look gorgeous, stay like that.
I'll be right back.
Move a little.
Walk a bit, from right to left.
Now sit on the table.
Just relax.
Perfect.
The last ones are the best.
I think that'll do.
Anyway, this is less dangerous than a rifle.
Was it a shotgun?
No, an Army rifle.
- Will you see my uncle?
- Probably.
He'll say I tried to shoot him, the old liar.
He hated me, because I'd had it with being his maid.
I couldn't even have lifted his rifle!
Those things are heavy!
Did you see it happen?
No, I was in the other room.
He was fiddling with his rifle.
Cleaning it for the umpteenth time.
I'd seen him the moment before.
Suddenly I heard a huge bang.
I rushed in and found my uncle on the floor.
You should have seen it!
I called the doctor.
Afterwards he called the police.
That's how it all started.
He put the blame on me.
- Did you hate him?
- Me?
No.
He's just an old prick, that's all.
As simple as that?
Aren't you working?
- I'll finish this game first.
- Are you working upstairs?
No, down here.
I need space to walk around.
I have a lot of people:
A big family, a maimed uncle, a big rifle, defense of our freedom, and that's not all.
For your poems you only have to picture the inside of your skull.
How's it going with Pierre?
Fine.
It's a good time.
It's a change for me.
I'm between a blank page and a construction site.
Do you want something to eat?
No, I'm not hungry.
Are you crazy?
They'll throw us out.
Should we go to my place to record?
If you want.
Finish your drink.
When I was small,
I went on lots of country walks with my older brother.
His big specialty was breaking windows, especially in winter, when he could make snowballs.
He was real strong.
His snowballs were like stones.
Once my father thrashed us, but he discovered my brother was stronger than him.
He never touched us after that.
I've always loved the sound of breaking windows.
You mentioned your father.
Oh god, my father...
He never had a steady job, it all depended.
When he had too much to drink, all hell broke loose at home.
He works at a sawmill now.
And your mother?
I love her, she's great.
We get along.
I visit her from time to time.
With all the kids she's brought into the world...
How many brothers and sisters?
Ten.
Ten?
- Eleven, counting you?
- Yeah.
I was the seventh.
Mother's never worn out.
She adores the little brats.
When I had a kid...
- A kid?
- Yeah, that was six years ago.
- I wanted to keep it.
- But you couldn't.
Why not?
You weren't married, were you?
No, but I wanted to keep it.
Mother took him at once.
What was one more or less to her?
Simple as that.
What's the child's name?
- Jean.
- A boy?
Yes.
My uncle thought that I was a bitch.
He wanted to put me in reform school.
No, that was after the car business.
That was nothing.
Albert, a friend of mine, had taken a car to go for a drive.
We had a drink in the village, and a cop asked for our papers just as we were leaving.
They only took my name, but they nabbed Albert.
No, wait, I had to go to court.
And reform school?
I never went.
What for?
Then I started as a dressmaker's apprentice.
That satisfied my uncle.
- Are you a dressmaker?
- No, I never finished.
Why not?
I don't like dressmaking.
Pierre thought that was as good a reason as any.
And Paul wrote:
"Heliodore", that was Rosemonde's name in the story,
"had little taste for what is called a trade."
"Where one learns an honest, which means poor, living."
"Where one's at everyone's beck and call."
"Where freedom means a quick smoke in the bathroom."
I was told I was pretty enough to be a hostess.
A stewardess, perhaps?
No, you need languages for that.
Some other hostess.
A department store hostess, with a little hat?
Maybe, but I like to dress how I like.
I don't like uniforms.
What did you do after the dressmaking?
Mostly housework for my uncle.
I was used to such work.
There was always plenty at home, scrubbing my brothers and sisters.
I did some other jobs too.
I was a salesgirl, and I worked in a macaroni factory.
But not for long.
Others stay.
I never do.
I'm not quite normal.
At least that's what people say.
"It slowly dawned on Heliodore that it was not the others, but she who was normal."
"That her desires were basically normal."
"Consequently, what wasn't normal had to be outside her, since she and the world didn't hit it off."
Once I went to the Riviera with Albert.
He had his own car then.
My uncle informed the police.
I'd gone off without telling him.
He thought I'd gone off on the loose.
Anyway, they never found us.
It was fantastic!
We went where we liked, slept on the beach.
One evening...
I nearly recorded some porn for you!
That was the last time I saw the sea.
Uncle takes his holidays in the mountains, in a total dump.
He took me there once.
There were two old bags who sang after dinner.
I never left my room.
He almost called the police to have them pry me out.
You don't like them much, do you?
Who, the cops?
I couldn't care less.
Were you involved with them before?
Me?
No, I never did a thing.
My brother, when he was working on a farm, did something stupid once.
The cops came to our house.
And then, when my father slugged a guy, they came again.
And after the thing with my uncle, they hounded me for ages.
Until finally, they left me alone.
And now?
Now?
I feel old.
Even more so than before.
I wonder what will become of me.
I never used to worry about that.
But nevermind.
That's enough for now.
Turn that thing off.
How often must I tell you that people eat what you handle?
Tidy your hair or wear a cap.
Come in!
Is that you?
No, it's me..
What are you doing here?
Aren't you working today?
Is it raining?
No, I went swimming.
A day off?
No, I quit.
Did they fire you?
Lay you off?
No, I left.
I was fed up.
- Do you need money?
- No.
I wanted to see you.
Good idea.
No, bad idea.
It's a good idea, but now's not a good time.
I was hoping you might cheer me up.
Not now.
I don't want to lose my train of thought.
Come back this evening.
You're not much fun!
I don't want to go anywhere.
May I stay here?
I won't say a word.
If you like.
The question of Swiss capital investment in Brazil gave Pierre trouble.
Two hours have passed since Rosemonde arrived.
Outside it was pitch dark.
It's pitch dark out.
I'm staying.
Fine, stay.
I'm sleeping here.
Fine, sleep here.
I'm sleeping in your bed.
I'm staying, I'm sleeping in your bed, and I'm sleeping with you.
I'm staying, I'm sleeping in your bed, and I'm sleeping with you.
I'm taking off my skirt.
Where's the bathroom?
Downstairs,
First door on your left.
No, right.
Is your novel almost finished?
Is your novel almost finished?
Is it all about me?
No, it's about Brazil.
Have you been there?
Really?
The Carnival in Rio, is that in Brazil?
Have you seen it?
No!
Sorry.
Can I watch TV?
Quietly?
.
Very quietly.
How's it work?
Turn the little knob on the left.
I'll be done in a couple minutes.
Are you a nice guy?
Very nice.
Me too.
It depends on the person.
Sometimes I'm terrible.
I'm wild, you know.
But I'm easily tamed.
I believe you.
That's it.
I'm stopping.
I'm hungry.
Are you?
I'll heat the stew Paul made for lunch.
Who is Paul?
My friend.
We work together.
I'll have some too.
Can I stay?
I don't want to go out in this weather.
I wouldn't have let you go, anyway.
Your thigh touched my hand in passing.
I noticed.
How did it feel?
Soft.
Here I am.
- How's your little family?
- Good.
Really good?
Yes, sure.
In the midst of total moral misery.
Fantastic!
One makes do with what one can.
- And how are you?
- Alright.
- Have you been working?
- A little.
I left my deluxe pen here.
- It's in my room.
- You used it?
I told you never to touch it!
I used it to sign a letter.
I didn't eat it.
Go get it, see for yourself.
There's a girl in your room.
How do you know?
It smells good.
She's asleep.
Aren't you asleep?
Pierre said you were.
I was, earlier.
Good morning, then.
Excuse me.
No harm done.
The girl wasn't asleep.
The girl is Rosemonde.
I got you, didn't I?
You've seen her, after all.
You didn't picture her like that?
She's pretty, isn't she?
I forgot to take my pen.
I came for something, but I already forgot what it was.
You know how to make coffee?
Of course.
Will you make some?
Yes.
I'll call you when it's ready.
I'll call you then.
Paul had problems.
Since he had met Rosemonde three days ago, everything looked different.
Only time remained the same.
It passed.
It's November 23rd.
You shouldn't have slept with Rosemonde.
Why not?
Wouldn't you like to?
It's going to complicate our work.
What do you mean?
We're almost done.
We know a lot about her and about her past.
I've talked to her uncle, her old boss, her coworkers.
I looked up her file at the paper.
I've seen the cops.
Now it's up to you.
I know.
I haven't written a line since I met her.
I knew it would change everything.
Die Ereignisse verwirren mich.
Two Rosemondes are one too many.
And which one's superfluous?
Mine, not the real one.
I've gotta start over.
I have to know more about the real one.
Where are the recordings?
In the bathroom.
I listened to them while I cut my toenails.
The entrance is around back.
Where's the door?
What do you want?
I'm a Civil Defense Inspector.
A real inspector or a phony?
Paul, come here!
A Civil Defense Inspector.
A real one!
Spiritual Defense Section.
Spiritual Defense Section!
What do you wish to inspect?
I'm checking, to see if everyone has their Red Book on Civil Defense.
- I threw mine away.
- Are you sure?
I'm positive.
I must enter that in the "Got Rid of Deliberately" column.
I regret that I'm obliged to do so.
It doesn't add up to much.
Nothing?
You're better at reporting shady investments in Brazil.
Nevertheless, I'll take it.
I'll go home and rewrite the thing in peace.
We'll never finish!
Now I feel I know nothing about Rosemonde.
A reporter repeats his information.
I look for the meaning in mine.
Can you give me a ride home?
Now?
What about your bike?
Do you know how cold it is out?
Why don't you buy a car?
It's pretentious to bike, these days.
I can't afford a car.
You know that.
Get a loan!
Debts are the foundation of sound household economics.
Anyway, they practically give old Mini's away.
- Really?
Where?
- Nearby.
Why don't you want to stay?
My daughter wants to see me.
Children!
Why have them at all?
It's the first law of nature.
So that we feel the burden of existence.
It's to clip our wings.
- For all that.
- In this case...
So, I'll take you home.
Let's have coffee first.
I'm sad.
I think I'm going to sing.
Don't forget to give me the uncle's address.
Her attitude at school was only the start of her delinquency.
The police soon got to know her.
It ended with an attempted murder.
A rifle bullet at point blank range spares no one.
See for yourself.
I'll show you the scar.
No, I don't need to see it.
You're like your colleague, frightened to see a wound.
We both live sheltered lives.
Three days earlier, on November 25th, the migrant worker-trashmen suddenly went on strike.
It was called "A brutal strike!" because it was unexpected and therefore intolerable.
In actuality, the strike was a threat to order and cleanliness, nothing more.
Have you seen the famous scar?
Me?
How awful!
It would turn my stomach.
Has he ever insisted that you see it?
I haven't been there since it happened.
What was it like when you went to live there at sixteen?
When I was sixteen?
Help me answer an ad, and I'll tell you all about it.
I'll tell you everything I did when I was sixteen.
You'll be so shocked, you'll leave me alone.
I already told big Pierre, and I'm not going over it again with li'l Paul.
C'mon, help.
Programmer.
What's that?
Not a job for me, I bet.
Secretary, cook, concierge... salesgirl...
I always talk back to the customers.
Housekeeper, bookstore helper...
Assistant, male, female...
I'll end up stuffing sausage in a bloody factory.
God!
My neck aches from the thought of it.
I always catch it in my neck and forehead.
I'm never going back to their bloody, shitty sausage factory!
Not me!
Never again!
That's it.
My neck aches.
I'm gonna go make myself an aspirin sandwich.
I have a cure for that.
Here, let me.
I met a girl at Pierre's, her name's Zoe.
We made love.
I think it was mainly because of her name.
She had very round breasts.
It's the first time since we've been together.
That shows how time passes.
You're getting old, Paul.
I worked, too.
Badly.
Because of Rosemonde, not Zoe.
Your life's a bit complicated at the moment, darling.
A bit.
I'd like to read you a piece by Heine, which I just found.
He wrote it in 1828.
I'll read it to you.
"We'll have a lovely day!" called my travelling companion."
"We'll have a lovely day!" My heart repeated the words...
"in adoration, and trembled with joy and melancholy."
"Yes, it will be a beautiful day,
"the sun of freedom will warm the earth with more happiness...
"than the noble night stars."
"A new generation will arise,
"conceived in freely chosen embraces,
"not in the bed of duty, or under control of the clergy."
"With free birth,
"free thoughts and feelings will be born, too,
"of which we, the enslaved, have not the slightest inkling."
"Oh!
Just as little as they will know...
"the frightful night of shadows in which we had to live,
"and the horrible battles we fought against hideous specters,
"obtuse owls, and criminal hypocrites."
Don't forget to type that page.
Here's the loveliest of all roses.
Are you working?
Aren't you always working?
I earn a poor living, by the sweat of my brow.
Your fridge is almost empty.
Really?
That doesn't surprise me.
Paul's economizing.
He feeds me nothing but potatoes.
He prepares them twenty-seven ways.
That's impossible.
Ask him.
He's got a sack full in the kitchen.
I'll put some on to boil.
I saw butter in the fridge.
Potatoes at four o"clock?
I'm hungry.
Suzanne's been gone for days.
There's nothing left at home.
You don't have any money?
I'll give you some.
Thanks.
This goes in the same line?
No, this line goes first, then this one, then the other.
I'm going to visit my mother and my son.
Take Paul with you.
He's dying to meet your family, and know your background.
Why don't we all go?
To the country?
I've got to work.
Our village has a quiet little inn, you could work there.
A quiet little inn?
With big country beds, and down comforters?
On the road to adventure!
What quiet!
I think that Paul is going to sing.
No, I was wrong.
Did you bring warm clothes?
My gloves are in the glove compartment.
Winters are chilly in our valley.
Paul, according to you, what are we doing?
Riding down the road in a car.
What I mean is,
Do you think this trip will help our work?
Or are we merely wasting time?
This isn't very serious.
But it's very nice.
I think it's indispensable.
I'm astonished by your doubts.
You don't have any?
Sure I do, but they're different.
After two hours, all distances being short in our little country, they arrived in a beautiful valley.
So, here we are in this awful valley.
Stop here.
I'll walk the rest of the way.
But it's raining.
If my father sees me arrive with you two nitwits, he'll smash everything.
I'll see you at the hotel.
I'd say that you're the nitwit.
No, you are!
Hey!
Where is the hotel?
Down there, on the left.
God, it's cold in this dump!
What a godforsaken place.
Sublime and lugubrious country!
I'd like to see where she lives.
I'll wait till her old man takes off.
What a delightful spot.
What shall we do?
Find the hotel.
I'm cold, hungry, and I need a drink.
My back aches and I'm fed up.
It's not bad, really.
I'll be able to write in peace, while you roam around.
You can report back to me every evening.
As you say, it's not bad!
Still, watch out for Rosemonde's father.
Approach him slowly, little by little, encircle him.
Like the Indians in westerns.
Should I stick feathers in my hair?
Good god, it's cold here!
When you get off the plane in Rio, the first thing that hits you is the humidity.
You smell a mixture of sea salt, pepper, slight putrefaction, pimento, dust, mangroves,
A fantastic sensation...
I'm gonna explore.
And I'm gonna go back to Brazil.
See you later.
Paul wrote in his notebook:
"The lovely little salamander...
855 01:17:30,320 -- 01:17:
"belongs to the lizard family."
"It's black, with yellowish-orange spots."
"The salamander is venomous.
It's the fire's spirit.
"Flames cannot harm it."
Pierre thought:
"What's the point of realizing there's a connection...
"between the crushing of bodies down there...
"and the crushing of the spirit here?"
One could only know it, say it... and still it would roll like a pebble down the gray stream of news.
That's where my father works.
Is he there now?
Yeah.
That's him, the guy over there.
So now's a good time to visit your mother.
He wouldn't have eaten you.
I fry the onions separately, and put the sauce aside for the moment.
He couldn't care less about your cooking.
But I do.
He's not a cook, he writes books.
You write books?
I always say, "Education's a great thing."
Rosemonde's mother, who usually judged people correctly, was wrong this time.
Paul had never studied.
He left school at fifteen.
Did you go to school here?
Yeah, but only for a year.
Before that, we lived in a small town in France.
We moved a lot.
We lived in a sort of farm over there, once.
How was school?
Here it was alright.
But in town it was a disaster.
I don't know.
I didn't like it anymore.
It's really not too warm here.
- Are the winters long?
- Here?
It drags on for at least six months, here.
- You get used to it.
- I couldn't.
You do look sad!
Pierre says you sing when you're sad.
Sing something.
It'll warm you up.
- My voice is frozen.
- Try it anyway.
What should I sing?
"Once there was a Swedish countess."
"She was so beautiful and pale."
"Forester, forester,
"my garter is undone."
"Forester, kneel and fasten it, do not fear."
When you sleep with a woman, do you do the usual, or do you have special tricks?
Very special!
Slut!
Peasant clod!
This is what happened.
The uncle was here, Rosemonde was here.
He cleaned his rifle like this.
The bullet hit the wall back there, behind him.
I checked the room.
Think about it:
How could Rosemonde have shot that way, with the table there?
What's your point?
You talk a lot of nonsense.
And you get on my nerves!
We're stuck.
What are we doing here?
Can you tell me?
Nothing, absolutely nothing.
We're just mucking about.
Oh, happiness is so close!
I feel it coming.
Don't you?
Oh, happiness is so close!
Oh, happiness is so far away and prehistory is so long!
Slowly we approach death.
Before capitalism, in all its perversity, kicks the bucket, and before bureaucracy, with its dull dogmas, passes away, there'll be a lot of bloodshed!
Oh, happiness is so close!
Oh, happiness is so far away!
Are we lost?
No, we can get out that way.
On the path.
- That path?
- Yeah, this way.
This is the way to the Promised Land!
You think?
The exit looks rather blocked.
We have no choice.
It's either this way to the Promised Land, or this way...to barbarism,
and the programmed intoxication brought about by technocrats.
With the approval of the silent majority.
That's right!
Oh, happiness is so close.
Oh, happiness is so far away...
A silent majority is composed of people like us, with arms and legs, who, from time to time, isolated by the secrecy of polling booths lined up like urinals, vote for louses and scoundrels.
Here's the bill for our four days here.
That's not bad.
No, but it's bad if you consider that we're practically broke.
How much have you got left of your share?
Not much, once we pay this.
Where'd it go?
Did you blow it all in a month?
I paid a few things.
You had debts, too?
No, just things to be paid.
- Let's do our accounts.
- What for?
If there's no cash, there's no cash.
How much did you give Rosemonde?
Five hundred, I think.
We owed her that, at least.
We've gotta find a way out.
That's for sure.
We're gonna have to take emergency measures.
What's more,
I feel like our story has reached a dead end.
A dead end?
We have to start over.
In the first person this time.
We know Rosemonde too well.
It hampers our story.
Only she can put us straight.
I'm twenty-three.
If I had been born six days later,
I would've been named Heliodore.
My breasts are small.
I like the shape of my legs.
I'm blonde.
I've always fended for myself, and I like it.
Are you awake?
Estelle quit, so I spoke to the boss about you.
You can start tomorrow, if you want.
They have a hard time getting salesgirls.
You spoke to him?
It's easy, honest.
I'll help you at first.
People hate my independence, they try to break me down.
They say I'm lazy, unruly and hysterical.
Shoes, shoes, shoes...
Why do you always take on pretty girls who are hopeless?
Look how she's dressed: for the beach!
Old crows don't sell anything nowadays, mother.
She told one customer his shoes were rotten.
Tell her to do her job properly.
Go on, tell her!
Get a move on!
How do you like it here?
It's alright.
How would you like to go for a ride in my Alfa?
I'd prefer a motorcycle.
Do you have a motorcycle?
No, I don't.
Too bad.
I guess you'll have to take your mother for a ride then.
Happily.
We won't bother you again.
But to finish this, we need to know a few more things.
You were 15 when you left home.
How'd that come about?
What were your thoughts at the time?
When I was fifteen?
When I was fifteen,
I had cute little feet.
One day I went to the ball in glass slippers.
There I met the King's son, who had great big feet, with big toes.
Nicer than yours.
And your shoes are ugly and dirty!
I'm like a dog on all fours these days, seeing nothing but feet.
All I see in the street are people's dreadful shoes.
All I hear are the sounds of their soles, it's terrible!
And all those disgusting socks!
You look so funny.
Like Laurel and Hardy.
No work today.
- Why not?
- Because it's Sunday.
Because we're stuck.
We're at a dead end with Rosemonde.
What do we do now?
- We'll read the papers.
- They give me hives.
We're bored, aren't we?
Well, it is Sunday.
Do you want to sing?
No, I'd rather chew my balls.
Listen, there's an idea I've had for a long time.
It needs two to work it, and you're just right.
What cheek!
Pestering us like that!
On Sunday, no less, and in our Geneva trams!
This is inconceivable!
Give us some peace and quiet!
No one complains!
Are you all cowards?
All you do is read the paper!
Haven't you had enough of Italians and Spaniards without Turks, too?
It's unbelievable!
I'm telling you, sir.
Listen to me, madam.
Soon we'll have negroes dancing in our trams!
Drums and all.
Cowards!
You're all cowards!
Can't you make him shut up?
Do it yourself, if you're so clever.
You keep your mouth shut!
He's right, we're foreigners.
Exactly, foreigners in our own country!
It was December 12th.
The tram business nearly came to a nasty end when they told the passengers it was only a joke.
Sleeping like angels!
It's awkward for you.
Only you and the boss have keys.
That would seem to narrow the line of questioning.
You went to bed early last night and slept soundly.
I told you.
Suzanne can confirm it.
Work here long?
A few days.
- And before?
- At Sogex.
Why did you leave Sogex?
I didn't like it.
Do you like it here?
It's okay.
Hi.
How are you?
What time is it?
3:30.
Not working this afternoon?
And you?
Is your story almost finished?
We're rather stuck.
You don't look very chipper yourself.
I'm not going back to the shop.
Why not?
I left, that's all.
It's not the first time.
Get in a fight?
We can't help you much, this time.
The finances of our little household are in crisis, about to pass from a cyclic to an endemic state.
Know what that means?
This is cyclic.
And this is endemic.
I haven't asked for anything!
What happened?
She quit, as usual.
We could title our story:
"Rosemonde, Just Passing Through."
The cops are after me again.
They were in the shop today, questioning people.
The shop was robbed last night.
Naturally they questioned me most of all.
I know they suspect me, it was clear.
So I acted a bit pissed at them.
After lunch, I didn't go back.
To hell with the place!
You had nothing to do with it?
Of course not.
Was there a break-in?
That's just it.
Someone had the keys.
My key was in my coat.
I'm not a sleepwalker!
- And Roger?
- What about him?
He could have taken the key.
No one touched it!
And I haven't seen Roger in a week!
What is he to you?
I like him.
It's the same with him as it is with you.
What can be done?
You, Rosemonde, pulled the trigger on your uncle.
Yes, it was me.
I didn't mean to, it happened in the heat of the moment.
I'd been fed up with the old fool for some time.
He always found piddling jobs for me, like in the Army.
He preached at me all the time.
I've been scared of my temper ever since.
I don't know what to do anymore...
You better go away.
I know people you could stay with in Paris.
Why should she go to Paris?
You should go to Paris.
That's a stupid idea, it'll only confirm the police's suspicion.
It won't be long until she finds a clue leading to Roger.
- She has to go back to work.
- I won't go.
Not long.
Just a few days.
Just long enough to dispel their suspicions.
I won't go!
Just a few days.
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.
Ready?
What shall I tell them about yesterday afternoon?
I don't know...
Say that the questioning upset you.
Let's go.
I don't want to go.
I'm not going.
Come on.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Because it's amusing.
What's amusing?
I've lived with your doppelganger for a month.
Whenever I went to my room, I knew you'd be there.
I invented you.
Only the shot at your uncle was a reality.
Now you're a reality.
That amuses me.
How did you know I pulled the trigger?
It was a gamble.
I could've gone to prison for a long time.
- How long?
- I don't know.
I imagined you differently, a little fatter, more countrified.
How fat?
Fat as a pig?
No.
Lovely, strapping, beautiful.
Do you like girls like that?
Is your wife like that?
No, she's very slim.
You were very funny.
You knew what you wanted.
And what do you want?
From life?
No, from me.
What do you want?
Me?
I don't know really.
But you do know.
I want people to get off my back.
That's not easy.
No one wants me the way I am.
No one?
Am I no one?
And Pierre?
And Suzanne?
You had three lovers in my story.
- All at once?
- No, one after the other.
You preferred one of them.
What did he look like?
He was...brawny.
Like this.
Like a construction worker I know.
- Was he handsome?
- Magnificent.
He had big hands.
Above all, he was clever.
He showed you the difference between breaking a window and breaking a window.
He taught you how to distinguish friend from foe, and not to break windows on your own anymore.
He explained why your enemies are your enemies.
Did I understand?
Yes, you got the gist.
Why do you write stories?
I'm just doing my bit.
In your story, do they know the truth about the rifle shot?
- Who?
- The cops.
No.
It was quite natural.
It wasn't your fault the rifle was handy.
It had to be of some use one day.
It was better the bullet went here than here.
Did you explain why your fat girl fired?
Why?
She couldn't not be her true self forever.
But the act itself wasn't important.
The important thing is what set things in motion.
The freedom to be yourself is systematically denied to too many people.
- Tell me her story again.
- You'll be late.
- Who were her enemies?
- The same as yours.
And who are my enemies?
Think.
Obviously the foreman at the factory the little boss of the shoe store, his mummy my uncle's cops, and the shoe store's cops.
The boss of law, the boss of sausages, the boss of boots, and the boss of cops!
I'll stop by the shop later.
Good morning, miss.
I'd like to buy a pair of shoes.
This way.
What do you have in mind?
I'd like shoes to put my feet in.
Shoes to walk in, simple shoes.
I think I've got just the thing.
How did it go?
It went alright.
Is he the little boss man?
Shall I punch his face in?
Have you got cash on you?
Yes, twenty francs.
Well, aren't you rich!
I'll see what I have at that price.
What size?
Like this, perhaps?
Nice and warm.
Too warm.
These are no good.
Neither are these.
These are practical.
A bit big.
That's better.
So are these...
That's the left.
And the right?
That looks nice.
But a little too small.
Soft.
Comfortable.
They fit like a glove!
You think?
They're elegant!
Then I'll keep them on, if they're so elegant.
- Sure you're alright?
- Yes, don't worry.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Au revoir, mademoiselle.
Au revoir, mademoiselle?
The second one this week buying tennis shoes...
In December!
Couldn't we use these notes?
No, you can't rehash stuff like that.
So we'll forget the adventures of the lovely Rosemonde?
Yes.
It's not my decision, it was decided by the facts.
Rosemonde engulfed us.
Shit!
What about the television money?
Another little debt.
Anyway, you didn't want to work on it.
I did at first.
I lured you into it.
I'll take responsibility.
That'll teach me.
Someone's knocking.
- Someone to inspect the place.
- Again!
Spiritual Defense were already here.
I represent your landlord's interest.
I'm here to evaluate your furniture.
Huh?
Why?
You signed a lease, which you clearly did not read.
It states that your belongings must equal the value of eighteen months rent.
In your case that's exactly 6,300 francs.
What's the point of all this?
In case non-payment of rent necessitates seizure of your effects.
In case you didn't know, your rent has not been paid in four months.
- Four months?
- Yes.
- Are you the boss?
- Excuse me?
Are you director of the estate?
No, I'm head clerk.
Now, how much is this lot worth?
I don't know.
Do your job, estimate, evaluate.
You sure have a strange job.
What do you mean?
You're not the boss but you have to act like you are.
I'm his legal representative.
What will become of you when property is nationalized?
That day still seems far away.
I'm not sure it will ever come in our country.
And even if it did, there are ways to get around it.
It just takes imagination.
I know a guy who succeeded by inventing a new way of squeezing mayonnaise.
Before, they were ordinary bottles and the mayonaisse squirted out.
He had a brilliant idea of chamfering the edge of the hole so the mayonaisse comes out all twisted and ribbed.
It looks great on sliced hard-boiled eggs.
He made a fortune, and now he's the boss.
The value of the furnishings amounted to scarcely 750 francs.
And that was a generous estimate.
The inspector took note, and left.
What a mess!
I made a decision.
I'm going to Paris.
I've had enough of this awful town.
And the papers, too.
Here or there...
Paris is also unbearable.
That's their problem.
At least I'm not at home there.
Does the Paris paper pay you?
A little.
I'll get by.
I'll find a place to sleep.
And I'll run up debts.
Devaluation is faster in France, and lawsuits are slower here.
I'll sell my car.
Catherine will take the apartment.
If you need a room in town...
Let me give you my phone number.
What's the matter?
You must be crazy.
It looks nice.
You have nice legs.
What are you doing?
Are you mad?
Sir!
Your salesgirl is mad!
She's getting fresh with me!
What happened?
I don't know what came over me.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, madam.
I'll handle it.
I've never seen the likes of it!
Do you need money for Christmas?
When's Christmas?
In five days.
Unfathomable sadness!
- How many days off do we have?
- Three.
What a waste!
Jesus and Maria!
He's sad.
He's going to sing.
It's too early.
I never sing before ten.
Written anything lately?
The story of a girl who tried to kill her uncle.
A serious thing?
An erotic tale?
Not at all.
What are you doing?
Rosemonde!
Yes, sir?
Come here!
You must leave here at once!
Get out!
You're completely mad.
You're a little slut!
Go on, get!
Unbelievable!
Goodbye, madam.
Sir.
Thank you very, very much.
It was the 20th of December.
The so-called holidays approached menacingly.
The crowds assaulted the shops, in accordance with mercantile law.
A tendency towards marked schizophrenia was evident, a sickness which threatened to engulf the entire social strata.
It still hadn't snowed, which, for this time of year, was actually not the least bit unusual.
Hey, hey, you're digging the master jock for solid rock Sweet Al Monte blasting, babies.
Being bold and pouring coal on KRML in quaint little Carmel-by-the-Sea.
We're next door to magnificent Monterey, home of the annual jazz festival.
Although it's four months away, you got to get your tickets because they're going fast and it can't last.
The time is 7:54 and there's a breeze of 50 degrees around your loving hips, and there's a taste of fog.
I say we got a bowl of soul, and if you think your heart can take it...
Now we're gonna wrap it up for the week, folks.
A brand-new release from the funk capital of the world, Squeeze Me.
Here he comes, the big "D" himself, Dave Garver.
And Dave is gonna bring you five hours of mellow groove.
In the meantime, this is Sweet Al Monte saying:
"Hang in there, babies, because everything is going to be everything."
'Bye.
What's that letter you got there?
Is that that Frisco gig?
Yeah.
All right, so what's happening?
They want the usual thing:
A biography, pictures.
Really?
Is that that Madge Brenner chick?
Yeah, she's the one putting it together.
In that case, David, you're in.
How do you figure that?
Now, David, come on, man.
Are you kidding?
She's a grandmother.
So when did that ever stop you?
You better get a move on.
I already played your theme.
Yeah, I heard it.
You're a real human being.
And you're on the air, baby.
All right.
"Men have destroyed the roads of wonder
"And their cities squat like black toads
"In the orchards of life nothing is clean or real
"Or as a girl, naked to love or be a man with"
This is Dave Garver with a little verse, a little talk and five hours of music to be very, very nice to each other by.
- KRML, Dave Garver speaking.
- Hello?
- Hi, what'll it be?
- Play Misty for me.
Misty?
We have that right on the play rack.
Thanks for calling.
I see you got your little Misty chick calling you again.
All righty.
- Swing along.
- You take it easy now.
See you in the a.m.
KRML, Dave Garver.
- Hi, Murphy.
- Hi, Dave.
No messages for you.
- No?
- Heard your show tonight.
It sure beats hell out of working for a living.
- Thanks for the plug.
- What are friends for?
- Bartender.
- Coke?
Coming right up.
She's waiting for someone.
You sure?
That's what she says.
Guys have been striking out all night.
One game?
- Cry Bastion?
- What else?
Okay, coach.
You asked for it.
Don't take all night.
Move.
Okay.
Move.
Palfrey's Gambit.
Dirty rat.
Are we playing Copenhagen rules?
Make it easy on yourself, Murph.
Cry Bastion.
Sorry, no Bastion.
Damn, I didn't see that.
It's too bad, Murphy.
Too bad.
- Careful now.
- That ought to do it.
Be really careful now.
Careful.
Hi.
He doesn't see it.
Yeah?
Cry Bastion.
Fool's ploy, my man.
Fool's ploy.
Care to play the winner?
I'll just watch.
- My name is Dave Garver.
- Evelyn Draper.
Sit down, Evelyn Draper?
Care for a drink?
Okay.
- What'll it be?
- Surprise me.
- Screwdriver.
- Nice game.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- What happened?
- I won.
How?
When?
When you said, "Okay."
I ought to be mad.
But you're not.
Not really.
It certainly was nice of you to bring me home, Mr. Garver?
That's right.
I don't think I've been stood up on a date since the ninth grade back in Albany.
Is something wrong?
No, I keep getting the feeling I know you from someplace.
- You do?
- Yeah.
Here.
Why don't you let me do that?
Oh, no.
That's all right.
I've got it.
Why don't you see if you can get the fire started?
All right.
There are some matches right next to it.
All right.
It's getting late.
You're sure I'm not keeping you up?
No.
I rarely get to bed before 3:00 a.m.
I didn't have a date tonight.
I went there because you talk about it on your program sometimes and I wanted to meet you.
I listen to you all the time.
I knew somebody was out there.
- You're making fun of me.
- No, I'm not.
- Say something else.
- Such as?
Play Misty for me?
Very good.
- You sure I'm not keeping you up?
- Don't you like me?
You're a very nice girl.
But who needs nice girls?
No, I like them.
I'm kind of hung up on one.
And you don't want to complicate your life.
- That's exactly right.
- Neither do I.
But that's no reason we shouldn't sleep together tonight if we feel like it.
Solid silicone.
Hi, David, my man!
How you been, baby?
See you got the joint cleaned up for once.
The Heavy digs it.
- Care for a beer?
- Not really.
I could go for something more uplifting, but not a brew, my man.
Beer is all we've got.
You're gonna have to ease on out.
I got a lot of work to do today.
You don't understand.
I've been sent here to get you.
By whom?
That old chick I go with.
What's her name?
- Carol?
- That's the one.
Girl thinks you've been working too hard.
She said we should get together tonight.
Who's this "we"?
Me, you, her and one of them hens that you can dig up.
There is a fantastic new Mexican place in Carmel called Susinos.
The albóndigas soup is unbelievable.
It is a mind-bender...
I know the joint, but I don't have a date, and I got a lot to do.
Big deal, man.
Get one!
If you have any problems getting one, I'll get one for you as nice as I look.
It's too late, and besides, I've got a lot of work to do.
But you gotta eat, David.
I'm gonna whip up something here in my own kitchen.
You know, David, I'm really worried about your social life.
You'll make someone a tremendous mother.
Too narrow in the pelvis.
I sure appreciate you dropping by, Al.
Come by again sometime, anytime.
Never let it be said that Sweet Al Monte can't take a hint.
- Who's hinting?
- Hi.
Why, hi there, yourself.
Dave Garver live here?
That depends on your point of view.
Hi.
This stuff weighs a ton.
Where's the kitchen?
Right inside.
Just come on in and help yourself.
Swing right around the bend there.
I know, David, she's from Chicken Delight.
Look, don't work too hard, my man.
Don't strain yourself.
How come you don't have any beer?
And what is this?
A shrunken head?
Does that guy live here?
- I wanted...
- I hope you like steak.
- You look like a steak-and-potatoes type.
- Hang on.
I said to myself, a nice salad with Roquefort and tomatoes and baked potato with...
- What's going on here?
- Don't send me away.
- No, I want to ask you a question.
I just wanted to surprise you.
Surprise?
What happens if he and I had been talking business?
Or maybe I have female company and you come traipsing in with groceries?
That would be some surprise.
I'm sorry.
Keep that stuff.
I think I've lost my appetite.
Hang on a minute.
I'm just trying to tell you something.
I don't understand.
Should I go or stay?
What?
I'm telling you there's a telephone, and I pick it up and I dial it.
You answer and I say, "What are you doing?"
And I say, "I'll be right over."
Fine.
Next time, why don't we do it that way?
Okay.
Any way you like.
Next time.
How do you like your steak?
Extremely rare.
That's just how I like mine.
Extremely rare.
I'll get some wine here.
A little vino.
Vino!
All this and heaven, too!
Terrific!
This is gonna be some dinner.
What happened to that discussion we had last time?
You know, the deal about no strings and all that?
There are no strings, but I never said anything about not coming back for seconds, did I?
That's right.
You didn't.
When will I see you?
I'll give you a call.
- Dave, you're funny.
- How's that?
If you want to keep playing these games, okay, but they're really not necessary anymore, not for me.
People are trying to sleep here!
People are trying to talk here!
- How'd you like to tell that to the law?
- How'd you like to go screw yourself?
Take it easy!
Guy's just trying to sleep, that's all.
You're right.
It's a terrific morning.
Why be selfish with it?
Bye-bye.
Wait a minute!
Yeah?
Excuse me, I saw the sweater, and I thought you were somebody else.
You must be David.
Where have you been?
Around.
I was trying to join the revolt against the representational.
Didn't quite make that though.
So now I'm just trying to play it cool.
Not quite making that either.
Got time for a break?
- Yeah.
- Let's go.
- When did you get in town?
- Yesterday.
- You weren't gonna call me?
- Of course I was.
I had to get settled first.
You shouldn't lend your sweaters to blabbermouths.
You've gotten thinner.
No!
Well, so much for Sausalito.
Sausalito?
That's where I was staying.
Jay Jay's place.
- Jay Jay's place?
- It's nothing much, really.
It's just a little pied-à-terre, but it's handy to the fleet.
You told me you didn't know where she was.
So I lied.
Picket me.
- Thanks a lot.
- Listen, stud, it wasn't my idea.
You should have caught her act.
The whole Bette Davis, through-finished-kaput scene.
- And at 3:00 a.m.
- Come on, Jay Jay.
He's exaggerating.
I'll check with Malcolm.
Maybe I can get you the afternoon off.
What happened, pussycat?
He ran into Anjelica.
She told him I was back.
That bitch should be hung by the thumbs or something equally appropriate.
It's all set up.
Let's go.
It's nothing personal, really.
I happen to think she could be a first-rate artist if her damned hormones didn't get in the way.
- There's not much he can do about that.
- He could kill himself.
Jay Jay, why don't you go cruise some sailors?
Please, don't mention seafood.
Come on.
I really missed this place.
I missed you.
You'd do me a big favor if you didn't say things like that.
Why is that?
I don't know.
Somehow it brings out the worst in me.
It makes me want to say things like, "How's that redhead?"
What?
The redhead, the one who worked in the bookstore.
She went back to Berkeley or whatever.
That's too bad.
You always have that blonde from Santa Barbara to fall back on.
If that's the phrase I'm looking for, and I think it probably is.
What are we gonna do?
Go through a whole list?
Is that it?
Who's got that kind of time?
I just don't know if I'm up to it anymore.
Up to what?
Those nights sitting and waiting for you to finish your program and come by.
Nights when it would start to get late and I'd start to think:
"I wonder if he's run himself off a cliff or maybe he's run into a blonde."
There was a time when I started rooting for the accident.
I mean, if it was a choice between that and a blonde.
You don't know how secure you make me feel.
I didn't wish you anything too serious.
Just a couple of months in traction.
You're all heart.
You know, the thing I hate the most in the whole world is a jealous female and that's what I was becoming.
That's why I had to split.
I was starting to be one of my most unfavorite people.
I hated it.
I know you did, too.
That still works anyway.
- Too well sometimes.
- What does that mean?
I mean, there's a little spot in the middle of each day, just about your size.
There's lots of girls my size if you're really looking.
I'm not.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You mean you've given up girls?
I haven't exactly been the monk of the month or anything like that but I have been making an effort.
There must be a real consternation among those "gropies."
That's "groupies," isn't it?
I don't know, "groupies, gropies..."
You know, you've got to be fair.
It hasn't just been my fault.
Listen, I know.
They kept overpowering you.
You get a little bit of the blame, too, you know.
You and that parade of roommates that keep moving in and out of your place.
I didn't realize they were such a trial to you.
What trial?
I enjoyed it.
You and I sitting in front of the fireplace and then some chick sitting there with a bathrobe on, eating Fig Newtons.
What about the one with the St. Bernard?
She was a real winner.
She took up enough space.
And then that other one that took the flute lessons.
Yeah, maybe it was a little rough on you.
I can think of a thousand reasons why we should try again.
I've got about seven billion things to do.
What do you think?
You want to try for a new start, right from the letter "A"?
- What am I gonna do with you?
- A lot.
Hi.
Excuse me.
Hi.
- You've met Anjelica, my...
- Roommate.
Yes.
I think I'll drive into Carmel and see if I can't find some cleaning solvent.
There's plenty under the sink.
Okay.
This house ought to have a revolving door.
You know when my father left me this house, he left me payments.
I can't handle that expense by myself and most girls don't like the isolation.
- It's a long way from town.
- I know.
I better get back to work.
- Thanks.
- That's it, "thanks"?
Four months in Sausalito is a long time.
I am not gonna get back on that same old merry-go-round again.
What do I have to do, give you a notarized statement?
I need a couple of more days to try and figure out where I'm at.
Okay.
You get your bearings, and then you'll give me a call, all right?
- Hi, Murph.
- Hi, Dave.
Sardine Factory.
Dave Garver?
You said this is Evelyn?
No.
Sorry, you've just missed him.
- What do you mean?
- He's gone.
He's not here.
I think you'd better look again.
Believe me, you just missed him.
Now if you're interested in someone more sophisticated I'll be happy to...
That's what I get for being a dirty old man.
There's a message for you, a Madge somebody from San Francisco.
- Brenner?
- That's it.
Al Monte gave her this number.
"Received pictures and biography.
"Please send a two-hour tape of your show as soon as possible."
- Thanks, Murph.
- Don't mention it.
I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be your social secretary.
You will put that on my tab?
Surprise!
What are you doing here?
I was calling you from that phone booth and he told me you'd left and I was staring right at your car.
Isn't that funny?
Yeah, kind of funny.
Why didn't you take my call?
Where does it say I gotta drop everything and answer the phone every time it rings?
Do you know your nostrils flare out into little wings when you're mad?
- It's kind of cute.
- Come on, Evelyn.
I gotta go.
- I'd love a Coke.
- Not now, I gotta get to the station.
No, you don't.
You're talking to your No. 1 fan.
You don't work tonight.
I've got this show that I'm trying to set and it's very important to me.
That means I gotta pick the music, write the lead-ins and find some poetry.
- Come on, will you?
- Poetry?
- Let me help you.
I'm terrific with poetry...
- Not tonight!
Does he want his keys?
- Come on, Evelyn.
- Speak.
- Come on!
- God!
Good boy!
Let's hear it.
Come on.
Come on.
Give me my keys.
- Come on.
Give me the keys.
- Come on.
Give me the keys, goddamn it!
- Having some trouble, lady?
- Get lost!
Yeah, get lost, assholes!
Let's split.
He's got enough trouble already.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
'Bye.
See you later.
Hi.
Get all your work done?
What do you want, Evelyn?
One Coke?
I'll tell you, tonight I'm really whipped.
What time is it?
Time for me to go home.
Go back to sleep.
- Hey, I've got an idea.
- What's that?
Some night this week, after the show corned beef and potato salad, dill pickles, the whole bit.
My place.
Deal?
I'll call you.
Thursday's good for me.
And now from KRML, the big-band sounds of Dee Barton.
Here's a fresh reel of tape for your air check.
- You want me to thread it up?
- No, leave it here.
Thanks.
I think I will go out and hit the streets, but before doing that I will blow me a little number.
Care to partake?
Take it in the other room.
I get zonked just breathing the air here.
All right, be that way.
- AI?
- Yeah?
Do you ever find yourself being completely smothered by somebody?
- Anybody I know?
- You met her at my house the other day.
Chicken Delight!
That's what I call a pretty good smothering.
You start a relationship thinking you're gonna be completely honest and suddenly the whole thing gets out of hand.
What's the problem?
The problem is I've been trying to uncomplicate my life and now I can't even answer the door.
Besides, Tobie's back.
Oh, really?
Tobie?
When?
- I ran into her Sunday.
- That was a goody.
I'll tell you the truth.
I've always thought Tobie was one of the foxiest chicks on the peninsula.
And why you gotta have so much action, I just don't understand it anyway.
It's just a hang-up I have, or had.
But now that I seem to have that straightened out I can't seem to solve this other problem.
Well, you know what they always say, my man.
No, what?
"He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword."
Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
Later.
We'll have more smooth sounds in just one minute but first, at ten minutes to the hour, we're broadcasting from KRML in the Carmel Rancho Shopping Center home of the buccaneer, the man's boutique.
KRML, Dave Garver speaking.
The whole point in having an answering service is to call in once in a while to check for messages.
Hi, Evelyn.
What's happening?
What could be happening, darling?
You're not here yet.
"Yet"?
I hope you like pastrami, because there was no corned beef.
Now, wait a minute.
Just hold on.
Are you trying to tell me you forgot that we have a date tonight?
I thought I was supposed to call you on that.
I feel kind of silly sitting here in my brand-new lounging pajamas.
I just assumed...
Apparently, I assumed wrong.
That's right.
You assumed wrong.
You don't have to come over if you've got something better to do.
I'll be over in a little while.
You and I are gonna have to have a talk.
Whatever you say.
In the meantime, haven't you forgotten something else?
What's that?
Weren't you gonna play Misty for me?
Yeah.
I have that one right here.
Thank you, darling.
And now we have a pretty one for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night.
It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty.
And this one is especially for Evelyn.
Just a second.
Come in.
Hi.
Hi.
- Cold night?
- Yeah.
But you got here anyway.
Stout fella.
There's something we're gonna have to get straight.
It's amazing what a man will go through for a hot pastrami sandwich.
- Look...
- Wait a minute.
You haven't told me how nice I look.
- You look fine.
- The sales lady guaranteed you'd flip.
- Now, listen.
Can we talk?
- Wait.
First...
Surprise.
- Don't you like them?
- Yeah, they're great, but...
Don't spoil my fun, darling.
I love to give you things.
It's Madame Butterfly time.
First, friendly neighborhood geisha remove honorable shoes.
Stop it, Evelyn!
Now, we've gotta talk!
Have I done something wrong?
I'm just trying to be straight with you, that's all.
Be nice to me instead.
Jesus Christ!
I don't understand.
Are you trying to say you don't love me anymore?
I never told you that I loved you.
Not in words maybe, but there are ways of saying things that have nothing to do with words.
I'm sorry you read it that way.
It's that other bitch, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
The silver-framed picture in your dresser.
- That picture's got nothing to do with you.
- What does have to do with me?
- I never lied to you.
- Big deal.
He never lied to me.
What do you want for that?
The Congressional Medal of Honor?
- So long.
- What am I supposed to do?
Sit here all dressed up in my little whore suit waiting for my lord and master to call?
- Nobody asked you to wait for anything.
- You're not dumping me!
- Get off my back, Evelyn!
- Get off your back?
That's where you've been keeping me, isn't it?
You're nothing!
You're not even good in bed!
I just felt sorry for you, that's all!
Bastard!
You poor, pathetic bastard!
Hello?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean those things I said.
Will I see you tomorrow?
You don't listen, do you?
Let me come over.
If I could just see you, just talk to you.
- No, Evelyn.
- But I love you, David.
I love you.
David!
If I could just...
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Why?
No, come on.
You haven't heard a word I've been saying.
- I have.
I've heard everything you said.
- You did?
All right, tell me.
- You don't believe me?
- Go ahead.
Okay, wise chick.
We're supposed to go to a party at Big Sur tomorrow night.
I'm supposed to meet you there at 9:00.
And the address is...
I didn't tell you that.
See how you are?
I don't know myself yet.
I'll call you tomorrow about it.
Okay.
You call me tomorrow.
Honey, we better go.
- We're just getting to the best part.
- But I've got to pick Anjelica up at 6:00.
God!
How the pain is setting in.
Come on.
She's a very nice girl.
Anyway, she's moving out tonight.
Now, that's about the best news I've heard in years.
And Madalyn's moving in.
Madalyn?
Shit.
- What's going on?
- Don't tell me he was asleep!
What else at this hour of the morning?
I'm surprised his conscience was that clear!
- What do you want, Evelyn?
- "What do you want, Evelyn?"
Do I have to want something?
Can't I just come over?
Or is it inconvenient?
- Wait a...
- Did I make a boo-boo?
Has someone been sleeping in Papa Bear's bed?
Wait a minute, goddamn it!
"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
I thought...
God, don't look at me that way, Dave.
I just don't know what to say to you.
I'm sorry I mistrusted you.
I know you'd never spoil it.
To spoil what?
What we have between us.
We don't have a goddamn thing!
How many ways do I have to say this?
I don't care how many ways you say it, it's not true!
- What do I have to do to convince you?
- It's not true!
It's not!
What are you doing?
I'm gonna get dressed and drive you home, that's what.
Why are you playing these games?
Why are you pretending you don't love me?
I don't even believe I'm hearing this.
But I love you!
You haven't got the vaguest idea what love is.
We don't even know each other.
Wait a minute.
You don't have to do that.
I'm okay.
I can drive home.
Are you sure?
Positive.
I'm fine.
Let me just wash my face.
You ready?
You okay?
Oh, no.
How's she gonna be?
I sutured the wounds.
It wasn't quite as bad as it looked.
It couldn't have been.
You know, Dave, I'm supposed to turn a report in on this.
But you won't.
You see, Tobie's back.
I'd rather tell her, and not have her read it in the paper somewhere.
I didn't know that.
I'll tell Marie.
We'll do the spaghetti number.
- Somebody gonna be around here today?
- Me.
I'll be here.
I bombed her out pretty good.
Let her sleep it off before you take her home.
- And how long will that be?
- It's hard to say.
Why?
- I'd like to take Tobie out tonight.
- No problem.
She'll wake up sometime this afternoon, 5:00 or so.
Is she gonna be all right?
The cuts were really pretty superficial.
I mean, do you think she'll try it again?
Chances are against it.
But I'd watch her.
I wouldn't leave her alone if she seems unusually depressed or insecure.
Better get some sleep yourself.
You look like hell.
Call me if you need me.
Thanks, Frank.
I really appreciate it.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
Fine.
Here.
Thank you.
Brought you a little soup.
It looks good.
I don't know what to say.
It frightens me thinking about it.
Don't think about it.
I don't mean me.
I mean you.
"Girl commits suicide in disc jockey's home."
It's not very good publicity for a man in your position.
Get some rest.
As soon as you feel better, I'll take you home.
Thank you, David.
I got your clothes hung up in the closet there.
Maybe you better answer the phone.
Yeah.
I'll get it in the other room.
Hello.
Hi.
I just wanted to check.
We still on for tonight?
Yeah, I'm ready to go.
What time is the party?
Madalyn's already left, and she won't be back for a long time and I was just thinking...
Would you be disappointed if we didn't go to the party and just stayed here instead?
I think I can bear up under it.
Don't be too long.
- That's me at the door.
- David the way I look at it, the hell with Sausalito.
Bye-bye.
Evelyn?
- What's the matter?
Take it easy.
- I had a dream.
I was drowning in the ocean and I called to you, but you just stood there watching.
Watching.
It was just a dream.
Oh, God, I'm so alone.
Hold me.
Hold me, Dave.
Please.
Yeah.
Tighter.
Tighter.
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.
David!
I woke up and you were gone.
If you have something planned for tonight, you could just take me home.
Maybe that'd be best.
No, no, there's nothing.
Good.
Isn't this nice?
Just us here, together.
Here we go again.
Stone-cold dead in the market.
Must have been quite a party.
Go away, Birdie.
Any other bodies, any other juiceheads around here?
Come back tomorrow, will you?
Or next year sometime.
I better check the workbench.
All right, break it up in here.
Looks like old times around this place.
Evelyn?
Lose something, tiger?
You couldn't find it within your heart to come back at a later time, could you?
This is a later time, pussycat.
I'm paying you back for the day I blew last week.
Evelyn?
Very funny, Birdie.
Very funny.
What I can't figure out is, with all this action going on in here what are you doing out there couching it?
What is this, some kind of Kinsey Report?
Do I come over to your house and ask a lot of dumb questions?
You just ought to, pussycat.
Might open up a whole new way of life to you.
Hold it.
Let's try to show a little class, shall we?
Mr. Garver's residence.
I'll see.
Do you want to talk to a Madge Brenner?
Yeah.
I want to talk to her.
Thanks.
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Garver?
Madge Brenner.
We like the tape on your show.
Like it very much.
There are one or two others in the running, but, frankly...
Can we have lunch today?
- Windjammer still good?
- Yeah, still very good.
Reserve a table in your name.
- See you then, Mr. Garver.
- Great.
Bye-bye.
Looks like we found Evelyn.
"Good morning, darling.
Gone shopping.
"Back in a flash with the hash."
A little humor in there.
"Love and kisses, Evelyn."
And then it says:
"If you can't find your keys, don't worry.
"I borrowed your car."
Here's your key, and here's your copy.
That'll be $0.40, please.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
David?
I stopped by my...
Hi.
Don't you look all gussied up?
Good.
I was gonna cook brunch but this calls for something more festive.
How about the Marquis?
My treat.
- After all I put you through, it's the least...
- I have a lunch date.
Business.
- Business?
- Yeah.
Can I have my car keys?
Sure.
I think you ought to take it easy, anyway.
Get some rest.
Yeah, I do feel a little tired.
Very funny, Dave.
Now, let's talk show.
Tell me, what do you think of the concept?
The unstructured the loosey-goosey, Monterey pop, Woodstock kind of thing?
I like it very much, and I think I can handle it.
So do I.
I'll keep this to promote your new career with.
You'll be working with kids, bright and marvelous.
But they take handling.
If this goes the way I think it will there's no reason in the world why...
- Isn't this cozy?
So this is your business lunch?
How's business?
Friend of yours?
- Just another trick.
- That's enough.
Is that your idea of a dish?
She's a little old for you, isn't she?
What is this, "Be Kind to Senior Citizens Week"?
Get outta here!
I don't mind you being a bastard, but do you have to be a tasteless one?
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
She couldn't get laid in a lumber camp!
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
You're hurting me!
Stop it, you dirty bastard!
No!
Stop it!
Dave!
No!
No!
Don't leave me!
Don't leave me!
She's nothing!
Nothing!
Nothing!
- I love you!
- Get her outta here.
Where to?
I did it because I love you.
Don't you understand that?
- I love you!
- Where to?
- Move!
- It's because I love you!
Dave, please.
This is a private beach.
- I want to talk to you.
- I don't want to talk to you.
Are you drunk?
No, but that's not a bad idea.
- Why, David?
- Why what?
Drunk?
No.
Why last night?
That's what I came to explain to you.
Okay, good.
I think we should understand each other.
I'm not very happy with you.
That's fair enough.
Whatever it was, you could have called me.
No, I couldn't.
Why not?
I couldn't tell you the truth last night.
I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.
Now, why do you have to say that?
I just didn't want to take a chance she'd try it again.
What if she does?
I swear to you, if she ever tries it I'd just let her go right on ahead.
God!
Oh, my God.
What in the...
Oh, God, help me!
Please, somebody, help me!
Help me, somebody!
Oh, God, help me!
- Stay back, buddy.
- I live here, man.
Is she your housecleaning lady, Garver?
Okay, boys, let's take her out.
Watch your step.
It's gonna cost you double to clean up this mess.
Watch your step.
- Dave Garver?
- Yeah.
I'm Sgt. McCallum.
Any ideas?
About what?
About your girlfriend in there.
That's not my girlfriend.
Let me get that straight right in front.
More or less a casual acquaintance, you'd say?
That's right.
You're saying she came by to hack up your wardrobe and your cleaning lady?
I'm not trying to tell you anything, Sergeant.
Maybe you ought to.
The lady almost got herself killed.
And I'm stumbling around in my stupid way trying to find out why.
What'll you have?
This Evelyn Draper, where does she come from?
I don't know.
- What about her family?
- I don't know that either.
She just listens to my radio show, and we met one night.
That's all.
- Practically a stranger.
- That's right.
Then how does she happen to have a key to your front door?
I don't know that either.
It boils down to, you don't know a hell of a lot, do you?
What it boils down to is, I'm getting sick of your questions.
And so am I!
But they get upset with me down at the store if I don't ask them.
- Just take her through.
I'll be right along.
- Right.
- Take her through what?
- Booking.
What she really needs is psychiatric help.
Really?
Now, look, those cuts on her wrists...
Don't know anything about those.
There's one other thing.
I know, "Don't leave town."
I was gonna say, "Why don't you play some Mantovani sometime?"
Didn't know you liked the show.
I don't.
I like Mantovani.
Go ahead, play!
All right!
Those of you who may have played brass instruments you know that was triple-tonguin', baby.
Let's give his tongue a nice hand!
He might just be the fastest tongue in the West!
- Come on.
- All right, I'm coming.
What do you say...
- Something to eat?
- I've got to pick up my roommate, Annabel.
- Madalyn's your roommate.
- I found my man, and I'm moving out.
- And Annabel's moving in.
- Right.
- 'Bye.
- Ciao.
See you later.
Thank you.
Thank you very kindly.
That was the Cannonball Adderley Group.
They're playing at the Monterey Jazz Festival with Duke Ellington, Woody Herman, Joe Williams and many others.
Still got tickets for Sunday.
So get on out there because that's where it's happening.
Now we're gonna hear from the Gator Creek Organization and Feelin' Fine.
KRML.
Dave Garver.
Hello.
Play Misty for me.
David?
I didn't mean to shake you up.
I'm sorry.
Pretty stupid of me.
I've been released.
Therapy.
It was a bad dream, but it's over.
- Where are you?
- The airport.
San Francisco.
I've only got a minute between planes.
- Got a job in Hawaii.
- You're all right then?
Fine, David.
Fine.
I just want to say how sorry I am about everything.
- Forget it.
I have.
- I hope so.
"Because this maiden she lived with no other thought
"Than to love and be loved by you."
Are you near a radio?
No.
But play it for me anyway.
Hello.
- Garver?
- Yeah.
Sgt. McCallum.
Sorry to wake you but something's come up.
I know.
She just paid me a visit with a butcher knife.
Why?
Because she was released on parole pending further legal action.
When?
A week ago.
I sure like the way you broke your ass to let me know!
- I just found out about it myself.
- Who's in charge down there anyway?
Now, look.
Do you want to help find her or would you rather just sit there and bellyache?
- All right.
- Good.
Now exactly what did she say to you?
I told you.
She said that she was well and that she was going to Hawaii.
What else?
- I already told you.
- Tell me again.
You know, you really make lousy conversation.
You make lousy coffee.
Come on, what else did she say?
Nothing, except...
- Except what?
- It was nothing.
It was a line from a poem.
- What poem?
- Lf I knew that, I'd know the line.
- Try to remember.
- You know, McCallum, it's getting late.
You're sounding very monotonous.
You're not exactly my idea of a swinging date either.
Good night, McCallum.
- What happened to the Mantovani?
- The what?
I heard the show, but I never did hear you play Mantovani.
You really did listen to the show?
Friend, if we had a TV down at the station I'd break my arm before I turned your show on.
Thanks a lot.
Just hope we're lucky enough to grab her the next time she tries it.
Tries what?
To kill you.
Yeah.
And if you're not lucky enough?
That'd be hell.
The guys down at the station would have to chip in and buy a TV.
You're a great comfort, Sergeant.
You will change the locks?
Hi.
Nothing like a nice brisk walk in the woods to put roses on a girl's cheeks.
How are you?
Not so good, honey.
- She's back.
- Who?
Evelyn Draper, the girl who tried to kill Birdie.
How can she be back?
I thought they'd put her in a state sanitarium.
- They did, but they let her out.
- Does that mean she's all right?
Theoretically.
What happens now?
I think you and I ought to stay away from each other for a couple of days just in case she's tagging after me.
She's already following you, isn't she?
I don't want you to worry about it.
I can handle myself.
Yeah.
So could Birdie.
All right then, you stand by.
They're all set to trace the call.
When she phones, just mention her by name right away, Evelyn and they start to trace her.
All you gotta do after that is just keep her talking.
Fifteen minutes before the hour here at KRML and here's It's Not Unusual.
I guess it hasn't come to you yet.
- What?
- What she said.
Over the phone last night?
Part of a poem or something.
You were gonna try to remember.
I thought I had that, but I've forgotten.
Is it that important?
Until we pick her up, everything's important.
What's wrong?
I'm worried about my girlfriend with all this going on.
They're so damn isolated down there.
I'm thinking the best thing to do is just have Al Monte sub for me.
The only chance we've got is when she phones in here tonight.
You've got to be here, right on that mike.
- Lf she phones.
- She will.
Believe me.
But only if you're here.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
If it'll make you feel better, I'll go over and check your girlfriend's house myself.
I'd sure appreciate that.
She lives on Spindrift Road.
I think it's the fourth or fifth house down.
- "Williams" is on the mailbox.
- Why don't you phone her?
- Okay.
- Tell her to be expecting me.
McCallum.
Thanks.
Public servant.
- Hello?
- Hi.
I'm just checking in.
You all right?
Marvelous.
I'm just getting ready to do my nails and I got your program on.
And Annabel's in the kitchen making a couple of coffee grogs.
What more could a girl ask for?
No, honey, everything's fine.
There's a Sgt. McCallum that's gonna drop by for a second to see if you've buttoned up all right.
Let him in, but nobody else.
Okay.
David, you want to play something soft and dreamy for us?
You got it.
Bye-bye.
'Bye, hon.
- Annabel, how's that stuff coming?
- Here's something soft and sentimental for Tobie and Annabel.
Hope you like cinnamon in yours.
Whatever's right.
Annabel.
Good?
Too much.
- So is this.
- Thank you.
Just one thing.
Do you mind?
No, be my guest.
The eyes are wrong.
David's are more...
How shall I say?
Colder.
I didn't know you knew David.
I didn't realize you and David were friends.
Friends?
No, not friends.
Not friends.
God, you're dumb.
"Because this maiden she lived with no other thought
"Than to love and be loved by you."
- Tobie?
- We're waiting for you, David.
This is Dave Garver with a little verse a little talk and five hours of music to be very, very nice to each other by.
Careful.
Careful.
I might put your eye out.
I'll bet David loves your eyes.
And your hair.
Does he run his fingers through your hair?
Have to get you all nice for David.
For David.
I hope he likes what he sees when he walks in here because that's what he's taking to hell with him.
Miss Williams?
McCallum?
And now we have a pretty one for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night.
It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty.
And this one is especially for Evelyn.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
AL MONTE:
Hey, hey, hey!
You're digging the master jock for solid rock.
Sweet Al Monte blasting, babies.
Being bold and pouring coal on station KRML in quaint little Carmel-by-the-Sea.
And we're right next door to magnificent Monterey, home of the annual jazz festival.
And don't forget, even though it's four months away, you got to get your tickets, Jim, because they're going fast and they can't last.
All right, now.
The time is 7:54 and there's a breeze of 50 degrees around your ever-loving hips, and the weatherman says we have a taste of fog.
I say we got a bowl of soul, and if you think your heart can take it, whoo!
Come fly higher with The Heavy!
Now we're gonna wrap it up for the week, folks.
A brand new release from the funk capital of the world, Squeeze Me.
Uh-oh.
Here he comes, the big "D" himself, Dave Garver.
Dave, people, is gonna bring you five hours of mellow groove.
So, in the meantime, this is Sweet Al Monte saying hang in there, babies, because everything is going to be everything.
Bye.
(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)
Hey, what's that letter you got there?
Is that that Frisco gig?
Yeah.
All right, so what's happening?
They want the usual thing.
A biography, pictures.
Oh, really?
Is that that Madge Brenner chick?
Yeah, she's the one putting it together.
Well, in that case, David, you're in.
How do you figure that?
(LAUGHS) Now, David, come on, man.
Are you kidding?
Hey, she's a grandmother.
Well, so when did that ever stop you?
(EXCLAIMING)
Hey, man.
You better get a move on.
I already played your theme.
Yeah, I heard it.
You're a real human being.
And you're on the air, baby.
All right.
"Men have destroyed the roads of wonder
"And their cities squat like black toads
"In the orchards of life nothing is clean or real
"Or as a girl, naked to love or be a man with"
This is Dave Garver with a little verse, a little talk and five hours of music to be very, very nice to each other by.
KRML, Dave Garver speaking.
WOMAN:
Hello?
Hi, what'll it be?
Play Misty for me.
Misty, huh?
We have that right on the play rack.
Thanks for calling.
I see you got your little Misty chick calling you again.
All righty.
- Swing low.
- You take it easy now, huh?
See you in the a.m.
KRML, Dave Garver.
Hi, Murphy.
Oh.
Hi, Dave.
No messages for you.
No?
Heard your show tonight.
Yeah?
Well, it sure beats hell out of working for a living.
Thanks for the plug.
What are friends for?
Bartender.
Coke?
Coming right up.
Uh-uh.
She's waiting for someone.
You sure?
That's what she says.
Guys have been striking out all night.
One game?
Cry Bastion?
What else?
Okay, coach.
You asked for it.
Don't take all night.
Move.
Okay.
Move.
Palfrey's Gambit.
Dirty rat.
Are we playing Copenhagen rules?
Make it easy on yourself, Murph.
Cry Bastion.
Sorry, no Bastion.
Damn, I didn't see that.
It's too bad, Murphy.
Too bad.
Careful now.
That ought to do it.
Be really careful now.
Careful.
Hi.
He doesn't see it.
Oh, yeah?
Cry Bastion.
Fool's ploy, my man.
Fool's ploy.
Care to play the winner?
I'll just watch.
My name is Dave Garver.
Evelyn Draper.
Sit down, Evelyn Draper?
- Care for a drink?
- Okay.
- What'll it be?
- Surprise me.
Screwdriver.
Nice game.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
What happened?
I won.
How?
When?
When you said, "Okay."
I ought to be mad.
But you're not.
Not really.
Well, it certainly was nice of you to bring me home, Mr...
Garver?
That's right.
I don't think I've been stood up on a date since the ninth grade back in Albany.
Is something wrong?
No.
I keep getting the feeling I know you from someplace.
You do?
Here.
Why don't you let me do that?
Oh, no, no.
That's all right.
I've got it.
Why don't you see if you can get the fire started?
There are some matches right next to it.
All right.
It's getting late.
You're sure I'm not keeping you up?
No.
I rarely get to bed before 3:00 a.m.
I didn't have a date tonight.
I went there because you talk about it on your program sometimes.
And I wanted to meet you.
I listen to you all the time.
I knew somebody was out there.
(LAUGHS) You're making fun of me.
No, I'm not.
Say something else, huh?
Such as?
"Play Misty for me"?
Very good.
You sure I'm not keeping you up?
Don't you like me?
You're a very nice girl.
But who needs nice girls?
No, I like them.
I'm kind of hung up on one.
And you don't want to complicate your life.
That's exactly right.
Well, neither do I.
But that's no reason we shouldn't sleep together tonight, if we feel like it.
(DOOR CLOSING)
(TYPEWRITER CLACKING)
Solid silicone.
Hi, ho, David, my man!
How you been, baby?
See you got the joint cleaned up for once.
The Heavy digs it.
Care for a beer?
No, not really.
I could go for something more uplifting, but not a brew, David.
Not a brew, my man.
Beer is all we've got.
Hey, Al, you're gonna have to ease on out.
I got a heck of a lot of work to do today.
Yeah, but you don't understand, man.
I've been sent over here to get you.
By whom?
That old chick I go with.
What's her name?
- Carol?
- Yeah, that's the one.
Girl thinks you've been working too hard, man.
She said we should get together and go out tonight.
Blast the town open a little taste.
Who's this "we"?
Me, you, her and one of them hens that you can dig up.
Man, there is a fantastic new Mexican place in Carmel called Susinos.
And the albondigas soup is not to be believed.
It is a mind-bender...
I know the joint, but I don't have a date, and I got a lot to do, really.
Big deal, man.
Get one!
Look.
If you have any problems getting one, I'll get one for you, as nice as I look.
It's too late, and besides, I've got a lot of work to do.
Hey, man, but you gotta eat, David.
Yes, well, I'm gonna whip up something right here in my own kitchen.
You know, David, I'm really worried about your social life.
You know something, you're gonna make somebody a tremendous mother.
Too narrow in the pelvis.
I sure appreciate you dropping by, Al.
Come by again sometime, anytime.
Never let it be said that Sweet Al Monte can't take a hint.
- Who's hinting?
- Hi.
Why, hi there, yourself.
Dave Garver live here?
Well, that depends on your point of view.
Oh, hi.
This stuff weighs a ton.
Where's the kitchen?
Right inside.
Just come on in and help yourself.
- Swing right around the bend there.
- Thank you.
I know, David, she's from Chicken Delight.
Look, don't work too hard, my man.
Don't strain yourself.
How come you don't have any beer?
And what is this?
A shrunken head?
Who was that guy?
Does he live here?
- Hey, look.
I wanted...
- I hope you like steak.
- I thought you look like a steak-and-potatoes type.
- Hang on.
I said to myself, a nice green salad with Roquefort and tomatoes, and baked potato with...
What's going on here?
Don't send me away.
No, I want to ask you a question.
I just wanted to surprise you.
Surprise?
What happens if he and I had been talking business?
Or maybe I have female company or something, and you come traipsing in with an armload of groceries?
That would be some surprise.
I'm sorry.
Why don't you keep that stuff?
I think I've lost my appetite.
Hang on a minute.
I'm just trying to tell you something, that's all.
I don't understand.
Should I go or should I stay?
What do you want?
I'm trying to tell you that there's a telephone, and I pick it up and I dial it.
You answer and I say, "Hey, what are you doing?"
And I say, "I'll be right over."
Fine.
Next time, why don't we do it that way?
Okay.
Any way you like.
Next time.
How do you like your steak?
Extremely rare.
That's just how I like mine.
Extremely rare.
I'll get some wine.
Here.
A little vino.
Vino!
All this and heaven, too!
Wow!
Terrific!
This is gonna be some dinner.
Hey, what happened to that discussion we had last time?
You know, the deal about no strings and all that?
There are no strings, but I never said anything about not coming back for seconds, did I?
That's right.
You didn't.
When will I see you?
I'll give you a call.
(LAUGHS) Dave, you're funny.
How's that?
If you want to keep playing these games, okay, but they're really not necessary anymore, not for me.
Hey!
People trying to sleep here!
People are trying to talk here!
How'd you like to tell it to the law?
How'd you like to go screw yourself?
(HONKING)
Hey!
Take it easy!
Guy's just trying to sleep, that's all.
You're right.
It's a terrific morning.
Why be selfish with it?
Bye-bye.
Hey, wait a minute!
Yeah?
Oh.
Excuse me, I saw the sweater, and I thought you were somebody else.
Oh, you must be David.
Where have you been?
Oh, around.
I was trying to join the revolt against the representational.
Didn't quite make that, though.
So now I'm just trying to play it cool.
Not quite making that, either.
Got time for a break?
- Yeah.
- Let's go.
When did you get in town?
Yesterday.
You weren't gonna call me?
Of course I was.
I had to get settled first.
Well, you shouldn't lend your sweaters to blabbermouths.
You've gotten thinner.
Oh, no!
Well, so much for Sausalito.
- Sausalito?
- That's where I was staying.
- Jay Jay's place.
- Jay Jay's place?
Oh, it's nothing much, really.
It's just a little pied-à-terre, but it's handy to the fleet.
You told me you didn't know where she was.
So I lied.
Picket me.
Thanks a lot.
Listen, stud, it wasn't my idea.
You should have caught her act.
The whole Bette Davis, through-finished-kaput scene.
And at 3:00 a.m.
Come on, Jay Jay.
He's exaggerating.
Well, I'll check with Malcolm.
Maybe I can get you the afternoon off.
What happened, pussycat?
He ran into Anjelica.
She told him I was back.
That bitch should be hung by the thumbs or something equally appropriate.
DAVE:
It's all set up.
Let's go.
Oh, well, it's nothing personal, really.
It's just that I happen to think she could be a first-rate artist if her damned hormones didn't keep getting in the way.
There's not much he can do about that.
He could kill himself.
Jay Jay, why don't you go cruise some sailors, huh?
Oh, please, don't mention seafood.
(LAUGHS)
Come on.
I really missed this place.
I missed you.
You'd do me a big favor if you didn't say things like that.
Why is that?
I don't know.
Somehow it brings out the worst in me.
It makes me want to say things like, "How's that redhead?"
What?
The redhead, the one who worked in the bookstore.
She went back to Berkeley or whatever.
Oh, that's too bad.
You always have that blonde from Santa Barbara to fall back on.
If that's the phrase I'm looking for, and I think it probably is.
What are we gonna do?
Go through a whole list?
Is that it?
Who's got that kind of time?
I just don't know if I'm up to it anymore.
Up to what?
Those nights sitting and waiting for you to finish your program and come by.
Nights when it would start to get late and I'd start to think,
"I wonder if he's run himself off a cliff.
Or maybe he's run into a blonde."
There was a time when I started rooting for the accident, you know.
I mean, if it was a choice between that and a blonde.
You know how secure you make me feel.
Oh, I didn't wish you anything too serious.
Just a couple of months in traction.
You're all heart.
You know, the thing I hate the most in the whole world is a jealous female, and that's what I was getting to be.
TOBIE:
That's why I had to split.
I was starting to be one of my most unfavorite people.
I hated it.
I know you did, too.
That still works, anyway.
Too well, sometimes.
What does that mean?
I mean, there's a little spot in the middle of each day, just about your size.
Well, there's lots of girls my size, if you're really looking.
I'm not.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You mean you've given up girls?
I haven't exactly been the monk of the month or anything like that, but I have been making an effort.
Boy, there must be a real consternation among those gropies.
That's "groupies," isn't it?
I don't know.
Groupies, gropies.
You know, you've got to be fair.
It hasn't just been my fault.
Listen, I know.
They kept overpowering you.
DAVE:
You get a little bit of the blame, too, you know.
You and that parade of roommates that keep moving in and out of your place.
I didn't realize they were such a trial to you.
What trial?
I enjoyed it.
You and I sitting in front of the fireplace, and then some chick sitting there with a bathrobe on, eating Fig Newtons.
(LAUGHS)
DAVE:
What about the one with the St. Bernard?
She was a real winner.
She took up enough space.
And then that other one, the one that took the flute lessons.
Yeah, well maybe it was a little rough on you.
I can think of a thousand reasons why we should try again.
(SIGHS) I've got about seven million things to do.
What do you think?
You want to try for a new start, right from the letter "A"?
What am I gonna do with you?
A lot.
Oh, hi.
Excuse me.
Hi.
You've met Anjelica, my...
Roommate.
Yes.
I think I'll drive into Carmel and see if I can't find some cleaning solvent.
There's plenty under the sink.
Okay.
This house ought to have a revolving door.
You know when my father left me this house, he left me payments.
I can't handle that expense by myself, and most girls find the isolation is too much for them.
It's a long way from town.
I know.
I better get back to work.
Thanks.
That's it, "Thanks"?
Four months in Sausalito is a long time.
I am not gonna get back on that same old merry-go-round again.
What do I have to do, give you a notarized statement?
I need a couple of more days to try and figure out where I'm at.
Okay.
You get your bearings, and then you'll give me a call, all right?
(SIGHING)
(PHONE RINGING)
Hi, Murph.
Oh, hi, Dave.
Sardine Factory.
Dave Garver?
You said this is Evelyn?
No.
Sorry, you've just missed him.
What do you mean?
He's gone.
He's not here.
I think you'd better look again.
Believe me, you just missed him.
Now, if you're interested in someone a little more suave and sophisticated,
- (HANGS UP PHONE)
- I'll be happy to...
That's what I get for being a dirty old man.
There's a message for you, a Madge somebody from San Francisco.
- Brenner?
- Yeah, that's it.
Al Monte gave her this number.
"Received pictures and biography.
"Please send a two-hour tape of your show as soon as possible."
Hey, thanks, Murph.
Don't mention it.
I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be your social secretary.
You will put that on my tab?
Surprise!
What are you doing here?
It was funny.
I was calling you from that phone booth over there, and he was telling me you'd left, and I was staring right at your car.
(GIGGLING) Isn't that funny?
Yeah, kind of funny.
Why didn't you take my call?
Where does it say that I gotta drop what I'm doing and answer the phone every time it rings?
Do you know your nostrils flare out into little wings when you're mad?
It's kind of cute.
Come on, Evelyn.
I gotta go.
I'd love a Coke.
Not tonight.
I gotta get to the station.
No, you don't.
Hey, you're talking to your number one fan.
You don't work tonight.
(SIGHS)
I've got this show that I'm trying to set, and it happens to be a very important show to me.
That means I gotta pick the music, I got to write the lead-ins and I gotta find some poetry.
Now come on, will you?
Poetry?
Let me help you.
I'm terrific with poetry.
- I know all kinds by heart.
- Not tonight!
Does he want his keys?
Come on, Evelyn.
Speak.
Come on!
God!
Good boy!
Let's hear it.
Come on.
Come on.
Give me my keys.
- Come on.
Give me the keys.
- Come on.
(LAUGHING)
Give me the keys, God damn it!
MAN 1:
Having some trouble, lady?
Get lost!
Yeah, get lost, assholes!
MAN 2:
Yeah, let's split.
He's got enough trouble already.
MAN 1:
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Bye.
See you later.
EVELYN:
Hi.
Get all your work done?
What do you want, Evelyn?
One Coke?
I'll tell you, tonight I'm really whipped.
(GIGGLES)
What time is it?
Time for me to go home.
Go back to sleep.
Hey, I've got an idea.
What's that?
Some night this week, after the show, corned beef and potato salad, dill pickles, the whole bit.
My place.
Deal?
I'll call you.
Thursday's good for me.
(DOOR CLOSING)
Oh, shit.
And now from KRML, the big-band sounds of Dee Barton.
Here's a fresh reel of tape for your air check.
You want me to thread it up?
No, leave it here.
Thanks.
All right.
I think I will go out and hit the streets, but before doing that,
I will blow me a little number.
Would you care to partake, my man?
Take it in the other room, will you?
I get zonked just breathing the air around here.
All right, be that way.
Al?
Yeah?
Do you ever find yourself being completely smothered by somebody?
Anybody I know?
Yeah, you met her at my house the other day.
Ooh!
Chicken Delight!
Well, that's what I call a pretty good smothering, cousin.
You start a relationship thinking you're gonna be completely honest, and all of a sudden the whole thing gets out of hand.
Yeah, well, what's the problem?
The problem is I've been trying to un-complicate my life, and now I can't even answer the doorbell.
Besides, Tobie's back.
Oh, really?
Tobie?
When?
Iran into her Sunday.
That was a goody.
Hey, I'll tell you the truth, David.
I've always thought that Tobie was one of the foxiest chicks on the peninsula.
And why you gotta have so much action, I just don't understand it, anyway.
You know what I mean?
It's just a hang-up I have, or had.
But now that I seem to have that all straightened away,
I can't seem to solve this other problem.
Well, you know what they always say, my man.
No.
What?
"He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword."
Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
Later.
DAVE:
We'll have more smooth sounds in just one minute.
But first, at 10 minutes to the hour, we're broadcasting from KRML in the Carmel Rancho Shopping Center, home of the Buccaneer, the man's boutique.
KRML, Dave Garver speaking.
The whole point in having an answering service is to call them once in a while and see if you've got any messages.
Hi, Evelyn.
What's happening?
What could be happening, darling?
You're not here yet.
"Yet"?
I hope you like pastrami, because they didn't have any corned beef.
Now, wait a minute.
Just hold on.
Are you trying to tell me you forgot that we have a date tonight?
I thought I was supposed to call you on that.
It's just that I feel kind of silly sitting here in my brand-new lounging pajamas.
I just assumed...
Apparently, I assumed wrong.
That's right.
You assumed wrong.
You don't have to come over, Dave, if you've got something better to do.
No, that's all right, I'll be over in a little while.
You and I are gonna have to have a talk.
Whatever you say.
In the meantime, haven't you forgotten something else?
What's that?
Weren't you gonna play Misty for me?
Yeah.
I have that one right here.
Thank you, darling.
And now we have a pretty one for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night.
It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty.
And this one is especially for Evelyn.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
EVELYN:
Just a second.
Come in.
Hi.
Hi.
- Cold night, huh?
- Yeah.
But you got here anyway.
Stout fella.
Look, Evelyn, there's something we're gonna have to get straight.
It's amazing what a man will go through for a hot pastrami sandwich.
Now look...
Wait a minute.
You haven't told me how nice I look.
You look fine.
The lady at the store guaranteed you'd flip.
Now, listen.
Can we talk?
Wait.
First...
Surprise.
Don't you like them?
Yeah, they're great, but...
Don't spoil my fun, darling.
I love to give you things.
It's Madame Butterfly time.
First, friendly neighborhood geisha remove honorable shoes.
Stop it, Evelyn!
Now, we've gotta talk!
Have I done something wrong?
I'm just trying to be straight with you, that's all.
Be nice to me instead.
Jesus Christ!
I don't understand.
Are you trying to say you don't love me anymore?
I never told you that I loved you.
Not in words, maybe, but, Dave, there are lots of ways of saying things that have nothing to do with words.
I'm sorry you read it that way.
It's that other bitch, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
The picture in the silver frame in your dresser.
Look, that picture has got nothing to do with you.
What does have to do with me?
I never lied to you.
Big deal.
He never lied to me.
What do you want for that?
The Congressional Medal of Honor?
So long.
What am I supposed to do?
Sit here all dressed up in my little whore suit, waiting for my lord and master to call?
Nobody asked you to wait for anything.
You're not dumping me, buster blue eyes.
Get off my back, Evelyn!
Get off your back?
That's where you've been keeping me, isn't it?
You're nothing!
You're not even good in bed!
I just felt sorry for you, that's all!
Bastard!
You poor, pathetic bastard!
(DOOR SLAMMING)
(PHONE RINGING)
- Hello?
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean those things I said.
Will I see you tomorrow?
You don't listen, do you?
Oh, let me come over.
If I could just see you, just talk to you.
No, Evelyn.
But I love you, David.
I love you.
(PHONE RINGING)
EVELYN:
David, if I could just...
TOBIE:
What's the matter?
DAVE:
Nothing.
Why?
No, come on.
You haven't heard one word I've been saying to you.
Yes, I have.
I've heard everything you said.
You did, huh?
All right, tell me.
You don't believe me, huh?
Go ahead.
Okay, wise chick.
We're supposed to go to a party at Big Sur tomorrow night, and I'm supposed to meet you there at 9:00.
And the address is... (LAUGHS)
I didn't tell you that.
See how you are?
I don't know myself yet.
I'll call you tomorrow about it, okay?
Okay.
You call me tomorrow.
Honey, we better go.
We're just getting to the best part.
Yeah, but I've got to pick Anjelica up at 6:00.
God!
How the pain is setting in.
Come on.
She's a very nice girl.
Anyway, she's moving out tonight.
Now, that's about the best news that I've heard in years.
And Madalyn's moving in.
Madalyn?
(GROANS)
(BANGING ON DOOR)
Shit.
(BANGING CONTINUES)
What's going on?
Don't tell me it was asleep!
What else at this hour of the morning?
Oh, I'm surprised his conscience was that clear!
What do you want, Evelyn?
"What do you want, Evelyn?" What do you want?
Do I have to want something?
Can't I just come over?
Or is it inconvenient?
- Now, wait just a...
- Could it be I make a boo-boo?
Could it be that someone has been sleeping in Papa Bear's bed?
Wait a minute, God damn it!
Come out, come out, wherever you are!
I thought...
Oh, God, don't look at me that way, Dave.
I just don't know what to say to you.
I'm sorry I mistrusted you.
I should have known you'd never do anything spoil it.
To spoil what?
What we have between us.
We don't have a goddamn thing between us.
Now, how many ways am I gonna have to say this to you?
I don't care how many ways you say it.
It's not true!
What do I have to do to convince you?
(WAILING) It's not true!
It's not!
What are you doing?
I'm gonna get dressed and drive you home, that's what.
Why are you playing these games?
Why are you pretending you don't love me?
I don't even believe I'm hearing this.
But I love you!
You haven't got the vaguest idea what love is.
We don't even know each other.
Wait a minute.
You don't have to do that.
I'm okay.
I can drive home.
Are you sure?
Positive.
I'm fine.
Let me just wash my face, huh?
(WATER RUNNING)
(WATER STOPS)
You ready?
(KNOCKING)
You okay?
Evelyn?
Evelyn?
(CLATTERING)
Oh, no.
DAVE:
How's she gonna be?
Well, I sutured the wounds.
It wasn't quite as bad as it looked.
It couldn't have been.
You know, Dave, I'm supposed to turn a report in on this.
But you won't.
You see, Tobie's back.
I'd rather be the one to tell her, and not have her read it in the paper somewhere.
I didn't know that.
I'll tell Marie.
We'll do the spaghetti number.
Somebody gonna be around here today?
Me.
I'll be here.
I bombed her out pretty good.
Better let her sleep it off before you take her home.
And how long will that be?
It's hard to say.
Why?
I'd like to take Tobie out tonight.
No problem.
She'll wake up sometime this afternoon, 5:00 or so.
Is she gonna be all right?
Well, the cuts were really pretty superficial.
I mean, do you think she'll try it again?
Chances are against it.
But I'd watch her.
I wouldn't leave her alone if she seems unusually depressed or insecure.
Better get some sleep yourself.
You look like hell.
FRANK:
Call me if you need me.
DAVE:
Hey, thanks, Frank.
I really appreciate it.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
Fine.
Here.
Thank you.
Brought you a little soup.
It looks good.
I don't know what to say.
It frightens me thinking about it.
Well, don't think about it.
Oh, I don't mean me.
I mean you.
"Girl commits suicide in disc jockey's home."
It's not very good publicity for a man in your position.
Get some rest.
As soon as you feel better, I'll take you home.
Thank you, David.
(PHONE RINGING)
I got your clothes hung up in the closet there.
Maybe you better answer the phone.
Yeah.
I'll get it in the other room.
Hello.
Hi.
Hey I just wanted to check.
We still on for tonight?
Yeah, I'm all dressed and ready to go.
What time is the party?
Well, Madalyn's already left, and she won't be back for a long time, and I was just thinking...
Would you be terribly disappointed if we didn't go to the party and just stayed here instead?
Well, I think I can bear up under it.
Don't be too long.
That's me at the door.
David, the way I look at it, the hell with Sausalito.
Bye-bye.
(EVELYN BREATHING HEAVILY)
(PANTING)
No.
Evelyn?
(SCREAMING)
What's the matter?
Take it easy.
I had a dream.
I was drowning in the ocean and I called to you, but you just stood there watching.
Watching.
It was just a dream.
Oh, God, I'm so alone.
Hold me.
Hold me, Dave.
Please.
Please.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Tighter.
Tighter.
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.
David!
I woke up and you were gone.
(HANGS UP PHONE)
If you have something planned for tonight, you could just take me home.
Maybe that'd be best.
No, no, there's nothing.
Good.
Isn't this nice?
Just us here, together.
Here we go again.
Stone-cold dead in the market.
Must have been quite a party.
Go away, Birdie.
Any other bodies, any other juiceheads around here?
Come back tomorrow, will you?
Or next year sometime.
I better check the workbench.
All right, break it up in here.
Looks like old times around this place.
Evelyn?
Evelyn?
Lose something, tiger?
Look, Birdie, you couldn't find it within your heart to come back at a later time, could you?
This is a later time, pussycat.
I'm paying you back for the day I blew last week.
Evelyn?
Evelyn?
Very funny, Birdie.
Very funny.
What I can't figure out is, with all this kind of action going on in here, what are you doing out there couching it?
What is this, some kind of Kinsey Report?
Do I come over to your house and ask a lot of dumb questions?
Well, you just ought to, pussycat.
Might open up a whole new way of life to you.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hold it.
Let's try to show a little class, shall we?
Mr. Garver's residence.
Oh, I'll see.
Do you want to talk to a Madge Brenner?
Yeah.
I want to talk to her.
Thanks.
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Garver?
Madge Brenner.
We like the tape on your show.
Like it very much.
There are one or two others still in the running, but frankly...
Why can't we have lunch today?
Windjammer still good?
Yeah, still very good.
Reserve a table in your name.
See you then, Mr. Garver.
Great.
Bye-bye.
Looks like we found Evelyn.
"Good morning, darling.
Gone shopping.
"Back in a flash with the hash."
Ooh!
A little humor in there.
"Love and kisses, Evelyn."
And then it says,
"if you can't find your keys, don't worry.
"I borrowed your car."
Here's your key, and here's your copy.
That'll be 40 cents, please.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
David?
I stopped by my...
Hi.
Don't you look all gussied up?
Well, good.
I was gonna cook brunch, but this calls for something more festive.
How about the Marquis?
My treat.
After all I put you through, it's the least...
No, no.
I have a lunch date.
Business.
Business?
Yeah.
Can I have my car keys?
Sure.
I think you ought to take it easy, anyway.
Get some rest.
Yeah, I do feel a little tired.
(DOOR CLOSING)
(MADGE LAUGHING)
Very funny, Dave.
Now, let's talk show.
Tell me, what do you think of the concept?
The unstructured, the loosey-goosey, Monterey pop, Woodstock kind of thing?
I like it.
I like it very much, and I think I can handle it.
So do I.
I'll keep this to promote your new career with.
You'll be working with kids, bright and marvelous.
But they take handling.
You know, if this show goes the way I think it's going to, there's no reason in the world why...
Well, isn't this cozy?
So this is your business lunch?
How's business?
- Friend of yours?
- Just another trick, honey.
That's enough.
Is that your idea of a dish?
My God, she's a little old for you, isn't she?
What is this, "Be Kind to Senior Citizens Week"?
Get out of here!
It's not that I mind you being a bastard, but do you have to be such a tasteless bastard?
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
She couldn't get laid in a lumber camp!
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
You're hurting me!
Stop it, you dirty bastard!
Oh, no!
Stop it!
Dave!
Oh, no!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Don't leave me!
Don't leave me!
She's nothing!
Nothing!
Nothing!
I love you!
Get her out of here, man.
DRIVER:
Where to?
I did it because I love you.
Don't you understand that?
I love you!
- Where to, mister?
- Move!
It's because I love you!
Dave, please.
This is a private beach.
I want to talk to you.
I don't want to talk to you.
Are you drunk?
No, but that's not a bad idea.
Why, David?
Why what?
Drunk?
No.
Why last night?
That's what I came to explain to you.
Okay, good.
But I think we should understand each other.
I'm not very happy with you.
Well, that's fair enough, Tobie.
Whatever it was, you could have called me.
No, I couldn't.
Why not?
I couldn't tell you the truth last night.
I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.
Now, why do you have to say that?
I just didn't want to take a chance she'd try it again.
What if she does?
Well, I swear to you, if she ever tries it,
I'd just let her go right on ahead.
Oh, God!
Oh, my God.
What in the...
(EVELYN PANTING)
(GRUNTING)
(PANTING)
(FABRIC TEARING)
(SCREAMING)
(SCREAMING)
Oh, God, help me!
Please, somebody, help me!
Help me, somebody!
Oh, God, help me!
Stay back, buddy.
I live here, man.
Is she your housecleaning lady, Garver?
Okay, boys, let's take her out.
Watch your step.
Birdie.
It's gonna cost you double to clean up this mess.
MAN:
Watch your step.
Dave Garver?
Yeah.
I'm Sergeant McCallum.
Any ideas?
About what?
About your girlfriend in there.
Hey, that's not my girlfriend.
Let me get that straight right in front.
(GATE CLOSING)
(AMBULANCE DEPARTS)
More or less a casual acquaintance, you'd say?
That's right.
She just dropped by to hack up your wardrobe and your cleaning lady?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
I'm not trying to tell you anything, Sergeant.
Well then, maybe you ought to.
The lady almost got herself killed.
And I'm stumbling around in my stupid way trying to find out why.
What'll you have?
This Evelyn Draper, where does she come from?
- I don't know.
- What about her family?
I don't know that either.
She just listens to my radio show, and we met one night.
That's all.
Practically a stranger.
That's right.
Then how does she happen to have a key to your front door?
I don't know that either.
It boils down to, you don't know a hell of a lot, do you?
What it boils down to is I'm getting sick of your questions.
And so am I!
But they get upset with me down at the store if I don't ask them.
Just take her through.
I'll be right along.
Right.
Take her through what?
Booking.
What she really needs is psychiatric help.
Really?
Now, look, those cuts on her wrists...
Don't know anything about those.
There's one other thing.
I know. "Don't leave town."
I was gonna say, "Why don't you play some Mantovani sometime?"
Didn't know you liked the show, Sergeant.
I don't.
I like Mantovani.
(PLAYING UPBEAT JAZZ)
MAN:
Go ahead, play!
MAN:
Whoo!
ANNOUNCER:
Those of you who may have played brass instruments in high school, you know that was triple-tonguing, baby.
Let's give his tongue a nice hand!
(CROWD CHEERING)
He might just be the fastest tongue in the West!
Come on.
All right, I'm coming.
(PLAYING UPBEAT JAZZ)
What do you say...
How about something to eat?
I've got to pick up my roommate, Annabel.
Madalyn's your roommate.
I found my man, and I'm moving out.
And Annabel's moving in.
Right.
Ciao.
Later.
(CROWD APPLAUDING)
MAN:
Thank you.
Thank you very kindly.
(PLAYING SMOOTH JAZZ)
That was the Cannonball Adderley Group.
And they're making it happen out at the Monterey Jazz Festival, along with Duke Ellington, Woody Herman, Joe Williams and many others.
Still got tickets for Sunday night.
So get on out there because that's where it's happening.
Now we're gonna hear from the Gator Creek Organization and Feelin' Fine.
KRML.
Dave Garver.
Hello?
EVELYN:
Play Misty for me.
David?
I didn't mean to shake you up.
I'm sorry.
Pretty stupid of me.
I've been released.
Therapy.
It was a bad dream, but it's over.
Where are you?
The airport.
San Francisco.
I've only got a minute or two between planes.
Got a job in Hawaii.
You're all right, then?
Fine, David.
Fine.
I just want to say how sorry I am about everything.
Forget it.
I have.
I hope so.
"Because this maiden she lived with no other thought"
"Than to love and be loved by you"
Are you near a radio?
No.
But play it for me anyway.
(SCREAMING)
(PHONE RINGING)
- Hello.
- McCALLUM:
Garver?
- Yeah.
- Sergeant McCallum.
Sorry to wake you, but something's come up.
Yeah, I know.
She just paid me a visit with a butcher knife.
Why?
Because she was released on parole pending further legal action.
When?
A week ago.
Well, I sure like the way you broke your ass to let me know about it.
I just found out about it myself.
Who's in charge down there, anyway?
Now, look.
Do you want to help find her or would you rather just sit there and bellyache?
All right.
Good.
Now, exactly what did she say to you?
I told you.
She said that she was well and that she was going to Hawaii.
What else?
I already told you.
Tell me again.
You know, Sergeant, you really make lousy conversation.
You make lousy coffee.
Come on, what else did she say?
Nothing, except...
Except what?
It was nothing.
It was a line from a poem.
What poem?
If I knew that, I'd know the line.
Wouldn't I?
Try to remember.
You know, McCallum, it's getting late.
You're sounding very monotonous.
Well, now, you're not exactly my idea of a swinging date either.
Good night, McCallum.
Hey, what happened to the Mantovani?
The what?
Well, I heard the show, but I never did hear you play Mantovani.
You really did listen to the show.
Friend, if we had a TV down at the station,
I'd break my arm before I turned your show on.
Thanks a lot.
Just hope we're lucky enough to grab her the next time she tries it.
Tries what?
To kill you.
Yeah.
And if you're not lucky enough...
That'd be hell.
The guys down at the station would have to chip in and buy a TV.
You're a great comfort, Sergeant.
You will change the locks?
Hi.
Nothing like a nice brisk walk in the woods to put roses on a girl's cheeks.
How are you?
Not so good, honey.
She's back.
Who?
Evelyn Draper, the girl who tried to kill Birdie.
How can...
How can she be back?
I thought they'd put her in a state sanitarium.
They did, but they let her out.
Does that mean she's all right?
Theoretically.
(SIGHS)
What happens now?
I think you and I ought to stay away from each other for a couple of days, just in case she's tagging after me.
She's already following you, isn't she?
I don't want you to worry about it.
I can handle myself.
Yeah.
So could Birdie.
All right then, you stand by.
Well, they're all set to trace the call.
Now, when she phones you, just mention her by name right away, Evelyn, and they start to trace her.
All you gotta do after that is just keep her talking.
Fifteen minutes before the hour here at KRML and here's It's Not Unusual.
I guess it hasn't come to you yet, huh?
What?
What she said.
Over the phone last night?
Part of a poem or something.
You told me were gonna try to remember.
I thought I had that, but I've forgotten.
Is it that important?
Until we pick her up, everything's important.
(SIGHS)
What's wrong?
I'm worried about my girlfriend with all this going on.
They're so damn isolated down there.
I'm thinking the best thing to do is just call Al Monte and have him sub for me.
Now, look.
The only chance we've got is when she phones in here tonight.
You've got to be here, right on that mike.
If she phones.
She will.
Believe me.
But only if you're here.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
If it'll make you feel any better,
I'll go over and check your girlfriend's house myself, okay?
I'd sure appreciate that.
She lives on the Highlands on Spindrift Road.
I think it's the fourth or fifth house down.
"Williams" is on the mailbox.
Why don't you phone her?
Okay.
Tell her to be expecting me.
McCallum.
Thanks, huh?
Public servant.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Hi.
I'm just checking in.
You all right?
Marvelous.
I'm just getting ready to do my nails and I got your program on.
And Annabel's in the kitchen making a couple of coffee grogs.
What more could a girl ask for?
No, honey, really everything's fine.
There's a Sergeant McCallum that's gonna drop by for a second, just to see if you've buttoned up all right.
Let him in, but nobody else.
Okay?
Okay.
Hey, David, you want to play something soft and dreamy for us?
You got it.
Bye-bye.
Bye, hon.
Hey, Annabel, how's that stuff coming?
DAVE ON RADIO:
Now here's something soft and sentimental for Tobie and Annabel.
Hope you like cinnamon in yours.
Whatever's right.
Annabel.
Good, huh?
Mmm.
Too much.
So is this.
Thank you.
Just one thing.
Do you mind?
No, be my guest.
The eyes are wrong.
David's are more...
How shall I say?
Colder.
I didn't know you knew David.
- Hmm?
- I didn't realize you and David were...
Were friends.
Friends?
(LAUGHS) Oh.
No, not friends.
Not friends.
God, you're dumb.
EVELYN: "Because this maiden she lived with no other thought
"Than to love and be loved by you"
(DIALING)
Tobie?
EVELYN:
We're waiting for you, David.
(ON TAPE) This is Dave Garver with a little verse, a little talk and five hours of music to be very, very nice to each other by.
(GRUNTING)
Careful.
Careful.
I might put your eye out.
I'll bet David loves your eyes.
And your hair.
Does he run his fingers through your hair?
Have to get you all nice for David.
For David.
I hope he likes what he sees when he walks in here, because that's what he's taking to hell with him.

DAVE ON RADIO:
And now here's a pretty one for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night.
It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty.
And this one is especially for Evelyn.
Hey, hey, hey!
You're digging the master jock for solid rock.
Sweet Al Monte blasting, babies.
Being bold and pouring coal on station KRML in quaint little Carmel-by-the-Sea.
And we're right next door to magnificent Monterey, home of the annual jazz festival.
And don't forget, even though it's four months away, you got to get your tickets, Jim, because they're going fast and they can't last.
All right, now.
The time is 7:54 and there's a breeze of 50 degrees around your ever-loving hips, and the weatherman says we have a taste of fog.
I say we got a bowl of soul, and if you think your heart can take it, whoo!
Come fly higher with The Heavy!
Now we're gonna wrap it up for the week, folks.
A brand new release from the funk capital of the world, Squeeze Me.
Uh-oh.
Here he comes, the big "D" himself, Dave Garver.
Dave, people, is gonna bring you five hours of mellow groove.
So, in the meantime, this is Sweet Al Monte saying hang in there, babies, because everything is going to be everything.
Bye.
Hey, what's that letter you got there?
Is that that Frisco gig?
Yeah.
All right, so what's happening?
They want the usual thing.
A biography, pictures.
Oh, really?
Is that that Madge Brenner chick?
Yeah, she's the one putting it together.
Well, in that case, David, you're in.
How do you figure that?
Now, David, come on, man.
Are you kidding?
Hey, she's a grandmother.
Well, so when did that ever stop you?
Hey, man.
You better get a move on.
I already played your theme.
Yeah, I heard it.
You're a real human being.
And you're on the air, baby.
All right.
"Men have destroyed the roads of wonder
"And their cities squat like black toads
"In the orchards of life nothing is clean or real
"Or as a girl, naked to love or be a man with"
This is Dave Garver with a little verse, a little talk and five hours of music to be very, very nice to each other by.
KRML, Dave Garver speaking.
Hello?
Hi, what'll it be?
Play Misty for me.
Misty, huh?
We have that right on the play rack.
Thanks for calling.
I see you got your little Misty chick calling you again.
All righty.
- Swing low.
- You take it easy now, huh?
See you in the a.m.
KRML, Dave Garver.
Hi, Murphy.
Oh.
Hi, Dave.
No messages for you.
No?
Heard your show tonight.
Yeah?
Well, it sure beats hell out of working for a living.
Thanks for the plug.
What are friends for?
Bartender.
Coke?
Coming right up.
Uh-uh.
She's waiting for someone.
You sure?
That's what she says.
Guys have been striking out all night.
One game?
Cry Bastion?
What else?
Okay, coach.
You asked for it.
Don't take all night.
Move.
Okay.
Move.
Palfrey's Gambit.
Dirty rat.
Are we playing Copenhagen rules?
Make it easy on yourself, Murph.
Cry Bastion.
Sorry, no Bastion.
Damn, I didn't see that.
It's too bad, Murphy.
Too bad.
Careful now.
That ought to do it.
Be really careful now.
Careful.
Hi.
He doesn't see it.
Oh, yeah?
Cry Bastion.
Fool's ploy, my man.
Fool's ploy.
Care to play the winner?
I'll just watch.
My name is Dave Garver.
Evelyn Draper.
Sit down, Evelyn Draper?
- Care for a drink?
- Okay.
- What'll it be?
- Surprise me.
Screwdriver.
Nice game.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
What happened?
I won.
How?
When?
When you said, "Okay."
I ought to be mad.
But you're not.
Not really.
Well, it certainly was nice of you to bring me home, Mr...
Garver?
That's right.
I don't think I've been stood up on a date since the ninth grade back in Albany.
Is something wrong?
No.
I keep getting the feeling I know you from someplace.
You do?
Here.
Why don't you let me do that?
Oh, no, no.
That's all right.
I've got it.
Why don't you see if you can get the fire started?
There are some matches right next to it.
All right.
It's getting late.
You're sure I'm not keeping you up?
No.
I rarely get to bed before 3:00 a.m.
I didn't have a date tonight.
I went there because you talk about it on your program sometimes.
And I wanted to meet you.
I listen to you all the time.
I knew somebody was out there.
You're making fun of me.
No, I'm not.
Say something else, huh?
Such as?
"Play Misty for me"?
Very good.
You sure I'm not keeping you up?
Don't you like me?
You're a very nice girl.
But who needs nice girls?
No, I like them.
I'm kind of hung up on one.
And you don't want to complicate your life.
That's exactly right.
Well, neither do I.
But that's no reason we shouldn't sleep together tonight, if we feel like it.
Solid silicone.
Hi, ho, David, my man!
How you been, baby?
See you got the joint cleaned up for once.
The Heavy digs it.
Care for a beer?
No, not really.
I could go for something more uplifting, but not a brew, David.
Not a brew, my man.
Beer is all we've got.
Hey, Al, you're gonna have to ease on out.
I got a heck of a lot of work to do today.
Yeah, but you don't understand, man.
I've been sent over here to get you.
By whom?
That old chick I go with.
What's her name?
- Carol?
- Yeah, that's the one.
Girl thinks you've been working too hard, man.
She said we should get together and go out tonight.
Blast the town open a little taste.
Who's this "we"?
Me, you, her and one of them hens that you can dig up.
Man, there is a fantastic new Mexican place in Carmel called Susinos.
And the albondigas soup is not to be believed.
It is a mind-bender...
I know the joint, but I don't have a date, and I got a lot to do, really.
Big deal, man.
Get one!
Look.
If you have any problems getting one, I'll get one for you, as nice as I look.
It's too late, and besides, I've got a lot of work to do.
Hey, man, but you gotta eat, David.
Yes, well, I'm gonna whip up something right here in my own kitchen.
You know, David, I'm really worried about your social life.
You know something, you're gonna make somebody a tremendous mother.
Too narrow in the pelvis.
I sure appreciate you dropping by, Al.
Come by again sometime, anytime.
Never let it be said that Sweet Al Monte can't take a hint.
- Who's hinting?
- Hi.
Why, hi there, yourself.
Dave Garver live here?
Well, that depends on your point of view.
Oh, hi.
This stuff weighs a ton.
Where's the kitchen?
Right inside.
Just come on in and help yourself.
- Swing right around the bend there.
- Thank you.
I know, David, she's from Chicken Delight.
Look, don't work too hard, my man.
Don't strain yourself.
How come you don't have any beer?
And what is this?
A shrunken head?
Who was that guy?
Does he live here?
- Hey, look.
I wanted...
- I hope you like steak.
- I thought you look like a steak-and-potatoes type.
- Hang on.
I said to myself, a nice green salad with Roquefort and tomatoes, and baked potato with...
What's going on here?
Don't send me away.
No, I want to ask you a question.
I just wanted to surprise you.
Surprise?
What happens if he and I had been talking business?
Or maybe I have female company or something, and you come traipsing in with an armload of groceries?
That would be some surprise.
I'm sorry.
Why don't you keep that stuff?
I think I've lost my appetite.
Hang on a minute.
I'm just trying to tell you something, that's all.
I don't understand.
Should I go or should I stay?
What do you want?
I'm trying to tell you that there's a telephone, and I pick it up and I dial it.
You answer and I say, "Hey, what are you doing?"
And I say, "I'll be right over."
Fine.
Next time, why don't we do it that way?
Okay.
Any way you like.
Next time.
How do you like your steak?
Extremely rare.
That's just how I like mine.
Extremely rare.
I'll get some wine.
Here.
A little vino.
Vino!
All this and heaven, too!
Wow!
Terrific!
This is gonna be some dinner.
Hey, what happened to that discussion we had last time?
You know, the deal about no strings and all that?
There are no strings, but I never said anything about not coming back for seconds, did I?
That's right.
You didn't.
When will I see you?
I'll give you a call.
Dave, you're funny.
How's that?
If you want to keep playing these games, okay, but they're really not necessary anymore, not for me.
Hey!
People trying to sleep here!
People are trying to talk here!
How'd you like to tell it to the law?
How'd you like to go screw yourself?
Hey!
Take it easy!
Guy's just trying to sleep, that's all.
You're right.
It's a terrific morning.
Why be selfish with it?
Bye-bye.
Hey, wait a minute!
Yeah?
Oh.
Excuse me, I saw the sweater, and I thought you were somebody else.
Oh, you must be David.
Where have you been?
Oh, around.
I was trying to join the revolt against the representational.
Didn't quite make that, though.
So now I'm just trying to play it cool.
Not quite making that, either.
Got time for a break?
- Yeah.
- Let's go.
When did you get in town?
Yesterday.
You weren't gonna call me?
Of course I was.
I had to get settled first.
Well, you shouldn't lend your sweaters to blabbermouths.
You've gotten thinner.
Oh, no!
Well, so much for Sausalito.
- Sausalito?
- That's where I was staying.
- Jay Jay's place.
- Jay Jay's place?
Oh, it's nothing much, really.
It's just a little pied-à-terre, but it's handy to the fleet.
You told me you didn't know where she was.
So I lied.
Picket me.
Thanks a lot.
Listen, stud, it wasn't my idea.
You should have caught her act.
The whole Bette Davis, through-finished-kaput scene.
And at 3:00 a.m.
Come on, Jay Jay.
He's exaggerating.
Well, I'll check with Malcolm.
Maybe I can get you the afternoon off.
What happened, pussycat?
He ran into Anjelica.
She told him I was back.
That bitch should be hung by the thumbs or something equally appropriate.
It's all set up.
Let's go.
Oh, well, it's nothing personal, really.
It's just that I happen to think she could be a first-rate artist if her damned hormones didn't keep getting in the way.
There's not much he can do about that.
He could kill himself.
Jay Jay, why don't you go cruise some sailors, huh?
Oh, please, don't mention seafood.
Come on.
I really missed this place.
I missed you.
You'd do me a big favor if you didn't say things like that.
Why is that?
I don't know.
Somehow it brings out the worst in me.
It makes me want to say things like, "How's that redhead?"
What?
The redhead, the one who worked in the bookstore.
She went back to Berkeley or whatever.
Oh, that's too bad.
You always have that blonde from Santa Barbara to fall back on.
If that's the phrase I'm looking for, and I think it probably is.
What are we gonna do?
Go through a whole list?
Is that it?
Who's got that kind of time?
I just don't know if I'm up to it anymore.
Up to what?
Those nights sitting and waiting for you to finish your program and come by.
Nights when it would start to get late and I'd start to think,
"I wonder if he's run himself off a cliff.
Or maybe he's run into a blonde."
There was a time when I started rooting for the accident, you know.
I mean, if it was a choice between that and a blonde.
You know how secure you make me feel.
Oh, I didn't wish you anything too serious.
Just a couple of months in traction.
You're all heart.
You know, the thing I hate the most in the whole world is a jealous female, and that's what I was getting to be.
That's why I had to split.
I was starting to be one of my most unfavorite people.
I hated it.
I know you did, too.
That still works, anyway.
Too well, sometimes.
What does that mean?
I mean, there's a little spot in the middle of each day, just about your size.
Well, there's lots of girls my size, if you're really looking.
I'm not.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You mean you've given up girls?
I haven't exactly been the monk of the month or anything like that, but I have been making an effort.
Boy, there must be a real consternation among those gropies.
That's "groupies," isn't it?
I don't know.
Groupies, gropies.
You know, you've got to be fair.
It hasn't just been my fault.
Listen, I know.
They kept overpowering you.
You get a little bit of the blame, too, you know.
You and that parade of roommates that keep moving in and out of your place.
I didn't realize they were such a trial to you.
What trial?
I enjoyed it.
You and I sitting in front of the fireplace, and then some chick sitting there with a bathrobe on, eating Fig Newtons.
What about the one with the St. Bernard?
She was a real winner.
She took up enough space.
And then that other one, the one that took the flute lessons.
Yeah, well maybe it was a little rough on you.
I can think of a thousand reasons why we should try again.
I've got about seven million things to do.
What do you think?
You want to try for a new start, right from the letter "A"?
What am I gonna do with you?
A lot.
Oh, hi.
Excuse me.
Hi.
You've met Anjelica, my...
Roommate.
Yes.
I think I'll drive into Carmel and see if I can't find some cleaning solvent.
There's plenty under the sink.
Okay.
This house ought to have a revolving door.
You know when my father left me this house, he left me payments.
I can't handle that expense by myself, and most girls find the isolation is too much for them.
It's a long way from town.
I know.
I better get back to work.
Thanks.
That's it, "Thanks"?
Four months in Sausalito is a long time.
I am not gonna get back on that same old merry-go-round again.
What do I have to do, give you a notarized statement?
I need a couple of more days to try and figure out where I'm at.
Okay.
You get your bearings, and then you'll give me a call, all right?
Hi, Murph.
Oh, hi, Dave.
Sardine Factory.
Dave Garver?
You said this is Evelyn?
No.
Sorry, you've just missed him.
What do you mean?
He's gone.
He's not here.
I think you'd better look again.
Believe me, you just missed him.
Now, if you're interested in someone a little more suave and sophisticated,
I'll be happy to...
That's what I get for being a dirty old man.
There's a message for you, a Madge somebody from San Francisco.
- Brenner?
- Yeah, that's it.
Al Monte gave her this number.
"Received pictures and biography.
"Please send a two-hour tape of your show as soon as possible."
Hey, thanks, Murph.
Don't mention it.
I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be your social secretary.
You will put that on my tab?
Surprise!
What are you doing here?
It was funny.
I was calling you from that phone booth over there, and he was telling me you'd left, and I was staring right at your car.
Isn't that funny?
Yeah, kind of funny.
Why didn't you take my call?
Where does it say that I gotta drop what I'm doing and answer the phone every time it rings?
Do you know your nostrils flare out into little wings when you're mad?
It's kind of cute.
Come on, Evelyn.
I gotta go.
I'd love a Coke.
Not tonight.
I gotta get to the station.
No, you don't.
Hey, you're talking to your number one fan.
You don't work tonight.
I've got this show that I'm trying to set, and it happens to be a very important show to me.
That means I gotta pick the music, I got to write the lead-ins and I gotta find some poetry.
Now come on, will you?
Poetry?
Let me help you.
I'm terrific with poetry.
- I know all kinds by heart.
- Not tonight!
Does he want his keys?
Come on, Evelyn.
Speak.
Come on!
God!
Good boy!
Let's hear it.
Come on.
Come on.
Give me my keys.
- Come on.
Give me the keys.
- Come on.
Give me the keys, God damn it!
Having some trouble, lady?
Get lost!
Yeah, get lost, assholes!
Yeah, let's split.
He's got enough trouble already.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Bye.
See you later.
Hi.
Get all your work done?
What do you want, Evelyn?
One Coke?
I'll tell you, tonight I'm really whipped.
What time is it?
Time for me to go home.
Go back to sleep.
Hey, I've got an idea.
What's that?
Some night this week, after the show, corned beef and potato salad, dill pickles, the whole bit.
My place.
Deal?
I'll call you.
Thursday's good for me.
Oh, shit.
And now from KRML, the big-band sounds of Dee Barton.
Here's a fresh reel of tape for your air check.
You want me to thread it up?
No, leave it here.
Thanks.
All right.
I think I will go out and hit the streets, but before doing that,
I will blow me a little number.
Would you care to partake, my man?
Take it in the other room, will you?
I get zonked just breathing the air around here.
All right, be that way.
Al?
Yeah?
Do you ever find yourself being completely smothered by somebody?
Anybody I know?
Yeah, you met her at my house the other day.
Ooh!
Chicken Delight!
Well, that's what I call a pretty good smothering, cousin.
You start a relationship thinking you're gonna be completely honest, and all of a sudden the whole thing gets out of hand.
Yeah, well, what's the problem?
The problem is I've been trying to un-complicate my life, and now I can't even answer the doorbell.
Besides, Tobie's back.
Oh, really?
Tobie?
When?
Iran into her Sunday.
That was a goody.
Hey, I'll tell you the truth, David.
I've always thought that Tobie was one of the foxiest chicks on the peninsula.
And why you gotta have so much action, I just don't understand it, anyway.
You know what I mean?
It's just a hang-up I have, or had.
But now that I seem to have that all straightened away,
I can't seem to solve this other problem.
Well, you know what they always say, my man.
No.
What?
"He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword."
Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
Later.
We'll have more smooth sounds in just one minute.
But first, at 10 minutes to the hour, we're broadcasting from KRML in the Carmel Rancho Shopping Center, home of the Buccaneer, the man's boutique.
KRML, Dave Garver speaking.
The whole point in having an answering service is to call them once in a while and see if you've got any messages.
Hi, Evelyn.
What's happening?
What could be happening, darling?
You're not here yet.
"Yet"?
I hope you like pastrami, because they didn't have any corned beef.
Now, wait a minute.
Just hold on.
Are you trying to tell me you forgot that we have a date tonight?
I thought I was supposed to call you on that.
It's just that I feel kind of silly sitting here in my brand-new lounging pajamas.
I just assumed...
Apparently, I assumed wrong.
That's right.
You assumed wrong.
You don't have to come over, Dave, if you've got something better to do.
No, that's all right, I'll be over in a little while.
You and I are gonna have to have a talk.
Whatever you say.
In the meantime, haven't you forgotten something else?
What's that?
Weren't you gonna play Misty for me?
Yeah.
I have that one right here.
Thank you, darling.
And now we have a pretty one for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night.
It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty.
And this one is especially for Evelyn.
Just a second.
Come in.
Hi.
Hi.
- Cold night, huh?
- Yeah.
But you got here anyway.
Stout fella.
Look, Evelyn, there's something we're gonna have to get straight.
It's amazing what a man will go through for a hot pastrami sandwich.
Now look...
Wait a minute.
You haven't told me how nice I look.
You look fine.
The lady at the store guaranteed you'd flip.
Now, listen.
Can we talk?
Wait.
First...
Surprise.
Don't you like them?
Yeah, they're great, but...
Don't spoil my fun, darling.
I love to give you things.
It's Madame Butterfly time.
First, friendly neighborhood geisha remove honorable shoes.
Stop it, Evelyn!
Now, we've gotta talk!
Have I done something wrong?
I'm just trying to be straight with you, that's all.
Be nice to me instead.
Jesus Christ!
I don't understand.
Are you trying to say you don't love me anymore?
I never told you that I loved you.
Not in words, maybe, but, Dave, there are lots of ways of saying things that have nothing to do with words.
I'm sorry you read it that way.
It's that other bitch, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
The picture in the silver frame in your dresser.
Look, that picture has got nothing to do with you.
What does have to do with me?
I never lied to you.
Big deal.
He never lied to me.
What do you want for that?
The Congressional Medal of Honor?
So long.
What am I supposed to do?
Sit here all dressed up in my little whore suit, waiting for my lord and master to call?
Nobody asked you to wait for anything.
You're not dumping me, buster blue eyes.
Get off my back, Evelyn!
Get off your back?
That's where you've been keeping me, isn't it?
You're nothing!
You're not even good in bed!
I just felt sorry for you, that's all!
Bastard!
You poor, pathetic bastard!
- Hello?
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean those things I said.
Will I see you tomorrow?
You don't listen, do you?
Oh, let me come over.
If I could just see you, just talk to you.
No, Evelyn.
But I love you, David.
I love you.
David, if I could just...
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Why?
No, come on.
You haven't heard one word I've been saying to you.
Yes, I have.
I've heard everything you said.
You did, huh?
All right, tell me.
You don't believe me, huh?
Go ahead.
Okay, wise chick.
We're supposed to go to a party at Big Sur tomorrow night, and I'm supposed to meet you there at 9:00.
And the address is...
I didn't tell you that.
See how you are?
I don't know myself yet.
I'll call you tomorrow about it, okay?
Okay.
You call me tomorrow.
Honey, we better go.
We're just getting to the best part.
Yeah, but I've got to pick Anjelica up at 6:00.
God!
How the pain is setting in.
Come on.
She's a very nice girl.
Anyway, she's moving out tonight.
Now, that's about the best news that I've heard in years.
And Madalyn's moving in.
Madalyn?
Shit.
What's going on?
Don't tell me it was asleep!
What else at this hour of the morning?
Oh, I'm surprised his conscience was that clear!
What do you want, Evelyn?
"What do you want, Evelyn?" What do you want?
Do I have to want something?
Can't I just come over?
Or is it inconvenient?
- Now, wait just a...
- Could it be I make a boo-boo?
Could it be that someone has been sleeping in Papa Bear's bed?
Wait a minute, God damn it!
Come out, come out, wherever you are!
I thought...
Oh, God, don't look at me that way, Dave.
I just don't know what to say to you.
I'm sorry I mistrusted you.
I should have known you'd never do anything spoil it.
To spoil what?
What we have between us.
We don't have a goddamn thing between us.
Now, how many ways am I gonna have to say this to you?
I don't care how many ways you say it.
It's not true!
What do I have to do to convince you?
It's not true!
It's not!
What are you doing?
I'm gonna get dressed and drive you home, that's what.
Why are you playing these games?
Why are you pretending you don't love me?
I don't even believe I'm hearing this.
But I love you!
You haven't got the vaguest idea what love is.
We don't even know each other.
Wait a minute.
You don't have to do that.
I'm okay.
I can drive home.
Are you sure?
Positive.
I'm fine.
Let me just wash my face, huh?
You ready?
You okay?
Evelyn?
Evelyn?
Oh, no.
How's she gonna be?
Well, I sutured the wounds.
It wasn't quite as bad as it looked.
It couldn't have been.
You know, Dave, I'm supposed to turn a report in on this.
But you won't.
You see, Tobie's back.
I'd rather be the one to tell her, and not have her read it in the paper somewhere.
I didn't know that.
I'll tell Marie.
We'll do the spaghetti number.
Somebody gonna be around here today?
Me.
I'll be here.
I bombed her out pretty good.
Better let her sleep it off before you take her home.
And how long will that be?
It's hard to say.
Why?
I'd like to take Tobie out tonight.
No problem.
She'll wake up sometime this afternoon, 5:00 or so.
Is she gonna be all right?
Well, the cuts were really pretty superficial.
I mean, do you think she'll try it again?
Chances are against it.
But I'd watch her.
I wouldn't leave her alone if she seems unusually depressed or insecure.
Better get some sleep yourself.
You look like hell.
Call me if you need me.
Hey, thanks, Frank.
I really appreciate it.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
Fine.
Here.
Thank you.
Brought you a little soup.
It looks good.
I don't know what to say.
It frightens me thinking about it.
Well, don't think about it.
Oh, I don't mean me.
I mean you.
"Girl commits suicide in disc jockey's home."
It's not very good publicity for a man in your position.
Get some rest.
As soon as you feel better, I'll take you home.
Thank you, David.
I got your clothes hung up in the closet there.
Maybe you better answer the phone.
Yeah.
I'll get it in the other room.
Hello.
Hi.
Hey I just wanted to check.
We still on for tonight?
Yeah, I'm all dressed and ready to go.
What time is the party?
Well, Madalyn's already left, and she won't be back for a long time, and I was just thinking...
Would you be terribly disappointed if we didn't go to the party and just stayed here instead?
Well, I think I can bear up under it.
Don't be too long.
That's me at the door.
David, the way I look at it, the hell with Sausalito.
Bye-bye.
No.
Evelyn?
What's the matter?
Take it easy.
I had a dream.
I was drowning in the ocean and I called to you, but you just stood there watching.
Watching.
It was just a dream.
Oh, God, I'm so alone.
Hold me.
Hold me, Dave.
Please.
Please.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Tighter.
Tighter.
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.
David!
I woke up and you were gone.
If you have something planned for tonight, you could just take me home.
Maybe that'd be best.
No, no, there's nothing.
Good.
Isn't this nice?
Just us here, together.
Here we go again.
Stone-cold dead in the market.
Must have been quite a party.
Go away, Birdie.
Any other bodies, any other juiceheads around here?
Come back tomorrow, will you?
Or next year sometime.
I better check the workbench.
All right, break it up in here.
Looks like old times around this place.
Evelyn?
Evelyn?
Lose something, tiger?
Look, Birdie, you couldn't find it within your heart to come back at a later time, could you?
This is a later time, pussycat.
I'm paying you back for the day I blew last week.
Evelyn?
Evelyn?
Very funny, Birdie.
Very funny.
What I can't figure out is, with all this kind of action going on in here, what are you doing out there couching it?
What is this, some kind of Kinsey Report?
Do I come over to your house and ask a lot of dumb questions?
Well, you just ought to, pussycat.
Might open up a whole new way of life to you.
Hold it.
Let's try to show a little class, shall we?
Mr. Garver's residence.
Oh, I'll see.
Do you want to talk to a Madge Brenner?
Yeah.
I want to talk to her.
Thanks.
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Garver?
Madge Brenner.
We like the tape on your show.
Like it very much.
There are one or two others still in the running, but frankly...
Why can't we have lunch today?
Windjammer still good?
Yeah, still very good.
Reserve a table in your name.
See you then, Mr. Garver.
Great.
Bye-bye.
Looks like we found Evelyn.
"Good morning, darling.
Gone shopping.
"Back in a flash with the hash."
Ooh!
A little humor in there.
"Love and kisses, Evelyn."
And then it says,
"if you can't find your keys, don't worry.
"I borrowed your car."
Here's your key, and here's your copy.
That'll be 40 cents, please.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
David?
I stopped by my...
Hi.
Don't you look all gussied up?
Well, good.
I was gonna cook brunch, but this calls for something more festive.
How about the Marquis?
My treat.
After all I put you through, it's the least...
No, no.
I have a lunch date.
Business.
Business?
Yeah.
Can I have my car keys?
Sure.
I think you ought to take it easy, anyway.
Get some rest.
Yeah, I do feel a little tired.
Very funny, Dave.
Now, let's talk show.
Tell me, what do you think of the concept?
The unstructured, the loosey-goosey, Monterey pop, Woodstock kind of thing?
I like it.
I like it very much, and I think I can handle it.
So do I.
I'll keep this to promote your new career with.
You'll be working with kids, bright and marvelous.
But they take handling.
You know, if this show goes the way I think it's going to, there's no reason in the world why...
Well, isn't this cozy?
So this is your business lunch?
How's business?
- Friend of yours?
- Just another trick, honey.
That's enough.
Is that your idea of a dish?
My God, she's a little old for you, isn't she?
What is this, "Be Kind to Senior Citizens Week"?
Get out of here!
It's not that I mind you being a bastard, but do you have to be such a tasteless bastard?
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
She couldn't get laid in a lumber camp!
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
You're hurting me!
Stop it, you dirty bastard!
Oh, no!
Stop it!
Dave!
Oh, no!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Don't leave me!
Don't leave me!
She's nothing!
Nothing!
Nothing!
I love you!
Get her out of here, man.
Where to?
I did it because I love you.
Don't you understand that?
I love you!
- Where to, mister?
- Move!
It's because I love you!
Dave, please.
This is a private beach.
I want to talk to you.
I don't want to talk to you.
Are you drunk?
No, but that's not a bad idea.
Why, David?
Why what?
Drunk?
No.
Why last night?
That's what I came to explain to you.
Okay, good.
But I think we should understand each other.
I'm not very happy with you.
Well, that's fair enough, Tobie.
Whatever it was, you could have called me.
No, I couldn't.
Why not?
I couldn't tell you the truth last night.
I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.
Now, why do you have to say that?
I just didn't want to take a chance she'd try it again.
What if she does?
Well, I swear to you, if she ever tries it,
I'd just let her go right on ahead.
Oh, God!
Oh, my God.
What in the...
Oh, God, help me!
Please, somebody, help me!
Help me, somebody!
Oh, God, help me!
Stay back, buddy.
I live here, man.
Is she your housecleaning lady, Garver?
Okay, boys, let's take her out.
Watch your step.
Birdie.
It's gonna cost you double to clean up this mess.
Watch your step.
Dave Garver?
Yeah.
I'm Sergeant McCallum.
Any ideas?
About what?
About your girlfriend in there.
Hey, that's not my girlfriend.
Let me get that straight right in front.
More or less a casual acquaintance, you'd say?
That's right.
She just dropped by to hack up your wardrobe and your cleaning lady?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
I'm not trying to tell you anything, Sergeant.
Well then, maybe you ought to.
The lady almost got herself killed.
And I'm stumbling around in my stupid way trying to find out why.
What'll you have?
This Evelyn Draper, where does she come from?
- I don't know.
- What about her family?
I don't know that either.
She just listens to my radio show, and we met one night.
That's all.
Practically a stranger.
That's right.
Then how does she happen to have a key to your front door?
I don't know that either.
It boils down to, you don't know a hell of a lot, do you?
What it boils down to is I'm getting sick of your questions.
And so am I!
But they get upset with me down at the store if I don't ask them.
Just take her through.
I'll be right along.
Right.
Take her through what?
Booking.
What she really needs is psychiatric help.
Really?
Now, look, those cuts on her wrists...
Don't know anything about those.
There's one other thing.
I know. "Don't leave town."
I was gonna say, "Why don't you play some Mantovani sometime?"
Didn't know you liked the show, Sergeant.
I don't.
I like Mantovani.
Go ahead, play!
Whoo!
Those of you who may have played brass instruments in high school, you know that was triple-tonguing, baby.
Let's give his tongue a nice hand!
He might just be the fastest tongue in the West!
Come on.
All right, I'm coming.
What do you say...
How about something to eat?
I've got to pick up my roommate, Annabel.
Madalyn's your roommate.
I found my man, and I'm moving out.
And Annabel's moving in.
Right.
Ciao.
Later.
Thank you.
Thank you very kindly.
That was the Cannonball Adderley Group.
And they're making it happen out at the Monterey Jazz Festival, along with Duke Ellington, Woody Herman, Joe Williams and many others.
Still got tickets for Sunday night.
So get on out there because that's where it's happening.
Now we're gonna hear from the Gator Creek Organization and Feelin' Fine.
KRML.
Dave Garver.
Hello?
Play Misty for me.
David?
I didn't mean to shake you up.
I'm sorry.
Pretty stupid of me.
I've been released.
Therapy.
It was a bad dream, but it's over.
Where are you?
The airport.
San Francisco.
I've only got a minute or two between planes.
Got a job in Hawaii.
You're all right, then?
Fine, David.
Fine.
I just want to say how sorry I am about everything.
Forget it.
I have.
I hope so.
"Because this maiden she lived with no other thought"
"Than to love and be loved by you"
Are you near a radio?
No.
But play it for me anyway.
- Hello.
- Garver?
- Yeah.
- Sergeant McCallum.
Sorry to wake you, but something's come up.
Yeah, I know.
She just paid me a visit with a butcher knife.
Why?
Because she was released on parole pending further legal action.
When?
A week ago.
Well, I sure like the way you broke your ass to let me know about it.
I just found out about it myself.
Who's in charge down there, anyway?
Now, look.
Do you want to help find her or would you rather just sit there and bellyache?
All right.
Good.
Now, exactly what did she say to you?
I told you.
She said that she was well and that she was going to Hawaii.
What else?
I already told you.
Tell me again.
You know, Sergeant, you really make lousy conversation.
You make lousy coffee.
Come on, what else did she say?
Nothing, except...
Except what?
It was nothing.
It was a line from a poem.
What poem?
If I knew that, I'd know the line.
Wouldn't I?
Try to remember.
You know, McCallum, it's getting late.
You're sounding very monotonous.
Well, now, you're not exactly my idea of a swinging date either.
Good night, McCallum.
Hey, what happened to the Mantovani?
The what?
Well, I heard the show, but I never did hear you play Mantovani.
You really did listen to the show.
Friend, if we had a TV down at the station,
I'd break my arm before I turned your show on.
Thanks a lot.
Just hope we're lucky enough to grab her the next time she tries it.
Tries what?
To kill you.
Yeah.
And if you're not lucky enough...
That'd be hell.
The guys down at the station would have to chip in and buy a TV.
You're a great comfort, Sergeant.
You will change the locks?
Hi.
Nothing like a nice brisk walk in the woods to put roses on a girl's cheeks.
How are you?
Not so good, honey.
She's back.
Who?
Evelyn Draper, the girl who tried to kill Birdie.
How can...
How can she be back?
I thought they'd put her in a state sanitarium.
They did, but they let her out.
Does that mean she's all right?
Theoretically.
What happens now?
I think you and I ought to stay away from each other for a couple of days, just in case she's tagging after me.
She's already following you, isn't she?
I don't want you to worry about it.
I can handle myself.
Yeah.
So could Birdie.
All right then, you stand by.
Well, they're all set to trace the call.
Now, when she phones you, just mention her by name right away, Evelyn, and they start to trace her.
All you gotta do after that is just keep her talking.
Fifteen minutes before the hour here at KRML and here's It's Not Unusual.
I guess it hasn't come to you yet, huh?
What?
What she said.
Over the phone last night?
Part of a poem or something.
You told me were gonna try to remember.
I thought I had that, but I've forgotten.
Is it that important?
Until we pick her up, everything's important.
What's wrong?
I'm worried about my girlfriend with all this going on.
They're so damn isolated down there.
I'm thinking the best thing to do is just call Al Monte and have him sub for me.
Now, look.
The only chance we've got is when she phones in here tonight.
You've got to be here, right on that mike.
If she phones.
She will.
Believe me.
But only if you're here.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
If it'll make you feel any better,
I'll go over and check your girlfriend's house myself, okay?
I'd sure appreciate that.
She lives on the Highlands on Spindrift Road.
I think it's the fourth or fifth house down.
"Williams" is on the mailbox.
Why don't you phone her?
Okay.
Tell her to be expecting me.
McCallum.
Thanks, huh?
Public servant.
Hello?
Hi.
I'm just checking in.
You all right?
Marvelous.
I'm just getting ready to do my nails and I got your program on.
And Annabel's in the kitchen making a couple of coffee grogs.
What more could a girl ask for?
No, honey, really everything's fine.
There's a Sergeant McCallum that's gonna drop by for a second, just to see if you've buttoned up all right.
Let him in, but nobody else.
Okay?
Okay.
Hey, David, you want to play something soft and dreamy for us?
You got it.
Bye-bye.
Bye, hon.
Hey, Annabel, how's that stuff coming?
Now here's something soft and sentimental for Tobie and Annabel.
Hope you like cinnamon in yours.
Whatever's right.
Annabel.
Good, huh?
Mmm.
Too much.
So is this.
Thank you.
Just one thing.
Do you mind?
No, be my guest.
The eyes are wrong.
David's are more...
How shall I say?
Colder.
I didn't know you knew David.
- Hmm?
- I didn't realize you and David were...
Were friends.
Friends?
Oh.
No, not friends.
Not friends.
God, you're dumb.
"Because this maiden she lived with no other thought
"Than to love and be loved by you"
Tobie?
We're waiting for you, David.
This is Dave Garver with a little verse, a little talk and five hours of music to be very, very nice to each other by.
Careful.
Careful.
I might put your eye out.
I'll bet David loves your eyes.
And your hair.
Does he run his fingers through your hair?
Have to get you all nice for David.
For David.
I hope he likes what he sees when he walks in here, because that's what he's taking to hell with him.
Miss Williams?
McCallum?
And now here's a pretty one for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night.
It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty.
And this one is especially for Evelyn.
Hey, hey, you're digging the masterjock forsolid rock Sweet Al Monte blasting, babies.
Being bold and pouring coal on KRML in quaintlittle Carmel-by-the-Sea.
We're next door to magnificent Monterey, home of the annualjazz festival.
Although it's four months away, you got to getyour tickets because they're going fast and it can'tlast.
The time is 7:54 and there's a breeze of 50 degrees around yourloving hips, and there's a taste of fog.
I say we got a bowl ofsoul, and ifyou think your heart can take it...
Now we're gonna wrap it up for the week, folks.
A brand-new release from the funk capital of the world, Squeeze Me.
Here he comes, the big "D" himself, Dave Garver.
And Dave is gonna bring you five hours of mellow groove.
In the meantime, this is SweetAl Monte saying:
"Hang in there, babies, because everything is going to be everything."
'Bye.
What's that letter you got there?
Is that that Frisco gig?
Yeah.
All right, so what's happening?
They want the usual thing:
A biography, pictures.
Really?
Is that that Madge Brenner chick?
Yeah, she's the one putting it together.
In that case, David, you're in.
How do you figure that?
Now, David, come on, man.
Are you kidding?
She's a grandmother.
So when did that everstop you?
You better get a move on.
I already played your theme.
Yeah, I heard it.
You're a real human being.
And you're on the air, baby.
All right.
"Men have destroyed the roads of wonder
"And their cities squat like black toads
"In the orchards of life nothing is clean or real
"Or as a girl, naked to love or be a man with"
This is Dave Garver with a little verse, a little talk and five hours of music to be very, very nice to each other by.
-KRML, Dave Garver speaking.
-Hello?
-Hi, what'll it be?
-Play Misty for me.
Misty?
We have that right on the play rack.
Thanks for calling.
I see you got your little Misty chick calling you again.
All righty.
-Swing along.
-You take it easy now.
See you in the a. m.
KRML, Dave Garver.
-Hi, Murphy.
-Hi, Dave.
No messages for you.
-No?
-Heard your show tonight.
It sure beats hell out of working for a living.
-Thanks for the plug.
-What are friends for?
-Bartender.
-Coke?
Coming right up.
She's waiting for someone.
You sure?
That's what she says.
Guys have been striking out all night.
One game?
-Cry Bastion?
-What else?
Okay, coach.
You asked for it.
Don't take all night.
Move.
Okay.
Move.
Palfrey's Gambit.
Dirty rat.
Are we playing Copenhagen rules?
Make it easy on yourself, Murph.
Cry Bastion.
Sorry, no Bastion.
Damn, I didn't see that.
It's too bad, Murphy.
Too bad.
-Careful now.
-That ought to do it.
Be really careful now.
Careful.
Hi.
He doesn't see it.
Yeah?
Cry Bastion.
Fool's ploy, my man.
Fool's ploy.
Care to play the winner?
I'll just watch.
-My name is Dave Garver.
-Evelyn Draper.
Sit down, Evelyn Draper?
Care for a drink?
Okay.
-What'll it be?
-Surprise me.
-Screwdriver.
-Nice game.
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.
-What happened?
-I won.
How?
When?
When you said, "Okay."
I ought to be mad.
But you're not.
Not really.
It certainly was nice of you to bring me home, Mr. Garver?
That's right.
I don't think I've been stood up on a date since the ninth grade back in Albany.
Is something wrong?
No, I keep getting the feeling I know you from someplace.
-You do?
-Yeah.
Here.
Why don't you let me do that?
Oh, no.
That's all right.
I've got it.
Why don't you see if you can get the fire started?
All right.
There are some matches right next to it.
All right.
It's getting late.
You're sure I'm not keeping you up?
No.
I rarely get to bed before 3:00 a. m.
I didn't have a date tonight.
I went there because you talk about it on your program sometimes and I wanted to meet you.
I listen to you all the time.
I knew somebody was out there.
-You're making fun of me.
-No, I'm not.
-Say something else.
-Such as?
Play Misty for me?
Very good.
-You sure I'm not keeping you up?
-Don't you like me?
You're a very nice girl.
But who needs nice girls?
No, I like them.
I'm kind of hung up on one.
And you don't want to complicate your life.
-That's exactly right.
-Neither do I.
But that's no reason we shouldn't sleep together tonight if we feel like it.
Solid silicone.
Hi, David, my man!
How you been, baby?
See you got the joint cleaned up for once.
The Heavy digs it.
-Care for a beer?
-Not really.
I could go for something more uplifting, but not a brew, my man.
Beer is all we've got.
You're gonna have to ease on out.
I got a lot of work to do today.
You don't understand.
I've been sent here to get you.
By whom?
That old chick I go with.
What's her name?
-Carol?
-That's the one.
Girl thinks you've been working too hard.
She said we should get together tonight.
Who's this "we"?
Me, you, her and one of them hens that you can dig up.
There is a fantastic new Mexican place in Carmel called Susinos.
The alb´ondigas soup is unbelievable.
It is a mind-bender...
I know the joint, but I don't have a date, and I got a lot to do.
Big deal, man.
Get one!
If you have any problems getting one, I'll get one for you as nice as I look.
It's too late, and besides, I've got a lot of work to do.
But you gotta eat, David.
I'm gonna whip up something here in my own kitchen.
You know, David, I'm really worried about your social life.
You'll make someone a tremendous mother.
Too narrow in the pelvis.
I sure appreciate you dropping by, Al.
Come by again sometime, anytime.
Never let it be said that Sweet Al Monte can't take a hint.
-Who's hinting?
-Hi.
Why, hi there, yourself.
Dave Garver live here?
That depends on your point of view.
Hi.
This stuff weighs a ton.
Where's the kitchen?
Right inside.
Just come on in and help yourself.
Swing right around the bend there.
I know, David, she's from Chicken Delight.
Look, don't work too hard, my man.
Don't strain yourself.
How come you don't have any beer?
And what is this?
A shrunken head?
Does that guy live here?
-I wanted...
-I hope you like steak.
-You look like a steak-and-potatoes type.
-Hang on.
I said to myself, a nice salad with Roquefort and tomatoes...
-...and baked potato with...
-What's going on here?
-Don't send me away.
-No, I want to ask you a question.
I just wanted to surprise you.
Surprise?
What happens if he and I had been talking business?
Or maybe I have female company and you come traipsing in with groceries?
That would be some surprise.
I'm sorry.
Keep that stuff.
I think I've lost my appetite.
Hang on a minute.
I'm just trying to tell you something.
I don't understand.
Should I go or stay?
What?
I'm telling you there's a telephone, and I pick it up and I dial it.
You answer and I say, "What are you doing?"
And I say, "I'll be right over."
Fine.
Next time, why don't we do it that way?
Okay.
Any way you like.
Next time.
How do you like your steak?
Extremely rare.
That's just how I like mine.
Extremely rare.
I'll get some wine here.
A little vino.
Vino!
All this and heaven, too!
Terrific!
This is gonna be some dinner.
What happened to that discussion we had last time?
You know, the deal about no strings and all that?
There are no strings, but I never said anything about not coming back for seconds, did I?
That's right.
You didn't.
When will I see you?
I'll give you a call.
-Dave, you're funny.
-How's that?
If you want to keep playing these games, okay, but they're really not necessary anymore, not for me.
People are trying to sleep here!
People are trying to talk here!
-How'd you like to tell that to the law?
-How'd you like to go screw yourself?
Take it easy!
Guy's just trying to sleep, that's all.
You're right.
It's a terrific morning.
Why be selfish with it?
Bye-bye.
Wait a minute!
Yeah?
Excuse me, I saw the sweater, and I thought you were somebody else.
You must be David.
Where have you been?
Around.
I was trying to join the revolt against the representational.
Didn't quite make that though.
So now I'm just trying to play it cool.
Not quite making that either.
Got time for a break?
-Yeah.
-Let's go.
-When did you get in town?
-Yesterday.
-You weren't gonna call me?
-Of course I was.
I had to get settled first.
You shouldn't lend your sweaters to blabbermouths.
You've gotten thinner.
No!
Well, so much for Sausalito.
Sausalito?
That's where I was staying.
Jay Jay's place.
-Jay Jay's place?
-It's nothing much, really.
It's just a little pied-´a-terre, but it's handy to the fleet.
You told me you didn't know where she was.
So I lied.
Picket me.
-Thanks a lot.
-Listen, stud, it wasn't my idea.
You should have caught her act.
The whole Bette Davis, through-finished-kaput scene.
-And at 3:00 a. m.
-Come on, Jay Jay.
He's exaggerating.
I'll check with Malcolm.
Maybe I can get you the afternoon off.
What happened, pussycat?
He ran into Anjelica.
She told him I was back.
That bitch should be hung by the thumbs or something equally appropriate.
It's all set up.
Let's go.
It's nothing personal, really.
I happen to think she could be a first-rate artist if her damned hormones didn't get in the way.
-There's not much he can do about that.
-He could kill himself.
Jay Jay, why don't you go cruise some sailors?
Please, don't mention seafood.
Come on.
I really missed this place.
I missed you.
You'd do me a big favor if you didn't say things like that.
Why is that?
I don't know.
Somehow it brings out the worst in me.
It makes me want to say things like, "How's that redhead?"
What?
The redhead, the one who worked in the bookstore.
She went back to Berkeley or whatever.
That's too bad.
You always have that blonde from Santa Barbara to fall back on.
If that's the phrase I'm looking for, and I think it probably is.
What are we gonna do?
Go through a whole list?
Is that it?
Who's got that kind of time?
I just don't know if I'm up to it anymore.
Up to what?
Those nights sitting and waiting for you to finish your program and come by.
Nights when it would start to get late and I'd start to think:
"I wonder if he's run himself off a cliff or maybe he's run into a blonde."
There was a time when I started rooting for the accident.
I mean, if it was a choice between that and a blonde.
You don't know how secure you make me feel.
I didn't wish you anything too serious.
Just a couple of months in traction.
You're all heart.
You know, the thing I hate the most in the whole world is a jealous female and that's what I was becoming.
That's why I had to split.
I was starting to be one of my most unfavorite people.
I hated it.
I know you did, too.
That still works anyway.
-Too well sometimes.
-What does that mean?
I mean, there's a little spot in the middle of each day, just about your size.
There's lots of girls my size if you're really looking.
I'm not.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You mean you've given up girls?
I haven't exactly been the monk of the month or anything like that but I have been making an effort.
There must be a real consternation among those "gropies."
That's "groupies," isn't it?
I don't know, "groupies, gropies..."
You know, you've got to be fair.
It hasn't just been my fault.
Listen, I know.
They kept overpowering you.
You get a little bit of the blame, too, you know.
You and that parade of roommates that keep moving in and out of your place.
I didn't realize they were such a trial to you.
What trial?
I enjoyed it.
You and I sitting in front of the fireplace and then some chick sitting there with a bathrobe on, eating Fig Newtons.
What about the one with the St. Bernard?
She was a real winner.
She took up enough space.
And then that other one that took the flute lessons.
Yeah, maybe it was a little rough on you.
I can think of a thousand reasons why we should try again.
I've got about seven billion things to do.
What do you think?
You want to try for a new start, right from the letter "A"?
-What am I gonna do with you?
-A lot.
Hi.
Excuse me.
Hi.
-You've met Anjelica, my...
-Roommate.
Yes.
I think I'll drive into Carmel and see if I can't find some cleaning solvent.
There's plenty under the sink.
Okay.
This house ought to have a revolving door.
You know when my father left me this house, he left me payments.
I can't handle that expense by myself and most girls don't like the isolation.
-It's a long way from town.
-I know.
I better get back to work.
-Thanks.
-That's it, "thanks"?
Four months in Sausalito is a long time.
I am not gonna get back on that same old merry-go-round again.
What do I have to do, give you a notarized statement?
I need a couple of more days to try and figure out where I'm at.
Okay.
You get your bearings, and then you'll give me a call, all right?
-Hi, Murph.
-Hi, Dave.
Sardine Factory.
Dave Garver?
You said this is Evelyn?
No.
Sorry, you've just missed him.
-What do you mean?
-He's gone.
He's not here.
I think you'd better look again.
Believe me, you just missed him.
Now if you're interested in someone more sophisticated I'll be happy to...
That's what I get for being a dirty old man.
There's a message for you, a Madge somebody from San Francisco.
-Brenner?
-That's it.
Al Monte gave her this number.
"Received pictures and biography.
"Please send a two-hour tape of your show as soon as possible."
-Thanks, Murph.
-Don't mention it.
I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be your social secretary.
You will put that on my tab?
Surprise!
What are you doing here?
I was calling you from that phone booth and he told me you'd left and I was staring right at your car.
Isn't that funny?
Yeah, kind of funny.
Why didn't you take my call?
Where does it say I gotta drop everything and answer the phone every time it rings?
Do you know your nostrils flare out into little wings when you're mad?
-It's kind of cute.
-Come on, Evelyn.
I gotta go.
-I'd love a Coke.
-Not now, I gotta get to the station.
No, you don't.
You're talking to your No. 1 fan.
You don't work tonight.
I've got this show that I'm trying to set and it's very important to me.
That means I gotta pick the music, write the lead-ins and find some poetry.
-Come on, will you?
-Poetry?
-Let me help you.
I'm terrific with poetry...
-Not tonight!
Does he want his keys?
-Come on, Evelyn.
-Speak.
-Come on!
-God!
Good boy!
Let's hear it.
Come on.
Come on.
Give me my keys.
-Come on.
Give me the keys.
-Come on.
Give me the keys, goddamn it!
-Having some trouble, lady?
-Get lost!
Yeah, get lost, assholes!
Let's split.
He's got enough trouble already.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
'Bye.
See you later.
Hi.
Get all your work done?
What do you want, Evelyn?
One Coke?
I'll tell you, tonight I'm really whipped.
What time is it?
Time for me to go home.
Go back to sleep.
-Hey, I've got an idea.
-What's that?
Some night this week, after the show corned beef and potato salad, dill pickles, the whole bit.
My place.
Deal?
I'll call you.
Thursday's good for me.
And now from KRML, the big-band sounds of Dee Barton.
Here's a fresh reel of tape for your air check.
-You want me to thread it up?
-No, leave it here.
Thanks.
I think I will go out and hit the streets, but before doing that I will blow me a little number.
Care to partake?
Take it in the other room.
I get zonked just breathing the air here.
All right, be that way.
-Al?
-Yeah?
Do you ever find yourself being completely smothered by somebody?
-Anybody I know?
-You met her at my house the other day.
Chicken Delight!
That's what I call a pretty good smothering.
You start a relationship thinking you're gonna be completely honest and suddenly the whole thing gets out of hand.
What's the problem?
The problem is I've been trying to uncomplicate my life and now I can't even answer the door.
Besides, Tobie's back.
Oh, really?
Tobie?
When?
-I ran into her Sunday.
-That was a goody.
I'll tell you the truth.
I've always thought Tobie was one of the foxiest chicks on the peninsula.
And why you gotta have so much action, I just don't understand it anyway.
It's just a hang-up I have, or had.
But now that I seem to have that straightened out I can't seem to solve this other problem.
Well, you know what they always say, my man.
No, what?
"He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword."
Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
Later.
We'll have more smooth sounds in just one minute but first, at ten minutes to the hour, we're broadcasting from KRML in the Carmel Rancho Shopping Center home of the buccaneer, the man's boutique.
KRML, Dave Garver speaking.
The whole point in having an answering service is to call in once in a while to check for messages.
Hi, Evelyn.
What's happening?
What could be happening, darling?
You're not here yet.
"Yet"?
I hope you like pastrami, because there was no corned beef.
Now, wait a minute.
Just hold on.
Are you trying to tell me you forgot that we have a date tonight?
I thought I was supposed to call you on that.
I feel kind of silly sitting here in my brand-new lounging pajamas.
Ijust assumed...
Apparently, I assumed wrong.
That's right.
You assumed wrong.
You don't have to come over if you've got something better to do.
I'll be over in a little while.
You and I are gonna have to have a talk.
Whatever you say.
In the meantime, haven't you forgotten something else?
What's that?
Weren't you gonna play Misty for me?
Yeah.
I have that one right here.
Thank you, darling.
And now we have a pretty one for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night.
It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty.
And this one is especially for Evelyn.
Just a second.
Come in.
Hi.
Hi.
-Cold night?
-Yeah.
But you got here anyway.
Stout fella.
There's something we're gonna have to get straight.
It's amazing what a man will go through for a hot pastrami sandwich.
-Look...
-Wait a minute.
You haven't told me how nice I look.
-You look fine.
-The sales lady guaranteed you'd flip.
-Now, listen.
Can we talk?
-Wait.
First...
Surprise.
-Don't you like them?
-Yeah, they're great, but...
Don't spoil my fun, darling.
I love to give you things.
It's Madame Butterfly time.
First, friendly neighborhood geisha remove honorable shoes.
Stop it, Evelyn!
Now, we've gotta talk!
Have I done something wrong?
I'm just trying to be straight with you, that's all.
Be nice to me instead.
Jesus Christ!
I don't understand.
Are you trying to say you don't love me anymore?
I never told you that I loved you.
Not in words maybe, but there are ways of saying things that have nothing to do with words.
I'm sorry you read it that way.
It's that other bitch, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
The silver-framed picture in your dresser.
-That picture's got nothing to do with you.
-What does have to do with me?
-I never lied to you.
-Big deal.
He never lied to me.
What do you want for that?
The Congressional Medal of Honor?
-So long.
-What am I supposed to do?
Sit here all dressed up in my little whore suit waiting for my lord and master to call?
-Nobody asked you to wait for anything.
-You're not dumping me!
-Get off my back, Evelyn!
-Get off your back?
That's where you've been keeping me, isn't it?
You're nothing!
You're not even good in bed!
I just felt sorry for you, that's all!
Bastard!
You poor, pathetic bastard!
Hello?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean those things I said.
Will I see you tomorrow?
You don't listen, do you?
Let me come over.
If I could just see you, just talk to you.
-No, Evelyn.
-But I love you, David.
I love you.
Davidl If I couldjust...
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Why?
No, come on.
You haven't heard a word I've been saying.
-I have.
I've heard everything you said.
-You did?
All right, tell me.
-You don't believe me?
-Go ahead.
Okay, wise chick.
We're supposed to go to a party at Big Sur tomorrow night.
I'm supposed to meet you there at 9:00.
And the address is...
I didn't tell you that.
See how you are?
I don't know myself yet.
I'll call you tomorrow about it.
Okay.
You call me tomorrow.
Honey, we better go.
-We're just getting to the best part.
-But I've got to pick Anjelica up at 6:00.
God!
How the pain is setting in.
Come on.
She's a very nice girl.
Anyway, she's moving out tonight.
Now, that's about the best news I've heard in years.
And Madalyn's moving in.
Madalyn?
Shit.
-What's going on?
-Don't tell me he was asleep!
What else at this hour of the morning?
I'm surprised his conscience was that clear!
-What do you want, Evelyn?
-"What do you want, Evelyn?"
Do I have to want something?
Can't I just come over?
Or is it inconvenient?
-Wait a...
-Did I make a boo-boo?
Has someone been sleeping in Papa Bear's bed?
Wait a minute, goddamn it!
"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
I thought...
God, don't look at me that way, Dave.
I just don't know what to say to you.
I'm sorry I mistrusted you.
I know you'd never spoil it.
To spoil what?
What we have between us.
We don't have a goddamn thing!
How many ways do I have to say this?
I don't care how many ways you say it, it's not true!
-What do I have to do to convince you?
-It's not true!
It's not!
What are you doing?
I'm gonna get dressed and drive you home, that's what.
Why are you playing these games?
Why are you pretending you don't love me?
I don't even believe I'm hearing this.
But I love you!
You haven't got the vaguest idea what love is.
We don't even know each other.
Wait a minute.
You don't have to do that.
I'm okay.
I can drive home.
Are you sure?
Positive.
I'm fine.
Let me just wash my face.
You ready?
You okay?
Oh, no.
How's she gonna be?
I sutured the wounds.
It wasn't quite as bad as it looked.
It couldn't have been.
You know, Dave, I'm supposed to turn a report in on this.
But you won't.
You see, Tobie's back.
I'd rather tell her, and not have her read it in the paper somewhere.
I didn't know that.
I'll tell Marie.
We'll do the spaghetti number.
-Somebody gonna be around here today?
-Me.
I'll be here.
I bombed her out pretty good.
Let her sleep it off before you take her home.
-And how long will that be?
-It's hard to say.
Why?
-I'd like to take Tobie out tonight.
-No problem.
She'll wake up sometime this afternoon, 5:00 or so.
Is she gonna be all right?
The cuts were really pretty superficial.
I mean, do you think she'll try it again?
Chances are against it.
But I'd watch her.
I wouldn't leave her alone if she seems unusually depressed or insecure.
Better get some sleep yourself.
You look like hell.
Call me if you need me.
Thanks, Frank.
I really appreciate it.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
Fine.
Here.
Thank you.
Brought you a little soup.
It looks good.
I don't know what to say.
It frightens me thinking about it.
Don't think about it.
I don't mean me.
I mean you.
"Girl commits suicide in disc jockey's home."
It's not very good publicity for a man in your position.
Get some rest.
As soon as you feel better, I'll take you home.
Thank you, David.
I got your clothes hung up in the closet there.
Maybe you better answer the phone.
Yeah.
I'll get it in the other room.
Hello.
Hi.
I just wanted to check.
We still on for tonight?
Yeah, I'm ready to go.
What time is the party?
Madalyn's already left, and she won't be back for a long time and I was just thinking...
Would you be disappointed if we didn't go to the party and just stayed here instead?
I think I can bear up under it.
Don't be too long.
-That's me at the door.
-David the way I look at it, the hell with Sausalito.
Bye-bye.
Evelyn?
-What's the matter?
Take it easy.
-I had a dream.
I was drowning in the ocean and I called to you, but you just stood there watching.
Watching.
It was just a dream.
Oh, God, I'm so alone.
Hold me.
Hold me, Dave.
Please.
Yeah.
Tighter.
Tighter.
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.
David!
I woke up and you were gone.
If you have something planned for tonight, you could just take me home.
Maybe that'd be best.
No, no, there's nothing.
Good.
Isn't this nice?
Just us here, together.
Here we go again.
Stone-cold dead in the market.
Must have been quite a party.
Go away, Birdie.
Any other bodies, any other juiceheads around here?
Come back tomorrow, will you?
Or next year sometime.
I better check the workbench.
All right, break it up in here.
Looks like old times around this place.
Evelyn?
Lose something, tiger?
You couldn't find it within your heart to come back at a later time, could you?
This is a later time, pussycat.
I'm paying you back for the day I blew last week.
Evelyn?
Very funny, Birdie.
Very funny.
What I can't figure out is, with all this action going on in here what are you doing out there couching it?
What is this, some kind of Kinsey Report?
Do I come over to your house and ask a lot of dumb questions?
You just ought to, pussycat.
Might open up a whole new way of life to you.
Hold it.
Let's try to show a little class, shall we?
Mr. Garver's residence.
I'll see.
Do you want to talk to a Madge Brenner?
Yeah.
I want to talk to her.
Thanks.
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Garver?
Madge Brenner.
We like the tape on your show.
Like it very much.
There are one or two others in the running, but, frankly...
Can we have lunch today?
-Windjammerstill good?
-Yeah, still very good.
Reserve a table in your name.
-See you then, Mr. Garver.
-Great.
Bye-bye.
Looks like we found Evelyn.
"Good morning, darling.
Gone shopping.
"Back in a flash with the hash."
A little humor in there.
"Love and kisses, Evelyn."
And then it says:
"If you can't find your keys, don't worry.
"I borrowed your car."
Here's your key, and here's your copy.
That'll be USDO.40, please.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
David?
I stopped by my...
Hi.
Don't you look all gussied up?
Good.
I was gonna cook brunch but this calls for something more festive.
How about the Marquis?
My treat.
-After all I put you through, it's the least...
-I have a lunch date.
Business.
-Business?
-Yeah.
Can I have my car keys?
Sure.
I think you ought to take it easy, anyway.
Get some rest.
Yeah, I do feel a little tired.
Very funny, Dave.
Now, let's talk show.
Tell me, what do you think of the concept?
The unstructured the loosey-goosey, Monterey pop, Woodstock kind of thing?
I like it very much, and I think I can handle it.
So do I.
I'll keep this to promote your new career with.
You'll be working with kids, bright and marvelous.
But they take handling.
If this goes the way I think it will...
-...there's no reason in the world why...
-Isn't this cozy?
So this is your business lunch?
How's business?
Friend of yours?
-Just another trick.
-That's enough.
Is that your idea of a dish?
She's a little old for you, isn't she?
What is this, "Be Kind to Senior Citizens Week"?
Get outta here!
I don't mind you being a bastard, but do you have to be a tasteless one?
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
She couldn't get laid in a lumber camp!
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
You're hurting me!
Stop it, you dirty bastard!
No!
Stop it!
Dave!
No!
No!
Don't leave me!
Don't leave me!
She's nothing!
Nothing!
Nothing!
-I love you!
-Get her outta here.
Where to?
I did it because I love you.
Don't you understand that?
-I love you!
-Where to?
-Move!
-It's because I love you!
Dave, please.
This is a private beach.
-I want to talk to you.
-I don't want to talk to you.
Are you drunk?
No, but that's not a bad idea.
-Why, David?
-Why what?
Drunk?
No.
Why last night?
That's what I came to explain to you.
Okay, good.
I think we should understand each other.
I'm not very happy with you.
That's fair enough.
Whatever it was, you could have called me.
No, I couldn't.
Why not?
I couldn't tell you the truth last night.
I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.
Now, why do you have to say that?
I just didn't want to take a chance she'd try it again.
What if she does?
I swear to you, if she ever tries it I'd just let her go right on ahead.
God!
Oh, my God.
What in the...
Oh, God, help me!
Please, somebody, help me!
Help me, somebody!
Oh, God, help me!
-Stay back, buddy.
-I live here, man.
Is she your housecleaning lady, Garver?
Okay, boys, let's take her out.
Watch your step.
It's gonna cost you double to clean up this mess.
Watch your step.
-Dave Garver?
-Yeah.
I'm Sgt. McCallum.
Any ideas?
About what?
About your girlfriend in there.
That's not my girlfriend.
Let me get that straight right in front.
More or less a casual acquaintance, you'd say?
That's right.
You're saying she came by to hack up your wardrobe and your cleaning lady?
I'm not trying to tell you anything, Sergeant.
Maybe you ought to.
The lady almost got herself killed.
And I'm stumbling around in my stupid way trying to find out why.
What'll you have?
This Evelyn Draper, where does she come from?
I don't know.
-What about her family?
-I don't know that either.
She just listens to my radio show, and we met one night.
That's all.
-Practically a stranger.
-That's right.
Then how does she happen to have a key to your front door?
I don't know that either.
It boils down to, you don't know a hell of a lot, do you?
What it boils down to is, I'm getting sick of your questions.
And so am I!
But they get upset with me down at the store if I don't ask them.
-Just take her through.
I'll be right along.
-Right.
-Take her through what?
-Booking.
What she really needs is psychiatric help.
Really?
Now, look, those cuts on her wrists...
Don't know anything about those.
There's one other thing.
I know, "Don't leave town."
I was gonna say, "Why don't you play some Mantovani sometime?"
Didn't know you liked the show.
I don't.
I like Mantovani.
Go ahead, play!
All right!
Those ofyou who may have played brass instruments you know that was triple-tonguin', baby.
Let's give his tongue a nice handl
He mightjust be the fastest tongue in the Westl
-Come on.
-All right, I'm coming.
What do you say...
-Something to eat?
-I've got to pick up my roommate, Annabel.
-Madalyn's your roommate.
-I found my man, and I'm moving out.
-And Annabel's moving in.
-Right.
-'Bye.
-Ciao.
See you later.
Thank you.
Thank you very kindly.
That was the Cannonball Adderley Group.
They're playing at the Monterey Jazz Festival with Duke Ellington, Woody Herman, Joe Williams and many others.
Still got tickets for Sunday.
So get on out there because that's where it's happening.
Now we're gonna hear from the Gator Creek Organization and Feelin' Fine.
KRML.
Dave Garver.
Hello.
Play Misty for me.
David?
I didn't mean to shake you up.
I'm sorry.
Pretty stupid of me.
I've been released.
Therapy.
It was a bad dream, butit's over.
-Where are you?
-The airport.
San Francisco.
I've only got a minute between planes.
-Got ajob in Hawaii.
-You're all right then?
Fine, David.
Fine.
I just want to say how sorry I am about everything.
-Forget it.
I have.
-I hope so.
"Because this maiden she lived with no other thought
"Than to love and be loved by you."
Are you near a radio?
No.
But play it for me anyway.
Hello.
-Garver?
-Yeah.
Sgt. McCallum.
Sorry to wake you butsomething's come up.
I know.
She just paid me a visit with a butcher knife.
Why?
Because she was released on parole pending further legal action.
When?
A week ago.
I sure like the way you broke your ass to let me know!
-I just found out about it myself.
-Who's in charge down there anyway?
Now, look.
Do you want to help find her or would you rather just sit there and bellyache?
-All right.
-Good.
Now exactly what did she say to you?
I told you.
She said that she was well and that she was going to Hawaii.
What else?
-I already told you.
-Tell me again.
You know, you really make lousy conversation.
You make lousy coffee.
Come on, what else did she say?
Nothing, except...
-Except what?
-It was nothing.
It was a line from a poem.
-What poem?
-If I knew that, I'd know the line.
-Try to remember.
-You know, McCallum, it's getting late.
You're sounding very monotonous.
You're not exactly my idea of a swinging date either.
Good night, McCallum.
-What happened to the Mantovani?
-The what?
I heard the show, but I never did hear you play Mantovani.
You really did listen to the show?
Friend, if we had a TV down at the station I'd break my arm before I turned your show on.
Thanks a lot.
Just hope we're lucky enough to grab her the next time she tries it.
Tries what?
To kill you.
Yeah.
And if you're not lucky enough?
That'd be hell.
The guys down at the station would have to chip in and buy a TV.
You're a great comfort, Sergeant.
You will change the locks?
Hi.
Nothing like a nice brisk walk in the woods to put roses on a girl's cheeks.
How are you?
Not so good, honey.
-She's back.
-Who?
Evelyn Draper, the girl who tried to kill Birdie.
How can she be back?
I thought they'd put her in a state sanitarium.
-They did, but they let her out.
-Does that mean she's all right?
Theoretically.
What happens now?
I think you and I ought to stay away from each other for a couple of days just in case she's tagging after me.
She's already following you, isn't she?
I don't want you to worry about it.
I can handle myself.
Yeah.
So could Birdie.
All right then, you stand by.
They're all set to trace the call.
When she phones, just mention her by name right away, Evelyn and they start to trace her.
All you gotta do after that is just keep her talking.
Fifteen minutes before the hour here at KRML and here's It's Not Unusual.
I guess it hasn't come to you yet.
-What?
-What she said.
Over the phone last night?
Part of a poem or something.
You were gonna try to remember.
I thought I had that, but I've forgotten.
Is it that important?
Until we pick her up, everything's important.
What's wrong?
I'm worried about my girlfriend with all this going on.
They're so damn isolated down there.
I'm thinking the best thing to do is just have Al Monte sub for me.
The only chance we've got is when she phones in here tonight.
You've got to be here, right on that mike.
-If she phones.
-She will.
Believe me.
But only if you're here.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
If it'll make you feel better, I'll go over and check your girlfriend's house myself.
I'd sure appreciate that.
She lives on Spindrift Road.
I think it's the fourth or fifth house down.
-"Williams" is on the mailbox.
-Why don't you phone her?
-Okay.
-Tell her to be expecting me.
McCallum.
Thanks.
Public servant.
-Hello?
-Hi.
I'mjust checking in.
You all right?
Marvelous.
I'm just getting ready to do my nails and I got your program on.
And Annabel's in the kitchen making a couple of coffee grogs.
What more could a girl ask for?
No, honey, everything's fine.
There's a Sgt. McCallum that's gonna drop by for a second to see if you've buttoned up all right.
Let him in, but nobody else.
Okay.
David, you want to play something soft and dreamy for us?
You gotit.
Bye-bye.
'Bye, hon.
-Annabel, how's that stuff coming?
-Here's something soft and sentimental for Tobie and Annabel.
Hope you like cinnamon in yours.
Whatever's right.
Annabel.
Good?
Too much.
-So is this.
-Thank you.
Just one thing.
Do you mind?
No, be my guest.
The eyes are wrong.
David's are more...
How shall I say?
Colder.
I didn't know you knew David.
I didn't realize you and David were friends.
Friends?
No, not friends.
Not friends.
God, you're dumb.
"Because this maiden she lived with no other thought
"Than to love and be loved by you."
-Tobie?
-We're waiting foryou, David.
This is Dave Garver with a little verse a little talk and five hours of music to be very, very nice to each other by.
Careful.
Careful.
I might put your eye out.
I'll bet David loves your eyes.
And your hair.
Does he run his fingers through your hair?
Have to get you all nice for David.
For David.
I hope he likes what he sees when he walks in here because that's what he's taking to hell with him.
Miss Williams?
McCallum?
And now we have a pretty one forlonely lovers on a cool, cool night.
It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty.
And this one is especially for Evelyn.
Play Misty for me.
Misty, huh?
Don't you like me?
Stop it, you dirty bastard!
You're a very nice girl.
But who needs nice girls?
Yeah, get lost, asshole!
I never said anything about not coming back for seconds.
Don't spoil my fun, darling.
I love to give you things.
I just want to say how sorry I am about everything.
The thing I hate the most in the whole world is a jealous female.
It's that other bitch, isn't it?
Why didn't you take my call?
Thank you, David.
You're not helping me, buster blue-eyes!
Get off my back, Evelyn!
Bye!
Will I see you tomorrow?
Aren't you going to play Misty for me?
First time I thought about being a director was way after I'd become an actor.
I think it was when I was doing Rawhide and I had had some discussions with the producers at that time to direct an episode or so.
That didn't pan out for one reason or another.
So I did some second-unit stuff and little bits and pieces here and there.
I think Don Siegel was probably my biggest sponsor of the idea of directing films.
I had worked with him on quite a few films and we enjoyed the collaboration very much.
When I went to him in 1970 and told him that I had this little project that I wanted to direct he said, "By all means.
Let me support you on that.
"Let me sign your Directors' Guild of America card," and all that sort of thing.
It was a great period of my life, because it started another segment.
It was a very experimental time for me.
I was going off and doing a Paint Your Wagon, kind of, musical thing up in Oregon and then coming back and doing Beguiled, and then Misty.
Beguiled not being a particularly commercial success to follow it with Misty...
The logical thing would have been to do an adventure film Dirty Harry or something, but that didn't work out that way.
Jo Heims was a girl that I'd known for many, many years.
She was a legal secretary.
She'd say, "I'm going to be a screenwriter some day."
I'd say, "Yeah, I'm an actor, and I'm studying acting," what have you.
One day, some years later, she came up with a treatment called Play Misty for Me.
I liked the Alfred Hitchcock, kind of thriller aspect but the main thing I liked about it was, beyond that, the story was very real.
The story was believable, because these kind of commitments or misinterpreting thereof, go on all the time.
Jo Heims had a female friend that was very much a stalker type and she didn't commit homicide, or anything like that but she went around and completely harassed this person that she knew very slightly.
It was a great statement on stalking.
Nobody had ever thought much about that in those days, 1970.
And that's something I hadn't seen in suspense films in general.
So I optioned the treatment from her.
Told her that I'd want to get around to it some day and then later on, I was working on a film in Europe and Jo called me up and she said:
"If you're not going to make that picture...
"...
I've got an opportunity to sell it to Universal...
"...and they're offering me good dough, and I really need it."
So, because I was occupied at the time, I said, "I can't hold you back...
"...from making some good money, so you go ahead and sell it."
Clint Eastwood, hero for hire.
Blazes his way across a land of lust and injustice.
Later on, I had a three-picture deal with Universal and became very tied in with them, so I went to Lew Wasserman, and I said:
"You've got this little project," and I said, "I want to do it, and I'll be in it."
And I said, "I'd also like to direct it."
And without missing a beat, Lew looked across the desk and said:
"That's fine.
That's very good."
So I said, "Boy, that was easy."
So I got up to leave, and I started walking down the hallway, and my agent Lenny Hirshan, was with me, and I said to him, "Boy, that was easy."
And all of a sudden I heard behind him:
"Lenny, can we talk to you a minute?"
So they called him back, and they said:
"Yeah, we don't mind clint directing this film.
"We just don't want to pay him."
"We don't want to pay him his regular three-picture deal.
"We want to pay him less." Lenny came back later and said:
"What do you think?" And I said, "Fine, I'll do it for nothing.
"They're smart not to pay me.
They should make me show my stuff."
Lenny said, "Let me go back and get just a percentage...
"...of the gross profits and we won't ask for anything."
And I said, "That's fine by me."
Turned out to be a good choice, but I would have done it for nothing.
I think most people who really want to do something badly will do that.
So I think they were saying:
"We'll let him go ahead and make this little film...
"...and then he'll go back and he'll do some big adventure for us...
"...and it doesn't matter."
I think they were somewhat placating me at the time.
Clint and I had known each other for many years.
We had lived in the same apartment complex.
When he was first getting started, we had worked in the same lot Universal International, it was called then.
We discussed the business back and forth, and we used to say:
"Maybe some day we can make our own movies."
Of course, his career took off very quickly and he asked me, "Why don't we get together?
Come to work at Malpaso."
And I'd been there just a few weeks when he brought me this script.
He was shooting Beguiled at the time with Don Siegel.
He said, "See what you think about it."
So I read it.
I loved it, identified.
And he said, "I'd like to do this next."
And I said, "You are thinking of directing it, aren't you?"
And he was kind of a little shy to say yes about it.
But I said, "No, you've got a handle on it."
He had spent all those seven and a half years on Rawhide not just doing his part and going home.
He had been watching what went on, on the set been learning the trade from behind the camera.
So I thought, "This is your chance."
Jo Heims was the one who wrote the original story and then she and Dean Riesner cooperated on the screenplay.
Dean Riesner was a writer I'd worked with before with Don.
I'd met him through Don.
We worked on coogan's Bluff and a couple of projects.
He was very good.
He told me the story of Misty and of course I was thrilled.
I was delighted, and he indicated that he'd like me to do it.
But he had his definite ideas about the way he wanted to do it.
He cleaned up some of the set-ups at the beginning.
He had the perspective of the part that I was playing, of Dave keeping his outlook, at the same time, not losing the characters of the girls.
This particular story it seemed very true to me.
It seemed very real.
I liked that quality that it had.
It started off gently, and then it built beautifully, I thought.
Play Misty for me.
I was looking for somebody who could play this role and was attractive but at the same time had sort of a quirky side to them and that's Jessica.
She's certainly a terrific gal, terrific actress.
I had actually just moved to California.
I'd done several movies in New York a lot of television in New York, a lot of theater.
I had been in a film Sidney Lumet directed, wonderful movie, called The Group.
And she played a gal.
And they had a lot of girls wonderful parts in there for women.
She had a smaller part, but it was very, very effective.
He had looked at that film for another actress.
There were eight actresses in that movie.
The Group was comprised of eight women.
He had seen me in the movie.
There was one scene in there where she's been flirting with this ski instructor and he finally gets annoyed.
He slapped her.
And the look on her face, it was just something, and I said:
"Yeah, that's the person.
That's the person I want."
And I learned a very good lesson:
Never to show The Group to anybody because there were too many good actresses in that movie.
But that's how he came to call me.
The studio, of course, wanted a name.
They wanted Lee Remick and various other people they had mentioned.
But when Jessica came in the office, I took one look at her and I said:
"Do you wanna do this film?" She says, "You bet!" and I said, "Okay."
And I was most pleasantly surprised when I met him for the first time because he was totally un-moviestar-like.
Anybody who knows him will tell you he's very laid back very quiet, soft-spoken.
I was very impressed with him at the first meeting I had, which was long.
He was drinking carrot juice.
This was before health foods were really popular, you know.
I thought, "Oh, my God!"
He offered me some, and of course, I politely said, "No, thanks."
But I liked him immediately.
You can't not like him.
I was looking for somebody who just had that zip.
Something like the old-time actresses used to have.
Any of those actresses that came up in the '40s they had all that kind of edge to them.
In 1970, there wasn't a lot of that.
We were in an era where women's roles were really secondary to the male leads in the film.
Most of them were the girl next door, very little depth to them.
I thought that this is one of the best roles for a woman to be a villain in a film, which wasn't being done at that time.
It was a very interesting time for me, right before I got Misty.
I was doing a soap opera in New York, and I had told them I was leaving.
They wanted me to sign, and I said:
"No, I've been there three years.
It's enough.
I really wanna go."
I had come out, as part of my contract on that to do a night-time television show, and it was a day in August.
I was talking to Burt Reynolds.
I said, "I'm looking for a girl...
"...who's got a certain look, but also has some character."
And he said, "I just worked with this girl on a television episode...
"...and she was really good."
Two weeks later, I got a call from my agent saying:
"You got a movie!" I said, "Really?
How?"
He said, "They just wanna hire you.
It's a movie with clint Eastwood."
I liked her right away.
She was another one that I made a very quick decision on.
Burt Reynolds showed him the dailies.
He hired me right from that.
I never met him, never read for him, never auditioned, tested, nothing.
I thought she'd be a good contrast to Jessica, a good contrast to what was going on between them as opposed to what was going on between his relationship with Jessica's role of Evelyn.
And I finished the soap opera on a Friday, came here wardrobed on Saturday and Sunday and went up to Carmel and started shooting Monday morning.
And I'd never met Clint until the night before.
We met in the bar just to say hello.
You always try to hire the best people.
If they're well known, then it works fine.
If they're not, you hire 'em anyway because they're the best for that particular part.
I'm Sergeant Mccallum.
John Larch, a very good actor who I knew and had played golf with.
This is Sweet Al Monte saying, "Hang in there...
"...because everything is going to be everything!"
Jim McEachin was a guy who I thought had a lot of character who would be an interesting co-disc jockey.
Mr. Garver, Madge Brenner.
The other people that came along were just all the very best for that particular part.
Let's try to show a little class, shall we?
Mr. Garver's residence.
Directing and acting wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be on Misty.
I had seen it done before many times.
There are many precedents for it:
Everybody from Orson Welles and Laurence Olivier and all the people who had tried it, some of them quite successfully.
After a while, I got so you could throw the switch a little bit.
Don kept on me all the time about, "Don't slough yourself.
"The big temptation is going to be to spend all the time...
"...with the other actors and then slough your own performance."
So I had to be careful, and I always remembered those words.
That's the one thing you have to be mindful of.
And as I've done it now over the years, it's been 30 years since I still, once in a while, remind myself, "Take your time.
"Don't want to move on to the next thing...
"...because you've got everybody else covered."
I was a bit nervous about him directing because this was the first thing he had directed and actors directing isn't always the best idea.
They generally have not a great reputation as far as doing movies, and things like that.
He was intimidating, but I knew from the first day of shooting that he was a director who knew exactly what he wanted exactly how to get it.
He had everything totally planned and made me feel very comfortable, because no matter what we were doing he'd look at me, too, and he'd say, "Did you like that?
Is that okay?"
I'd say, "Yeah, okay."
I never thought once about the fact that he would be both starring in the movie and directing it.
It never occurred to me that there was anything wrong with it.
Actually, it was a nice match because he doesn't like to do too many takes and I don't, either.
So usually we only did one or two, maybe three takes on a shot.
We had the same feeling about not over-rehearsing.
It was a good match, I think.
We wanted to be away from the studio because there's a certain spirit in the crew when you're on location.
It's like an army in the field, no matter where you go.
But especially Carmel, which was so photogenic and really lent itself to the story beautifully.
And Clint knew it, which was a great advantage because we didn't have to scout.
He'd say, "I can shoot this here."
It seemed to me that it would be a smaller location.
It would be much more of a disc jockey being a big fish in a small pond rather than LA, where there's hundreds of stations and many disc jockeys and so forth.
So I knew a guy here who worked for a local station, who was sort of like this guy.
He was very, very popular, and he was kind of a well known celebrity just being a well known disc jockey in the area.
It could have worked in any small town.
I could have made it in any small town in America.
But it seemed, because I knew this one, I picked this one.
And it also allowed me the chance to work at home.
David, my man!
His home in the film belonged to Malcolm, I can't think of Malcolm's last name who lived in that house where clint's character lived and who ran a little art store where they made sculptures in which we shot, where Donna Mills was working.
And he knew the house on the cliff, the restaurants.
They all knew him, even though he wasn't mayor yet for many years.
He was like the unofficial mayor of the town.
Everybody cooperated.
We had great cooperation.
It was a small picture.
It didn't cost very much.
I think the direct costs on the film were $700,000 or $725,000 or something less any overhead.
That was, even in those days, still considered very modest.
In those days, it was very unusual to have every shot in a movie especially an under-$1-million-budget movie be on the location.
He was adamant that it be done this way.
Nothing fake:
No makeup, no process shots no studio shots.
I think it shows.
It's very European in that way.
I didn't want it to look like a television show even though nowadays, if I was shooting it for television I'd shoot it the same way.
It was done all on natural sets.
There were no sets built for it.
Very limited art direction.
Most everything was just done by everybody on the crew pitching in.
This is Dave Garver with a little verse, a little talk and five hours of music to be very, very nice to each other by.
I never had any idea of presentation except that I had guest disc-jockeyed a few times in my life and I figured he was a jazz disc jockey, so he was probably not mainstream pop with the AM mania, quick-talking, like that, kind of guy.
Jazz disc jockeys are more cool, a little more laid back.
Johnny Adams was the local disc jockey at KRML, the station we used.
He was very quiet-talking, very smooth-talking, very conversational.
KRML, Dave Garver speaking.
Hello?
Hi, what'll it be?
Play Misty for me.
Misty, huh?
We have that right on the play rack.
Play Misty for Me was the original title.
I always thought it was great because Misty was a classic song that had spanned quite a few generations.
It spanned the '60s, '70s, '80s and it's continued on being popular today.
The studio suggested, "How about using a song that Universal owns...
"...
like Strangers in the Night?" and I said:
"What, like, Play Strangers in the Night for Me?"
I said, "That's been used in a film very recent to that."
And they said, "At the end of Strangers in the Night...
"...he says, 'Scooby-Dooby-Doo."'
And I said, "How about Play Scooby-Dooby-Doo for Me?"
Right then, I said, "You know, this conversation's coming to an end."
So we bought the song Misty, which cost $25,000 which was a lot of money then, from Erroll Garner.
I think it was important to keep a classic song that everybody knew and not to sort of whore out and decide that because the studio owned that particular piece was not my idea of something to do.
We wanted to add strings to it, and at that particular time Garner was alive, and so we made the deal to cover him coming back, playing the tune and then adding in strings, and making it a little bit different version than he was playing on the radio, which was a record which only had Erroll Garner, with brushes and bass.
Dee, I'd known a long time.
He hadn't done a lot of movie scores, but he was a band leader in Los Angeles.
I needed somebody that was affordable, because I was on a very limited budget and I wanted somebody who was young and energetic and would bring maybe a newer shot to it rather than using the same people that had been doing these kind of movies over and over.
Hi, Murphy.
Hi, Dave.
No messages for you.
He had worked with Don two or three films before that.
We felt, "Well, this might be a good idea...
"...in case clint needs a little backup.
We'll start with Don...
"...who's a director, and with clint, who's going to be a director...
"...and Don, who's going to be an actor, and Clint, who is an actor."
There was nothing to worry about.
Clint just immediately took charge.
He thought I was crazy doing it.
He says, "Why aren't you hiring a really good, competent actor?"
I said, "This'll be a great experience for you, Don.
"You've been on this side of the camera but not on the other side.
"It'll make you more sympathetic to actors' problems...
"...and also, it gives me an opportunity to have you there."
I said, "What happens if I fall on my face?
I've got you...
"...and everybody'll feel happy about that."
So he came and did it.
He was so nervous.
He would've been no help if I'd asked him any pointers anyway because he was so intense about trying to get this role so worried about every line.
Finally, I made him throw away pieces of script and improvise a lot of it.
Thanks for the plug.
What are friends for?
Bartender?
Coke?
Coming right up.
I thought she should look terribly average, in an average mode of dress.
In those days it was the mini-skirts with the boots little jacket, a little blouse.
Not fancy at all.
I think my clothing budget was probably $300 for the whole thing which would have been $600 in those days.
No money was spent on clothing, and not on makeup because Clint doesn't like makeup.
He would say, "I don't want that shot-out-of-a-cannon Universal look."
Because in those days, the makeup was so thick, and fake eyelashes and he really stuck to it.
You know, I tried to sneak on makeup and he'd give me one of those looks so I'd wash it off.
One game?
Cry Bastion?
What else?
Okay, coach.
The bartender was based from the bartender that I knew, named Murphy.
So I thought it'd be fun to play the game that was called Cry Bastion that Murphy used to play.
Cry Bastion was just a fake game.
They'd set up a lot of bottle tops on the bar and they'd yell, "Cry Bastion!" And move the bottle tops and people would watch, and say, "No, no, no!"
Palfrey's Gambit.
Dirty rat.
And so we just set it up and played it, and I just told Don, I said:
"The game doesn't make sense.
It's a ploy to get the interest...
"...of somebody who's sitting down the way.
"So just make it up as you go." So we kind of made it up.
At the beginning, he took his script and he clipped it all, and he had little pieces stuck in various areas so he thought he could go read the lines real quick.
Cry Bastion!
I said, "Don, you can't do that.
In the first place, your eyesight isn't...
"You're sitting there, looking, staring at something, it looks kind of odd.
"Just say anything."
Nice game.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
What happened?
I won.
How?
When?
When you said, "Okay."
I oughta be mad.
There's a big trap when you play someone who's crazy and that's to play them like they're crazy.
I played her as if she were the all-American girl next door.
It was that simple.
I never thought of her as crazy.
It's important that she be a seemingly normal person or else there's no fun in discovering that she's not.
The studio suggested, "Why don't we show her as an escapee...
"...from a mental institution or something?"
I said, "If you know she's a mental case, then there's no mystery to the story."
It would be much more frightening psychologically if you didn't know where she was coming from.
So we didn't start it off that way because I think that would have given the whole thing away.
As a matter of fact, we changed certain things in the original script.
When they met at the bar, and he asked, "What do you want?"
The original was, "I'll have a vodka stinger" or something and I said, "No, no, no.
We shouldn't have any kind of allusions...
"...to the fact that she might be going off the deep end or something."
Care for a drink?
Okay.
- What'll it be?
- Surprise me.
And then, there was another scene, where she comes to the door of his place.
What do you want, Evelyn?
One coke?
That was originally, "Can I have a drink?"
But I didn't want her to be a drinker, a smoker.
I wanted her to be just as pure as the driven snow.
Don't you like me?
You're a very nice girl.
Everything seemed kind of idyllic, until little things start springing up.
Slowly, we get the clues that there's something odd there.
How'd you like to go screw yourself?
Hey, take it easy.
She gets all kind of wrapped up in being coquettish, very child-like and the other times, she goes into madness and the other times, she's very sexual or sensual.
All those three things are very typical of schizophrenia.
Surprise!
I had a very simple through-line.
She had to have this man or die.
And everything came off that.
The objectives of every scene, why she did what she did the logic of what she did was to save her life.
Because if she didn't have him, she would die.
Bye!
See you later!
I never thought of Misty as a horror movie.
I thought of it as a very intense love story.
That's my character's point of view, but that's how I thought of it.
I think every actor has to like the person that they're playing.
There's gotta be something about even the worst people in the world that is good about them, and you have to find that in the person because you have to play the vulnerability.
You don't have to come over, if you've got something to do.
That's all right.
I'll be over in a little while.
You and I are going to have to have a talk.
Actually, we suggested to do which Fatal Attraction did when they remade the film or came close to remaking it, was to make him a guy who maybe was married or something.
Then I thought, "No, because...
"...obviously there's a big problem there, because then he's philandering, etc."
This way, he doesn't really have any commitments.
He's got this girlfriend he'd like to reconcile with but basically, he's a free guy and how does a free guy get manipulated like that?
That's what makes it interesting.
Let me come over.
If I could just see you, just talk to you.
No, Evelyn.
But I love you, David, I love you.
I really give Clint credit for a lot of things that made me look good in that movie.
I don't care how many ways you say it!
It's not true!
- What do I have to do to convince you?
- No, it's not true!
Let me just wash my face.
I remember in the suicide, when she's in the bathroom when I drop down slowly to the floor and you see the wrists are all bloody that's all him, I can't take credit for any of that.
The scene in the bed where she wakes up screaming from a nightmare after she's tried to kill herself...
Take it easy!
I had a dream, I was drowning in the ocean.
The way he shot that, and the camera then goes in to him and you see him, and he's trapped.
That's where she's using every tool, including not only the threat of suicide but the attempt of suicide.
And she's got him completely under her thumb now and we pull back and we pull back and the whole idea was that he's just a trapped animal.
He can't do anything.
The big question when I started to make this film because I was associated with action films, especially in the '60s and the studio seemed to think I had some obligation to be a person who was infallible kind of indestructible, maybe.
I said, "That's not this movie."
This movie is a person who, regardless of his physical strength is totally at the mercy of the manipulations of this particular person.
Isn't this nice?
Just us here together.
A wonderful thing about Clint as a director was the fact that he would go with you if you improvised a little bit.
Is that your idea of a dish?
My God, she's a little old for you, isn't she?
I remember, in the scene where I find him in a restaurant...
She couldn't get laid in a lumber camp!
...and I scream at her, and he throws me into a taxicab.
She's nothing!
Nothing!
We couldn't even loop.
We had to do looping on a lot of scenes.
We couldn't loop the scene where I'm in the taxi screaming:
"I only did it because I love you!" etc., because it was so crazy.
- Please, I did it because I love you!
- Where to?
Don't you understand?
When it came to looping, I said, "I don't think I can do that."
Because I couldn't follow, nobody could follow it.
He said, "Okay, then we won't."
That kind of going with the artistic choice rather than the technical.
I'm not very happy with you.
Oh, God!
I always saw her as somebody who screamed.
I mean, I've never killed anybody, so I don't know what it must be like.
I should think it's a huge release, which includes screaming.
We certainly looped a lot of screams into that movie.
And I learned how to handle a knife.
There's a way Clint taught me.
You have to hold it like this and then twist it so it catches the light.
It looks so scary and eerie that way.
When we did the scene of hacking up the maid he wanted blood.
And this darling make-up artist that I loved, Jack Freeman brought little Visine bottles of blood.
And Clint said: "No, you don't understand.
I want buckets!"
And sure enough, Jack went and got more blood in pails.
Splashed them all over the walls.
He went all the way!
Please, somebody!
Oh, God, help me!
What she really needs is psychiatric help.
Really?
I need a couple more days to try and figure out where I'm at.
I wanted to do a nice idyllic scene where he was reconciling with the girlfriend Donna Mills' character.
I heard the Roberta Flack song on the radio coming to work one day and I said:
"Yeah, this tells the story.
"If I could buy that..." I had a little problem buying it but we finally got it.
He brought me into his trailer, and he said: "I want you to hear a song.
"I want to do a montage sequence to this song, I just heard it on the radio...
"...and I bought it."
He played it for me and I went, "Wow."
I mean, it's the most beautiful song I've ever heard.
He said, "I want to do this beautiful sequence.
"There's going to be some nudity in it.
Can you handle that?"
I said, "Oh, God.
"What's my mother going to say?"
I was nervous about it.
He said, "I'll tell you what.
"I'll let you see it after it's cut and everything.
"If there's anything in it that you find offensive or don't like, I'll take it out."
I said, "Okay."
I was nervous shooting it.
More than anything, I was cold.
So that's how it came about.
He found the song he conceived the montage to it and then it went into the movie.
It was like an organic thing that he needed to put in there that he really felt strongly about.
He worked very hard on that montage.
And I thought it was one of the most beautiful pieces of film I'd ever seen.
At the time, strangely enough, a lot of people didn't like it.
They felt that it was intrusive.
Not that they didn't like the sequence.
They felt that it kind of came in the middle of the movie.
Then the movie went on again.
I think Clint really knew what he was doing by putting it there to kind of ease the tension, and then start it again.
At the jazz festival that day, we shot 30,000 feet of film.
We had cameramen all over.
We said, "Grab anything you can."
That wasn't a crowd of extras, you know, all set up and stuff.
We just went in with a bare crew, sound and camera, no lights, nothing and shot it.
And that, again, is a precursor to the way things are shot because at that time, nothing was shot that way.
Now they shoot television things that way, but they didn't then.
I thought it was really inventive and really good.
It took a huge amount of editing.
Carl Pingitore, the editor, had his work cut out for him culling that down, and making it into a workable montage.
But this was strictly clint's idea and his creation.
The big problem I had was how to hide from the audience who are much smarter than most people give them credit for the fact that Evelyn is going to move in with the Donna Mills character.
How do I hide that?
If we go ahead and have a scene where Donna Mills starts talking about the roommate.
Then right away, people would get the sense of something.
I kind of buried it in the jazz festival.
I've got to pick up my roommate, Annabel.
Madalyn's your roommate.
I found my man and I'm moving out.
- And Annabel's moving in.
- Right.
I didn't want to hammer it home so everybody goes, "Here comes the roommate."
So it does come as a surprise.
At least for most of us, I think it did.
That was the cannonball Adderley group now at the Monterey Jazz Festival...
Camera moves are fine but sometimes stillness can be very effective.
I could have come around, I suppose slid around and pivoted on the blinking phone in the foreground and everybody'd go, "The blinking phone," and what have you.
This way, it's just there.
Keep it very quiet and calm, and later on you can move around as things get more radical.
Hello?
Play Misty for me.
You also don't want to give away what's going on.
I guess I could have done it from behind somebody's hand or something walking across a room and gone in to his face.
Right away, you know something's going to happen.
I didn't want that, I just wanted him sleeping.
The idea is, you don't know if he's dreaming and then he looks up and bam, she's there.
I hope we're lucky enough to grab her next time she tries it.
Tries what?
To kill you.
You and I ought to stay away from each other for a couple of days.
She's already following you, isn't she?
I don't want you to worry.
I can handle myself.
Annabel, how's that stuff coming?
Hope you like cinnamon in yours.
Working with Jessica Walter was wonderful.
She's a wonderful actress.
I met her probably the second or third day of shooting.
Actually, we became very good friends and I lived in her guest house when I came down to Los Angeles because I didn't have a place to live.
She offered me her guest house to live in.
The eyes are wrong.
David's are more how shall I say colder.
She's a very precise actress.
Very strong, so that you never felt wishy-washy with her.
You always knew exactly what was going to be done, how it was going to be done.
God, you're dumb.
The funny thing is, off screen, we were running around together and seeing all of the sights and things like that.
And on screen, she was cutting off my hair and trying to kill me.
- Tobie.
- We're waiting for you, David.
The painting was done by a local artist, a guy named Don Heitkotter.
I think he's up in San Jose now, but he was here at the time.
He just volunteered to do it.
He said, "Will you give me a credit on the screen?"
I said: "Fine.
The only trouble is this is a movie...
"...so I need three or four copies...
"...of this one she tears up."
I was just trying to keep the intensity of him coming in there and meanwhile, she's killing him, in a visual way, with the painting.
So I made a lot of different angles of her cutting.
And I did a lot of equally different angles of my character driving down the highway.
So I had a lot of variety, so I don't come back to the same shot, back and forth.
It's different each time, so it's somewhat disorienting but, in a way, it keeps the audience on their toes.
What's happened to the other girl, nobody knows yet.
We haven't cut to that.
We just see her at the painting.
Maybe she's killed her, too.
Maybe not.
We don't know.
So we keep that in the offing.
Careful.
What I had to do to poor Donna, cutting her hair and menacing her.
Careful.
The poor girl.
Does he run his fingers through your hair?
I was wearing a wig because I didn't want them to cut my hair.
Have to get you all nice for David.
But it was still scary because they were huge scissors and she was very close to my face.
I hope he likes what he sees when he walks in here.
I didn't realize, when we were shooting it, how scary it was going to be...
Because that's what he's taking to hell with him.
...until I saw the movie.
He's a master at setting up that kind of suspense.
I think that was the most exhausting sequence in the movie.
Many, many days on that.
But of course, when you're acting and you're enjoying what you're doing, you could go on forever.
Clint is always prepared.
He always knows what's going to happen.
It was very carefully blocked, and it was carefully plotted out.
It was tiring but it's an exhilarating kind of tiring.
I like not seeing things specifically and the night offers you a way to do that.
You get little excerpts of things and you can also use sound effects.
Things like that puts everybody ill at ease.
I was kind of winging a lot of things.
I had a definite plan in mind but by the same token, I'm not averse to altering that plan or embellishing that plan as I'm filming.
And because I move rather quickly, I get my motor going and I also get the motor going of all the members of the crew and everybody starts giving you good input and good things happen.
You've heard about people in institutions where you get a person that's crazy has sometimes a tremendous amount of strength.
Here's this crazy person who's got a kitchen knife.
She's already committed homicide.
She's already gone way over the top so it's going to be a desperation move.
I wasn't playing a violent character like some of the other movies.
This guy's a disc jockey.
He's never been in a situation like this.
So he's kind of desperate about his girlfriend and about himself.
There was quite a bit of discussion about clint hitting a woman and knocking her through the window.
As Clint said, "By that time...
"...anybody is going to want to knock her through the window."
In the original story the detective is stabbed, but not killed by Evelyn so at the ending of the story, he conveniently shoots Evelyn.
And that's the end of it.
Well, I wanted a little bigger thing, so we rented a house that's on a cliff down on the highlands here, south of Carmel someplace where it could all go over the top.
I thought the cliff and her and the sea and the playing of Misty would be quite dynamic rather than just having her shot and lying on the floor.
My stunt double, who was a wonderful stunt lady named Julie Johnson that I had actually worked with before.
She took the final punch at the end of the film.
That was a dummy that went all that way.
She went a little way and then the dummy went all the way.
Then when you see Evelyn lying in the water in the Pacific Ocean thirty degrees that was me.
It had a nice irony to it.
This woman's at the bottom of the cliff and he's walking off injured and wounded and the girlfriend's injured and wounded.
And this one is especially for Evelyn.
Everybody's trying to gather up what's left and here's this beautiful theme that comes on which is associated very romantically.
I was petrified going to the first sneak preview.
I don't like going to those anyway.
So we snuck in, in San Jose.
I put on a hat and glasses and disguised myself in a beard or what have you.
I went and sat in the audience.
I sat in behind all these teenage girls.
It was going along well and the first time there was a psychotic moment out of Evelyn these gals jumped out of their teeth.
How would you like to go screw yourself?
By then, I thought, "I think we're on the road to something here."
Don was very proud of it and he and John cassavettes came over.
John liked it a lot, too.
He thought it was great.
He said, "There's only one trouble with this movie.
"It doesn't have Hitchcock's name on it."
I said, "Really?" and he said, "Yeah, if his name was on it...
"...people would be giving this all kinds of things."
It opened up, among other places, at the Cinerama Dome Theatre in Hollywood.
They had a four week engagement there.
Each week, it would do a little bigger business than the week before.
But they were obligated by contract for a Christmas movie to come in.
I had gone down to see how the business was doing and the manager said, "I don't want to yank it out of here...
"...but I have no choice."
And the next week, the christmas movie came in and business dropped to one-fourth of what it had been with Misty.
He felt very bad and was very down about it.
But Misty was a big hit.
Even though some reviewers liked the film a lot...
A lot of them dismissed it, because as I'm always fond of saying not too many people were ready to accept me as an actor much less as a director.
I remember thinking, upon seeing Misty, it was pretty good.
It was really a very stirring, interesting, quirky movie.
The truth of the matter is as the years have gone on that movie seems better than it seemed initially.
And it's partly because it's such a unique movie.
I guess were seeing more stalkers in movies in the last decade or two than we did in those days.
But there's never been a movie that quite worked that sexual nexus in the same way as Play Misty.
But that's no reason we shouldn't sleep together tonight if we feel like it.
One thing I learned on the movie is, never to worry about Clint as a director.
Clint is, in my opinion the top director in the business today.
You hire him and you get the best direction, on schedule, on budget and it's highly creative and it's wonderful.
He would ask people whose judgment he trusted:
"What do you think of this?"
They would digest it all, but the final decision was always his.
He went by his basic instincts.
When it was over, I remember the last day, I really shed a few tears.
I did.
I remember saying to Clint, he had his pickup truck and he drove me back to the motel.
I had little tears in my eyes, "I'm so sorry it's over."
Because it really was a labor of love on everybody's part.
It seems as fresh today as it did then as scary today which is really saying something because there have been lots of scary movies.
There's been lots of things done with cameras and this and that and this is pretty basic.
But it's real, inventive and precise story telling that just makes it grow and then gets you.
I think it says that that's what lasts.
That's what keeps people riveted to their seats that kind of storytelling, and clint knows how to do it.
I've never done another movie like this one because I've never had another script that seemed to lay out logically.
I like doing departures, but if I had another script as good as that one that would fit in with me and my present day maturity I would certainly attempt it.
But it was a great time.
I haven't seen the picture in many years.
If I did, I'd probably say:
"I could do this a little different than that."
And I'm fond of saying that I'd probably really wreck it because whatever my thoughts were at that time were probably the proper ones.
If I did it now, I'd probably make it slicker, but it might not have the same energy.
Misty was very important in my life and I've directed a lot of films since then.
Maybe I wouldn't have done any if I hadn't taken that opportunity at that time.
We don't have a goddamn thing between us!
But I love you!
She's already following you, isn't she?
Don't leave me!
Because this maiden lived with no other thought than to love and be loved by you.
Play Misty for me.
Hey, hey, you're digging the master jock for solid rock Sweet Al Monte blasting, babies.
Being bold and pouring coal on KRML in quaint little Carmel-by-the-Sea.
We're next door to magnificent Monterey, home of the annual jazz festival.
Although it's four months away, you got to get your tickets because they're going fast and it can't last.
The time is 7:54 and there's a breeze of 50 degrees around your loving hips, and there's a taste of fog.
I say we got a bowl of soul, and if you think your heart can take it...
Now we're gonna wrap it up for the week, folks.
A brand-new release from the funk capital of the world, Squeeze Me.
Here he comes, the big "D" himself, Dave Garver.
And Dave is gonna bring you five hours of mellow groove.
In the meantime, this is Sweet Al Monte saying:
"Hang in there, babies, because everything is going to be everything."
'Bye.
What's that letter you got there?
Is that that Frisco gig?
Yeah.
All right, so what's happening?
They want the usual thing:
A biography, pictures.
Really?
Is that that Madge Brenner chick?
Yeah, she's the one putting it together.
In that case, David, you're in.
How do you figure that?
Now, David, come on, man.
Are you kidding?
She's a grandmother.
So when did that ever stop you?
You better get a move on.
I already played your theme.
Yeah, I heard it.
You're a real human being.
And you're on the air, baby.
All right.
"Men have destroyed the roads of wonder
"And their cities squat like black toads
"In the orchards of life nothing is clean or real
"Or as a girl, naked to love or be a man with"
This is Dave Garver with a little verse, a little talk and five hours of music to be very, very nice to each other by.
- KRML, Dave Garver speaking.
- Hello?
- Hi, what'll it be?
- Play Misty for me.
Misty?
We have that right on the play rack.
Thanks for calling.
I see you got your little Misty chick calling you again.
All righty.
- Swing along.
- You take it easy now.
See you in the a.m.
KRML, Dave Garver.
- Hi, Murphy.
- Hi, Dave.
No messages for you.
- No?
- Heard your show tonight.
It sure beats hell out of working for a living.
- Thanks for the plug.
- What are friends for?
- Bartender.
- Coke?
Coming right up.
She's waiting for someone.
You sure?
That's what she says.
Guys have been striking out all night.
One game?
- Cry Bastion?
- What else?
Okay, coach.
You asked for it.
Don't take all night.
Move.
Okay.
Move.
Palfrey's Gambit.
Dirty rat.
Are we playing Copenhagen rules?
Make it easy on yourself, Murph.
Cry Bastion.
Sorry, no Bastion.
Damn, I didn't see that.
It's too bad, Murphy.
Too bad.
- Careful now.
- That ought to do it.
Be really careful now.
Careful.
Hi.
He doesn't see it.
Yeah?
Cry Bastion.
Fool's ploy, my man.
Fool's ploy.
Care to play the winner?
I'll just watch.
- My name is Dave Garver.
- Evelyn Draper.
Sit down, Evelyn Draper?
Care for a drink?
Okay.
- What'll it be?
- Surprise me.
- Screwdriver.
- Nice game.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- What happened?
- I won.
How?
When?
When you said, "Okay."
I ought to be mad.
But you're not.
Not really.
It certainly was nice of you to bring me home, Mr. Garver?
That's right.
I don't think I've been stood up on a date since the ninth grade back in Albany.
Is something wrong?
No, I keep getting the feeling I know you from someplace.
- You do?
- Yeah.
Here.
Why don't you let me do that?
Oh, no.
That's all right.
I've got it.
Why don't you see if you can get the fire started?
All right.
There are some matches right next to it.
All right.
It's getting late.
You're sure I'm not keeping you up?
No.
I rarely get to bed before 3:00 a.m.
I didn't have a date tonight.
I went there because you talk about it on your program sometimes and I wanted to meet you.
I listen to you all the time.
I knew somebody was out there.
- You're making fun of me.
- No, I'm not.
- Say something else.
- Such as?
Play Misty for me?
Very good.
- You sure I'm not keeping you up?
- Don't you like me?
You're a very nice girl.
But who needs nice girls?
No, I like them.
I'm kind of hung up on one.
And you don't want to complicate your life.
- That's exactly right.
- Neither do I.
But that's no reason we shouldn't sleep together tonight if we feel like it.
Solid silicone.
Hi, David, my man!
How you been, baby?
See you got the joint cleaned up for once.
The Heavy digs it.
- Care for a beer?
- Not really.
I could go for something more uplifting, but not a brew, my man.
Beer is all we've got.
You're gonna have to ease on out.
I got a lot of work to do today.
You don't understand.
I've been sent here to get you.
By whom?
That old chick I go with.
What's her name?
- Carol?
- That's the one.
Girl thinks you've been working too hard.
She said we should get together tonight.
Who's this "we"?
Me, you, her and one of them hens that you can dig up.
There is a fantastic new Mexican place in Carmel called Susinos.
The albóndigas soup is unbelievable.
It is a mind-bender...
I know the joint, but I don't have a date, and I got a lot to do.
Big deal, man.
Get one!
If you have any problems getting one, I'll get one for you as nice as I look.
It's too late, and besides, I've got a lot of work to do.
But you gotta eat, David.
I'm gonna whip up something here in my own kitchen.
You know, David, I'm really worried about your social life.
You'll make someone a tremendous mother.
Too narrow in the pelvis.
I sure appreciate you dropping by, Al.
Come by again sometime, anytime.
Never let it be said that Sweet Al Monte can't take a hint.
- Who's hinting?
- Hi.
Why, hi there, yourself.
Dave Garver live here?
That depends on your point of view.
Hi.
This stuff weighs a ton.
Where's the kitchen?
Right inside.
Just come on in and help yourself.
Swing right around the bend there.
I know, David, she's from Chicken Delight.
Look, don't work too hard, my man.
Don't strain yourself.
How come you don't have any beer?
And what is this?
A shrunken head?
Does that guy live here?
- I wanted...
- I hope you like steak.
- You look like a steak-and-potatoes type.
- Hang on.
I said to myself, a nice salad with Roquefort and tomatoes and baked potato with...
- What's going on here?
- Don't send me away.
- No, I want to ask you a question.
I just wanted to surprise you.
Surprise?
What happens if he and I had been talking business?
Or maybe I have female company and you come traipsing in with groceries?
That would be some surprise.
I'm sorry.
Keep that stuff.
I think I've lost my appetite.
Hang on a minute.
I'm just trying to tell you something.
I don't understand.
Should I go or stay?
What?
I'm telling you there's a telephone, and I pick it up and I dial it.
You answer and I say, "What are you doing?"
And I say, "I'll be right over."
Fine.
Next time, why don't we do it that way?
Okay.
Any way you like.
Next time.
How do you like your steak?
Extremely rare.
That's just how I like mine.
Extremely rare.
I'll get some wine here.
A little vino.
Vino!
All this and heaven, too!
Terrific!
This is gonna be some dinner.
What happened to that discussion we had last time?
You know, the deal about no strings and all that?
There are no strings, but I never said anything about not coming back for seconds, did I?
That's right.
You didn't.
When will I see you?
I'll give you a call.
- Dave, you're funny.
- How's that?
If you want to keep playing these games, okay, but they're really not necessary anymore, not for me.
People are trying to sleep here!
People are trying to talk here!
- How'd you like to tell that to the law?
- How'd you like to go screw yourself?
Take it easy!
Guy's just trying to sleep, that's all.
You're right.
It's a terrific morning.
Why be selfish with it?
Bye-bye.
Wait a minute!
Yeah?
Excuse me, I saw the sweater, and I thought you were somebody else.
You must be David.
Where have you been?
Around.
I was trying to join the revolt against the representational.
Didn't quite make that though.
So now I'm just trying to play it cool.
Not quite making that either.
Got time for a break?
- Yeah.
- Let's go.
- When did you get in town?
- Yesterday.
- You weren't gonna call me?
- Of course I was.
I had to get settled first.
You shouldn't lend your sweaters to blabbermouths.
You've gotten thinner.
No!
Well, so much for Sausalito.
Sausalito?
That's where I was staying.
Jay Jay's place.
- Jay Jay's place?
- It's nothing much, really.
It's just a little pied-à-terre, but it's handy to the fleet.
You told me you didn't know where she was.
So I lied.
Picket me.
- Thanks a lot.
- Listen, stud, it wasn't my idea.
You should have caught her act.
The whole Bette Davis, through-finished-kaput scene.
- And at 3:00 a.m.
- Come on, Jay Jay.
He's exaggerating.
I'll check with Malcolm.
Maybe I can get you the afternoon off.
What happened, pussycat?
He ran into Anjelica.
She told him I was back.
That bitch should be hung by the thumbs or something equally appropriate.
It's all set up.
Let's go.
It's nothing personal, really.
I happen to think she could be a first-rate artist if her damned hormones didn't get in the way.
- There's not much he can do about that.
- He could kill himself.
Jay Jay, why don't you go cruise some sailors?
Please, don't mention seafood.
Come on.
I really missed this place.
I missed you.
You'd do me a big favor if you didn't say things like that.
Why is that?
I don't know.
Somehow it brings out the worst in me.
It makes me want to say things like, "How's that redhead?"
What?
The redhead, the one who worked in the bookstore.
She went back to Berkeley or whatever.
That's too bad.
You always have that blonde from Santa Barbara to fall back on.
If that's the phrase I'm looking for, and I think it probably is.
What are we gonna do?
Go through a whole list?
Is that it?
Who's got that kind of time?
I just don't know if I'm up to it anymore.
Up to what?
Those nights sitting and waiting for you to finish your program and come by.
Nights when it would start to get late and I'd start to think:
"I wonder if he's run himself off a cliff or maybe he's run into a blonde."
There was a time when I started rooting for the accident.
I mean, if it was a choice between that and a blonde.
You don't know how secure you make me feel.
I didn't wish you anything too serious.
Just a couple of months in traction.
You're all heart.
You know, the thing I hate the most in the whole world is a jealous female and that's what I was becoming.
That's why I had to split.
I was starting to be one of my most unfavorite people.
I hated it.
I know you did, too.
That still works anyway.
- Too well sometimes.
- What does that mean?
I mean, there's a little spot in the middle of each day, just about your size.
There's lots of girls my size if you're really looking.
I'm not.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You mean you've given up girls?
I haven't exactly been the monk of the month or anything like that but I have been making an effort.
There must be a real consternation among those "gropies."
That's "groupies," isn't it?
I don't know, "groupies, gropies..."
You know, you've got to be fair.
It hasn't just been my fault.
Listen, I know.
They kept overpowering you.
You get a little bit of the blame, too, you know.
You and that parade of roommates that keep moving in and out of your place.
I didn't realize they were such a trial to you.
What trial?
I enjoyed it.
You and I sitting in front of the fireplace and then some chick sitting there with a bathrobe on, eating Fig Newtons.
What about the one with the St. Bernard?
She was a real winner.
She took up enough space.
And then that other one that took the flute lessons.
Yeah, maybe it was a little rough on you.
I can think of a thousand reasons why we should try again.
I've got about seven billion things to do.
What do you think?
You want to try for a new start, right from the letter "A"?
- What am I gonna do with you?
- A lot.
Hi.
Excuse me.
Hi.
- You've met Anjelica, my...
- Roommate.
Yes.
I think I'll drive into Carmel and see if I can't find some cleaning solvent.
There's plenty under the sink.
Okay.
This house ought to have a revolving door.
You know when my father left me this house, he left me payments.
I can't handle that expense by myself and most girls don't like the isolation.
- It's a long way from town.
- I know.
I better get back to work.
- Thanks.
- That's it, "thanks"?
Four months in Sausalito is a long time.
I am not gonna get back on that same old merry-go-round again.
What do I have to do, give you a notarized statement?
I need a couple of more days to try and figure out where I'm at.
Okay.
You get your bearings, and then you'll give me a call, all right?
- Hi, Murph.
- Hi, Dave.
Sardine Factory.
Dave Garver?
You said this is Evelyn?
No.
Sorry, you've just missed him.
- What do you mean?
- He's gone.
He's not here.
I think you'd better look again.
Believe me, you just missed him.
Now if you're interested in someone more sophisticated I'll be happy to...
That's what I get for being a dirty old man.
There's a message for you, a Madge somebody from San Francisco.
- Brenner?
- That's it.
Al Monte gave her this number.
"Received pictures and biography.
"Please send a two-hour tape of your show as soon as possible."
- Thanks, Murph.
- Don't mention it.
I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be your social secretary.
You will put that on my tab?
Surprise!
What are you doing here?
I was calling you from that phone booth and he told me you'd left and I was staring right at your car.
Isn't that funny?
Yeah, kind of funny.
Why didn't you take my call?
Where does it say I gotta drop everything and answer the phone every time it rings?
Do you know your nostrils flare out into little wings when you're mad?
- It's kind of cute.
- Come on, Evelyn.
I gotta go.
- I'd love a Coke.
- Not now, I gotta get to the station.
No, you don't.
You're talking to your No. 1 fan.
You don't work tonight.
I've got this show that I'm trying to set and it's very important to me.
That means I gotta pick the music, write the lead-ins and find some poetry.
- Come on, will you?
- Poetry?
- Let me help you.
I'm terrific with poetry...
- Not tonight!
Does he want his keys?
- Come on, Evelyn.
- Speak.
- Come on!
- God!
Good boy!
Let's hear it.
Come on.
Come on.
Give me my keys.
- Come on.
Give me the keys.
- Come on.
Give me the keys, goddamn it!
- Having some trouble, lady?
- Get lost!
Yeah, get lost, assholes!
Let's split.
He's got enough trouble already.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
'Bye.
See you later.
Hi.
Get all your work done?
What do you want, Evelyn?
One Coke?
I'll tell you, tonight I'm really whipped.
What time is it?
Time for me to go home.
Go back to sleep.
- Hey, I've got an idea.
- What's that?
Some night this week, after the show corned beef and potato salad, dill pickles, the whole bit.
My place.
Deal?
I'll call you.
Thursday's good for me.
And now from KRML, the big-band sounds of Dee Barton.
Here's a fresh reel of tape for your air check.
- You want me to thread it up?
- No, leave it here.
Thanks.
I think I will go out and hit the streets, but before doing that I will blow me a little number.
Care to partake?
Take it in the other room.
I get zonked just breathing the air here.
All right, be that way.
- AI?
- Yeah?
Do you ever find yourself being completely smothered by somebody?
- Anybody I know?
- You met her at my house the other day.
Chicken Delight!
That's what I call a pretty good smothering.
You start a relationship thinking you're gonna be completely honest and suddenly the whole thing gets out of hand.
What's the problem?
The problem is I've been trying to uncomplicate my life and now I can't even answer the door.
Besides, Tobie's back.
Oh, really?
Tobie?
When?
- I ran into her Sunday.
- That was a goody.
I'll tell you the truth.
I've always thought Tobie was one of the foxiest chicks on the peninsula.
And why you gotta have so much action, I just don't understand it anyway.
It's just a hang-up I have, or had.
But now that I seem to have that straightened out I can't seem to solve this other problem.
Well, you know what they always say, my man.
No, what?
"He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword."
Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
Later.
We'll have more smooth sounds in just one minute but first, at ten minutes to the hour, we're broadcasting from KRML in the Carmel Rancho Shopping Center home of the buccaneer, the man's boutique.
KRML, Dave Garver speaking.
The whole point in having an answering service is to call in once in a while to check for messages.
Hi, Evelyn.
What's happening?
What could be happening, darling?
You're not here yet.
"Yet"?
I hope you like pastrami, because there was no corned beef.
Now, wait a minute.
Just hold on.
Are you trying to tell me you forgot that we have a date tonight?
I thought I was supposed to call you on that.
I feel kind of silly sitting here in my brand-new lounging pajamas.
I just assumed...
Apparently, I assumed wrong.
That's right.
You assumed wrong.
You don't have to come over if you've got something better to do.
I'll be over in a little while.
You and I are gonna have to have a talk.
Whatever you say.
In the meantime, haven't you forgotten something else?
What's that?
Weren't you gonna play Misty for me?
Yeah.
I have that one right here.
Thank you, darling.
And now we have a pretty one for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night.
It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty.
And this one is especially for Evelyn.
Just a second.
Come in.
Hi.
Hi.
- Cold night?
- Yeah.
But you got here anyway.
Stout fella.
There's something we're gonna have to get straight.
It's amazing what a man will go through for a hot pastrami sandwich.
- Look...
- Wait a minute.
You haven't told me how nice I look.
- You look fine.
- The sales lady guaranteed you'd flip.
- Now, listen.
Can we talk?
- Wait.
First...
Surprise.
- Don't you like them?
- Yeah, they're great, but...
Don't spoil my fun, darling.
I love to give you things.
It's Madame Butterfly time.
First, friendly neighborhood geisha remove honorable shoes.
Stop it, Evelyn!
Now, we've gotta talk!
Have I done something wrong?
I'm just trying to be straight with you, that's all.
Be nice to me instead.
Jesus Christ!
I don't understand.
Are you trying to say you don't love me anymore?
I never told you that I loved you.
Not in words maybe, but there are ways of saying things that have nothing to do with words.
I'm sorry you read it that way.
It's that other bitch, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
The silver-framed picture in your dresser.
- That picture's got nothing to do with you.
- What does have to do with me?
- I never lied to you.
- Big deal.
He never lied to me.
What do you want for that?
The Congressional Medal of Honor?
- So long.
- What am I supposed to do?
Sit here all dressed up in my little whore suit waiting for my lord and master to call?
- Nobody asked you to wait for anything.
- You're not dumping me!
- Get off my back, Evelyn!
- Get off your back?
That's where you've been keeping me, isn't it?
You're nothing!
You're not even good in bed!
I just felt sorry for you, that's all!
Bastard!
You poor, pathetic bastard!
Hello?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean those things I said.
Will I see you tomorrow?
You don't listen, do you?
Let me come over.
If I could just see you, just talk to you.
- No, Evelyn.
- But I love you, David.
I love you.
David!
If I could just...
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Why?
No, come on.
You haven't heard a word I've been saying.
- I have.
I've heard everything you said.
- You did?
All right, tell me.
- You don't believe me?
- Go ahead.
Okay, wise chick.
We're supposed to go to a party at Big Sur tomorrow night.
I'm supposed to meet you there at 9:00.
And the address is...
I didn't tell you that.
See how you are?
I don't know myself yet.
I'll call you tomorrow about it.
Okay.
You call me tomorrow.
Honey, we better go.
- We're just getting to the best part.
- But I've got to pick Anjelica up at 6:00.
God!
How the pain is setting in.
Come on.
She's a very nice girl.
Anyway, she's moving out tonight.
Now, that's about the best news I've heard in years.
And Madalyn's moving in.
Madalyn?
Shit.
- What's going on?
- Don't tell me he was asleep!
What else at this hour of the morning?
I'm surprised his conscience was that clear!
- What do you want, Evelyn?
- "What do you want, Evelyn?"
Do I have to want something?
Can't I just come over?
Or is it inconvenient?
- Wait a...
- Did I make a boo-boo?
Has someone been sleeping in Papa Bear's bed?
Wait a minute, goddamn it!
"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
I thought...
God, don't look at me that way, Dave.
I just don't know what to say to you.
I'm sorry I mistrusted you.
I know you'd never spoil it.
To spoil what?
What we have between us.
We don't have a goddamn thing!
How many ways do I have to say this?
I don't care how many ways you say it, it's not true!
- What do I have to do to convince you?
- It's not true!
It's not!
What are you doing?
I'm gonna get dressed and drive you home, that's what.
Why are you playing these games?
Why are you pretending you don't love me?
I don't even believe I'm hearing this.
But I love you!
You haven't got the vaguest idea what love is.
We don't even know each other.
Wait a minute.
You don't have to do that.
I'm okay.
I can drive home.
Are you sure?
Positive.
I'm fine.
Let me just wash my face.
You ready?
You okay?
Oh, no.
How's she gonna be?
I sutured the wounds.
It wasn't quite as bad as it looked.
It couldn't have been.
You know, Dave, I'm supposed to turn a report in on this.
But you won't.
You see, Tobie's back.
I'd rather tell her, and not have her read it in the paper somewhere.
I didn't know that.
I'll tell Marie.
We'll do the spaghetti number.
- Somebody gonna be around here today?
- Me.
I'll be here.
I bombed her out pretty good.
Let her sleep it off before you take her home.
- And how long will that be?
- It's hard to say.
Why?
- I'd like to take Tobie out tonight.
- No problem.
She'll wake up sometime this afternoon, 5:00 or so.
Is she gonna be all right?
The cuts were really pretty superficial.
I mean, do you think she'll try it again?
Chances are against it.
But I'd watch her.
I wouldn't leave her alone if she seems unusually depressed or insecure.
Better get some sleep yourself.
You look like hell.
Call me if you need me.
Thanks, Frank.
I really appreciate it.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
Fine.
Here.
Thank you.
Brought you a little soup.
It looks good.
I don't know what to say.
It frightens me thinking about it.
Don't think about it.
I don't mean me.
I mean you.
"Girl commits suicide in disc jockey's home."
It's not very good publicity for a man in your position.
Get some rest.
As soon as you feel better, I'll take you home.
Thank you, David.
I got your clothes hung up in the closet there.
Maybe you better answer the phone.
Yeah.
I'll get it in the other room.
Hello.
Hi.
I just wanted to check.
We still on for tonight?
Yeah, I'm ready to go.
What time is the party?
Madalyn's already left, and she won't be back for a long time and I was just thinking...
Would you be disappointed if we didn't go to the party and just stayed here instead?
I think I can bear up under it.
Don't be too long.
- That's me at the door.
- David the way I look at it, the hell with Sausalito.
Bye-bye.
Evelyn?
- What's the matter?
Take it easy.
- I had a dream.
I was drowning in the ocean and I called to you, but you just stood there watching.
Watching.
It was just a dream.
Oh, God, I'm so alone.
Hold me.
Hold me, Dave.
Please.
Yeah.
Tighter.
Tighter.
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.
David!
I woke up and you were gone.
If you have something planned for tonight, you could just take me home.
Maybe that'd be best.
No, no, there's nothing.
Good.
Isn't this nice?
Just us here, together.
Here we go again.
Stone-cold dead in the market.
Must have been quite a party.
Go away, Birdie.
Any other bodies, any other juiceheads around here?
Come back tomorrow, will you?
Or next year sometime.
I better check the workbench.
All right, break it up in here.
Looks like old times around this place.
Evelyn?
Lose something, tiger?
You couldn't find it within your heart to come back at a later time, could you?
This is a later time, pussycat.
I'm paying you back for the day I blew last week.
Evelyn?
Very funny, Birdie.
Very funny.
What I can't figure out is, with all this action going on in here what are you doing out there couching it?
What is this, some kind of Kinsey Report?
Do I come over to your house and ask a lot of dumb questions?
You just ought to, pussycat.
Might open up a whole new way of life to you.
Hold it.
Let's try to show a little class, shall we?
Mr. Garver's residence.
I'll see.
Do you want to talk to a Madge Brenner?
Yeah.
I want to talk to her.
Thanks.
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Garver?
Madge Brenner.
We like the tape on your show.
Like it very much.
There are one or two others in the running, but, frankly...
Can we have lunch today?
- Windjammer still good?
- Yeah, still very good.
Reserve a table in your name.
- See you then, Mr. Garver.
- Great.
Bye-bye.
Looks like we found Evelyn.
"Good morning, darling.
Gone shopping.
"Back in a flash with the hash."
A little humor in there.
"Love and kisses, Evelyn."
And then it says:
"If you can't find your keys, don't worry.
"I borrowed your car."
Here's your key, and here's your copy.
That'll be $0.40, please.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
David?
I stopped by my...
Hi.
Don't you look all gussied up?
Good.
I was gonna cook brunch but this calls for something more festive.
How about the Marquis?
My treat.
- After all I put you through, it's the least...
- I have a lunch date.
Business.
- Business?
- Yeah.
Can I have my car keys?
Sure.
I think you ought to take it easy, anyway.
Get some rest.
Yeah, I do feel a little tired.
Very funny, Dave.
Now, let's talk show.
Tell me, what do you think of the concept?
The unstructured the loosey-goosey, Monterey pop, Woodstock kind of thing?
I like it very much, and I think I can handle it.
So do I.
I'll keep this to promote your new career with.
You'll be working with kids, bright and marvelous.
But they take handling.
If this goes the way I think it will there's no reason in the world why...
- Isn't this cozy?
So this is your business lunch?
How's business?
Friend of yours?
- Just another trick.
- That's enough.
Is that your idea of a dish?
She's a little old for you, isn't she?
What is this, "Be Kind to Senior Citizens Week"?
Get outta here!
I don't mind you being a bastard, but do you have to be a tasteless one?
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
She couldn't get laid in a lumber camp!
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
You're hurting me!
Stop it, you dirty bastard!
No!
Stop it!
Dave!
No!
No!
Don't leave me!
Don't leave me!
She's nothing!
Nothing!
Nothing!
- I love you!
- Get her outta here.
Where to?
I did it because I love you.
Don't you understand that?
- I love you!
- Where to?
- Move!
- It's because I love you!
Dave, please.
This is a private beach.
- I want to talk to you.
- I don't want to talk to you.
Are you drunk?
No, but that's not a bad idea.
- Why, David?
- Why what?
Drunk?
No.
Why last night?
That's what I came to explain to you.
Okay, good.
I think we should understand each other.
I'm not very happy with you.
That's fair enough.
Whatever it was, you could have called me.
No, I couldn't.
Why not?
I couldn't tell you the truth last night.
I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.
Now, why do you have to say that?
I just didn't want to take a chance she'd try it again.
What if she does?
I swear to you, if she ever tries it I'd just let her go right on ahead.
God!
Oh, my God.
What in the...
Oh, God, help me!
Please, somebody, help me!
Help me, somebody!
Oh, God, help me!
- Stay back, buddy.
- I live here, man.
Is she your housecleaning lady, Garver?
Okay, boys, let's take her out.
Watch your step.
It's gonna cost you double to clean up this mess.
Watch your step.
- Dave Garver?
- Yeah.
I'm Sgt. McCallum.
Any ideas?
About what?
About your girlfriend in there.
That's not my girlfriend.
Let me get that straight right in front.
More or less a casual acquaintance, you'd say?
That's right.
You're saying she came by to hack up your wardrobe and your cleaning lady?
I'm not trying to tell you anything, Sergeant.
Maybe you ought to.
The lady almost got herself killed.
And I'm stumbling around in my stupid way trying to find out why.
What'll you have?
This Evelyn Draper, where does she come from?
I don't know.
- What about her family?
- I don't know that either.
She just listens to my radio show, and we met one night.
That's all.
- Practically a stranger.
- That's right.
Then how does she happen to have a key to your front door?
I don't know that either.
It boils down to, you don't know a hell of a lot, do you?
What it boils down to is, I'm getting sick of your questions.
And so am I!
But they get upset with me down at the store if I don't ask them.
- Just take her through.
I'll be right along.
- Right.
- Take her through what?
- Booking.
What she really needs is psychiatric help.
Really?
Now, look, those cuts on her wrists...
Don't know anything about those.
There's one other thing.
I know, "Don't leave town."
I was gonna say, "Why don't you play some Mantovani sometime?"
Didn't know you liked the show.
I don't.
I like Mantovani.
Go ahead, play!
All right!
Those of you who may have played brass instruments you know that was triple-tonguin', baby.
Let's give his tongue a nice hand!
He might just be the fastest tongue in the West!
- Come on.
- All right, I'm coming.
What do you say...
- Something to eat?
- I've got to pick up my roommate, Annabel.
- Madalyn's your roommate.
- I found my man, and I'm moving out.
- And Annabel's moving in.
- Right.
- 'Bye.
- Ciao.
See you later.
Thank you.
Thank you very kindly.
That was the Cannonball Adderley Group.
They're playing at the Monterey Jazz Festival with Duke Ellington, Woody Herman, Joe Williams and many others.
Still got tickets for Sunday.
So get on out there because that's where it's happening.
Now we're gonna hear from the Gator Creek Organization and Feelin' Fine.
KRML.
Dave Garver.
Hello.
Play Misty for me.
David?
I didn't mean to shake you up.
I'm sorry.
Pretty stupid of me.
I've been released.
Therapy.
It was a bad dream, but it's over.
- Where are you?
- The airport.
San Francisco.
I've only got a minute between planes.
- Got a job in Hawaii.
- You're all right then?
Fine, David.
Fine.
I just want to say how sorry I am about everything.
- Forget it.
I have.
- I hope so.
"Because this maiden she lived with no other thought
"Than to love and be loved by you."
Are you near a radio?
No.
But play it for me anyway.
Hello.
- Garver?
- Yeah.
Sgt. McCallum.
Sorry to wake you but something's come up.
I know.
She just paid me a visit with a butcher knife.
Why?
Because she was released on parole pending further legal action.
When?
A week ago.
I sure like the way you broke your ass to let me know!
- I just found out about it myself.
- Who's in charge down there anyway?
Now, look.
Do you want to help find her or would you rather just sit there and bellyache?
- All right.
- Good.
Now exactly what did she say to you?
I told you.
She said that she was well and that she was going to Hawaii.
What else?
- I already told you.
- Tell me again.
You know, you really make lousy conversation.
You make lousy coffee.
Come on, what else did she say?
Nothing, except...
- Except what?
- It was nothing.
It was a line from a poem.
- What poem?
- Lf I knew that, I'd know the line.
- Try to remember.
- You know, McCallum, it's getting late.
You're sounding very monotonous.
You're not exactly my idea of a swinging date either.
Good night, McCallum.
- What happened to the Mantovani?
- The what?
I heard the show, but I never did hear you play Mantovani.
You really did listen to the show?
Friend, if we had a TV down at the station I'd break my arm before I turned your show on.
Thanks a lot.
Just hope we're lucky enough to grab her the next time she tries it.
Tries what?
To kill you.
Yeah.
And if you're not lucky enough?
That'd be hell.
The guys down at the station would have to chip in and buy a TV.
You're a great comfort, Sergeant.
You will change the locks?
Hi.
Nothing like a nice brisk walk in the woods to put roses on a girl's cheeks.
How are you?
Not so good, honey.
- She's back.
- Who?
Evelyn Draper, the girl who tried to kill Birdie.
How can she be back?
I thought they'd put her in a state sanitarium.
- They did, but they let her out.
- Does that mean she's all right?
Theoretically.
What happens now?
I think you and I ought to stay away from each other for a couple of days just in case she's tagging after me.
She's already following you, isn't she?
I don't want you to worry about it.
I can handle myself.
Yeah.
So could Birdie.
All right then, you stand by.
They're all set to trace the call.
When she phones, just mention her by name right away, Evelyn and they start to trace her.
All you gotta do after that is just keep her talking.
Fifteen minutes before the hour here at KRML and here's It's Not Unusual.
I guess it hasn't come to you yet.
- What?
- What she said.
Over the phone last night?
Part of a poem or something.
You were gonna try to remember.
I thought I had that, but I've forgotten.
Is it that important?
Until we pick her up, everything's important.
What's wrong?
I'm worried about my girlfriend with all this going on.
They're so damn isolated down there.
I'm thinking the best thing to do is just have Al Monte sub for me.
The only chance we've got is when she phones in here tonight.
You've got to be here, right on that mike.
- Lf she phones.
- She will.
Believe me.
But only if you're here.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
If it'll make you feel better, I'll go over and check your girlfriend's house myself.
I'd sure appreciate that.
She lives on Spindrift Road.
I think it's the fourth or fifth house down.
- "Williams" is on the mailbox.
- Why don't you phone her?
- Okay.
- Tell her to be expecting me.
McCallum.
Thanks.
Public servant.
- Hello?
- Hi.
I'm just checking in.
You all right?
Marvelous.
I'm just getting ready to do my nails and I got your program on.
And Annabel's in the kitchen making a couple of coffee grogs.
What more could a girl ask for?
No, honey, everything's fine.
There's a Sgt. McCallum that's gonna drop by for a second to see if you've buttoned up all right.
Let him in, but nobody else.
Okay.
David, you want to play something soft and dreamy for us?
You got it.
Bye-bye.
'Bye, hon.
- Annabel, how's that stuff coming?
- Here's something soft and sentimental for Tobie and Annabel.
Hope you like cinnamon in yours.
Whatever's right.
Annabel.
Good?
Too much.
- So is this.
- Thank you.
Just one thing.
Do you mind?
No, be my guest.
The eyes are wrong.
David's are more...
How shall I say?
Colder.
I didn't know you knew David.
I didn't realize you and David were friends.
Friends?
No, not friends.
Not friends.
God, you're dumb.
"Because this maiden she lived with no other thought
"Than to love and be loved by you."
- Tobie?
- We're waiting for you, David.
This is Dave Garver with a little verse a little talk and five hours of music to be very, very nice to each other by.
Careful.
Careful.
I might put your eye out.
I'll bet David loves your eyes.
And your hair.
Does he run his fingers through your hair?
Have to get you all nice for David.
For David.
I hope he likes what he sees when he walks in here because that's what he's taking to hell with him.
Miss Williams?
McCallum?
And now we have a pretty one for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night.
It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty.
And this one is especially for Evelyn.
Subtitles by SOFTITLER
Hey, hey, you're digging the master jock for solid rock Sweet Al Monte blasting, babies.
Being bold and pouring coal on KRML in quaint little Carmel-by-the-Sea.
We're next door to magnificent Monterey, home of the annual jazz festival.
Although it's four months away, you got to get your tickets because they're going fast and it can't last.
The time is 7:54 and there's a breeze of 50 degrees around your loving hips, and there's a taste of fog.
I say we got a bowl of soul, and if you think your heart can take it...
Now we're gonna wrap it up for the week, folks.
A brand-new release from the funk capital of the world, Squeeze Me.
Here he comes, the big "D" himself, Dave Garver.
And Dave is gonna bring you five hours of mellow groove.
In the meantime, this is Sweet Al Monte saying:
"Hang in there, babies, because everything is going to be everything."
'Bye.
What's that letter you got there?
Is that that Frisco gig?
Yeah.
All right, so what's happening?
They want the usual thing:
A biography, pictures.
Really?
Is that that Madge Brenner chick?
Yeah, she's the one putting it together.
In that case, David, you're in.
How do you figure that?
Now, David, come on, man.
Are you kidding?
She's a grandmother.
So when did that ever stop you?
You better get a move on.
I already played your theme.
Yeah, I heard it.
You're a real human being.
And you're on the air, baby.
All right.
"Men have destroyed the roads of wonder
"And their cities squat like black toads
"In the orchards of life nothing is clean or real
"Or as a girl, naked to love or be a man with"
This is Dave Garver with a little verse, a little talk and five hours of music to be very, very nice to each other by.
- KRML, Dave Garver speaking.
- Hello?
- Hi, what'll it be?
- Play Misty for me.
Misty?
We have that right on the play rack.
Thanks for calling.
I see you got your little Misty chick calling you again.
All righty.
- Swing along.
- You take it easy now.
See you in the a.m.
KRML, Dave Garver.
- Hi, Murphy.
- Hi, Dave.
No messages for you.
- No?
- Heard your show tonight.
It sure beats hell out of working for a living.
- Thanks for the plug.
- What are friends for?
- Bartender.
- Coke?
Coming right up.
She's waiting for someone.
You sure?
That's what she says.
Guys have been striking out all night.
One game?
- Cry Bastion?
- What else?
Okay, coach.
You asked for it.
Don't take all night.
Move.
Okay.
Move.
Palfrey's Gambit.
Dirty rat.
Are we playing Copenhagen rules?
Make it easy on yourself, Murph.
Cry Bastion.
Sorry, no Bastion.
Damn, I didn't see that.
It's too bad, Murphy.
Too bad.
- Careful now.
- That ought to do it.
Be really careful now.
Careful.
Hi.
He doesn't see it.
Yeah?
Cry Bastion.
Fool's ploy, my man.
Fool's ploy.
Care to play the winner?
I'll just watch.
- My name is Dave Garver.
- Evelyn Draper.
Sit down, Evelyn Draper?
Care for a drink?
Okay.
- What'll it be?
- Surprise me.
- Screwdriver.
- Nice game.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- What happened?
- I won.
How?
When?
When you said, "Okay."
I ought to be mad.
But you're not.
Not really.
It certainly was nice of you to bring me home, Mr. Garver?
That's right.
I don't think I've been stood up on a date since the ninth grade back in Albany.
Is something wrong?
No, I keep getting the feeling I know you from someplace.
- You do?
- Yeah.
Here.
Why don't you let me do that?
Oh, no.
That's all right.
I've got it.
Why don't you see if you can get the fire started?
All right.
There are some matches right next to it.
All right.
It's getting late.
You're sure I'm not keeping you up?
No.
I rarely get to bed before 3:00 a.m.
I didn't have a date tonight.
I went there because you talk about it on your program sometimes and I wanted to meet you.
I listen to you all the time.
I knew somebody was out there.
- You're making fun of me.
- No, I'm not.
- Say something else.
- Such as?
Play Misty for me?
Very good.
- You sure I'm not keeping you up?
- Don't you like me?
You're a very nice girl.
But who needs nice girls?
No, I like them.
I'm kind of hung up on one.
And you don't want to complicate your life.
- That's exactly right.
- Neither do I.
But that's no reason we shouldn't sleep together tonight if we feel like it.
Solid silicone.
Hi, David, my man!
How you been, baby?
See you got the joint cleaned up for once.
The Heavy digs it.
- Care for a beer?
- Not really.
I could go for something more uplifting, but not a brew, my man.
Beer is all we've got.
You're gonna have to ease on out.
I got a lot of work to do today.
You don't understand.
I've been sent here to get you.
By whom?
That old chick I go with.
What's her name?
- Carol?
- That's the one.
Girl thinks you've been working too hard.
She said we should get together tonight.
Who's this "we"?
Me, you, her and one of them hens that you can dig up.
There is a fantastic new Mexican place in Carmel called Susinos.
The albóndigas soup is unbelievable.
It is a mind-bender...
I know the joint, but I don't have a date, and I got a lot to do.
Big deal, man.
Get one!
If you have any problems getting one, I'll get one for you as nice as I look.
It's too late, and besides, I've got a lot of work to do.
But you gotta eat, David.
I'm gonna whip up something here in my own kitchen.
You know, David, I'm really worried about your social life.
You'll make someone a tremendous mother.
Too narrow in the pelvis.
I sure appreciate you dropping by, Al.
Come by again sometime, anytime.
Never let it be said that Sweet Al Monte can't take a hint.
- Who's hinting?
- Hi.
Why, hi there, yourself.
Dave Garver live here?
That depends on your point of view.
Hi.
This stuff weighs a ton.
Where's the kitchen?
Right inside.
Just come on in and help yourself.
Swing right around the bend there.
I know, David, she's from Chicken Delight.
Look, don't work too hard, my man.
Don't strain yourself.
How come you don't have any beer?
And what is this?
A shrunken head?
Does that guy live here?
- I wanted...
- I hope you like steak.
- You look like a steak-and-potatoes type.
- Hang on.
I said to myself, a nice salad with Roquefort and tomatoes and baked potato with...
- What's going on here?
- Don't send me away.
- No, I want to ask you a question.
I just wanted to surprise you.
Surprise?
What happens if he and I had been talking business?
Or maybe I have female company and you come traipsing in with groceries?
That would be some surprise.
I'm sorry.
Keep that stuff.
I think I've lost my appetite.
Hang on a minute.
I'm just trying to tell you something.
I don't understand.
Should I go or stay?
What?
I'm telling you there's a telephone, and I pick it up and I dial it.
You answer and I say, "What are you doing?"
And I say, "I'll be right over."
Fine.
Next time, why don't we do it that way?
Okay.
Any way you like.
Next time.
How do you like your steak?
Extremely rare.
That's just how I like mine.
Extremely rare.
I'll get some wine here.
A little vino.
Vino!
All this and heaven, too!
Terrific!
This is gonna be some dinner.
What happened to that discussion we had last time?
You know, the deal about no strings and all that?
There are no strings, but I never said anything about not coming back for seconds, did I?
That's right.
You didn't.
When will I see you?
I'll give you a call.
- Dave, you're funny.
- How's that?
If you want to keep playing these games, okay, but they're really not necessary anymore, not for me.
People are trying to sleep here!
People are trying to talk here!
- How'd you like to tell that to the law?
- How'd you like to go screw yourself?
Take it easy!
Guy's just trying to sleep, that's all.
You're right.
It's a terrific morning.
Why be selfish with it?
Bye-bye.
Wait a minute!
Yeah?
Excuse me, I saw the sweater, and I thought you were somebody else.
You must be David.
Where have you been?
Around.
I was trying to join the revolt against the representational.
Didn't quite make that though.
So now I'm just trying to play it cool.
Not quite making that either.
Got time for a break?
- Yeah.
- Let's go.
- When did you get in town?
- Yesterday.
- You weren't gonna call me?
- Of course I was.
I had to get settled first.
You shouldn't lend your sweaters to blabbermouths.
You've gotten thinner.
No!
Well, so much for Sausalito.
Sausalito?
That's where I was staying.
Jay Jay's place.
- Jay Jay's place?
- It's nothing much, really.
It's just a little pied-à-terre, but it's handy to the fleet.
You told me you didn't know where she was.
So I lied.
Picket me.
- Thanks a lot.
- Listen, stud, it wasn't my idea.
You should have caught her act.
The whole Bette Davis, through-finished-kaput scene.
- And at 3:00 a.m.
- Come on, Jay Jay.
He's exaggerating.
I'll check with Malcolm.
Maybe I can get you the afternoon off.
What happened, pussycat?
He ran into Anjelica.
She told him I was back.
That bitch should be hung by the thumbs or something equally appropriate.
It's all set up.
Let's go.
It's nothing personal, really.
I happen to think she could be a first-rate artist if her damned hormones didn't get in the way.
- There's not much he can do about that.
- He could kill himself.
Jay Jay, why don't you go cruise some sailors?
Please, don't mention seafood.
Come on.
I really missed this place.
I missed you.
You'd do me a big favor if you didn't say things like that.
Why is that?
I don't know.
Somehow it brings out the worst in me.
It makes me want to say things like, "How's that redhead?"
What?
The redhead, the one who worked in the bookstore.
She went back to Berkeley or whatever.
That's too bad.
You always have that blonde from Santa Barbara to fall back on.
If that's the phrase I'm looking for, and I think it probably is.
What are we gonna do?
Go through a whole list?
Is that it?
Who's got that kind of time?
I just don't know if I'm up to it anymore.
Up to what?
Those nights sitting and waiting for you to finish your program and come by.
Nights when it would start to get late and I'd start to think:
"I wonder if he's run himself off a cliff or maybe he's run into a blonde."
There was a time when I started rooting for the accident.
I mean, if it was a choice between that and a blonde.
You don't know how secure you make me feel.
I didn't wish you anything too serious.
Just a couple of months in traction.
You're all heart.
You know, the thing I hate the most in the whole world is a jealous female and that's what I was becoming.
That's why I had to split.
I was starting to be one of my most unfavorite people.
I hated it.
I know you did, too.
That still works anyway.
- Too well sometimes.
- What does that mean?
I mean, there's a little spot in the middle of each day, just about your size.
There's lots of girls my size if you're really looking.
I'm not.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You mean you've given up girls?
I haven't exactly been the monk of the month or anything like that but I have been making an effort.
There must be a real consternation among those "gropies."
That's "groupies," isn't it?
I don't know, "groupies, gropies..."
You know, you've got to be fair.
It hasn't just been my fault.
Listen, I know.
They kept overpowering you.
You get a little bit of the blame, too, you know.
You and that parade of roommates that keep moving in and out of your place.
I didn't realize they were such a trial to you.
What trial?
I enjoyed it.
You and I sitting in front of the fireplace and then some chick sitting there with a bathrobe on, eating Fig Newtons.
What about the one with the St. Bernard?
She was a real winner.
She took up enough space.
And then that other one that took the flute lessons.
Yeah, maybe it was a little rough on you.
I can think of a thousand reasons why we should try again.
I've got about seven billion things to do.
What do you think?
You want to try for a new start, right from the letter "A"?
- What am I gonna do with you?
- A lot.
Hi.
Excuse me.
Hi.
- You've met Anjelica, my...
- Roommate.
Yes.
I think I'll drive into Carmel and see if I can't find some cleaning solvent.
There's plenty under the sink.
Okay.
This house ought to have a revolving door.
You know when my father left me this house, he left me payments.
I can't handle that expense by myself and most girls don't like the isolation.
- It's a long way from town.
- I know.
I better get back to work.
- Thanks.
- That's it, "thanks"?
Four months in Sausalito is a long time.
I am not gonna get back on that same old merry-go-round again.
What do I have to do, give you a notarized statement?
I need a couple of more days to try and figure out where I'm at.
Okay.
You get your bearings, and then you'll give me a call, all right?
- Hi, Murph.
- Hi, Dave.
Sardine Factory.
Dave Garver?
You said this is Evelyn?
No.
Sorry, you've just missed him.
- What do you mean?
- He's gone.
He's not here.
I think you'd better look again.
Believe me, you just missed him.
Now if you're interested in someone more sophisticated I'll be happy to...
That's what I get for being a dirty old man.
There's a message for you, a Madge somebody from San Francisco.
- Brenner?
- That's it.
Al Monte gave her this number.
"Received pictures and biography.
"Please send a two-hour tape of your show as soon as possible."
- Thanks, Murph.
- Don't mention it.
I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be your social secretary.
You will put that on my tab?
Surprise!
What are you doing here?
I was calling you from that phone booth and he told me you'd left and I was staring right at your car.
Isn't that funny?
Yeah, kind of funny.
Why didn't you take my call?
Where does it say I gotta drop everything and answer the phone every time it rings?
Do you know your nostrils flare out into little wings when you're mad?
- It's kind of cute.
- Come on, Evelyn.
I gotta go.
- I'd love a Coke.
- Not now, I gotta get to the station.
No, you don't.
You're talking to your No. 1 fan.
You don't work tonight.
I've got this show that I'm trying to set and it's very important to me.
That means I gotta pick the music, write the lead-ins and find some poetry.
- Come on, will you?
- Poetry?
- Let me help you.
I'm terrific with poetry...
- Not tonight!
Does he want his keys?
- Come on, Evelyn.
- Speak.
- Come on!
- God!
Good boy!
Let's hear it.
Come on.
Come on.
Give me my keys.
- Come on.
Give me the keys.
- Come on.
Give me the keys, goddamn it!
- Having some trouble, lady?
- Get lost!
Yeah, get lost, assholes!
Let's split.
He's got enough trouble already.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
'Bye.
See you later.
Hi.
Get all your work done?
What do you want, Evelyn?
One Coke?
I'll tell you, tonight I'm really whipped.
What time is it?
Time for me to go home.
Go back to sleep.
- Hey, I've got an idea.
- What's that?
Some night this week, after the show corned beef and potato salad, dill pickles, the whole bit.
My place.
Deal?
I'll call you.
Thursday's good for me.
And now from KRML, the big-band sounds of Dee Barton.
Here's a fresh reel of tape for your air check.
- You want me to thread it up?
- No, leave it here.
Thanks.
I think I will go out and hit the streets, but before doing that I will blow me a little number.
Care to partake?
Take it in the other room.
I get zonked just breathing the air here.
All right, be that way.
- AI?
- Yeah?
Do you ever find yourself being completely smothered by somebody?
- Anybody I know?
- You met her at my house the other day.
Chicken Delight!
That's what I call a pretty good smothering.
You start a relationship thinking you're gonna be completely honest and suddenly the whole thing gets out of hand.
What's the problem?
The problem is I've been trying to uncomplicate my life and now I can't even answer the door.
Besides, Tobie's back.
Oh, really?
Tobie?
When?
- I ran into her Sunday.
- That was a goody.
I'll tell you the truth.
I've always thought Tobie was one of the foxiest chicks on the peninsula.
And why you gotta have so much action, I just don't understand it anyway.
It's just a hang-up I have, or had.
But now that I seem to have that straightened out I can't seem to solve this other problem.
Well, you know what they always say, my man.
No, what?
"He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword."
Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
Later.
We'll have more smooth sounds in just one minute but first, at ten minutes to the hour, we're broadcasting from KRML in the Carmel Rancho Shopping Center home of the buccaneer, the man's boutique.
KRML, Dave Garver speaking.
The whole point in having an answering service is to call in once in a while to check for messages.
Hi, Evelyn.
What's happening?
What could be happening, darling?
You're not here yet.
"Yet"?
I hope you like pastrami, because there was no corned beef.
Now, wait a minute.
Just hold on.
Are you trying to tell me you forgot that we have a date tonight?
I thought I was supposed to call you on that.
I feel kind of silly sitting here in my brand-new lounging pajamas.
I just assumed...
Apparently, I assumed wrong.
That's right.
You assumed wrong.
You don't have to come over if you've got something better to do.
I'll be over in a little while.
You and I are gonna have to have a talk.
Whatever you say.
In the meantime, haven't you forgotten something else?
What's that?
Weren't you gonna play Misty for me?
Yeah.
I have that one right here.
Thank you, darling.
And now we have a pretty one for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night.
It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty.
And this one is especially for Evelyn.
Just a second.
Come in.
Hi.
Hi.
- Cold night?
- Yeah.
But you got here anyway.
Stout fella.
There's something we're gonna have to get straight.
It's amazing what a man will go through for a hot pastrami sandwich.
- Look...
- Wait a minute.
You haven't told me how nice I look.
- You look fine.
- The sales lady guaranteed you'd flip.
- Now, listen.
Can we talk?
- Wait.
First...
Surprise.
- Don't you like them?
- Yeah, they're great, but...
Don't spoil my fun, darling.
I love to give you things.
It's Madame Butterfly time.
First, friendly neighborhood geisha remove honorable shoes.
Stop it, Evelyn!
Now, we've gotta talk!
Have I done something wrong?
I'm just trying to be straight with you, that's all.
Be nice to me instead.
Jesus Christ!
I don't understand.
Are you trying to say you don't love me anymore?
I never told you that I loved you.
Not in words maybe, but there are ways of saying things that have nothing to do with words.
I'm sorry you read it that way.
It's that other bitch, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
The silver-framed picture in your dresser.
- That picture's got nothing to do with you.
- What does have to do with me?
- I never lied to you.
- Big deal.
He never lied to me.
What do you want for that?
The Congressional Medal of Honor?
- So long.
- What am I supposed to do?
Sit here all dressed up in my little whore suit waiting for my lord and master to call?
- Nobody asked you to wait for anything.
- You're not dumping me!
- Get off my back, Evelyn!
- Get off your back?
That's where you've been keeping me, isn't it?
You're nothing!
You're not even good in bed!
I just felt sorry for you, that's all!
Bastard!
You poor, pathetic bastard!
Hello?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean those things I said.
Will I see you tomorrow?
You don't listen, do you?
Let me come over.
If I could just see you, just talk to you.
- No, Evelyn.
- But I love you, David.
I love you.
David!
If I could just...
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Why?
No, come on.
You haven't heard a word I've been saying.
- I have.
I've heard everything you said.
- You did?
All right, tell me.
- You don't believe me?
- Go ahead.
Okay, wise chick.
We're supposed to go to a party at Big Sur tomorrow night.
I'm supposed to meet you there at 9:00.
And the address is...
I didn't tell you that.
See how you are?
I don't know myself yet.
I'll call you tomorrow about it.
Okay.
You call me tomorrow.
Honey, we better go.
- We're just getting to the best part.
- But I've got to pick Anjelica up at 6:00.
God!
How the pain is setting in.
Come on.
She's a very nice girl.
Anyway, she's moving out tonight.
Now, that's about the best news I've heard in years.
And Madalyn's moving in.
Madalyn?
Shit.
- What's going on?
- Don't tell me he was asleep!
What else at this hour of the morning?
I'm surprised his conscience was that clear!
- What do you want, Evelyn?
- "What do you want, Evelyn?"
Do I have to want something?
Can't I just come over?
Or is it inconvenient?
- Wait a...
- Did I make a boo-boo?
Has someone been sleeping in Papa Bear's bed?
Wait a minute, goddamn it!
"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
I thought...
God, don't look at me that way, Dave.
I just don't know what to say to you.
I'm sorry I mistrusted you.
I know you'd never spoil it.
To spoil what?
What we have between us.
We don't have a goddamn thing!
How many ways do I have to say this?
I don't care how many ways you say it, it's not true!
- What do I have to do to convince you?
- It's not true!
It's not!
What are you doing?
I'm gonna get dressed and drive you home, that's what.
Why are you playing these games?
Why are you pretending you don't love me?
I don't even believe I'm hearing this.
But I love you!
You haven't got the vaguest idea what love is.
We don't even know each other.
Wait a minute.
You don't have to do that.
I'm okay.
I can drive home.
Are you sure?
Positive.
I'm fine.
Let me just wash my face.
You ready?
You okay?
Oh, no.
How's she gonna be?
I sutured the wounds.
It wasn't quite as bad as it looked.
It couldn't have been.
You know, Dave, I'm supposed to turn a report in on this.
But you won't.
You see, Tobie's back.
I'd rather tell her, and not have her read it in the paper somewhere.
I didn't know that.
I'll tell Marie.
We'll do the spaghetti number.
- Somebody gonna be around here today?
- Me.
I'll be here.
I bombed her out pretty good.
Let her sleep it off before you take her home.
- And how long will that be?
- It's hard to say.
Why?
- I'd like to take Tobie out tonight.
- No problem.
She'll wake up sometime this afternoon, 5:00 or so.
Is she gonna be all right?
The cuts were really pretty superficial.
I mean, do you think she'll try it again?
Chances are against it.
But I'd watch her.
I wouldn't leave her alone if she seems unusually depressed or insecure.
Better get some sleep yourself.
You look like hell.
Call me if you need me.
Thanks, Frank.
I really appreciate it.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
Fine.
Here.
Thank you.
Brought you a little soup.
It looks good.
I don't know what to say.
It frightens me thinking about it.
Don't think about it.
I don't mean me.
I mean you.
"Girl commits suicide in disc jockey's home."
It's not very good publicity for a man in your position.
Get some rest.
As soon as you feel better, I'll take you home.
Thank you, David.
I got your clothes hung up in the closet there.
Maybe you better answer the phone.
Yeah.
I'll get it in the other room.
Hello.
Hi.
I just wanted to check.
We still on for tonight?
Yeah, I'm ready to go.
What time is the party?
Madalyn's already left, and she won't be back for a long time and I was just thinking...
Would you be disappointed if we didn't go to the party and just stayed here instead?
I think I can bear up under it.
Don't be too long.
- That's me at the door.
- David the way I look at it, the hell with Sausalito.
Bye-bye.
Evelyn?
- What's the matter?
Take it easy.
- I had a dream.
I was drowning in the ocean and I called to you, but you just stood there watching.
Watching.
It was just a dream.
Oh, God, I'm so alone.
Hold me.
Hold me, Dave.
Please.
Yeah.
Tighter.
Tighter.
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.
David!
I woke up and you were gone.
If you have something planned for tonight, you could just take me home.
Maybe that'd be best.
No, no, there's nothing.
Good.
Isn't this nice?
Just us here, together.
Here we go again.
Stone-cold dead in the market.
Must have been quite a party.
Go away, Birdie.
Any other bodies, any other juiceheads around here?
Come back tomorrow, will you?
Or next year sometime.
I better check the workbench.
All right, break it up in here.
Looks like old times around this place.
Evelyn?
Lose something, tiger?
You couldn't find it within your heart to come back at a later time, could you?
This is a later time, pussycat.
I'm paying you back for the day I blew last week.
Evelyn?
Very funny, Birdie.
Very funny.
What I can't figure out is, with all this action going on in here what are you doing out there couching it?
What is this, some kind of Kinsey Report?
Do I come over to your house and ask a lot of dumb questions?
You just ought to, pussycat.
Might open up a whole new way of life to you.
Hold it.
Let's try to show a little class, shall we?
Mr. Garver's residence.
I'll see.
Do you want to talk to a Madge Brenner?
Yeah.
I want to talk to her.
Thanks.
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Garver?
Madge Brenner.
We like the tape on your show.
Like it very much.
There are one or two others in the running, but, frankly...
Can we have lunch today?
- Windjammer still good?
- Yeah, still very good.
Reserve a table in your name.
- See you then, Mr. Garver.
- Great.
Bye-bye.
Looks like we found Evelyn.
"Good morning, darling.
Gone shopping.
"Back in a flash with the hash."
A little humor in there.
"Love and kisses, Evelyn."
And then it says:
"If you can't find your keys, don't worry.
"I borrowed your car."
Here's your key, and here's your copy.
That'll be $0.40, please.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
David?
I stopped by my...
Hi.
Don't you look all gussied up?
Good.
I was gonna cook brunch but this calls for something more festive.
How about the Marquis?
My treat.
- After all I put you through, it's the least...
- I have a lunch date.
Business.
- Business?
- Yeah.
Can I have my car keys?
Sure.
I think you ought to take it easy, anyway.
Get some rest.
Yeah, I do feel a little tired.
Very funny, Dave.
Now, let's talk show.
Tell me, what do you think of the concept?
The unstructured the loosey-goosey, Monterey pop, Woodstock kind of thing?
I like it very much, and I think I can handle it.
So do I.
I'll keep this to promote your new career with.
You'll be working with kids, bright and marvelous.
But they take handling.
If this goes the way I think it will there's no reason in the world why...
- Isn't this cozy?
So this is your business lunch?
How's business?
Friend of yours?
- Just another trick.
- That's enough.
Is that your idea of a dish?
She's a little old for you, isn't she?
What is this, "Be Kind to Senior Citizens Week"?
Get outta here!
I don't mind you being a bastard, but do you have to be a tasteless one?
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
She couldn't get laid in a lumber camp!
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
You're hurting me!
Stop it, you dirty bastard!
No!
Stop it!
Dave!
No!
No!
Don't leave me!
Don't leave me!
She's nothing!
Nothing!
Nothing!
- I love you!
- Get her outta here.
Where to?
I did it because I love you.
Don't you understand that?
- I love you!
- Where to?
- Move!
- It's because I love you!
Dave, please.
This is a private beach.
- I want to talk to you.
- I don't want to talk to you.
Are you drunk?
No, but that's not a bad idea.
- Why, David?
- Why what?
Drunk?
No.
Why last night?
That's what I came to explain to you.
Okay, good.
I think we should understand each other.
I'm not very happy with you.
That's fair enough.
Whatever it was, you could have called me.
No, I couldn't.
Why not?
I couldn't tell you the truth last night.
I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.
Now, why do you have to say that?
I just didn't want to take a chance she'd try it again.
What if she does?
I swear to you, if she ever tries it I'd just let her go right on ahead.
God!
Oh, my God.
What in the...
Oh, God, help me!
Please, somebody, help me!
Help me, somebody!
Oh, God, help me!
- Stay back, buddy.
- I live here, man.
Is she your housecleaning lady, Garver?
Okay, boys, let's take her out.
Watch your step.
It's gonna cost you double to clean up this mess.
Watch your step.
- Dave Garver?
- Yeah.
I'm Sgt. McCallum.
Any ideas?
About what?
About your girlfriend in there.
That's not my girlfriend.
Let me get that straight right in front.
More or less a casual acquaintance, you'd say?
That's right.
You're saying she came by to hack up your wardrobe and your cleaning lady?
I'm not trying to tell you anything, Sergeant.
Maybe you ought to.
The lady almost got herself killed.
And I'm stumbling around in my stupid way trying to find out why.
What'll you have?
This Evelyn Draper, where does she come from?
I don't know.
- What about her family?
- I don't know that either.
She just listens to my radio show, and we met one night.
That's all.
- Practically a stranger.
- That's right.
Then how does she happen to have a key to your front door?
I don't know that either.
It boils down to, you don't know a hell of a lot, do you?
What it boils down to is, I'm getting sick of your questions.
And so am I!
But they get upset with me down at the store if I don't ask them.
- Just take her through.
I'll be right along.
- Right.
- Take her through what?
- Booking.
What she really needs is psychiatric help.
Really?
Now, look, those cuts on her wrists...
Don't know anything about those.
There's one other thing.
I know, "Don't leave town."
I was gonna say, "Why don't you play some Mantovani sometime?"
Didn't know you liked the show.
I don't.
I like Mantovani.
Go ahead, play!
All right!
Those of you who may have played brass instruments you know that was triple-tonguin', baby.
Let's give his tongue a nice hand!
He might just be the fastest tongue in the West!
- Come on.
- All right, I'm coming.
What do you say...
- Something to eat?
- I've got to pick up my roommate, Annabel.
- Madalyn's your roommate.
- I found my man, and I'm moving out.
- And Annabel's moving in.
- Right.
- 'Bye.
- Ciao.
See you later.
Thank you.
Thank you very kindly.
That was the Cannonball Adderley Group.
They're playing at the Monterey Jazz Festival with Duke Ellington, Woody Herman, Joe Williams and many others.
Still got tickets for Sunday.
So get on out there because that's where it's happening.
Now we're gonna hear from the Gator Creek Organization and Feelin' Fine.
KRML.
Dave Garver.
Hello.
Play Misty for me.
David?
I didn't mean to shake you up.
I'm sorry.
Pretty stupid of me.
I've been released.
Therapy.
It was a bad dream, but it's over.
- Where are you?
- The airport.
San Francisco.
I've only got a minute between planes.
- Got a job in Hawaii.
- You're all right then?
Fine, David.
Fine.
I just want to say how sorry I am about everything.
- Forget it.
I have.
- I hope so.
"Because this maiden she lived with no other thought
"Than to love and be loved by you."
Are you near a radio?
No.
But play it for me anyway.
Hello.
- Garver?
- Yeah.
Sgt. McCallum.
Sorry to wake you but something's come up.
I know.
She just paid me a visit with a butcher knife.
Why?
Because she was released on parole pending further legal action.
When?
A week ago.
I sure like the way you broke your ass to let me know!
- I just found out about it myself.
- Who's in charge down there anyway?
Now, look.
Do you want to help find her or would you rather just sit there and bellyache?
- All right.
- Good.
Now exactly what did she say to you?
I told you.
She said that she was well and that she was going to Hawaii.
What else?
- I already told you.
- Tell me again.
You know, you really make lousy conversation.
You make lousy coffee.
Come on, what else did she say?
Nothing, except...
- Except what?
- It was nothing.
It was a line from a poem.
- What poem?
- Lf I knew that, I'd know the line.
- Try to remember.
- You know, McCallum, it's getting late.
You're sounding very monotonous.
You're not exactly my idea of a swinging date either.
Good night, McCallum.
- What happened to the Mantovani?
- The what?
I heard the show, but I never did hear you play Mantovani.
You really did listen to the show?
Friend, if we had a TV down at the station I'd break my arm before I turned your show on.
Thanks a lot.
Just hope we're lucky enough to grab her the next time she tries it.
Tries what?
To kill you.
Yeah.
And if you're not lucky enough?
That'd be hell.
The guys down at the station would have to chip in and buy a TV.
You're a great comfort, Sergeant.
You will change the locks?
Hi.
Nothing like a nice brisk walk in the woods to put roses on a girl's cheeks.
How are you?
Not so good, honey.
- She's back.
- Who?
Evelyn Draper, the girl who tried to kill Birdie.
How can she be back?
I thought they'd put her in a state sanitarium.
- They did, but they let her out.
- Does that mean she's all right?
Theoretically.
What happens now?
I think you and I ought to stay away from each other for a couple of days just in case she's tagging after me.
She's already following you, isn't she?
I don't want you to worry about it.
I can handle myself.
Yeah.
So could Birdie.
All right then, you stand by.
They're all set to trace the call.
When she phones, just mention her by name right away, Evelyn and they start to trace her.
All you gotta do after that is just keep her talking.
Fifteen minutes before the hour here at KRML and here's It's Not Unusual.
I guess it hasn't come to you yet.
- What?
- What she said.
Over the phone last night?
Part of a poem or something.
You were gonna try to remember.
I thought I had that, but I've forgotten.
Is it that important?
Until we pick her up, everything's important.
What's wrong?
I'm worried about my girlfriend with all this going on.
They're so damn isolated down there.
I'm thinking the best thing to do is just have Al Monte sub for me.
The only chance we've got is when she phones in here tonight.
You've got to be here, right on that mike.
- Lf she phones.
- She will.
Believe me.
But only if you're here.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
If it'll make you feel better, I'll go over and check your girlfriend's house myself.
I'd sure appreciate that.
She lives on Spindrift Road.
I think it's the fourth or fifth house down.
- "Williams" is on the mailbox.
- Why don't you phone her?
- Okay.
- Tell her to be expecting me.
McCallum.
Thanks.
Public servant.
- Hello?
- Hi.
I'm just checking in.
You all right?
Marvelous.
I'm just getting ready to do my nails and I got your program on.
And Annabel's in the kitchen making a couple of coffee grogs.
What more could a girl ask for?
No, honey, everything's fine.
There's a Sgt. McCallum that's gonna drop by for a second to see if you've buttoned up all right.
Let him in, but nobody else.
Okay.
David, you want to play something soft and dreamy for us?
You got it.
Bye-bye.
'Bye, hon.
- Annabel, how's that stuff coming?
- Here's something soft and sentimental for Tobie and Annabel.
Hope you like cinnamon in yours.
Whatever's right.
Annabel.
Good?
Too much.
- So is this.
- Thank you.
Just one thing.
Do you mind?
No, be my guest.
The eyes are wrong.
David's are more...
How shall I say?
Colder.
I didn't know you knew David.
I didn't realize you and David were friends.
Friends?
No, not friends.
Not friends.
God, you're dumb.
"Because this maiden she lived with no other thought
"Than to love and be loved by you."
- Tobie?
- We're waiting for you, David.
This is Dave Garver with a little verse a little talk and five hours of music to be very, very nice to each other by.
Careful.
Careful.
I might put your eye out.
I'll bet David loves your eyes.
And your hair.
Does he run his fingers through your hair?
Have to get you all nice for David.
For David.
I hope he likes what he sees when he walks in here because that's what he's taking to hell with him.
Miss Williams?
McCallum?
And now we have a pretty one for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night.
It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty.
And this one is especially for Evelyn.
Subtitles by SOFTITLER
Hey, hey, you're digging the master jock for solid rock Sweet Al Monte blasting, babies.
Being bold and pouring coal on KRML in quaint little Carmel-by-the-Sea.
We're next door to magnificent Monterey, home of the annual jazz festival.
Although it's four months away, you got to get your tickets because they're going fast and it can't last.
The time is 7:54 and there's a breeze of 50 degrees around your loving hips, and there's a taste of fog.
I say we got a bowl of soul, and if you think your heart can take it...
Now we're gonna wrap it up for the week, folks.
A brand-new release from the funk capital of the world, Squeeze Me.
Here he comes, the big "D" himself, Dave Garver.
And Dave is gonna bring you five hours of mellow groove.
In the meantime, this is Sweet Al Monte saying:
"Hang in there, babies, because everything is going to be everything."
'Bye.
What's that letter you got there?
Is that that Frisco gig?
Yeah.
All right, so what's happening?
They want the usual thing:
A biography, pictures.
Really?
Is that that Madge Brenner chick?
Yeah, she's the one putting it together.
In that case, David, you're in.
How do you figure that?
Now, David, come on, man.
Are you kidding?
She's a grandmother.
So when did that ever stop you?
You better get a move on.
I already played your theme.
Yeah, I heard it.
You're a real human being.
And you're on the air, baby.
All right.
"Men have destroyed the roads of wonder
"And their cities squat like black toads
"In the orchards of life nothing is clean or real
"Or as a girl, naked to love or be a man with"
This is Dave Garver with a little verse, a little talk and five hours of music to be very, very nice to each other by.
- KRML, Dave Garver speaking.
- Hello?
- Hi, what'll it be?
- Play Misty for me.
Misty?
We have that right on the play rack.
Thanks for calling.
I see you got your little Misty chick calling you again.
All righty.
- Swing along.
- You take it easy now.
See you in the a.m.
KRML, Dave Garver.
- Hi, Murphy.
- Hi, Dave.
No messages for you.
- No?
- Heard your show tonight.
It sure beats hell out of working for a living.
- Thanks for the plug.
- What are friends for?
- Bartender.
- Coke?
Coming right up.
She's waiting for someone.
You sure?
That's what she says.
Guys have been striking out all night.
One game?
- Cry Bastion?
- What else?
Okay, coach.
You asked for it.
Don't take all night.
Move.
Okay.
Move.
Palfrey's Gambit.
Dirty rat.
Are we playing Copenhagen rules?
Make it easy on yourself, Murph.
Cry Bastion.
Sorry, no Bastion.
Damn, I didn't see that.
It's too bad, Murphy.
Too bad.
- Careful now.
- That ought to do it.
Be really careful now.
Careful.
Hi.
He doesn't see it.
Yeah?
Cry Bastion.
Fool's ploy, my man.
Fool's ploy.
Care to play the winner?
I'll just watch.
- My name is Dave Garver.
- Evelyn Draper.
Sit down, Evelyn Draper?
Care for a drink?
Okay.
- What'll it be?
- Surprise me.
- Screwdriver.
- Nice game.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- What happened?
- I won.
How?
When?
When you said, "Okay."
I ought to be mad.
But you're not.
Not really.
It certainly was nice of you to bring me home, Mr. Garver?
That's right.
I don't think I've been stood up on a date since the ninth grade back in Albany.
Is something wrong?
No, I keep getting the feeling I know you from someplace.
- You do?
- Yeah.
Here.
Why don't you let me do that?
Oh, no.
That's all right.
I've got it.
Why don't you see if you can get the fire started?
All right.
There are some matches right next to it.
All right.
It's getting late.
You're sure I'm not keeping you up?
No.
I rarely get to bed before 3:00 a.m.
I didn't have a date tonight.
I went there because you talk about it on your program sometimes and I wanted to meet you.
I listen to you all the time.
I knew somebody was out there.
- You're making fun of me.
- No, I'm not.
- Say something else.
- Such as?
Play Misty for me?
Very good.
- You sure I'm not keeping you up?
- Don't you like me?
You're a very nice girl.
But who needs nice girls?
No, I like them.
I'm kind of hung up on one.
And you don't want to complicate your life.
- That's exactly right.
- Neither do I.
But that's no reason we shouldn't sleep together tonight if we feel like it.
Solid silicone.
Hi, David, my man!
How you been, baby?
See you got the joint cleaned up for once.
The Heavy digs it.
- Care for a beer?
- Not really.
I could go for something more uplifting, but not a brew, my man.
Beer is all we've got.
You're gonna have to ease on out.
I got a lot of work to do today.
You don't understand.
I've been sent here to get you.
By whom?
That old chick I go with.
What's her name?
- Carol?
- That's the one.
Girl thinks you've been working too hard.
She said we should get together tonight.
Who's this "we"?
Me, you, her and one of them hens that you can dig up.
There is a fantastic new Mexican place in Carmel called Susinos.
The albóndigas soup is unbelievable.
It is a mind-bender...
I know the joint, but I don't have a date, and I got a lot to do.
Big deal, man.
Get one!
If you have any problems getting one, I'll get one for you as nice as I look.
It's too late, and besides, I've got a lot of work to do.
But you gotta eat, David.
I'm gonna whip up something here in my own kitchen.
You know, David, I'm really worried about your social life.
You'll make someone a tremendous mother.
Too narrow in the pelvis.
I sure appreciate you dropping by, Al.
Come by again sometime, anytime.
Never let it be said that Sweet Al Monte can't take a hint.
- Who's hinting?
- Hi.
Why, hi there, yourself.
Dave Garver live here?
That depends on your point of view.
Hi.
This stuff weighs a ton.
Where's the kitchen?
Right inside.
Just come on in and help yourself.
Swing right around the bend there.
I know, David, she's from Chicken Delight.
Look, don't work too hard, my man.
Don't strain yourself.
How come you don't have any beer?
And what is this?
A shrunken head?
Does that guy live here?
- I wanted...
- I hope you like steak.
- You look like a steak-and-potatoes type.
- Hang on.
I said to myself, a nice salad with Roquefort and tomatoes and baked potato with...
- What's going on here?
- Don't send me away.
- No, I want to ask you a question.
I just wanted to surprise you.
Surprise?
What happens if he and I had been talking business?
Or maybe I have female company and you come traipsing in with groceries?
That would be some surprise.
I'm sorry.
Keep that stuff.
I think I've lost my appetite.
Hang on a minute.
I'm just trying to tell you something.
I don't understand.
Should I go or stay?
What?
I'm telling you there's a telephone, and I pick it up and I dial it.
You answer and I say, "What are you doing?"
And I say, "I'll be right over."
Fine.
Next time, why don't we do it that way?
Okay.
Any way you like.
Next time.
How do you like your steak?
Extremely rare.
That's just how I like mine.
Extremely rare.
I'll get some wine here.
A little vino.
Vino!
All this and heaven, too!
Terrific!
This is gonna be some dinner.
What happened to that discussion we had last time?
You know, the deal about no strings and all that?
There are no strings, but I never said anything about not coming back for seconds, did I?
That's right.
You didn't.
When will I see you?
I'll give you a call.
- Dave, you're funny.
- How's that?
If you want to keep playing these games, okay, but they're really not necessary anymore, not for me.
People are trying to sleep here!
People are trying to talk here!
- How'd you like to tell that to the law?
- How'd you like to go screw yourself?
Take it easy!
Guy's just trying to sleep, that's all.
You're right.
It's a terrific morning.
Why be selfish with it?
Bye-bye.
Wait a minute!
Yeah?
Excuse me, I saw the sweater, and I thought you were somebody else.
You must be David.
Where have you been?
Around.
I was trying to join the revolt against the representational.
Didn't quite make that though.
So now I'm just trying to play it cool.
Not quite making that either.
Got time for a break?
- Yeah.
- Let's go.
- When did you get in town?
- Yesterday.
- You weren't gonna call me?
- Of course I was.
I had to get settled first.
You shouldn't lend your sweaters to blabbermouths.
You've gotten thinner.
No!
Well, so much for Sausalito.
Sausalito?
That's where I was staying.
Jay Jay's place.
- Jay Jay's place?
- It's nothing much, really.
It's just a little pied-à-terre, but it's handy to the fleet.
You told me you didn't know where she was.
So I lied.
Picket me.
- Thanks a lot.
- Listen, stud, it wasn't my idea.
You should have caught her act.
The whole Bette Davis, through-finished-kaput scene.
- And at 3:00 a.m.
- Come on, Jay Jay.
He's exaggerating.
I'll check with Malcolm.
Maybe I can get you the afternoon off.
What happened, pussycat?
He ran into Anjelica.
She told him I was back.
That bitch should be hung by the thumbs or something equally appropriate.
It's all set up.
Let's go.
It's nothing personal, really.
I happen to think she could be a first-rate artist if her damned hormones didn't get in the way.
- There's not much he can do about that.
- He could kill himself.
Jay Jay, why don't you go cruise some sailors?
Please, don't mention seafood.
Come on.
I really missed this place.
I missed you.
You'd do me a big favor if you didn't say things like that.
Why is that?
I don't know.
Somehow it brings out the worst in me.
It makes me want to say things like, "How's that redhead?"
What?
The redhead, the one who worked in the bookstore.
She went back to Berkeley or whatever.
That's too bad.
You always have that blonde from Santa Barbara to fall back on.
If that's the phrase I'm looking for, and I think it probably is.
What are we gonna do?
Go through a whole list?
Is that it?
Who's got that kind of time?
I just don't know if I'm up to it anymore.
Up to what?
Those nights sitting and waiting for you to finish your program and come by.
Nights when it would start to get late and I'd start to think:
"I wonder if he's run himself off a cliff or maybe he's run into a blonde."
There was a time when I started rooting for the accident.
I mean, if it was a choice between that and a blonde.
You don't know how secure you make me feel.
I didn't wish you anything too serious.
Just a couple of months in traction.
You're all heart.
You know, the thing I hate the most in the whole world is a jealous female and that's what I was becoming.
That's why I had to split.
I was starting to be one of my most unfavorite people.
I hated it.
I know you did, too.
That still works anyway.
- Too well sometimes.
- What does that mean?
I mean, there's a little spot in the middle of each day, just about your size.
There's lots of girls my size if you're really looking.
I'm not.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You mean you've given up girls?
I haven't exactly been the monk of the month or anything like that but I have been making an effort.
There must be a real consternation among those "gropies."
That's "groupies," isn't it?
I don't know, "groupies, gropies..."
You know, you've got to be fair.
It hasn't just been my fault.
Listen, I know.
They kept overpowering you.
You get a little bit of the blame, too, you know.
You and that parade of roommates that keep moving in and out of your place.
I didn't realize they were such a trial to you.
What trial?
I enjoyed it.
You and I sitting in front of the fireplace and then some chick sitting there with a bathrobe on, eating Fig Newtons.
What about the one with the St. Bernard?
She was a real winner.
She took up enough space.
And then that other one that took the flute lessons.
Yeah, maybe it was a little rough on you.
I can think of a thousand reasons why we should try again.
I've got about seven billion things to do.
What do you think?
You want to try for a new start, right from the letter "A"?
- What am I gonna do with you?
- A lot.
Hi.
Excuse me.
Hi.
- You've met Anjelica, my...
- Roommate.
Yes.
I think I'll drive into Carmel and see if I can't find some cleaning solvent.
There's plenty under the sink.
Okay.
This house ought to have a revolving door.
You know when my father left me this house, he left me payments.
I can't handle that expense by myself and most girls don't like the isolation.
- It's a long way from town.
- I know.
I better get back to work.
- Thanks.
- That's it, "thanks"?
Four months in Sausalito is a long time.
I am not gonna get back on that same old merry-go-round again.
What do I have to do, give you a notarized statement?
I need a couple of more days to try and figure out where I'm at.
Okay.
You get your bearings, and then you'll give me a call, all right?
- Hi, Murph.
- Hi, Dave.
Sardine Factory.
Dave Garver?
You said this is Evelyn?
No.
Sorry, you've just missed him.
- What do you mean?
- He's gone.
He's not here.
I think you'd better look again.
Believe me, you just missed him.
Now if you're interested in someone more sophisticated I'll be happy to...
That's what I get for being a dirty old man.
There's a message for you, a Madge somebody from San Francisco.
- Brenner?
- That's it.
Al Monte gave her this number.
"Received pictures and biography.
"Please send a two-hour tape of your show as soon as possible."
- Thanks, Murph.
- Don't mention it.
I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be your social secretary.
You will put that on my tab?
Surprise!
What are you doing here?
I was calling you from that phone booth and he told me you'd left and I was staring right at your car.
Isn't that funny?
Yeah, kind of funny.
Why didn't you take my call?
Where does it say I gotta drop everything and answer the phone every time it rings?
Do you know your nostrils flare out into little wings when you're mad?
- It's kind of cute.
- Come on, Evelyn.
I gotta go.
- I'd love a Coke.
- Not now, I gotta get to the station.
No, you don't.
You're talking to your No. 1 fan.
You don't work tonight.
I've got this show that I'm trying to set and it's very important to me.
That means I gotta pick the music, write the lead-ins and find some poetry.
- Come on, will you?
- Poetry?
- Let me help you.
I'm terrific with poetry...
- Not tonight!
Does he want his keys?
- Come on, Evelyn.
- Speak.
- Come on!
- God!
Good boy!
Let's hear it.
Come on.
Come on.
Give me my keys.
- Come on.
Give me the keys.
- Come on.
Give me the keys, goddamn it!
- Having some trouble, lady?
- Get lost!
Yeah, get lost, assholes!
Let's split.
He's got enough trouble already.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
'Bye.
See you later.
Hi.
Get all your work done?
What do you want, Evelyn?
One Coke?
I'll tell you, tonight I'm really whipped.
What time is it?
Time for me to go home.
Go back to sleep.
- Hey, I've got an idea.
- What's that?
Some night this week, after the show corned beef and potato salad, dill pickles, the whole bit.
My place.
Deal?
I'll call you.
Thursday's good for me.
And now from KRML, the big-band sounds of Dee Barton.
Here's a fresh reel of tape for your air check.
- You want me to thread it up?
- No, leave it here.
Thanks.
I think I will go out and hit the streets, but before doing that I will blow me a little number.
Care to partake?
Take it in the other room.
I get zonked just breathing the air here.
All right, be that way.
- AI?
- Yeah?
Do you ever find yourself being completely smothered by somebody?
- Anybody I know?
- You met her at my house the other day.
Chicken Delight!
That's what I call a pretty good smothering.
You start a relationship thinking you're gonna be completely honest and suddenly the whole thing gets out of hand.
What's the problem?
The problem is I've been trying to uncomplicate my life and now I can't even answer the door.
Besides, Tobie's back.
Oh, really?
Tobie?
When?
- I ran into her Sunday.
- That was a goody.
I'll tell you the truth.
I've always thought Tobie was one of the foxiest chicks on the peninsula.
And why you gotta have so much action, I just don't understand it anyway.
It's just a hang-up I have, or had.
But now that I seem to have that straightened out I can't seem to solve this other problem.
Well, you know what they always say, my man.
No, what?
"He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword."
Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
Later.
We'll have more smooth sounds in just one minute but first, at ten minutes to the hour, we're broadcasting from KRML in the Carmel Rancho Shopping Center home of the buccaneer, the man's boutique.
KRML, Dave Garver speaking.
The whole point in having an answering service is to call in once in a while to check for messages.
Hi, Evelyn.
What's happening?
What could be happening, darling?
You're not here yet.
"Yet"?
I hope you like pastrami, because there was no corned beef.
Now, wait a minute.
Just hold on.
Are you trying to tell me you forgot that we have a date tonight?
I thought I was supposed to call you on that.
I feel kind of silly sitting here in my brand-new lounging pajamas.
I just assumed...
Apparently, I assumed wrong.
That's right.
You assumed wrong.
You don't have to come over if you've got something better to do.
I'll be over in a little while.
You and I are gonna have to have a talk.
Whatever you say.
In the meantime, haven't you forgotten something else?
What's that?
Weren't you gonna play Misty for me?
Yeah.
I have that one right here.
Thank you, darling.
And now we have a pretty one for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night.
It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty.
And this one is especially for Evelyn.
Just a second.
Come in.
Hi.
Hi.
- Cold night?
- Yeah.
But you got here anyway.
Stout fella.
There's something we're gonna have to get straight.
It's amazing what a man will go through for a hot pastrami sandwich.
- Look...
- Wait a minute.
You haven't told me how nice I look.
- You look fine.
- The sales lady guaranteed you'd flip.
- Now, listen.
Can we talk?
- Wait.
First...
Surprise.
- Don't you like them?
- Yeah, they're great, but...
Don't spoil my fun, darling.
I love to give you things.
It's Madame Butterfly time.
First, friendly neighborhood geisha remove honorable shoes.
Stop it, Evelyn!
Now, we've gotta talk!
Have I done something wrong?
I'm just trying to be straight with you, that's all.
Be nice to me instead.
Jesus Christ!
I don't understand.
Are you trying to say you don't love me anymore?
I never told you that I loved you.
Not in words maybe, but there are ways of saying things that have nothing to do with words.
I'm sorry you read it that way.
It's that other bitch, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
The silver-framed picture in your dresser.
- That picture's got nothing to do with you.
- What does have to do with me?
- I never lied to you.
- Big deal.
He never lied to me.
What do you want for that?
The Congressional Medal of Honor?
- So long.
- What am I supposed to do?
Sit here all dressed up in my little whore suit waiting for my lord and master to call?
- Nobody asked you to wait for anything.
- You're not dumping me!
- Get off my back, Evelyn!
- Get off your back?
That's where you've been keeping me, isn't it?
You're nothing!
You're not even good in bed!
I just felt sorry for you, that's all!
Bastard!
You poor, pathetic bastard!
Hello?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean those things I said.
Will I see you tomorrow?
You don't listen, do you?
Let me come over.
If I could just see you, just talk to you.
- No, Evelyn.
- But I love you, David.
I love you.
David!
If I could just...
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Why?
No, come on.
You haven't heard a word I've been saying.
- I have.
I've heard everything you said.
- You did?
All right, tell me.
- You don't believe me?
- Go ahead.
Okay, wise chick.
We're supposed to go to a party at Big Sur tomorrow night.
I'm supposed to meet you there at 9:00.
And the address is...
I didn't tell you that.
See how you are?
I don't know myself yet.
I'll call you tomorrow about it.
Okay.
You call me tomorrow.
Honey, we better go.
- We're just getting to the best part.
- But I've got to pick Anjelica up at 6:00.
God!
How the pain is setting in.
Come on.
She's a very nice girl.
Anyway, she's moving out tonight.
Now, that's about the best news I've heard in years.
And Madalyn's moving in.
Madalyn?
Shit.
- What's going on?
- Don't tell me he was asleep!
What else at this hour of the morning?
I'm surprised his conscience was that clear!
- What do you want, Evelyn?
- "What do you want, Evelyn?"
Do I have to want something?
Can't I just come over?
Or is it inconvenient?
- Wait a...
- Did I make a boo-boo?
Has someone been sleeping in Papa Bear's bed?
Wait a minute, goddamn it!
"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
I thought...
God, don't look at me that way, Dave.
I just don't know what to say to you.
I'm sorry I mistrusted you.
I know you'd never spoil it.
To spoil what?
What we have between us.
We don't have a goddamn thing!
How many ways do I have to say this?
I don't care how many ways you say it, it's not true!
- What do I have to do to convince you?
- It's not true!
It's not!
What are you doing?
I'm gonna get dressed and drive you home, that's what.
Why are you playing these games?
Why are you pretending you don't love me?
I don't even believe I'm hearing this.
But I love you!
You haven't got the vaguest idea what love is.
We don't even know each other.
Wait a minute.
You don't have to do that.
I'm okay.
I can drive home.
Are you sure?
Positive.
I'm fine.
Let me just wash my face.
You ready?
You okay?
Oh, no.
How's she gonna be?
I sutured the wounds.
It wasn't quite as bad as it looked.
It couldn't have been.
You know, Dave, I'm supposed to turn a report in on this.
But you won't.
You see, Tobie's back.
I'd rather tell her, and not have her read it in the paper somewhere.
I didn't know that.
I'll tell Marie.
We'll do the spaghetti number.
- Somebody gonna be around here today?
- Me.
I'll be here.
I bombed her out pretty good.
Let her sleep it off before you take her home.
- And how long will that be?
- It's hard to say.
Why?
- I'd like to take Tobie out tonight.
- No problem.
She'll wake up sometime this afternoon, 5:00 or so.
Is she gonna be all right?
The cuts were really pretty superficial.
I mean, do you think she'll try it again?
Chances are against it.
But I'd watch her.
I wouldn't leave her alone if she seems unusually depressed or insecure.
Better get some sleep yourself.
You look like hell.
Call me if you need me.
Thanks, Frank.
I really appreciate it.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
Fine.
Here.
Thank you.
Brought you a little soup.
It looks good.
I don't know what to say.
It frightens me thinking about it.
Don't think about it.
I don't mean me.
I mean you.
"Girl commits suicide in disc jockey's home."
It's not very good publicity for a man in your position.
Get some rest.
As soon as you feel better, I'll take you home.
Thank you, David.
I got your clothes hung up in the closet there.
Maybe you better answer the phone.
Yeah.
I'll get it in the other room.
Hello.
Hi.
I just wanted to check.
We still on for tonight?
Yeah, I'm ready to go.
What time is the party?
Madalyn's already left, and she won't be back for a long time and I was just thinking...
Would you be disappointed if we didn't go to the party and just stayed here instead?
I think I can bear up under it.
Don't be too long.
- That's me at the door.
- David the way I look at it, the hell with Sausalito.
Bye-bye.
Evelyn?
- What's the matter?
Take it easy.
- I had a dream.
I was drowning in the ocean and I called to you, but you just stood there watching.
Watching.
It was just a dream.
Oh, God, I'm so alone.
Hold me.
Hold me, Dave.
Please.
Yeah.
Tighter.
Tighter.
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.
David!
I woke up and you were gone.
If you have something planned for tonight, you could just take me home.
Maybe that'd be best.
No, no, there's nothing.
Good.
Isn't this nice?
Just us here, together.
Here we go again.
Stone-cold dead in the market.
Must have been quite a party.
Go away, Birdie.
Any other bodies, any other juiceheads around here?
Come back tomorrow, will you?
Or next year sometime.
I better check the workbench.
All right, break it up in here.
Looks like old times around this place.
Evelyn?
Lose something, tiger?
You couldn't find it within your heart to come back at a later time, could you?
This is a later time, pussycat.
I'm paying you back for the day I blew last week.
Evelyn?
Very funny, Birdie.
Very funny.
What I can't figure out is, with all this action going on in here what are you doing out there couching it?
What is this, some kind of Kinsey Report?
Do I come over to your house and ask a lot of dumb questions?
You just ought to, pussycat.
Might open up a whole new way of life to you.
Hold it.
Let's try to show a little class, shall we?
Mr. Garver's residence.
I'll see.
Do you want to talk to a Madge Brenner?
Yeah.
I want to talk to her.
Thanks.
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Garver?
Madge Brenner.
We like the tape on your show.
Like it very much.
There are one or two others in the running, but, frankly...
Can we have lunch today?
- Windjammer still good?
- Yeah, still very good.
Reserve a table in your name.
- See you then, Mr. Garver.
- Great.
Bye-bye.
Looks like we found Evelyn.
"Good morning, darling.
Gone shopping.
"Back in a flash with the hash."
A little humor in there.
"Love and kisses, Evelyn."
And then it says:
"If you can't find your keys, don't worry.
"I borrowed your car."
Here's your key, and here's your copy.
That'll be $0.40, please.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
David?
I stopped by my...
Hi.
Don't you look all gussied up?
Good.
I was gonna cook brunch but this calls for something more festive.
How about the Marquis?
My treat.
- After all I put you through, it's the least...
- I have a lunch date.
Business.
- Business?
- Yeah.
Can I have my car keys?
Sure.
I think you ought to take it easy, anyway.
Get some rest.
Yeah, I do feel a little tired.
Very funny, Dave.
Now, let's talk show.
Tell me, what do you think of the concept?
The unstructured the loosey-goosey, Monterey pop, Woodstock kind of thing?
I like it very much, and I think I can handle it.
So do I.
I'll keep this to promote your new career with.
You'll be working with kids, bright and marvelous.
But they take handling.
If this goes the way I think it will there's no reason in the world why...
- Isn't this cozy?
So this is your business lunch?
How's business?
Friend of yours?
- Just another trick.
- That's enough.
Is that your idea of a dish?
She's a little old for you, isn't she?
What is this, "Be Kind to Senior Citizens Week"?
Get outta here!
I don't mind you being a bastard, but do you have to be a tasteless one?
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
She couldn't get laid in a lumber camp!
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
You're hurting me!
Stop it, you dirty bastard!
No!
Stop it!
Dave!
No!
No!
Don't leave me!
Don't leave me!
She's nothing!
Nothing!
Nothing!
- I love you!
- Get her outta here.
Where to?
I did it because I love you.
Don't you understand that?
- I love you!
- Where to?
- Move!
- It's because I love you!
Dave, please.
This is a private beach.
- I want to talk to you.
- I don't want to talk to you.
Are you drunk?
No, but that's not a bad idea.
- Why, David?
- Why what?
Drunk?
No.
Why last night?
That's what I came to explain to you.
Okay, good.
I think we should understand each other.
I'm not very happy with you.
That's fair enough.
Whatever it was, you could have called me.
No, I couldn't.
Why not?
I couldn't tell you the truth last night.
I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.
Now, why do you have to say that?
I just didn't want to take a chance she'd try it again.
What if she does?
I swear to you, if she ever tries it I'd just let her go right on ahead.
God!
Oh, my God.
What in the...
Oh, God, help me!
Please, somebody, help me!
Help me, somebody!
Oh, God, help me!
- Stay back, buddy.
- I live here, man.
Is she your housecleaning lady, Garver?
Okay, boys, let's take her out.
Watch your step.
It's gonna cost you double to clean up this mess.
Watch your step.
- Dave Garver?
- Yeah.
I'm Sgt. McCallum.
Any ideas?
About what?
About your girlfriend in there.
That's not my girlfriend.
Let me get that straight right in front.
More or less a casual acquaintance, you'd say?
That's right.
You're saying she came by to hack up your wardrobe and your cleaning lady?
I'm not trying to tell you anything, Sergeant.
Maybe you ought to.
The lady almost got herself killed.
And I'm stumbling around in my stupid way trying to find out why.
What'll you have?
This Evelyn Draper, where does she come from?
I don't know.
- What about her family?
- I don't know that either.
She just listens to my radio show, and we met one night.
That's all.
- Practically a stranger.
- That's right.
Then how does she happen to have a key to your front door?
I don't know that either.
It boils down to, you don't know a hell of a lot, do you?
What it boils down to is, I'm getting sick of your questions.
And so am I!
But they get upset with me down at the store if I don't ask them.
- Just take her through.
I'll be right along.
- Right.
- Take her through what?
- Booking.
What she really needs is psychiatric help.
Really?
Now, look, those cuts on her wrists...
Don't know anything about those.
There's one other thing.
I know, "Don't leave town."
I was gonna say, "Why don't you play some Mantovani sometime?"
Didn't know you liked the show.
I don't.
I like Mantovani.
Go ahead, play!
All right!
Those of you who may have played brass instruments you know that was triple-tonguin', baby.
Let's give his tongue a nice hand!
He might just be the fastest tongue in the West!
- Come on.
- All right, I'm coming.
What do you say...
- Something to eat?
- I've got to pick up my roommate, Annabel.
- Madalyn's your roommate.
- I found my man, and I'm moving out.
- And Annabel's moving in.
- Right.
- 'Bye.
- Ciao.
See you later.
Thank you.
Thank you very kindly.
That was the Cannonball Adderley Group.
They're playing at the Monterey Jazz Festival with Duke Ellington, Woody Herman, Joe Williams and many others.
Still got tickets for Sunday.
So get on out there because that's where it's happening.
Now we're gonna hear from the Gator Creek Organization and Feelin' Fine.
KRML.
Dave Garver.
Hello.
Play Misty for me.
David?
I didn't mean to shake you up.
I'm sorry.
Pretty stupid of me.
I've been released.
Therapy.
It was a bad dream, but it's over.
- Where are you?
- The airport.
San Francisco.
I've only got a minute between planes.
- Got a job in Hawaii.
- You're all right then?
Fine, David.
Fine.
I just want to say how sorry I am about everything.
- Forget it.
I have.
- I hope so.
"Because this maiden she lived with no other thought
"Than to love and be loved by you."
Are you near a radio?
No.
But play it for me anyway.
Hello.
- Garver?
- Yeah.
Sgt. McCallum.
Sorry to wake you but something's come up.
I know.
She just paid me a visit with a butcher knife.
Why?
Because she was released on parole pending further legal action.
When?
A week ago.
I sure like the way you broke your ass to let me know!
- I just found out about it myself.
- Who's in charge down there anyway?
Now, look.
Do you want to help find her or would you rather just sit there and bellyache?
- All right.
- Good.
Now exactly what did she say to you?
I told you.
She said that she was well and that she was going to Hawaii.
What else?
- I already told you.
- Tell me again.
You know, you really make lousy conversation.
You make lousy coffee.
Come on, what else did she say?
Nothing, except...
- Except what?
- It was nothing.
It was a line from a poem.
- What poem?
- Lf I knew that, I'd know the line.
- Try to remember.
- You know, McCallum, it's getting late.
You're sounding very monotonous.
You're not exactly my idea of a swinging date either.
Good night, McCallum.
- What happened to the Mantovani?
- The what?
I heard the show, but I never did hear you play Mantovani.
You really did listen to the show?
Friend, if we had a TV down at the station I'd break my arm before I turned your show on.
Thanks a lot.
Just hope we're lucky enough to grab her the next time she tries it.
Tries what?
To kill you.
Yeah.
And if you're not lucky enough?
That'd be hell.
The guys down at the station would have to chip in and buy a TV.
You're a great comfort, Sergeant.
You will change the locks?
Hi.
Nothing like a nice brisk walk in the woods to put roses on a girl's cheeks.
How are you?
Not so good, honey.
- She's back.
- Who?
Evelyn Draper, the girl who tried to kill Birdie.
How can she be back?
I thought they'd put her in a state sanitarium.
- They did, but they let her out.
- Does that mean she's all right?
Theoretically.
What happens now?
I think you and I ought to stay away from each other for a couple of days just in case she's tagging after me.
She's already following you, isn't she?
I don't want you to worry about it.
I can handle myself.
Yeah.
So could Birdie.
All right then, you stand by.
They're all set to trace the call.
When she phones, just mention her by name right away, Evelyn and they start to trace her.
All you gotta do after that is just keep her talking.
Fifteen minutes before the hour here at KRML and here's It's Not Unusual.
I guess it hasn't come to you yet.
- What?
- What she said.
Over the phone last night?
Part of a poem or something.
You were gonna try to remember.
I thought I had that, but I've forgotten.
Is it that important?
Until we pick her up, everything's important.
What's wrong?
I'm worried about my girlfriend with all this going on.
They're so damn isolated down there.
I'm thinking the best thing to do is just have Al Monte sub for me.
The only chance we've got is when she phones in here tonight.
You've got to be here, right on that mike.
- Lf she phones.
- She will.
Believe me.
But only if you're here.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
If it'll make you feel better, I'll go over and check your girlfriend's house myself.
I'd sure appreciate that.
She lives on Spindrift Road.
I think it's the fourth or fifth house down.
- "Williams" is on the mailbox.
- Why don't you phone her?
- Okay.
- Tell her to be expecting me.
McCallum.
Thanks.
Public servant.
- Hello?
- Hi.
I'm just checking in.
You all right?
Marvelous.
I'm just getting ready to do my nails and I got your program on.
And Annabel's in the kitchen making a couple of coffee grogs.
What more could a girl ask for?
No, honey, everything's fine.
There's a Sgt. McCallum that's gonna drop by for a second to see if you've buttoned up all right.
Let him in, but nobody else.
Okay.
David, you want to play something soft and dreamy for us?
You got it.
Bye-bye.
'Bye, hon.
- Annabel, how's that stuff coming?
- Here's something soft and sentimental for Tobie and Annabel.
Hope you like cinnamon in yours.
Whatever's right.
Annabel.
Good?
Too much.
- So is this.
- Thank you.
Just one thing.
Do you mind?
No, be my guest.
The eyes are wrong.
David's are more...
How shall I say?
Colder.
I didn't know you knew David.
I didn't realize you and David were friends.
Friends?
No, not friends.
Not friends.
God, you're dumb.
"Because this maiden she lived with no other thought
"Than to love and be loved by you."
- Tobie?
- We're waiting for you, David.
This is Dave Garver with a little verse a little talk and five hours of music to be very, very nice to each other by.
Careful.
Careful.
I might put your eye out.
I'll bet David loves your eyes.
And your hair.
Does he run his fingers through your hair?
Have to get you all nice for David.
For David.
I hope he likes what he sees when he walks in here because that's what he's taking to hell with him.
Miss Williams?
McCallum?
And now we have a pretty one for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night.
It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty.
And this one is especially for Evelyn.
Hey, hey, you're digging the master jock for solid rock Sweet Al Monte blasting, babies.
Being bold and pouring coal on KRML in quaint little Carmel-by-the-Sea.
We're next door to magnificent Monterey, home of the annualjazz festival.
Although it's four months away, you got to get your tickets because they're going fast and it can't last.
The time is 7:54 and there's a breeze of 50 degrees around your loving hips, and there's a taste of fog.
I say we got a bowl of soul, and if you think your heart can take it...
Now we're gonna wrap it up for the week, folks.
A brand-new release from the funk capital of the world, Squeeze Me.
Here he comes, the big "D" himself, Dave Garver.
And Dave is gonna bring you five hours of mellow groove.
In the meantime, this is Sweet Al Monte saying:
"Hang in there, babies, because everything is going to be everything."
'Bye.
What's that letter you got there?
Is that that Frisco gig?
Yeah.
All right, so what's happening?
They want the usual thing:
A biography, pictures.
Really?
Is that that Madge Brenner chick?
Yeah, she's the one putting it together.
In that case, David, you're in.
How do you figure that?
Now, David, come on, man.
Are you kidding?
She's a grandmother.
So when did that ever stop you?
You better get a move on.
I already played your theme.
Yeah, I heard it.
You're a real human being.
And you're on the air, baby.
All right.
"Men have destroyed the roads of wonder
"And their cities squat like black toads
"In the orchards of life nothing is clean or real
"Or as a girl, naked to love or be a man with"
This is Dave Garver with a little verse, a little talk and five hours of music to be very, very nice to each other by.
- KRML, Dave Garver speaking.
- Hello?
- Hi, what'll it be?
- Play Misty for me.
Misty?
We have that right on the play rack.
Thanks for calling.
I see you got your little Misty chick calling you again.
All righty.
- Swing along.
- You take it easy now.
See you in the a. m.
KRML, Dave Garver.
- Hi, Murphy.
- Hi, Dave.
No messages for you.
- No?
- Heard your show tonight.
It sure beats hell out of working for a living.
- Thanks for the plug.
- What are friends for?
- Bartender.
- Coke?
Coming right up.
She's waiting for someone.
You sure?
That's what she says.
Guys have been striking out all night.
One game?
- Cry Bastion?
- What else?
Okay, coach.
You asked for it.
Don't take all night.
Move.
Okay.
Move.
Palfrey's Gambit.
Dirty rat.
Are we playing Copenhagen rules?
Make it easy on yourself, Murph.
Cry Bastion.
Sorry, no Bastion.
Damn, I didn't see that.
It's too bad, Murphy.
Too bad.
- Careful now.
- That ought to do it.
Be really careful now.
Careful.
Hi.
He doesn't see it.
Yeah?
Cry Bastion.
Fool's ploy, my man.
Fool's ploy.
Care to play the winner?
I'll just watch.
- My name is Dave Garver.
- Evelyn Draper.
Sit down, Evelyn Draper?
Care for a drink?
Okay.
- What'll it be?
- Surprise me.
- Screwdriver.
- Nice game.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- What happened?
- I won.
How?
When?
When you said, "Okay."
I ought to be mad.
But you're not.
Not really.
It certainly was nice of you to bring me home, Mr. Garver?
That's right.
I don't think I've been stood up on a date since the ninth grade back in Albany.
Is something wrong?
No, I keep getting the feeling I know you from someplace.
- You do?
- Yeah.
Here.
Why don't you let me do that?
Oh, no.
That's all right.
I've got it.
Why don't you see if you can get the fire started?
All right.
There are some matches right next to it.
All right.
It's getting late.
You're sure I'm not keeping you up?
No.
I rarely get to bed before 3:00 a. m.
I didn't have a date tonight.
I went there because you talk about it on your program sometimes and I wanted to meet you.
I listen to you all the time.
I knew somebody was out there.
- You're making fun of me.
- No, I'm not.
- Say something else.
- Such as?
Play Misty for me?
Very good.
- You sure I'm not keeping you up?
- Don't you like me?
You're a very nice girl.
But who needs nice girls?
No, I like them.
I'm kind of hung up on one.
And you don't want to complicate your life.
- That's exactly right.
- Neither do I.
But that's no reason we shouldn't sleep together tonight if we feel like it.
Solid silicone.
Hi, David, my man!
How you been, baby?
See you got the joint cleaned up for once.
The Heavy digs it.
- Care for a beer?
- Not really.
I could go for something more uplifting, but not a brew, my man.
Beer is all we've got.
You're gonna have to ease on out.
I got a lot of work to do today.
You don't understand.
I've been sent here to get you.
By whom?
That old chick I go with.
What's her name?
- Carol?
- That's the one.
Girl thinks you've been working too hard.
She said we should get together tonight.
Who's this "we"?
Me, you, her and one of them hens that you can dig up.
There is a fantastic new Mexican place in Carmel called Susinos.
The albóndigas soup is unbelievable.
It is a mind-bender...
I know the joint, but I don't have a date, and I got a lot to do.
Big deal, man.
Get one!
If you have any problems getting one, I'll get one for you as nice as I look.
It's too late, and besides, I've got a lot of work to do.
But you gotta eat, David.
I'm gonna whip up something here in my own kitchen.
You know, David, I'm really worried about your social life.
You'll make someone a tremendous mother.
Too narrow in the pelvis.
I sure appreciate you dropping by, Al.
Come by again sometime, anytime.
Never let it be said that Sweet Al Monte can't take a hint.
- Who's hinting?
- Hi.
Why, hi there, yourself.
Dave Garver live here?
That depends on your point of view.
Hi.
This stuff weighs a ton.
Where's the kitchen?
Right inside.
Just come on in and help yourself.
Swing right around the bend there.
I know, David, she's from Chicken Delight.
Look, don't work too hard, my man.
Don't strain yourself.
How come you don't have any beer?
And what is this?
A shrunken head?
Does that guy live here?
- I wanted...
- I hope you like steak.
- You look like a steak-and-potatoes type.
- Hang on.
I said to myself, a nice salad with Roquefort and tomatoes...
- ...and baked potato with...
- What's going on here?
- Don't send me away.
- No, I want to ask you a question.
I just wanted to surprise you.
Surprise?
What happens if he and I had been talking business?
Or maybe I have female company and you come traipsing in with groceries?
That would be some surprise.
I'm sorry.
Keep that stuff.
I think I've lost my appetite.
Hang on a minute.
I'm just trying to tell you something.
I don't understand.
Should I go or stay?
What?
I'm telling you there's a telephone, and I pick it up and I dial it.
You answer and I say, "What are you doing?"
And I say, "I'll be right over."
Fine.
Next time, why don't we do it that way?
Okay.
Any way you like.
Next time.
How do you like your steak?
Extremely rare.
That's just how I like mine.
Extremely rare.
I'll get some wine here.
A little vino.
Vino!
All this and heaven, too!
Terrific!
This is gonna be some dinner.
What happened to that discussion we had last time?
You know, the deal about no strings and all that?
There are no strings, but I never said anything about not coming back for seconds, did I?
That's right.
You didn't.
When will I see you?
I'll give you a call.
- Dave, you're funny.
- How's that?
If you want to keep playing these games, okay, but they're really not necessary anymore, not for me.
People are trying to sleep here!
People are trying to talk here!
- How'd you like to tell that to the law?
- How'd you like to go screw yourself?
Take it easy!
Guy's just trying to sleep, that's all.
You're right.
It's a terrific morning.
Why be selfish with it?
Bye-bye.
Wait a minute!
Yeah?
Excuse me, I saw the sweater, and I thought you were somebody else.
You must be David.
Where have you been?
Around.
I was trying to join the revolt against the representational.
Didn't quite make that though.
So now I'm just trying to play it cool.
Not quite making that either.
Got time for a break?
- Yeah.
- Let's go.
- When did you get in town?
- Yesterday.
- You weren't gonna call me?
- Of course I was.
I had to get settled first.
You shouldn't lend your sweaters to blabbermouths.
You've gotten thinner.
No!
Well, so much for Sausalito.
Sausalito?
That's where I was staying.
Jay Jay's place.
- Jay Jay's place?
- It's nothing much, really.
It's just a little pied-á-terre, but it's handy to the fleet.
You told me you didn't know where she was.
So I lied.
Picket me.
- Thanks a lot.
- Listen, stud, it wasn't my idea.
You should have caught her act.
The whole Bette Davis, through-finished-kaput scene.
- And at 3:00 a. m.
- Come on, Jay Jay.
He's exaggerating.
I'll check with Malcolm.
Maybe I can get you the afternoon off.
What happened, pussycat?
He ran into Anjelica.
She told him I was back.
That bitch should be hung by the thumbs or something equally appropriate.
It's all set up.
Let's go.
It's nothing personal, really.
I happen to think she could be a first-rate artist if her damned hormones didn't get in the way.
- There's not much he can do about that.
- He could kill himself.
Jay Jay, why don't you go cruise some sailors?
Please, don't mention seafood.
Come on.
I really missed this place.
I missed you.
You'd do me a big favor if you didn't say things like that.
Why is that?
I don't know.
Somehow it brings out the worst in me.
It makes me want to say things like, "How's that redhead?"
What?
The redhead, the one who worked in the bookstore.
She went back to Berkeley or whatever.
That's too bad.
You always have that blonde from Santa Barbara to fall back on.
If that's the phrase I'm looking for, and I think it probably is.
What are we gonna do?
Go through a whole list?
Is that it?
Who's got that kind of time?
I just don't know if I'm up to it anymore.
Up to what?
Those nights sitting and waiting for you to finish your program and come by.
Nights when it would start to get late and I'd start to think:
"I wonder if he's run himself off a cliff or maybe he's run into a blonde."
There was a time when I started rooting for the accident.
I mean, if it was a choice between that and a blonde.
You don't know how secure you make me feel.
I didn't wish you anything too serious.
Just a couple of months in traction.
You're all heart.
You know, the thing I hate the most in the whole world is a jealous female and that's what I was becoming.
That's why I had to split.
I was starting to be one of my most unfavorite people.
I hated it.
I know you did, too.
That still works anyway.
- Too well sometimes.
- What does that mean?
I mean, there's a little spot in the middle of each day, just about your size.
There's lots of girls my size if you're really looking.
I'm not.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You mean you've given up girls?
I haven't exactly been the monk of the month or anything like that but I have been making an effort.
There must be a real consternation among those "gropies."
That's "groupies," isn't it?
I don't know, "groupies, gropies..."
You know, you've got to be fair.
It hasn't just been my fault.
Listen, I know.
They kept overpowering you.
You get a little bit of the blame, too, you know.
You and that parade of roommates that keep moving in and out of your place.
I didn't realize they were such a trial to you.
What trial?
I enjoyed it.
You and I sitting in front of the fireplace and then some chick sitting there with a bathrobe on, eating Fig Newtons.
What about the one with the St. Bernard?
She was a real winner.
She took up enough space.
And then that other one that took the flute lessons.
Yeah, maybe it was a little rough on you.
I can think of a thousand reasons why we should try again.
I've got about seven billion things to do.
What do you think?
You want to try for a new start, right from the letter "A"?
- What am I gonna do with you?
- A lot.
Hi.
Excuse me.
Hi.
- You've met Anjelica, my...
- Roommate.
Yes.
I think I'll drive into Carmel and see if I can't find some cleaning solvent.
There's plenty under the sink.
Okay.
This house ought to have a revolving door.
You know when my father left me this house, he left me payments.
I can't handle that expense by myself and most girls don't like the isolation.
- It's a long way from town.
- I know.
I better get back to work.
- Thanks.
- That's it, "thanks"?
Four months in Sausalito is a long time.
I am not gonna get back on that same old merry-go-round again.
What do I have to do, give you a notarized statement?
I need a couple of more days to try and figure out where I'm at.
Okay.
You get your bearings, and then you'll give me a call, all right?
- Hi, Murph.
- Hi, Dave.
Sardine Factory.
Dave Garver?
You said this is Evelyn?
No.
Sorry, you've just missed him.
- What do you mean?
- He's gone.
He's not here.
I think you'd better look again.
Believe me, you just missed him.
Now if you're interested in someone more sophisticated I'll be happy to...
That's what I get for being a dirty old man.
There's a message for you, a Madge somebody from San Francisco.
- Brenner?
- That's it.
Al Monte gave her this number.
"Received pictures and biography.
"Please send a two-hour tape of your show as soon as possible."
- Thanks, Murph.
- Don't mention it.
I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be your social secretary.
You will put that on my tab?
Surprise!
What are you doing here?
I was calling you from that phone booth and he told me you'd left and I was staring right at your car.
Isn't that funny?
Yeah, kind of funny.
Why didn't you take my call?
Where does it say I gotta drop everything and answer the phone every time it rings?
Do you know your nostrils flare out into little wings when you're mad?
- It's kind of cute.
- Come on, Evelyn.
I gotta go.
- I'd love a Coke.
- Not now, I gotta get to the station.
No, you don't.
You're talking to your No. 1 fan.
You don't work tonight.
I've got this show that I'm trying to set and it's very important to me.
That means I gotta pick the music, write the lead-ins and find some poetry.
- Come on, will you?
- Poetry?
- Let me help you.
I'm terrific with poetry...
- Not tonight!
Does he want his keys?
- Come on, Evelyn.
- Speak.
- Come on!
- God!
Good boy!
Let's hear it.
Come on.
Come on.
Give me my keys.
- Come on.
Give me the keys.
- Come on.
Give me the keys, goddamn it!
- Having some trouble, lady?
- Get lost!
Yeah, get lost, assholes!
Let's split.
He's got enough trouble already.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
'Bye.
See you later.
Hi.
Get all your work done?
What do you want, Evelyn?
One Coke?
I'll tell you, tonight I'm really whipped.
What time is it?
Time for me to go home.
Go back to sleep.
- Hey, I've got an idea.
- What's that?
Some night this week, after the show corned beef and potato salad, dill pickles, the whole bit.
My place.
Deal?
I'll call you.
Thursday's good for me.
And now from KRML, the big-band sounds of Dee Barton.
Here's a fresh reel of tape for your air check.
- You want me to thread it up?
- No, leave it here.
Thanks.
I think I will go out and hit the streets, but before doing that I will blow me a little number.
Care to partake?
Take it in the other room.
I get zonked just breathing the air here.
All right, be that way.
- Al?
- Yeah?
Do you ever find yourself being completely smothered by somebody?
- Anybody I know?
- You met her at my house the other day.
Chicken Delight!
That's what I call a pretty good smothering.
You start a relationship thinking you're gonna be completely honest and suddenly the whole thing gets out of hand.
What's the problem?
The problem is I've been trying to uncomplicate my life and now I can't even answer the door.
Besides, Tobie's back.
Oh, really?
Tobie?
When?
- I ran into her Sunday.
- That was a goody.
I'll tell you the truth.
I've always thought Tobie was one of the foxiest chicks on the peninsula.
And why you gotta have so much action, I just don't understand it anyway.
It's just a hang-up I have, or had.
But now that I seem to have that straightened out I can't seem to solve this other problem.
Well, you know what they always say, my man.
No, what?
"He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword."
Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
Later.
We'll have more smooth sounds in just one minute but first, at ten minutes to the hour, we're broadcasting from KRML in the Carmel Rancho Shopping Center home of the buccaneer, the man's boutique.
KRML, Dave Garver speaking.
The whole point in having an answering service is to call in once in a while to check for messages.
Hi, Evelyn.
What's happening?
What could be happening, darling?
You're not here yet.
"Yet"?
I hope you like pastrami, because there was no corned beef.
Now, wait a minute.
Just hold on.
Are you trying to tell me you forgot that we have a date tonight?
I thought I was supposed to call you on that.
I feel kind of silly sitting here in my brand-new lounging pajamas.
Ijust assumed...
Apparently, I assumed wrong.
That's right.
You assumed wrong.
You don't have to come over if you've got something better to do.
I'll be over in a little while.
You and I are gonna have to have a talk.
Whatever you say.
In the meantime, haven't you forgotten something else?
What's that?
Weren't you gonna play Misty for me?
Yeah.
I have that one right here.
Thank you, darling.
And now we have a pretty one for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night.
It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty.
And this one is especially for Evelyn.
Just a second.
Come in.
Hi.
Hi.
- Cold night?
- Yeah.
But you got here anyway.
Stout fella.
There's something we're gonna have to get straight.
It's amazing what a man will go through for a hot pastrami sandwich.
- Look...
- Wait a minute.
You haven't told me how nice I look.
- You look fine.
- The sales lady guaranteed you'd flip.
- Now, listen.
Can we talk?
- Wait.
First...
Surprise.
- Don't you like them?
- Yeah, they're great, but...
Don't spoil my fun, darling.
I love to give you things.
It's Madame Butterfly time.
First, friendly neighborhood geisha remove honorable shoes.
Stop it, Evelyn!
Now, we've gotta talk!
Have I done something wrong?
I'm just trying to be straight with you, that's all.
Be nice to me instead.
Jesus Christ!
I don't understand.
Are you trying to say you don't love me anymore?
I never told you that I loved you.
Not in words maybe, but there are ways of saying things that have nothing to do with words.
I'm sorry you read it that way.
It's that other bitch, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
The silver-framed picture in your dresser.
- That picture's got nothing to do with you.
- What does have to do with me?
- I never lied to you.
- Big deal.
He never lied to me.
What do you want for that?
The Congressional Medal of Honor?
- So long.
- What am I supposed to do?
Sit here all dressed up in my little whore suit waiting for my lord and master to call?
- Nobody asked you to wait for anything.
- You're not dumping me!
- Get off my back, Evelyn!
- Get off your back?
That's where you've been keeping me, isn't it?
You're nothing!
You're not even good in bed!
I just felt sorry for you, that's all!
Bastard!
You poor, pathetic bastard!
Hello?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean those things I said.
Will I see you tomorrow?
You don't listen, do you?
Let me come over.
If I could just see you, just talk to you.
- No, Evelyn.
- But I love you, David.
I love you.
Davidl If I could just...
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Why?
No, come on.
You haven't heard a word I've been saying.
- I have.
I've heard everything you said.
- You did?
All right, tell me.
- You don't believe me?
- Go ahead.
Okay, wise chick.
We're supposed to go to a party at Big Sur tomorrow night.
I'm supposed to meet you there at 9:00.
And the address is...
I didn't tell you that.
See how you are?
I don't know myself yet.
I'll call you tomorrow about it.
Okay.
You call me tomorrow.
Honey, we better go.
- We're just getting to the best part.
- But I've got to pick Anjelica up at 6:00.
God!
How the pain is setting in.
Come on.
She's a very nice girl.
Anyway, she's moving out tonight.
Now, that's about the best news I've heard in years.
And Madalyn's moving in.
Madalyn?
Shit.
- What's going on?
- Don't tell me he was asleep!
What else at this hour of the morning?
I'm surprised his conscience was that clear!
- What do you want, Evelyn?
- "What do you want, Evelyn?"
Do I have to want something?
Can't I just come over?
Or is it inconvenient?
- Wait a...
- Did I make a boo-boo?
Has someone been sleeping in Papa Bear's bed?
Wait a minute, goddamn it!
"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
I thought...
God, don't look at me that way, Dave.
I just don't know what to say to you.
I'm sorry I mistrusted you.
I know you'd never spoil it.
To spoil what?
What we have between us.
We don't have a goddamn thing!
How many ways do I have to say this?
I don't care how many ways you say it, it's not true!
- What do I have to do to convince you?
- It's not true!
It's not!
What are you doing?
I'm gonna get dressed and drive you home, that's what.
Why are you playing these games?
Why are you pretending you don't love me?
I don't even believe I'm hearing this.
But I love you!
You haven't got the vaguest idea what love is.
We don't even know each other.
Wait a minute.
You don't have to do that.
I'm okay.
I can drive home.
Are you sure?
Positive.
I'm fine.
Let me just wash my face.
You ready?
You okay?
Oh, no.
How's she gonna be?
I sutured the wounds.
It wasn't quite as bad as it looked.
It couldn't have been.
You know, Dave, I'm supposed to turn a report in on this.
But you won't.
You see, Tobie's back.
I'd rather tell her, and not have her read it in the paper somewhere.
I didn't know that.
I'll tell Marie.
We'll do the spaghetti number.
- Somebody gonna be around here today?
- Me.
I'll be here.
I bombed her out pretty good.
Let her sleep it off before you take her home.
- And how long will that be?
- It's hard to say.
Why?
- I'd like to take Tobie out tonight.
- No problem.
She'll wake up sometime this afternoon, 5:00 or so.
Is she gonna be all right?
The cuts were really pretty superficial.
I mean, do you think she'll try it again?
Chances are against it.
But I'd watch her.
I wouldn't leave her alone if she seems unusually depressed or insecure.
Better get some sleep yourself.
You look like hell.
Call me if you need me.
Thanks, Frank.
I really appreciate it.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
Fine.
Here.
Thank you.
Brought you a little soup.
It looks good.
I don't know what to say.
It frightens me thinking about it.
Don't think about it.
I don't mean me.
I mean you.
"Girl commits suicide in disc jockey's home."
It's not very good publicity for a man in your position.
Get some rest.
As soon as you feel better, I'll take you home.
Thank you, David.
I got your clothes hung up in the closet there.
Maybe you better answer the phone.
Yeah.
I'll get it in the other room.
Hello.
Hi.
I just wanted to check.
We still on for tonight?
Yeah, I'm ready to go.
What time is the party?
Madalyn's already left, and she won't be back for a long time and I was just thinking...
Would you be disappointed if we didn't go to the party and just stayed here instead?
I think I can bear up under it.
Don't be too long.
- That's me at the door.
- David the way I look at it, the hell with Sausalito.
Bye-bye.
Evelyn?
- What's the matter?
Take it easy.
- I had a dream.
I was drowning in the ocean and I called to you, but you just stood there watching.
Watching.
It was just a dream.
Oh, God, I'm so alone.
Hold me.
Hold me, Dave.
Please.
Yeah.
Tighter.
Tighter.
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.
David!
I woke up and you were gone.
If you have something planned for tonight, you could just take me home.
Maybe that'd be best.
No, no, there's nothing.
Good.
Isn't this nice?
Just us here, together.
Here we go again.
Stone-cold dead in the market.
Must have been quite a party.
Go away, Birdie.
Any other bodies, any other juiceheads around here?
Come back tomorrow, will you?
Or next year sometime.
I better check the workbench.
All right, break it up in here.
Looks like old times around this place.
Evelyn?
Lose something, tiger?
You couldn't find it within your heart to come back at a later time, could you?
This is a later time, pussycat.
I'm paying you back for the day I blew last week.
Evelyn?
Very funny, Birdie.
Very funny.
What I can't figure out is, with all this action going on in here what are you doing out there couching it?
What is this, some kind of Kinsey Report?
Do I come over to your house and ask a lot of dumb questions?
You just ought to, pussycat.
Might open up a whole new way of life to you.
Hold it.
Let's try to show a little class, shall we?
Mr. Garver's residence.
I'll see.
Do you want to talk to a Madge Brenner?
Yeah.
I want to talk to her.
Thanks.
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Garver?
Madge Brenner.
We like the tape on your show.
Like it very much.
There are one or two others in the running, but, frankly...
Can we have lunch today?
- Wind jammerstill good?
- Yeah, still very good.
Reserve a table in your name.
- See you then, Mr. Garver.
- Great.
Bye-bye.
Looks like we found Evelyn.
"Good morning, darling.
Gone shopping.
"Back in a flash with the hash."
A little humor in there.
"Love and kisses, Evelyn."
And then it says:
"If you can't find your keys, don't worry.
"I borrowed your car."
Here's your key, and here's your copy.
That'll be USDO.40, please.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
David?
I stopped by my...
Hi.
Don't you look all gussied up?
Good.
I was gonna cook brunch but this calls for something more festive.
How about the Marquis?
My treat.
- After all I put you through, it's the least...
- I have a lunch date.
Business.
- Business?
- Yeah.
Can I have my car keys?
Sure.
I think you ought to take it easy, anyway.
Get some rest.
Yeah, I do feel a little tired.
Very funny, Dave.
Now, let's talk show.
Tell me, what do you think of the concept?
The unstructured the loosey-goosey, Monterey pop, Woodstock kind of thing?
I like it very much, and I think I can handle it.
So do I.
I'll keep this to promote your new career with.
You'll be working with kids, bright and marvelous.
But they take handling.
If this goes the way I think it will...
- ...there's no reason in the world why...
- Isn't this cozy?
So this is your business lunch?
How's business?
Friend of yours?
- Just another trick.
- That's enough.
Is that your idea of a dish?
She's a little old for you, isn't she?
What is this, "Be Kind to Senior Citizens Week"?
Get outta here!
I don't mind you being a bastard, but do you have to be a tasteless one?
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
She couldn't get laid in a lumber camp!
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
You're hurting me!
Stop it, you dirty bastard!
No!
Stop it!
Dave!
No!
No!
Don't leave me!
Don't leave me!
She's nothing!
Nothing!
Nothing!
- I love you!
- Get her outta here.
Where to?
I did it because I love you.
Don't you understand that?
- I love you!
- Where to?
- Move!
- It's because I love you!
Dave, please.
This is a private beach.
- I want to talk to you.
- I don't want to talk to you.
Are you drunk?
No, but that's not a bad idea.
- Why, David?
- Why what?
Drunk?
No.
Why last night?
That's what I came to explain to you.
Okay, good.
I think we should understand each other.
I'm not very happy with you.
That's fair enough.
Whatever it was, you could have called me.
No, I couldn't.
Why not?
I couldn't tell you the truth last night.
I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.
Now, why do you have to say that?
I just didn't want to take a chance she'd try it again.
What if she does?
I swear to you, if she ever tries it I'd just let her go right on ahead.
God!
Oh, my God.
What in the...
Oh, God, help me!
Please, somebody, help me!
Help me, somebody!
Oh, God, help me!
- Stay back, buddy.
- I live here, man.
Is she your housecleaning lady, Garver?
Okay, boys, let's take her out.
Watch your step.
It's gonna cost you double to clean up this mess.
Watch your step.
- Dave Garver?
- Yeah.
I'm Sgt. McCallum.
Any ideas?
About what?
About your girlfriend in there.
That's not my girlfriend.
Let me get that straight right in front.
More or less a casual acquaintance, you'd say?
That's right.
You're saying she came by to hack up your wardrobe and your cleaning lady?
I'm not trying to tell you anything, Sergeant.
Maybe you ought to.
The lady almost got herself killed.
And I'm stumbling around in my stupid way trying to find out why.
What'll you have?
This Evelyn Draper, where does she come from?
I don't know.
- What about her family?
- I don't know that either.
She just listens to my radio show, and we met one night.
That's all.
- Practically a stranger.
- That's right.
Then how does she happen to have a key to your front door?
I don't know that either.
It boils down to, you don't know a hell of a lot, do you?
What it boils down to is, I'm getting sick of your questions.
And so am I!
But they get upset with me down at the store if I don't ask them.
- Just take her through.
I'll be right along.
- Right.
- Take her through what?
- Booking.
What she really needs is psychiatric help.
Really?
Now, look, those cuts on her wrists...
Don't know anything about those.
There's one other thing.
I know, "Don't leave town."
I was gonna say, "Why don't you play some Mantovani sometime?"
Didn't know you liked the show.
I don't.
I like Mantovani.
Go ahead, play!
All right!
Those of you who may have played brass instruments you know that was triple-tonguin', baby.
Let's give his tongue a nice hand.
He might just be the fastest tongue in the West.
- Come on.
- All right, I'm coming.
What do you say...
- Something to eat?
- I've got to pick up my roommate, Annabel.
- Madalyn's your roommate.
- I found my man, and I'm moving out.
- And Annabel's moving in.
- Right.
- 'Bye.
- Ciao.
See you later.
Thank you.
Thank you very kindly.
That was the Cannonball Adderley Group.
They're playing at the Monterey Jazz Festival with Duke Ellington, Woody Herman, Joe Williams and many others.
Still got tickets for Sunday.
So get on out there because that's where it's happening.
Now we're gonna hear from the Gator Creek Organization and Feelin' Fine.
KRML.
Dave Garver.
Hello.
Play Misty for me.
David?
I didn't mean to shake you up.
I'm sorry.
Pretty stupid of me.
I've been released.
Therapy.
It was a bad dream, butit's over.
- Where are you?
- The airport.
San Francisco.
I've only got a minute between planes.
- Got ajob in Hawaii.
- You're all right then?
Fine, David.
Fine.
I just want to say how sorry I am about everything.
- Forget it.
I have.
- I hope so.
"Because this maiden she lived with no other thought
"Than to love and be loved by you."
Are you near a radio?
No.
But play it for me anyway.
Hello.
- Garver?
- Yeah.
Sgt. McCallum.
Sorry to wake you butsomething's come up.
I know.
She just paid me a visit with a butcher knife.
Why?
Because she was released on parole pending further legal action.
When?
A week ago.
I sure like the way you broke your ass to let me know!
- I just found out about it myself.
- Who's in charge down there anyway?
Now, look.
Do you want to help find her or would you rather just sit there and bellyache?
- All right.
- Good.
Now exactly what did she say to you?
I told you.
She said that she was well and that she was going to Hawaii.
What else?
- I already told you.
- Tell me again.
You know, you really make lousy conversation.
You make lousy coffee.
Come on, what else did she say?
Nothing, except...
- Except what?
- It was nothing.
It was a line from a poem.
- What poem?
- If I knew that, I'd know the line.
- Try to remember.
- You know, McCallum, it's getting late.
You're sounding very monotonous.
You're not exactly my idea of a swinging date either.
Good night, McCallum.
- What happened to the Mantovani?
- The what?
I heard the show, but I never did hear you play Mantovani.
You really did listen to the show?
Friend, if we had a TV down at the station I'd break my arm before I turned your show on.
Thanks a lot.
Just hope we're lucky enough to grab her the next time she tries it.
Tries what?
To kill you.
Yeah.
And if you're not lucky enough?
That'd be hell.
The guys down at the station would have to chip in and buy a TV.
You're a great comfort, Sergeant.
You will change the locks?
Hi.
Nothing like a nice brisk walk in the woods to put roses on a girl's cheeks.
How are you?
Not so good, honey.
- She's back.
- Who?
Evelyn Draper, the girl who tried to kill Birdie.
How can she be back?
I thought they'd put her in a state sanitarium.
- They did, but they let her out.
- Does that mean she's all right?
Theoretically.
What happens now?
I think you and I ought to stay away from each other for a couple of days just in case she's tagging after me.
She's already following you, isn't she?
I don't want you to worry about it.
I can handle myself.
Yeah.
So could Birdie.
All right then, you stand by.
They're all set to trace the call.
When she phones, just mention her by name right away, Evelyn and they start to trace her.
All you gotta do after that is just keep her talking.
Fifteen minutes before the hour here at KRML and here's It's Not Unusual.
I guess it hasn't come to you yet.
- What?
- What she said.
Over the phone last night?
Part of a poem or something.
You were gonna try to remember.
I thought I had that, but I've forgotten.
Is it that important?
Until we pick her up, everything's important.
What's wrong?
I'm worried about my girlfriend with all this going on.
They're so damn isolated down there.
I'm thinking the best thing to do is just have Al Monte sub for me.
The only chance we've got is when she phones in here tonight.
You've got to be here, right on that mike.
- If she phones.
- She will.
Believe me.
But only if you're here.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
If it'll make you feel better, I'll go over and check your girlfriend's house myself.
I'd sure appreciate that.
She lives on Spindrift Road.
I think it's the fourth or fifth house down.
- "Williams" is on the mailbox.
- Why don't you phone her?
- Okay.
- Tell her to be expecting me.
McCallum.
Thanks.
Public servant.
- Hello?
- Hi.
I'mjust checking in.
You all right?
Marvelous.
I'm just getting ready to do my nails and I got your program on.
And Annabel's in the kitchen making a couple of coffee grogs.
What more could a girl ask for?
No, honey, everything's fine.
There's a Sgt. McCallum that's gonna drop by for a second to see if you've buttoned up all right.
Let him in, but nobody else.
Okay.
David, you want to play something soft and dreamy for us?
You gotit.
Bye-bye.
'Bye, hon.
- Annabel, how's that stuff coming?
- Here's something soft and sentimental for Tobie and Annabel.
Hope you like cinnamon in yours.
Whatever's right.
Annabel.
Good?
Too much.
- So is this.
- Thank you.
Just one thing.
Do you mind?
No, be my guest.
The eyes are wrong.
David's are more...
How shall I say?
Colder.
I didn't know you knew David.
I didn't realize you and David were friends.
Friends?
No, not friends.
Not friends.
God, you're dumb.
"Because this maiden she lived with no other thought
"Than to love and be loved by you."
- Tobie?
- We're waiting foryou, David.
This is Dave Garver with a little verse a little talk and five hours of music to be very, very nice to each other by.
Careful.
Careful.
I might put your eye out.
I'll bet David loves your eyes.
And your hair.
Does he run his fingers through your hair?
Have to get you all nice for David.
For David.
I hope he likes what he sees when he walks in here because that's what he's taking to hell with him.
Miss Williams?
McCallum?
And now we have a pretty one for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night.
It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty.
And this one is especially for Evelyn.
is Godzilla your favorite?
He's a superman!
Come on, Ken, time for lunch.
Okay.
Darling.
Darling!
Good afternoon.
Oh, good afternoon.
Got something interesting for my husband?
Some kind of strange fish that looks very weird to me.
Well, professor, what kind of fish is it?
It's a tadpole, isn't it?
It's much too big to be a tadpole.
Anyway, they don't live in the sea.
Oh, yeah.
Where did you catch this?
Down on the point, where l usually get the shrimp.
I didn't catch a single one today.
With the fish getting worse every day, Suruga Bay is done for.
What in the world is this monster that appeared at the accident site in Suruga Bay?
Could it be some kind of sea monster or was it some kind of new military weapon?
Whatever it was it has enough frightful power to destroy two ships.
Oh, that was a monster tadpole.
Papa, it's the same fish the old fisherman brought here today.
I'll be back in 30 minutes.
-That'll be 2:00.
-Right.
Now, set your watch.
Bye.
Man, it's empty.
Papa!
The tadpole!
Papa!
Papa.
Papa....
Papa.
Please come back, Papa.
Ouch!
Papa!
Papa!
The monster that attacked you was smaller than the one...
-...that sunk the tanker.
-Right.
There isn't just one Hedorah.
They come in different sizes, right, Papa?
Hedorah?
That's just a name my son dreamed up for them.
They come from the sludge.
Sludge?
Professor, is it possible that's the reason?
Well, maybe. I'm not sure.
It's too early to say.
Excuse us.
Oh, no.
No pictures, please.
Yes, I want pictures taken.
I want people to see this on the television.
They need to realize how big the threat is.
Go ahead.
Hedorah got me too.
Since the first tragedy in Suruga Bay, other tankers have been involved in similar accidents.
The survivors tell us that in each instance, they saw a dark-colored monster.
This could be the work of Hedorah.
Cheerful
The atomic bomb, the hydrogen bomb cast their fallout into the sea.
Poison gases, sludge.
Everyone throws them into the sea.
Even sewage.
Godzilla would really get angry if he saw this.
He would do something.
Class A, second grade, Ken Yano.
Oh, darling, what are you doing up so late?
I put some muddy water in one of those test tubes.
Stop this.
You should be resting.
This the strangest thing I've ever seen.
This so-called fish is actually a mineral.
It's the same as diamonds and other crystallized carbons.
Papa.
Ken, what are you doing up?
Don't you know how late it is?
Papa, Godzilla's coming to save us.
Godzilla?
He's gonna come and kill Hedorah!
I saw it happen in my dream.
He'll come, won't he?
Mama, what do you think?
If you saw it in your dream, I'm sure he'll come.
Now it's time to go back to bed.
Papa.
I understand now.
This water is just muddy water.
Hedorah comes to life in polluted water, just like you thought.
Cool!
Look, Mama.
Now, these will join together too.
No wonder it can grow so quickly.
They combine when they meet each other.
So the Hedorah I saw, and the one that sank the tankers grew big this way.
This means they can reach an enormous size.
-Bigger than Godzilla?
-Yep as long as we keep feeding the ocean with sludge.
If this thing came up on land, it would be a disaster!
But would a tadpole be able to come up on land?
You never know.
This is a new and unusual mutation.
We have to do something before it's too late.
Did you say Hedorah?
Knock it off!
Hedorah is a sea monster.
It's Godzilla!
Let's take a closer look.
Why is Godzilla here?
If the two monsters start fighting, they'll destroy the entire port.
Thirty-five people are dead and 8 1 have been injured in the fight, on land, between Hedorah and Godzilla.
Three hundred and twenty-two buildings have been lost.
In areas that Hedorah passed through metal objects have been completely corroded as if by some form of acid.
is this terrestrial Hedorah the same monster that sank the tankers?
Where did Hedorah come from?
Why was Godzilla here?
There are still many unanswered questions regarding this strange event.
He doesn't know anything.
Godzilla came to beat Hedorah.
Right, Papa?
You know everything, don't you, Ken?
is that your Godzilla impression?
-Brother, are you okay?
-Yeah.
Yukio seems to think you can be of some help.
Well, I might be able to find out what Hedorah really is with the help of Yukio and Miki.
is this where you saw the sparks?
Yeah, that's right.
Papa.
This is it. lt's burnt.
It's ash from the sparks.
-You want me to pick them up?
-All that you can find.
It's exactly like the tadpole.
So it came onto land after it changed like a frog does.
That may be the case but is it possible for a living organism to be made up of minerals?
You're sure you saw sparks coming from it?
Yes, without a doubt.
It was very beautiful.
And it didn't eat the cat it captured but inhaled smoke from the smokestacks instead.
That smoke should be toxic to any living animal.
I know.
Hedorah is completely different from all other life on Earth.
The colored, gooey stuff is waste material.
The white, shiny stuff is the crystallized carbon.
It's a mineral called hedrium.
What you see there is the eyeball of the tadpole ground into powder.
I gave it the name hedrium and I think that is the key to the life force of the monster.
If its body is formed by minerals and waste material it wouldn't have a nerve structure as we know it.
It wouldn't be unusual for it to spark if Godzilla breathed fire on it.
If Hedorah lived off of our smoke wouldn't that end our air-pollution problem?
Don't be ridiculous.
Hedorah is much more dangerous.
Why did all that metal corrode?
Take another look.
That yellow substance you see there that's sulfur.
The hedrium is probably a catalyst that produces sulfur when it reacts with other substances.
Sulfur is a component of sulfuric acid.
The burns on my face are very similar to burns caused by sulfuric acid.
The small particles in sulfuric acid create a sulfuric mist that corrodes metal.
If Hedorah consumes our smoke and releases a sulfuric mist it wouldn't clean our air.
We'll be enveloped in a poisonous smog.
The appearance of Hedorah, believed to have formed in polluted bays has placed the entire country in a state of terror.
Hedorah appears to avoid daylight but the threat of another landing remains on rainy or foggy days.
Residents within one kilometer of rivers or the ocean should stay on alert.
Especially along industrial coastlines where pollution is a problem--
Forget all this Hedorah talk until you get better.
Fine.
I was just watching the news.
Papa, if Hedorah isn't from this planet, then how did it get here?
Ken, do you know what a meteor is?
M 82 Nebula which has exploded
-A shooting star that falls to Earth.
-That's right.
Hedorah must have been on a rock that landed on Earth.
I wonder what kind of planet it came from.
It probably came from a sticky, dark planet far, far away.
Now, let's go to sleep.
-Stop!
Stop!
-Careful!
Be careful!
I saw Godzilla.
Hedorah must be here too!
Hedorah wouldn't come on a nice day like this.
Ken!
He's so hard to keep up with.
Yes.
-What?
Godzilla?
-lt's true!
Right, go to your mother's school and come home together.
Ken?
What's wrong?
Ken!
Hello?
Hello?
One, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight.
Teacher!
My throat!
What was it?
Girls!
Michiko!
Quickly, come along, girls.
We must go inside.
Hurry!
Everyone, help each other.
Gas tanks at the Japan Oil Company have exploded.
Residents in the area, evacuate immediately.
The fire may spread.
Residents, please evacuate immediately.
-lt'd be faster to walk.
-Now, don't get impatient.
Something wrong?
I don't know.
What is that?
!
Run for it!
Ouch!
Anti-Hedorah Oxygen Masks Now on Sale
The southwestern area of Fuji City has virtually been destroyed.
So far, 1 600 people have been killed while the number of people injured exceeds 30,000.
Hedorah has left a trail of very high levels of sulfuric mist ranging from 2000 ppm to 2800 ppm affecting rescue workers' eyes and throats.
Dead bodies are reportedly piling up in the streets.
It was so frightening when the students started collapsing.
That's no learning environment.
If this continues, there's no telling how bad it will get.
Will Hedorah just get bigger and bigger, Papa?
If we don't get rid of the pollution, he'll just keep growing.
As it gets bigger it'll absorb more pollutants into itself and it'll be able to go anywhere.
Will it climb Mount Fuji?
It might.
Ken, do you know what a nuclear explosion is?
-The atomic and hydrogen bombs.
-Yes.
Atomic nucleus
When the atoms of a substance undergo nuclear fission...
Neutron ...they create different atoms and emit a tremendous amount of energy.
The Nuclear Explosion of an Atom of Silver ln space, there are explosions much bigger than atomic bombs, even bigger than the sun.
Bang!
That's wild.
Hedorah is probably flying by means of its own nuclear power.
After all, it is a space creature made up of metal components.
There's no telling what kind of destructive power it may develop.
Could it become more powerful than Godzilla?
It's possible.
But, you see, there's only one Hedorah.
If everyone pulls together, we can defeat it.
Can't we do something?
The next time the monster lands we must have something ready to destroy it.
It has to have a weakness.
Why don't we dry it?
It's only sludge.
Hedorah has won after all.
Everything produces waste.
We humans created Hedorah with ours.
Down with Environmental Pollution!
The March of One Million People
Sponsored by All-Japan Youth Federation
A million people on the go.
How about that?
We'll get all the young people.
Then we'll throw a huge party on top of Mount Fuji before Hedorah gets to it.
1 .
Aquatic Phase
When Hedorah first appeared, it looked like a huge tadpole sinking tankers left and right.
This is its aquatic phase.
2.
Terrestrial Phase
On a foggy night, it transformed into a creature like a four-legged reptile absorbing smoke from smokestacks, growing steadily.
This was its terrestrial stage.
3.
Airborne Phase lt transformed into a saucer-like flier and spread large amounts of sulfuric mist over the city in broad daylight.
This is its airborne phase.
The question now is:
What terrifying form will the monster take next?
Professor, what do you think?
Its growth rate is frightening.
I have no idea what it will do.
Then what is Hedorah's weakness?
Well, you see Hedorah lives in a world in which no earthly creature can exist.
A negative world of death.
That is to say, it lives in sludge and polluted air.
So it's possible that oxygen might deter its growth.
-Give them oxygen/ That'll do it/
-Yeah/
Who gave birth to Hedorah?
Neither the land nor the sea is suitable for life.
What will Hedorah do next?
Oh, thank you.
One positive electrode and one negative.
Feed the electric current and anything between them dries instantly.
It's been tested in Hokkaido as a way to dry out the fields.
Well, let's try it.
-You'll use this to dry out Hedorah?
-That's right.
Good.
We just need to increase the size of the model.
Call the Self-Defense Force.
Orders have been given for the entire Self-Defense Force including the reserve forces, to guard the main industrial cities.
The government issued orders for all factories to cease production and placed restrictions on movement of vehicles.
Over 1 0 million people in Tokyo, Osaka and other large cities are suffering from the effects of the sulfuric mist.
I thought a million people were coming.
There's only 1 00.
Why complain about it?
Green pastures exist only in our hearts now.
Let's sing.
Let's dance!
Let's at least use our energy to make a stand!
All right, let's do it!
It is 5;40 p.m. This is a special news bulletin.
Hedorah has made a landing and is heading north.
It seems to have grown to a size of at least 60 meters long.
Self-Defense Forces along the coast have fired at Hedorah but the bullets shot straight through it with no effect...
-...as it continues in its destruction.
-Toshi!
Toshi!
Darling!
Make a phone call for me.
I can sense it.
Godzilla is here.
-That means Hedorah is here too.
-Are you sure?
Good, it's Godzilla!
He's here!
Get him, Godzilla!
Hello, Self-Defense headquarters?
The electrodes.
Have you finished making the electrodes?
What?
You're constructing it in Sakaigawa?
Hedorah's in the Mount Fuji area?
Please do your best.
Ken is in danger.
He's not the only one.
Every living thing is in danger.
Toshi, we must go to Mount Fuji.
You're in no condition to travel.
If the electrodes fail there's no way of stopping Hedorah.
The survival of this planet depends on those electrodes.
Look!
The fire.
Get your torches!
Drop the oxygen!
Here we are.
Are you all right?
Professor, the electrodes are ready.
Good.
We've set up the electrodes one kilometer apart.
They are 40 meters tall and 60 meters wide.
How do you plan on getting Hedorah to come between the electrodes?
We bait it with artillery and helicopters.
When it's close, we'll use blinking headlights and supersonic waves.
-What's the voltage?
-Three million volts.
We're rerouting all the electricity from the Kanto and Chubu areas here.
The power lines are down!
Repair them immediately!
Headquarters!
Temporarily stop current transmission!
Unit one!
Unit one, report!
-We've lost contact.
-What about unit two?
-lt's on its way, sir.
-Hurry!
It's coming.
The headlights.
Use the headlights.
You've got to get its attention.
But we still don't have power.
If you don't use them, it'll leave here.
-Hurry!
-Please do as he says.
Hey, blink the lights!
-Aren't the repairs done yet?
-Almost.
-When will you be finished?
-ln about 1 0 more minutes.
How close to us is it now?
About 1 00 meters.
It's stopped.
Stupid bastard!
It's coming.
-ls it ready yet?
-Another five minutes.
We don't have time!
You've got one minute.
-You've got 30 seconds!
-Okay!
is it ready?
Do we have any power?
Hurry, we need the power now!
-We've got full power now!
-You damn fool!
It's too late!
Hey, they're coming right for us.
All right, turn it on!
Open circuits!
-Now what?
-l think we blew a fuse. lt's no good.
Why can't anything be done right?
Godzilla!
Godzilla!
Godzilla, goodbye!
Is Godzilla your favorite?
He's a superman!
Come on, Ken, time for lunch.
Okay.
Darling.
Darling!
Good afternoon.

He's so hard to keep up with.
Yes.
- What?
Godzilla?
- It's true!
Right, go to your mother's school and come home together.
Ken?
What's wrong?
Ken!
Hello?
Hello?
One, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight.
Teacher!
My throat!
What was it?
Girls!
Michiko!
Quickly, come along, girls.
We must go inside.
Hurry!
Everyone, help each other.
Gas tanks at the Japan Oil Company have exploded,
Residents in the area, evacuate immediately,
The fire may spread,
Residents, please evacuate immediately,
- It'd be faster to walk.
- Now, don't get impatient.
Something wrong?
I don't know.
What is that?
!
Run for it!
Ouch!
Anti-Hedorah Oxygen Masks Now on Sale
The southwestern area of Fuji City has virtually been destroyed.
So far, 1600 people have been killed while the number of people injured exceeds 30,000.
Hedorah has left a trail of very high levels of sulfuric mist ranging from 2000 ppm to 2800 ppm affecting rescue workers' eyes and throats.
Dead bodies are reportedly piling up in the streets.
It was so frightening when the students started collapsing.
That's no learning environment.
If this continues, there's no telling how bad it will get.
Will Hedorah just get bigger and bigger, Papa?
If we don't get rid of the pollution, he'll just keep growing.
As it gets bigger it'll absorb more pollutants into itself and it'll be able to go anywhere.
Will it climb Mount Fuji?
It might.
Ken, do you know what a nuclear explosion is?
- The atomic and hydrogen bombs.
- Yes.
Atomic nucleus
When the atoms of a substance undergo nuclear fission...
Neutron ... they create different atoms and emit a tremendous amount of energy,
The Nuclear Explosion of an Atom of Silver
In space, there are explosions much bigger than atomic bombs, even bigger than the sun,
Bang!
That's wild.
Hedorah is probably flying by means of its own nuclear power.
After all, it is a space creature made up of metal components.
There's no telling what kind of destructive power it may develop.
Could it become more powerful than Godzilla?
It's possible.
But, you see, there's only one Hedorah.
If everyone pulls together, we can defeat it.
Can't we do something?
The next time the monster lands we must have something ready to destroy it.
It has to have a weakness.
Why don't we dry it?
It's only sludge.
Hedorah has won after all.
Everything produces waste.
We humans created Hedorah with ours.
Down with Environmental Pollution!
The March of One Million People
Sponsored by All-Japan Youth Federation
A million people on the go.
How about that?
We'll get all the young people.
Then we'll throw a huge party on top of Mount Fuji before Hedorah gets to it.
1.
Aquatic Phase
When Hedorah first appeared, it looked like a huge tadpole sinking tankers left and right.
This is its aquatic phase.
2.
Terrestrial Phase
On a foggy night, it transformed into a creature like a four-legged reptile absorbing smoke from smokestacks, growing steadily.
This was its terrestrial stage.
3.
Airborne Phase
It transformed into a saucer-like flier and spread large amounts of sulfuric mist over the city in broad daylight.
This is its airborne phase.
The question now is:
What terrifying form will the monster take next?
Professor, what do you think?
Its growth rate is frightening.
I have no idea what it will do.
Then what is Hedorah's weakness?
Well, you see Hedorah lives in a world in which no earthly creature can exist.
A negative world of death.
That is to say, it lives in sludge and polluted air.
So it's possible that oxygen might deter its growth.
- Give them oxygen!
That'll do it!
- Yeah!
Who gave birth to Hedorah?
Neither the land nor the sea is suitable for life,
What will Hedorah do next?
Oh, thank you.
One positive electrode and one negative.
Feed the electric current and anything between them dries instantly.
It's been tested in Hokkaido as a way to dry out the fields.
Well, let's try it.
- You'll use this to dry out Hedorah?
- That's right.
Good.
We just need to increase the size of the model.
Call the Self-Defense Force.
Orders have been given for the entire Self-Defense Force including the reserve forces, to guard the main industrial cities,
The government issued orders for all factories to cease production and placed restrictions on movement of vehicles,
Over 10 million people in Tokyo, Osaka and other large cities are suffering from the effects of the sulfuric mist,
I thought a million people were coming.
There's only 100.
Why complain about it?
Green pastures exist only in our hearts now.
Let's sing.
Let's dance!
Let's at least use our energy to make a stand!
All right, let's do it!
It is 5;40 p, m, This is a special news bulletin,
Hedorah has made a landing and is heading north,
It seems to have grown to a size of at least 60 meters long,
Self-Defense Forces along the coast have fired at Hedorah but the bullets shot straight through it with no effect...
- ... as it continues in its destruction,
- Toshi!
Toshi!
Darling!
Make a phone call for me.
I can sense it.
Godzilla is here.
- That means Hedorah is here too.
- Are you sure?
Good, it's Godzilla!
He's here!
Get him, Godzilla!
Hello, Self-Defense headquarters?
The electrodes.
Have you finished making the electrodes?
What?
You're constructing it in Sakaigawa?
Hedorah's in the Mount Fuji area?
Please do your best.
Ken is in danger.
He's not the only one.
Every living thing is in danger.
Toshi, we must go to Mount Fuji.
You're in no condition to travel.
If the electrodes fail there's no way of stopping Hedorah.
The survival of this planet depends on those electrodes.
Look!
The fire.
Get your torches!
Drop the oxygen!
Here we are.
Are you all right?
Professor, the electrodes are ready.
Good.
We've set up the electrodes one kilometer apart.
They are 40 meters tall and 60 meters wide.
How do you plan on getting Hedorah to come between the electrodes?
We bait it with artillery and helicopters.
When it's close, we'll use blinking headlights and supersonic waves.
- What's the voltage?
- Three million volts.
We're rerouting all the electricity from the Kanto and Chubu areas here.
The power lines are down!
Repair them immediately!
Headquarters!
Temporarily stop current transmission!
Unit one!
Unit one, report!
- We've lost contact.
- What about unit two?
- It's on its way, sir.
- Hurry!
It's coming.
The headlights.
Use the headlights.
You've got to get its attention.
But we still don't have power.
If you don't use them, it'll leave here.
- Hurry!
- Please do as he says.
Hey, blink the lights!
- Aren't the repairs done yet?
- Almost.
- When will you be finished?
- In about 10 more minutes.
How close to us is it now?
About 100 meters.
It's stopped.
Stupid bastard!
It's coming.
- Is it ready yet?
- Another five minutes.
We don't have time!
You've got one minute.
- You've got 30 seconds!
- Okay!
Is it ready?
Do we have any power?
Hurry, we need the power now!
- We've got full power now!
- You damn fool!
It's too late!
Hey, they're coming right for us.
All right, turn it on!
Open circuits!
- Now what?
- I think we blew a fuse.
It's no good.
Why can't anything be done right?
Godzilla!
Godzilla!
Godzilla, goodbye!
Is Godzilla your favorite?
He's a superman!
Come on, Ken, time for lunch.
Okay.
Darling.
Darling!
Good afternoon.
Oh, good afternoon, Gohei.
Got another interesting fish for my husband?
Some kind of strange fish that looks very weird to me.
Well, Professor, what kind of fish is it?
It's a tadpole, isn't it?
It's much too big to be a tadpole.
Anyway, they don't live in the sea.
Oh, yeah.
Where did you catch this?
Down on the point, where I usually get the shrimp.
I didn't catch a single one today.
With the fish getting worse every day, Suruga Bay is done for.
What in the world is this monster that appeared at the accident site in Suruga Bay?
Could it be some kind of sea monster?
Or was it some kind of new military weapon?
Whatever it was, it has enough frightful power to destroy two ships.
Oh, that was a monster tadpole.
Papa, it's the same fish the old fisherman brought here today.
I'll be back in 30 minutes.
- That'll be 2:00.
- Right.
Now, set your watch.
Bye.
Man, it's empty.
Papa!
The tadpole!
Papa!
Papa.
Papa...
Papa.
Please come back, Papa.
Ouch!
Papa!
Papa!
The monster that attacked you was smaller than the one that sunk the tanker.
Right.
There isn't just one Hedorah.
They come in different sizes, right, Papa?
Hedorah?
That's just a name my son dreamed up for them.
The Hedorah monsters came from the sludge.
Sludge?
Professor, is it possible that's the reason?
Well, maybe.
I'm not sure.
It's too early to say.
Excuse us.
Oh, no.
No pictures, please.
Yes, I want pictures taken.
I want people to see this on the television.
They need to realize how big the threat is.
Go ahead.
Hedorah got me too.
Since the first tragedy in Suruga Bay, other tankers have been involved in similar accidents.
The survivors tell us that in each instance, they saw a dark-colored monster.
This could be the work of Hedorah.
CHEERFUL
The atomic bomb, the hydrogen bomb... cast their fallout into the sea.
Poison gases, sludge.
Everyone throws them into the sea.
Even sewage.
Godzilla would really get angry if he saw this.
He would do something.
Class A, second grade, Ken Yano.
Darling, what are you doing up so late?
I put some muddy water in one of those test tubes.
Stop this.
You should be resting.
This is the strangest thing I've ever seen.
This so-called tadpole is actually a mineral.
It's the same as diamonds and other crystallized carbons.
Papa.
Ken, what are you doing up?
Don't you know how late it is?
Papa, Godzilla's coming to save us.
Godzilla?
He's gonna come and kill Hedorah!
I saw it happen in my dream.
He'll come, won't he?
Mama, what do you think?
If you saw it in your dream, I'm sure he'll come.
Now it's time to go back to bed.
Papa.
I understand now.
This water is just muddy water.
Hedorah comes to life in polluted water, just like you thought.
Cool!
Look, Mama.
Now, these will join together too.
No wonder it can grow so quickly.
They combine when they meet each other.
So the Hedorah I saw, and the one that sank the tankers grew big this way.
This means they can reach enormous size.
Bigger than Godzilla?
Yep...
Hedorahs live in the chemicals we put in the sea.
If this thing came up on land, it would be a disaster!
But would a tadpole be able to come up on land?
You never know.
This is a new and unusual mutation.
We have to do something before it's too late.
Did you say Hedorah?
Knock it off!
Hedorah is a sea monster.
It's Godzilla!
Let's take a closer look.
Why is Godzilla here?
If the two monsters start fighting, they'll destroy the entire port.
Thirty-five are dead and eighty-one have been injured in the fight between Hedorah and Godzilla.
Three hundred and twenty-two buildings have been lost.
In areas that Hedorah passed through... metal objects have been completely corroded as if affected by some form of acid.
Is this terrestrial Hedorah the same monster that sank the tankers?
Where did Hedorah come from?
Why was Godzilla here?
There are still many unanswered questions regarding this strange event.
He doesn't know anything.
Godzilla came to beat Hedorah.
Right, Papa?
You know everything, don't you, Ken?
Is that your Godzilla impression?
- Brother, are you okay?
- Yeah.
Yukio seems to think you can be of some help.
Well, I might be able to find out what Hedorah really is with the help of Yukio and Miki.
Is this where you saw the sparks?
Yeah, that's right.
Papa.
This is it.
It's burnt.
It's ash from the sparks.
You want me to pick them up?
All that you can find.
It's exactly like the tadpole.
So it came onto land after it changed like a frog does.
That may be the case... but is it possible for a living organism to be made up of minerals?
You're sure you saw sparks coming from it?
Yes, without a doubt.
It was very beautiful.
And it didn't eat the cat it captured, but inhaled smoke from the smokestacks instead.
That smoke should be toxic to any living animal.
I know.
Hedorah is completely different from all other life on earth.
The colored, gooey stuff is waste material.
The white, shiny stuff is the crystallized carbon.
It's a mineral I think we should call hedrium.
What you see there is the eyeball of the tadpole ground into powder.
Hedrium is as good a name as any I can think off... but I think the white substance is the key to the lifeforce of the monster.
If its body is formed by minerals and waste material... it wouldn't have a nerve structure as we know it.
It wouldn't be unusual for it to spark if Godzilla breathed fire on it.
If Hedorah lived off of our smoke, wouldn't that end our air-pollution problem?
Don't be ridiculous.
Hedorah is much more dangerous.
Why did all that metal corrode?
Take another look.
That yellow substance you see there that's sulfur.
Hedrium is probably a catalyst that produces sulfur when it reacts with other substances.
Sulfur is a component of sulfuric acid.
The burns on my face are very similar to burns caused by sulfuric acid.
The small particles in sulfuric acid create a sulfuric acid mist that corrodes metal.
If Hedorah consumes our smoke and releases a sulfuric acid mist it wouldn't clean our air.
We'll be enveloped in a poisonous smog.
The appearance of Hedorah, believed to have formed in polluted bays... has placed the entire country in a state of terror.
Hedorah appears to avoid daylight... but the threat of another landing remains on rainy or foggy days.
Residents within one kilometer of rivers or the ocean should stay on alert.
Especially along industrial coastlines where pollution is a problem...
Forget all this Hedorah talk until you get better.
Fine.
I was just watching the news.
Papa, if Hedorah isn't from this planet, then how did it get here?
Ken, do you know what a meteor is?
"A shooting star that falls to earth."
That's right.
Hedorah must have been on a rock that landed on earth.
I wonder what kind of planet it came from.
Hedorah probably came from a sticky, dark planet far, far away.
Now, let's go to sleep.
- Stop!
Stop!
- Careful!
Be careful!
I saw Godzilla.
Hedorah must be here too!
Hedorah wouldn't come on a nice day like this.
Ken!
He's so hard to keep up with.
Yes.
What?
Godzilla?
It's true!
Right, go to your mother's school and come home together.
Ken?
What's wrong?
Ken!
Hello?
Hello?
One, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight.
Teacher!
My throat!

Girls!
Michiko!
Quickly, come along, girls.
We must go inside.
Hurry!
Everyone, help each other.
Gas tanks at the Japan Oil Company have exploded.
Residents in the area, evacuate immediately.
The fire may spread.
Residents, please evacuate immediately.
It'd be faster to walk.
Now, don't get impatient.
Something wrong?
I don't know.
What is that?
!
Run for it!
Ouch!

The southwestern area of Fuji City has virtually been destroyed.
So far, 1600 people have been killed, while the number of injured exceeds 30,000.
Hedorah has left a trail of very high levels of sulfuric acid mist ranging from 2000 ppm to 2800 ppm, affecting rescue workers' eyes and throats.
Dead bodies are reportedly piling up in the streets.
It was so frightening when the students started collapsing.

What a useless lot!
We've missed the dig.
Well, we might just catch the end of it.
Look, there's Jo!
Doctor!
We seem to have lost all contact with the barrow.
We shall, of course, resume transmission as soon as we can.
In the meantime, here's some music.
Benton, get on to the BBC.
See if you can find out what's going on down there.
I'll try to raise the Brigadier.
Right, sir.
Look at him, please hurry!
Please hurry!
Oh, great Azal!
I, the Master, thank thee for arising at my command!
Behold my worthy disciples.
They know now of thy presence and will seek to help me to fulfil my desires.
Therefore I command them to rise to their feet and welcome thee, Azal!
To do my will shall be the whole of the law.
To do thy will shall be the whole of the law.
Azal, hear me.
Let this stone... mark the appointed place.
Let us meet together later... and thou mayest learn my intent.
As my will, so mote it be.
As thy will, so mote it be.
You have nothing to fear - so long as you do the will of the Master.
Go now.
And say no word to any man, but await my commands.
He's gone too.
No... no, he can't!
Look, we must get a doctor!
Look, love, face it - they've had it.
But there must be a doctor in the village or somewhere!
Charlie, can I have word in a minute?
Okay, Harry.
Charlie'll take him down_.
Thank you.
Doctor!
Doctor, please?
!
Now listen, this is an official call from UNIT...
Yes, but gone on to where?
United Nations Intelligence Taskforce.
Because it's urgent.
Look, I warn you, if you're withholding information... _ you will ring me back?
But you must know something?
Right then, I'll ring you... in ten minutes.
Well, find out and ring me back at this number.
No, make it five.
Anything?
No, sir.
You?
No.
The Brigadier went on somewhere after dinner.
No one knows quite where.
We're sorry for this interruption in our outside broadcast from Devil's End but we still can't get through to our unit...
Oh, this is stupid!
Just as soon as we have some news...
I've a good mind to go down there and find out for myself.
The Brigadier'd go spare, sir!
I mean, we might get news at any minute.
Oh yes, sure, and in the meantime what's happening to Jo and the Doctor?
Too late, I'm afraid.
He's gone, just like the Professor.
No... no, he can't be dead!
I'm sorry.
Oh, please, you must do something!
I can't work miracles, you know.
He's very nearly a solid block of ice.
Oh, there, there.
I'm sorry, my dear, there's nothing we can do.
I don't believe it...
What?
Get some blankets and some hot water bottles - lots of them.
He's alive then!
It's possible but I think I felt a pulse.
Oh, then there's a chance?
Maybe.
He must have the constitution of an ox to be able to survive a reduction of temperature like that.
He doesn't look all that tough.
You can't always tell by...
Hello?
What?
Silly really, I swear it sounds as if he's...
What?
It's quite ridiculous.
It must be an echo off an atypical bone structure.
Sounds as if what?
As if he had two hearts... one on each side?
Doctor?
Fine, fine, now more if you've got them.
He's going to be all right then?
There is a chance.
Cheer up!
While there's life there's hope, right?
Look, have you got a telephone I could use, please?
In the corner.
Oh yes, thank you.
And is he all right now?
Well, touch and go, I think Mike.
Look, can you get down here right away?
Yes, of course.
We'll come down in the chopper as soon as it's light.
Hello?
Jo?
Can you hear me?
Blast!
We've been cut off.
Well, that's the last of us.
Thanks for all your help.
Happy to oblige, sir.
Well, I can't wait to get away myself.
Don't envy you.
Oh, that's all right, sir.
Just a bit of night duty.
I enjoy a bit of peace and quiet.
Well, you're welcome to it, mate.
Anyway, I'm away. 'Night.
Bye, sir.
Soon be there, sir.
Hello, what's that?
Must be the dig.
No, beyond that.
A line of... they couldn't be hoofmarks, could they?
They're enormous.
Shall we go and see, sir?
Better.
They are you know, sir.
Hoofmarks?
They can't be!
The animal that made these would have to be at least thirty feet tall.
Well, whatever it is, it's gone into that wood over there.
Well, it'll have to wait.
Come on, first things first.
What, like breakfast you mean, sir?
No, I don't
- I mean Jo and the Doc.
Right.
Well, where's the red carpet then?
And the brass band?
After last night, I reckon they all deserve a lie-in.
Well, there's the pub, sir.
And Jo.
Are you sure you're all right now?
Yes thanks, honest.
Boy, am I glad to see you two.
And the Doc?
Upstairs.
Better I think, but he's still out cold.
Oh, he'll pull through.
You know what a tough old bird he is!
Anyway, you're both safe - that's the main thing.
Well, I don't think there's any danger in here - but out there...
Look Jo, what is going on?
I don't know, something... really bad, you know...
Well, how do you mean?
Well, you know... devilish.
Look sir, if you don't need me here, I'd like to make a quick recee of those tracks.
Oh...
Look, fifteen minutes, say twenty?
Right - but at the first sign of trouble, straight back here.
Right.
Do be careful, Sergeant Benton.
Don't you worry, Miss.
Oh, and don't forget to contact the Brigadier, sir.
Ah!
I'd forgotten all about him!
The Doctor's gone?
Gone where?
Well you should know, corporal.
I want to talk to him.
What?
Oh, all right then, wake up Miss Grant.
I see, and I suppose she didn't leave a number either?
I suppose it wouldn't do any good to ask for Captain Yates or Sergeant Benton?
My helicopter!
Where to?
Devil's End...
Yes, yes I see.
Get my car here right away.
Yes, and if they do contact you, tell them to stay put.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Let me out of here!
Help!
Help!
Oh, let me out...
Who are you?
Friend or foe?
Friend, I hope, ma'am.
Oh, oh, oh, very perfect gentle knight!
What?
Oh well, your damsel in distress may be a bit long in the tooth, but... she's very grateful.
Yes well, you're lucky I heard you.
Who are you?
Benton
- Sergeant Benton.
What happened?
Police Sergeant?
No - army.
Now who put you in here?
Garvin - the verger.
Now, we must... we must get the police at once.
Oh, oh, may name's Olive Hawthorne, by the way.
How do you do?
How do you do.
Look, what is going on here?
All hell seems to be breaking loose.
Do you know, sergeant, you're exactly right.
Come on.
What is it?
Garvin - the one who tied me up.
Quick!
Hide down here 'til he's out of the way.
Goodness!
What?
What is it?
The gargoyle - it's gone!
Shh!
Better wait 'til he's gone.
Here what's this?
The sign of the evil one.
Keep away!
For goodness sake!
You know who's at the bottom of all this?
No - who?
The Reverend Mr. Magister.
Who's he?
The vicar, so called.
But he's an imposter.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I should have realised at once.
Magister is the name given to the leader of a black magic coven.
Black magic?
That stuff died out years ago.
Do you know when the last Witchcraft Act was repealed in this country?
1951 - why, it's as alive today as it ever was.
Yes, well...
I'm sure it's safe now.
That's what you think!
Right, on your way - move.
All right - on your feet.
Oh, don't be stupid.
Can't you see he's half unconscious?
Somebody'll have to help him then, won't they?
Yes...
Come on.
Right, come on - this way.
Doctor?
Doctor, wake up!
You see?
He's been like that for hours.
Well, shouldn't he be in hospital?
Well, Doctor Reeves said that we shouldn't move him.
Then we'll just have to wait.
All right?
Eureka!
Azal!
I welcome thee!
Now you're sure you're all right?
You'd better come and sit in this chair over here.
Come on.
Jo...
Jo, please, stop fussing.
She's right you know.
Better take it gently.
Look, I tell you, I am perfectly all right.
It was a parky up there for a while, I'll admit, but it soon warmed up.
That wave of heat?
Yes, the final confirmation of my theory.
You mean you know what caused it?
Yes, I think so.
Tell us then.
No, not just yet.
I want to wait until I'm absolutely sure.
Right, I'm going back up to the dig.
Doctor, haven't you had enough of that place?
Hello?
You better?
I thought you'd had it.
Fortunately, no.
Captain Yates, you'd better wait here, all right?
Oh, If I drop him, he'll go with a most dreadful wallop!
He's out on his feet!
Get him over to that bench - quickly!
Here, what's happened to your boy?
He's been beaten up - by an expert, I'd say.
Oh, you might indeed say that!
You might indeed.
Oh, no...
Oh dear, he's a very heavy young man!
I'll get a doctor.
Yes, it's all right
- I am a Doctor.
Ahh...
Well, there are no bones broken or anything.
Look could you get me some hot water and some hot sweet tea, perhaps?
Yes, _.
Thank you very much - and thank you too, Miss Hawthorne.
You know who I am?
Yes, of course.
It's a great pity they didn't listen to you in the first place.
If only they had.
Ohh...
Oh, what a tale I'll have to tell them now!
Both alive are they?
And the others?
I see.
Very well, they'll all be dealt with.
Now you'd better get back inside before they become suspicious.
This fellow, Garvin, who did him over...
No, no, no, it was the elementals in the cavern!
Elementals?
Yes, creatures of the devil.
Did you say the devil?
Yes, dear boy
- Satan, Lucifer, the prince of darkness, Beelzebub, the horned beast, call him what you like - he was there!
You saw the devil?
Yes.
And what did he look like?
Oh, well, it was a glimpse - no more.
Twenty, thirty feet high, but the horns were there... and the face...
The devil!
Look, Miss Hawthorne, I agreed with you from the first about the danger, but now I think you're utterly mistaken.
Whatever else you saw it certainly was not the devil.
But it was!
There's a Satanist cult in this village and last night they held a sabbat.
A sabbat?
Oh yes, an occult ceremony to call up the devil.
And it worked!
The devil came!
Nonsense, Jo!
Miss Hawthorne, who is the leader of this cult?
The new vicar - he calls himself Magister.
Magister!
Yes, of course, I should have known!
What?
Jo, did you fail Latin as well as science?
Magister is the Latin word for Master!
What's up?
I wouldn't go any further, mate, look what's happened to my van!
Petrol tank?
No, it just went up in a flash.
During the earth tremor's was it?
No, just after it stopped.
I was about to get back in and drive back to the village and bingo!
- off it went.
Is that Devil's End over there?
Must be some sort of heat barrier!
We'll try getting in from the south.
Right.
Get the saw, will you?
Yes.
Right, that settles it.
We'd better try and raise the Doctor.
And, er, that's about it, sir - over.
I see, Yates.
So, the Doctor was frozen stiff at the barrow and was then revived by a freak heatwave, Benton was beaten up by invisible forces and the local white witch claims she's seen the devil?
Yes, sir.
I know it sounds a bit wild...
It does indeed, Yates.
Now listen, I'm bringing up some men to investigate this heat barrier.
Let me talk to the Doctor.
Over.
I'm afraid you can't, sir.
He's gone up to the dig with Jo.
Over.
I see.
Well Yates, anything further revelations?
Just one, sir.
Well, what is it?
We've found out who's at the bottom of all this - it's the Master.
Over and out.
Still alive are you, Doctor?
Very well.
Ah, poor fellah.
Do you know what killed him?
Well it certainly wasn't the devil - at least not exactly.
What do you mean?
Look, I'm going in.
Would you prefer to wait outside?
No.
I'd rather stick with you - if I wouldn't be in the way.
No, of course not.
I'd be glad of the company.
Come on.
What are you looking for?
If my theory's right, we're all in mortal danger.
Everyone in the village?
Everyone in the whole world.
Ahh...
What is it?
Metal.
It looks like a model spaceship.
That's right.
Except that it isn't a model.
What is it then?
Jo, look at the shape of this tomb.
Well, it looks like that spaceship.
A different size, that's all.
Now you try picking it up.
I can't.
It's fixed down.
The reason why you can't pick it up is that is weighs... oh, about seven hundred and fifty tonnes, at a rough guess.
Oh, come on, be serious!
Be serious?
All right.
About a hundred thousand years ago...
JABBERWOCKY
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borrogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The Jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!
He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he sought...
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood awhile in though.
And, as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!
One, two, One, two!
And through and through The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with his head He went galumphing back.
"And hast thou stain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day!
Callooh!
Callay!"
He chortled in his joy.
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

I'm very glad to be here and I'm just starting on an unofficial trip to Puerto Rico hoping to see something of a very beautiful island and its people.
[Announcer]:
Mrs. Roosevelt gets ready for the first over-ocean flight ever made by a president's wife.
Off to Haiti, landing safely a few hours later then Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
A triple hop of 1,250 miles for the flying First Lady.
Emotion continued high in this small country courthouse as young Leonard Hill and Wesley Bruckner after six weeks of one of the century's grisliest murder trials were sentenced to life imprisonment.
During the course of the trial the jury was shown photographs such as these depicting the brutal mutilation killing of Ellie Banner one of Braddock's most respected citizens.
[Crowd Shouting]
There was a tense moment as crowds, displeased at the verdict threatened the orderly departure of the young killers from the courthouse.
Leaving moments later are the convicted men's mothers Adelle Bruckner and Helen Hill.
During the sensation-packed days of the trial Mrs. Bruckner and Mrs. Hill have been subjected to nearly as much public curiosity as their sons.
And so the ordeal comes to an end for these two women as their sons go to prison for life.
Billy, get us out of here.
[Car Horn Honking]
Do you have a handkerchief?
Sure.
[Horn Honking]
[Adelle Sighs]
You're not going to cry, are you?
You never cry.
[Crowd Thumping On Car]
Oh, no.
What happened?
Somebody cut me.
Somebody out there cut me.
[Horn Honking]
[Helen]:
The handkerchief, put the handkerchief on it.
Billy, hurry!
[Car Door Closing]
[Adelle]:
I know it's against your religion, Helen but you better have a shot of gin.
Adelle, I'd rather have a first aid kit.
Yeah, of course.
I call that real class.
What?
The way you didn't scream or anything.
I'd have raised the roof.
Iodine first, dear.
Go ahead.
Go on.
And you never saw who did it?
I didn't even feel it.
I just looked down, and my palm was full of blood.
What kind of a screwball would do such a thing?
There.
Thank you, Adelle.
How about a little shot of gin now?
[Exhales]
Holy Moses I still have a heap to get done if I'm going to get out of here on Friday.
I think I'm going to have that shot of gin.
I didn't tell you.
But you know what I've decided?
I decided that the school in California is going to be all different, just for kids.
Out there in Hollywood, kids are the cat's meow.
Cat's meow?
Since Shirley Temple, you know?
You have heard of Shirley Temple.
I hardly ever go to the movies, but I've heard of Shirley Temple.
You know, out there in Hollywood all the parents are crazy to get their kids in the movies.
And somebody has to teach them how to sing and dance, so why shouldn't I help?
Won't you mind being so far away from your boy?
Of course I will.
But what can I do about it?
He turned on me.
He really turned on me.
You saw.
I just don't understand it.
I did everything I could for him.
It wasn't my fault that his father took a powder.
Men can be quite a bit lower than the angels.
[Telephone Ringing]
That's for sure.
Adelle's New York School of Dance.
Hello?
[Adelle]:
This is she.
Yeah, hold on.
It's, umm, someone with asthma for you.
Hello?
[Man]:
I thought you'd like to know, I'm the one who cut you today.
- Why?
- I wanted to see you bleed.
Like Ellie Banner.
I wanted to be sure you can.
You'll bleed, all right.
So will the other one.
You have no right to talk to me like that.
[Adelle]:
What's going on?
Those boys should have gone to the gallows.
Somebody's got to pay for what they did to Ellie.
And somebody's going to.
You and her.
Wherever you are I'm going to...
I'll call the police.
[Telephone Dialing]
Don't.
No.
We'll be all over the papers again.
I can't take that anymore.
Th...that man's dangerous.
Helen, how do you know?
He may be just a harmless crank.
Please, don't do anything yet.
Honestly, Helen, I can't stand any more.
I don't understand.
Wes, saying that he hated me and that I was too busy when he needed me.
[Chuckles]
I was busy dancing my feet off to earn a buck so we could eat.
I did everything I could.
No matter how bad things get you must always tell yourself there's a reason, there has to be a reason.
- Up there?
- Yes.
[Sobs]
I...
I need a reason down here.
I do.
Helen, Why don't...
why don't you come with me to California?
Well, I--I...
D-d-don't worry.
I have a little money socked away.
Enough for two train tickets, if you don't mind riding coach.
And--and I'll still have enough to get the school going somehow.
I'm so glad you asked me.
I didn't want to be the one that suggested it.
You're quite a girl.
You really are, Mrs. Hill.
Wait a minute.
No more "Mrs. Hill."
From now on, you're going to be Helen Martin.
- Helen Martin?
- I'm going to be Adelle Stuart.
Adelle Stuart?
New names and new lives.
New lives.
- A whole new shuffle for both of us, okay?
- Okay.
And if the school catches on, then we'll hire a high-priced lawyer.
Maybe even Clarence Darrow, for an appeal, for the boys.
And anyway, we'll be 2,000 miles away from everything, including that.
[Telephone Ringing]
Hello?
[Man]:
Your light went on so I know you're awake.
You will kindly refrain from disturbing us further!

Miss Stuart, have any of those talent scouts said they're coming to the recital?
We heard from Universal and Columbia, but not from the other studios.
Well, you gotta have MGM.
[Woman]:
Oh, Miss Stuart, you know how bad Charlene's eyes are, the trouble she has with them.
If you put her in the back row...
I haven't forgotten, Mrs. Baker.
- Mrs. Barker.
- I haven't forgotten.
Mrs. Palmer, excuse me.
Winona, what's the matter?
You were doing just great last time.
I hate my costume.
We do like all the girls to dress alike.
It's her father's idea.
He had it made up special, in four different colors.
Could you speak to him, being the mother?
I'm only the housekeeper.
We don't talk about my mother.
She's bad.
I'll try to explain it to Mr. Palmer, but I doubt he'll listen.
He's a Texas man.
Come on, Winona.
Look at the little lady.
Don't stare, Donna.
It's rude.
Miss Stuart, now, you won't forget, will you?
No, I won't.

Poor little thing.
Ah.

The poor thing doesn't feel well.
Here we are.
The poor little thing.
You know, she's expecting.
- You know what they say about rabbits.
- No, what?
What are you going to do with all of them?
I'm going to love them, take care of them.
Still the country girl at heart.
But, all the same, you're the Marion Davies type.
Marion who?
Didn't you see Marion in Polly of the Circus?
No, I'm afraid the only movie I've seen in five years is Sign of the Cross.
- Marion Davies is lovely.
- She's beautiful.
But Adelle, I'm not one bit like her.
You could be.
Helen, you know how much I read about show business.
Mm-Hmm.
Yes, I know.
- And how interested I am in everything.
- Yes.
You know, it's to know what type you are.
The public always looks for types.
Yes, I know.
Like, I am Jean Harlow, definitely.
I think I've heard of her.
She's English, isn't she?
[Laughing] No.
No, no, Helen, she's from Kansas City and they call her "the blonde bombshell."
[Laughing]
Here, take a look.
Oh, she's lovely.
Oh, I see.
Th-that's why you changed the color of your hair.
Oh, but you're much prettier than she is.
We could be sisters.
The public always looks for types.
All right, now here we go.
There we are.
There we go.
And there we are.
There.
- Something the matter?
- No.
I know how it feels to have your hair cut off.
Here, look at yourself.
I used to wear my hair longer than Jeannette MacDonald's.
Isn't that gonna look nifty?
I mean, after I get it shaped in a bit, huh?
Adelle, why don't you wear your wedding ring anymore?
A ring doesn't mean a marriage.
Anyway, that's in the past now.
Oh, I hate to think about the past.
Sometimes I can't help it.
You mean, the boys?
No, further back than that.
Lenny's father.
How he died.
Tell me.
You know we had a little farm.
One morning, it was a lovely day I made him a picnic lunch and I took Lenny and I went out into the field.
We were going to have a ride on the plough.
And we started out and then the harness seemed to come loose and Matt got off to fix it.
And then something frightened the horses.
[[Horses Neighing]
And I couldn't hold them.
And the blades of the plough they're big, and they're much sharper than they look.
[Scraping]
He fell.
Matt fell.
He fell.
And Lenny saw it.
He saw it all, and he blamed me for ever afterwards for not being able to save his father.
But you said he was only four years old.
He was too young to think anything like that.
But children do, they do somehow.
They look at you, and they just make you feel guilty.
You have to see yourself full-length to get the whole effect.
It's lovely, Adelle, lovely.
[Kissing]
- Oh, Thank you.
- It's perfect.
I startled you.
I'm so sorry.
But the front door was ajar, so I just came straight up.
You should have rung the bell.
I hate to spoil an entrance, I'm afraid.
Are you Miss Stuart?
No.
I am Helen Martin, Miss Stuart's partner.
But I've heard excellent reports of you in the profession.
I give private lessons, you see, in voice and diction to a few moppets with ambitious mothers.
Among these is your Charlene Barker a small but horrendous creature of absolutely no talent whatsoever.
[Chuckling]
[Man]:
Now, since the arrival of the talking picture...
Uh, Just what are you trying to say to us?
It's perfectly simple, my dear lady.
Just concentrate for a moment, will you?
Since the talking picture is here to stay your moppets must learn to speak distinctly as well as shake their fat little legs.
Now, why not extend your curriculum to include courses in drama and elocution given by myself?
Maybe he's got something.
I mean, Shirley doesn't just dance, she's an actress, too.
We do not know who he is.
My name is Hamilton Starr, two "R"s, but prophetic nonetheless.
[Chuckling]
Now, a-at what time do you conclude your classes in the morning?
- 11:00.
- Good.
And that is when I shall return with some rather impressive letters of reference.
Until then, ladies, good night.
"Good night, sweet ladies."
That's Hamlet, of course.
[Starr]:
Oh, don't bother.
I like to find my own way out as well as in.
By the way shall I close the front door?
Rather unwise, you know, to leave it open.

Miss Stuart, any word from the other talent scouts?
We have Paramount coming, too.
You didn't look at my Rosalie once today.
How do you know if she's doing good or bad?
I did look, Mrs. Greenbaum, and she's doing exceptionally well.
Mr. Palmer?
I'll see you on Wednesday, Mrs. Greenbaum.
They're very interested in Rosalie at RKO.
- That's wonderful, Mrs. Greenbaum.
- She could make you famous.
Yes, well, I bet she will.
Why not bring her a little earlier on Wednesday?
I will if she's not testing.
Mr. Palmer, about Winona's practice costumes...
You don't like them?
I think they're dumb.
Daddy, can we go home now?
We do have a rule here that all the girls dress alike and it makes Winona self-conscious to stand out from all the others.
Really?
It shouldn't.
I mean, if you got it, why be afraid to let it stand out, Miss Stuart?
Well, if you've got it, you don't have to draw attention to it.
Mr. Palmer
[Chuckles]
I'm hungry.
Ah.
That's a..that's a very interesting subject, Miss Stuart.
I'd like to chat some more about that.
Maybe over dinner tonight?

I admit I am subject to the disease of curiosity.
Now, where do we discuss these sordid business details?
Do you still have your instinct, Adelle?
He makes me laugh.
We have the bond of humor, Miss Stuart.
I'm so glad.
Mrs. Martin may still think that I'm Jack the Ripper but my references are A-1.
You could make a start by calling up Constance Bennett.
Constance Bennett, did you hear that?
We still don't know a thing about him.
But I have letters from the immortals!
Let me see.

And then here's John Barrymore.

Those people don't mean a thing to me.
But of course anything concerning the school is up to you.
Now what is there about me that makes Mrs. Martin so nervous?

Even for this town, you're a pretty special kind of ham, Mr. Starr.

With the money that they take in, it ought to be.
Okay, tell me something.
- What?
- Anything about you.
You ever been married?
No.
Just love them and leave them?
Well, I can't say as I blame you.
I've got nothing against marriage.
It's just that...
It's the oldest story in the world.
I never met the right man.
I bet you have a great time playing the field.
I know I do.
It's a tango.
Do you do the tango?
Sorry, I don't think even you could teach me to dance.
It's all right.
Mind if I ask the lady to dance?
I think that's up to the lady.
You want to?
Go on, get up there.
You know you're just aching to.
Thank you.
I'll leave this with you.

No, that will keep me awake.

[Helen Tsk-Tsking]
All right, so I've got a snoot full.
What's going on in there?
I tried on my new dress and I started to decorate the hall for our recital.
Ah, don't waste your time.
We're going to have it in a real theater with scenery, lights, orchestra, the works courtesy of Mr. Lincoln Palmer.
But it's our recital!
[Sighs] Well, he's a very generous man!
Hmmm.
Oh...yes.
Oh, he's...
generous and wonderful.
Helen, he's the first man I've been serious about in years.
Yes, but is he serious about you?
Yes, I think he is.
He called me a knockout.
My, isn't he a fast worker?
That's marvelous.
It's marvelous.
I'm very happy for you.
You told him about Wes?
What?
That he hasn't answered any of your letters, or has he?
No.
You do act like a killjoy sometimes.
I'm sorry.
I come home from a great evening, with a great guy, and you bring up Wes.
But it's a realistic problem.
I thought that he should know about it before you get seriously involved.
I'll tell him.
Excuse me.
Are you scared that...
Yes, of course I am.
I'm scared as hell.
Good night.
Did you remember to lock the door downstairs?
I did.

Him.
He was standing out there just a minute ago.
Watching you and Lincoln smooching.
You mean, you just happened to be looking out of the window when Linc drove me home?
He was standing out there, smoking a cigarette.
Just like he was that other night.

Hello?
Who is this?

I told you so.
Oh, my poor little creatures.

They've been without water all day.

Maybe there's another one in the cellar.

Well, this is just a little something I rent for the summer.
With an option to buy, of course.

I thought I heard you.
Good evening, Miss Stuart.
- Is Nonie asleep?
- Yes.
And dinner will be ready shortly.
It's just like in the movies.
You haven't seen nothing yet.
Come on.
Do you want a drink?
What's your pleasure?
- Anything.
- Gin Rickey?
That's fine.
One Gin Rickey coming up.
You want to tell me about it?
I want to, but...
Or did you already tell me?
Something came in the mail this morning.
I thought maybe it was from you.
- I never sent you this.
- You didn't?
I thought maybe it was your way of letting me know without having to talk about it.
Must have come from one of those nuts that sign themselves "a well-wisher," you know?
Yes.
That's who it must have been.
A well-wisher who lives near where I live.
So you wanted to keep a secret from me?
We don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Oh, my.
No guy can be that marvelous.
Now I'm glad the secret's out.
You know, Helen's boy, Lenny he was the ringleader.
He admitted it.
- Wes...
- Do you hear from him at all?
No.
I write to him every week, but he never answers.
He just won't have anything to do with me.
There's no way I can get through.
[Bird Whistling]
What about the appeal?
What?
I said, what about the appeal?
It takes a lot of tap lessons to pay for an appeal.
Yeah, well, ah maybe I can be of some help.
How?
Well, judging from what I read in the papers, that, uh...
[Chuckling] ...that lawyer was not so hot.
Do you want me to put you on to someone?
- You'd do that?
- Be my guest.
One man can be that marvelous.
If you didn't know about that letter what's eating you?
I've been wondering for days whether to try and tell you or not, or how.
I was scared.
[Woman On Radio]:
I want to open tonight with a poem that our dear Sister Bertha wrote and gave to me, and which I want to share with you.
"Put the love of God in action
"Make his word the main attraction
"Sin and sickness you'll erase
"And perfect peace will take its place."
Thank you for those words, Sister Bertha.
[Adelle]:
oh.
Water and power, telephone, gas, Hollywood Dress Store.
Helen, a letter for you.
That letter is addressed to Mrs. Helen Hill.
I hadn't noticed.
It's mailed from around here, too.
Aren't you going to open it?
No.
See who's it from?
Mr. Mailman!
Mr. Mailman!
We're very sorry, there's no one by that name at this address.
Do you understand?
I refused the letter.
Very smart.
It seemed like the best thing to do.
Yes?
Do you wish me well?
- Of course I do, dear.
- Then you're a well-wisher.
Yes.
Some people who call themselves well-wishers do crazy things.
You know?
I'm afraid I don't understand what you're talking about.
Suppose the same person who wrecked my cutout sent a picture of you and me at the trial to Linc?
Well, if that same person wanted to throw me off the scent she'd arrange to receive a bad piece of news herself wouldn't she?
You can't be imagining things like this about me.
I don't believe this.
W-w-why can't you just face the truth instead?
I am facing it.
And it's not very pleasant.
"Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord."
[Sighs] Here we go.
Now you listen to me, Adelle.
There is someone out there seeking revenge on us.
Despite your social preoccupations, you remember, he cut my hand.
You heard his phone calls.
He stabbed your cutout.
Did you ever take a good look at Ellie Banner's face?
Look.
No, thank you.
Why?
She was a working woman, just like us.
About the same age.
- Quite a bit like us.
- So?
So our sons really wanted to kill us.
They hated us.
That was the substitute revenge.
I am not like you, Adelle.
I'm not trying to buy back my son's love by charming some rich man to charm...
I want you out of here!
[Sighs] Adelle, Linc's big lawyer might help Wes if he's paid enough.
But what will you do if you really get him back?
You can't buy back his love and respect.
You neglected him.
You deserve his hatred!
Tonight!
Right away, I want you out!
[Man On Radio]:
And so, to get your free mug, here's all you do.
Just print your name and address plainly on a piece of paper and send it in together with a thin metal foil seal from under the lid of a can of sweet, chocolate-flavored Ovaltine.
- Helen, here's your check.
- Thank you.
I'll be gone by the time you get back.
I'm going to a hotel.
I'll send for my things.

Here's Linc.
Good-bye, Helen.
Be careful.
Adelle, I forgive you.

Yes, from what he said to a couple of people he was crazy with the idea of revenge.
Of course, he suffered greatly when she died.
Your boys were out of reach, of course, and so he fixed on their mothers.
He traced you out here.
I think you've had a very lucky escape.
Yes.
It's all been quite a shock.
I can't stand violence.
It's unforgivable.
You see, Sergeant, that's why when my boy...
Do you mind if I tell Mrs. Bruckner about this?
Yes, that's perfectly all right.
Well, that's about it.
I'll just let myself out.
Yes.
Good-bye.
Sergeant?
Forgive me.
I didn't even thank you or ask you if you'd like a cup of coffee or something?
No, that's perfectly all right.
Thank you again, ma'am, and good night.
Thank you.
[Door Closing]
Adelle!
Adelle!
Adelle, darling!
It was him!
It was that man!
¶ [Piano Playing]
Adelle?
Adelle?
Uh, now, just a minute, please.
Shh.
My partner is not quite finished with our recital yet.
[Laughing]
¶ [Piano]....
You have a very great opportunity not merely to provide bread and butter not merely to keep people from starving.
You have the further great social opportunity of inculcating the understanding that we've got to build from the bottom up and not merely supply food from the top down.
The First Lady, about to take an aerial holiday, has a word to say before she goes.
I'm very glad to be here, and I'm just starting on an unofficial trip to Puerto Rico, hoping to see something of a very beautiful island and its people.
Mrs. Roosevelt gets ready for the first over-ocean flight ever made by a president's wife.
Off to Haiti, landing safely a few hours later, then Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
A triple hop of 1,250 miles for the flying First Lady.
Emotion continued high in this small country courthouse, as young Leonard Hill and Wesley Bruckner, after six weeks of one of the century's grisliest murder trials, were sentenced to life imprisonment.
During the course of the trial, the jury was shown photographs such as these, depicting the brutal mutilation killing of Ellie Banner, one of Braddock's most respected citizens.
There was a tense moment as crowds, displeased at the verdict, threatened the orderly departure of the young killers from the courthouse.
Leaving moments later are the convicted men's mothers,
Adelle Bruckner and Helen Hill.
During the sensation-packed days of the trial,
Mrs. Bruckner and Mrs. Hill have been subjected to nearly as much public curiosity as their sons.
And so the ordeal comes to an end for these two women, as their sons go to prison for life.
Billy, get us out of here.
Do you have a handkerchief?
Sure.
You're not going to cry, are you?
You never cry.
Oh, no.
What happened?
Somebody cut me.
Somebody out there cut me.
The handkerchief, put the handkerchief on it.
Oh, Billy, hurry!
I know it's against your religion, Helen but you better have a shot of gin.
Adelle, I'd rather have a first aid kit.
Oh, yeah, of course.
Where did I--?
Oh.
I call that real class.
Why?
What?
Well, the way-- the way you didn't scream or anything.
I'd have raised the roof.
Iodine first, dear.
Oh.
Go ahead.
Go on.
And you never saw who did it?
I didn't even feel it.
I just looked down, and my palm was full of blood.
What kind of a screwball would do such a thing?
There.
Thank you, Adelle.
How 'bout a little shot of gin now?
Holy Moses, I--
I still have a heap to get done if I'm going to get out of here on Friday.
I think I'm gonna have that shot of gin.
- Helen
- Mmm?
Helen, I didn't tell you.
But you know what I've decided?
Mmm?
I decided that the school in California is going to be all different, just for kids.
You know, out there in Hollywood, kids are the cat's meow.
Cat's meow?
Since Shirley Temple, you know?
You have heard of Shirley Temple?
I hardly ever go to the movies, but I've heard of Shirley Temple.
You know, out there in Hollywood all the parents are crazy to get their kids in the movies.
And somebody has to teach them how to sing and dance, so why shouldn't I help?
Adelle...
Won't you mind being so far away from your boy?
Of course, I will.
But what can I do about it?
He turned on me.
He really turned on me, Helen.
You saw.
I just don't understand it.
I did everything I could for him.
It wasn't my fault that his father took a powder.
You know,
Adelle, men can be quite a bit lower than the angels.
That's for sure.
Adelle's New York School of Dance.
Hello?
This is she.
Yeah, hold on.
It's, uh... someone with asthma for you.
Hello?
I thought you'd Like to know,
I'm the one who cut you today.
Why?
I wanted to see you bleed.
Like Ellie Banner.
I wanted to be sure you can.
You'll bleed, all right.
So will the other one.
You have no right to talk to me like that.
What's going on?
Those boys should have gone to the gallows.
Somebody's got to pay for what they did to Ellie.
And somebody's going to.
You and her.
Wherever you are, I'm gonna--
I'll call the police.
Don't.
No.
We'll be all over the papers again.
I can't take that anymore.
Adelle, that man's dangerous.
Helen, how do you know?
He may be just a harmless crank.
Oh Helen, please don't do anything yet.
Honestly, Helen, I can't stand any more.
I don't understand.
Wes, saying that he hated me and that I was too busy when he needed me.
I was busy dancing my feet off to earn a buck so we could eat.
I did everything I could.
Adelle.
Dear, no matter how bad things get you must always tell yourself, always, there is a reason, there has to be a reason.
Up there?
Yes.
I need a reason down here.
I do.
Helen.
Helen, why don't--
Why don't you come with me to California?
Well, I-
- I--
D--d-- don't worry.
I have a little money socked away.
Enough for two train tickets, if you don't mind riding coach.
And-- and I'll still have enough to get the school going somehow.
I'm so glad you asked me.
I didn't want to be the one that suggested it.
You're--
You're quite a girl, Mrs. Hill.
You know, you-- you really are, Mrs. Hill.
Ah!
Oh, wait a minute.
No more "Mrs. Hill."
No, from now on, you're going to be Helen Martin.
Helen Martin?
I'm going to be Adelle Stuart.
Adelle Stuart?
New names and new lives.
New lives.
Yeah, a whole new shuffle for both of us, okay?
Okay.
And--And if the school catches on, then, we'll-- we'll hire one of those high-priced lawyers.
Maybe even Clarence Darrow, for an appeal, for the boys.
And, anyway, we're gonna be 2,000 miles away from everything, including that.
Hello?
Your light went on so I know you're awake.
You will kindly refrain from disturbing us further!
H-
- He's been watching us.
Come away from there.
Come away from there, Adelle Stuart.
California, here we come.
That's it, girls.
Swing those arms out.
Turn around, now.
Good, swing the arms.
Go right around, that's it.
And one more turn.
That's perfect, yes.
And around, and kick.
And turn.
And turn, turn.
Lift those hands.
Lift.
Good.
Two,
Very good, Winona.
Good.
Now, okay, twist, twist.
Good.
Well, time's up for today, kids.
You're going to be just swell.
Miss Stuart, have any of those talent scouts said they're coming to the recital?
Well, we, uh, we heard from Universal and Columbia, but we haven't heard from the other studios.
Well, you gotta have MGM.
Oh, Miss Stuart.
Miss Stuart, you know how bad Charlene's eyes are.
You know, the trouble she has with them.
Now, if you put her in the back row for the recit--
Well, I haven't forgotten, Mrs. Baker.
Mrs. Barker.
I haven't-
- I haven't forgotten.
Mrs. Palmer, excuse me.
Winona, what's the matter?
You were doing just great last time.
I hate my costume.
Well, we do like all the girls to dress alike.
It's her father's idea.
He had it made up special, in four different colors.
Well, couldn't you speak to him, being the mother?
Oh, I'm only the housekeeper, Miss Stuart.
We don't talk about my mother.
She's bad.
Look, I'll try to explain it to Mr. Palmer, but I doubt he'll listen.
He's a Texas man.
Come on, Winona.
Oh, look at the little lady.
Don't stare, Donna.
It's rude.
Oh, Miss Stuart.
Miss Stuart, now, you won't forget, will you?
No, I won't.
Helen?
Helen?
Helen?
Poor little thing.
Ah.
Oh.
Oh, Adelle.
My little white one she doesn't feel well.
The poor thing doesn't feel well.
- Oh.
- Here we are.
The poor little thing.
You know, she's expecting.
Yeah, you know what they say about rabbits.
No, what?
Helen, what are you going to do with all of them?
Oh, I'm going to love them, take care of them.
You're still the country girl at heart.
But, all the same, you're the Marion Davies type.
Marion, who?
Well, didn't you see Marion in--in Polly of the Circus?
No, I'm afraid the only movie
I've seen in five years is Sign of the Cross.
Oh.
Well, Marion Davies is lovely.
She's beautiful.
But, Adelle, I'm not one bit like her.
You could be.
Helen, you know how much I read about show business.
Mm-hmm.
Yes, I know.
And how interested I am in everything.
Yes.
You know, it's important to know what type you are.
You know, the public always looks for types.
Yes, I know.
Like, I am Jean Harlow, definitely.
Oh, you know, I think I've heard of her.
Uh, she's English, isn't she?
No.
No, no, Helen, she's from Kansas City and they call her "The Blonde Bombshell."
Here, take a look.
Oh, she's lovely.
Oh, I see.
Th-- that's why you changed the color of your hair.
Oh, but you're much prettier than she is.
We could be sisters.
The public always looks for types.
All right, now here we go.
There we are.
There we go.
Oh.
And there we are.
There.
Something the matter?
Oh, no.
Oh, I know how it feels to have your hair cut off.
Here, look at yourself.
Hmm?
I used to wear my hair longer than Jeannette MacDonald's.
Isn't that gonna look nifty?
I mean, after I get it shaped in a bit, huh?
Adelle, why don't you wear your wedding ring anymore?
A ring doesn't mean a marriage.
Anyway, that's in the past now.
Oh, I hate to think about the past.
Sometimes I can't help it.
You mean, the boys?
No, further back than that.
Lenny's father.
How he died.
Tell me.
Well, you know we had a little farm.
And one morning, it was a lovely day,
I made him a picnic lunch, and I took Lenny, and I went out into the field.
We were going to have a ride on the plough.
And we started out and then the harness seemed to come loose and Matt got off to fix it.
And then something frightened the horses.
And I couldn't hold them.
And the blades of the plough they're big, and they're much sharper than they look.
He fell.
And Matt fell.
He fell.
And Lenny saw it.
He saw it all, and he blamed me for ever afterwards for-- for not being able to save his father.
But you said he was only-- only four years old.
He was too young to think anything like that.
But children do, they do somehow.
They-
- They look at you, and they just make you feel guilty.
You have to see yourself full-length to get the whole effect.
Oh, It's lovely, Adelle, lovely.
Good?
- Oh, thank you.
- It's perfect.
I startled you.
I'm so sorry.
But the front door was ajar, so I just came straight up.
You should have rung the bell.
I hate to spoil an entrance, I'm afraid.
Are you Miss Stuart?
No.
I am Helen Martin, Miss Stuart's partner.
Oh, but I've heard excellent reports of you... in the profession.
I give private lessons, you see, in voice and diction to a few moppets with ambitious mothers.
Among these is...
your Charlene Barker, a small but horrendous creature of absolutely no talent whatsoever.
Now, since the arrival of the talking picture--
Uh, just what are you trying to say to us?
It's perfectly simple, my dear lady.
Just concentrate for a moment, will you?
Since the talking picture is here to stay, your moppets must learn to speak distinctly as well as shake their fat little legs.
Now, why not extend your curriculum to include courses in drama and elocution given by myself?
Maybe he's got something.
I mean, Shirley doesn't just dance, she's an actress, too.
We do not know who he is.
My name is Hamilton Starr, two "R's", but prophetic nonetheless.
Now, a-- at what time do you conclude your classes in the morning?
- 11 o'clock.
- Good.
And that is when I shall return with some rather impressive letters of reference.
Until then, ladies, good night.
"Good night, sweet ladies."
That's Hamlet, of course.
Oh, don't bother.
I like to find my own way out as well as in.
By the way shall I close the front door?
Rather unwise, you know, to leave it open.
Girls!
Girls!
Now, kids, you've got the steps okay, but we need to jazz it up a bit.
Hmm?
Let me show you what I mean.
Well, you see what I mean?
Now, it's after 11.
I'll see you all on Wednesday.
Helen, on Goody, Goody, after the break, make a note to speed it up a little bit, hmm?
Uh, Miss Stuart, any word from the other talent scouts?
Sure, we have Paramount coming, too.
You didn't look at my Rosalie once today.
How do you know if she's doing good or bad or what?
Oh, I did look, Mrs. Greenbaum, and she's doing exceptionally well.
Mr. Palmer?
I'll see you on Wednesday, Mrs. Greenbaum.
They're very interested in Rosalie at RKO.
Oh, that's wonderful, Mrs. Greenbaum.
She could make you famous.
Yes, well, I'll bet she will.
Why don't you bring her a little earlier on Wednesday?
- Hmm?
- I will if she's not testing.
Uh, Mr. Palmer, about Winona's practice costumes...
You don't like 'em?
I think they're dumb.
Daddy, can we go home now?
We do have a rule here that all the girls dress alike, and it makes Winona self-conscious to stand out from all the others.
Really?
Well, it shouldn't.
I mean, if you got it, why be afraid to let it stand out, Miss Stuart?
Well, if you've got it, you don't have to draw attention to it,
Mr. Palmer.
I'm hungry.
Ah.
That's a-- that's a very interesting subject,
Miss Stuart.
I'd-
- I'd like to chat some more about that, but--
Maybe over dinner tonight?
Tonight?
You got a date?
We'll make it tomorrow night, then.
- Oh, no, tonight'd be just fine.
- Seven o'clock?
Mm-hmm.
I'll pick you up.
Come on, baby doll.
I want a giant chocolate malted.
Adelle!
Holy Moses!
Ladies, ladies, please!
I found him up here.
He-- he startled me.
Your class was running a bit late, so I decided to inspect the facilities.
I'm so sorry if I alarmed your partner.
Surprise entrances are one thing, Mr. Starr.
Snooping is another.
How right you are.
Oh, I admit, I am subject to the disease of curiosity.
Now, where do we discuss these sordid business details?
Do you still have your instinct, Adelle?
He makes me laugh.
Oh.
We have the bond of humor, Miss Stuart.
I'm so glad.
Mrs. Martin may still think that I'm Jack the Ripper, but my references are A-1.
You could make a start by calling up Constance Bennett.
Constance Bennett?
Did you hear that, Helen?
We still don't know a thing about him.
But I have letters from the immortals!
Let me see.
Oh, Belasco, of course.
And then, here's John Barrymore.
I played the ghost, not the gravedigger...
- Oh.
- ...to his Hamlet, you see.
George Bernard Shaw, good enough for anyone,
I should imagine.
Then there's Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree,
Mrs. Patrick Campbell--
Kay Francis!
Did you hear all these names, Helen?
Those people don't mean a thing to me.
But, of course anything concerning the school is up to you.
Now what is there about me that makes Mrs. Martin so nervous?
Oh, well, Helen just isn't used to theatrical types.
What?
Ln this town?
Well, even for this town, you're a pretty special kind of ham, Mr. Starr.
Oh, Madame.
Shall we go to my office?
I should love it.
Thank you.
Everywhere I go, folks come up to me and say,
"Sister Alma, where do you get the energy to hold three services each and every day?"
"From the pure love of God," I tell them.
What I say to you now, brothers and sisters, is repent.
Repent and be saved.
"There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked."
Right this... ♪ Da da da da da da ♪
How swank.
Helen, is that what you're having for supper, carrots and lettuce?
That's for my rabbits.
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.
Here, help, help.
Helen, I took on Mr. Starr.
Oh, I guessed you would.
Now, don't let the Dracula act fool you, really, he's just a show-off.
I think he'll be a real asset.
Well, for your sake, I hope so.
There's my date.
Well, good night, Helen.
Good night.
Uh, Adelle?
Uh-huh?
Uh, you won't be home late, will you?
No, I don't suppose so.
Um...
Oh, how I love these evening visits with my dear friends.
A chance for us to get together...
What do you want?
A cup of coffee, a pie, a sandwich.
I've had nothing to eat in a couple of days.
Do you know what it is to go hungry?
I lost my job six months ago.
It's a hard life out there.
Why did you ring this bell?
Why pick on me?
You look like you could spare a dime.
I--
I came out without any money.
Look for yourself.
Here's my date.
This man wants a handout.
Do you have any change?
Well, fella have a little something on me, but let's not be bothering the lady.
Thank you, Miss, not many people care about other people anymore.
Should be more people like her in the world, she gives a damn.
Did he scare you, honey?
Oh.
Poverty frightens me, I guess.
Oh.
Thank you.
Open it.
Oh.
Gardenias!
Joan Crawford's favorite!
I've never been on a gambling ship before.
It's so, uh, ritzy!
With the money that they take in, it ought to be.
Okay, tell me something.
- What?
- Anything about you.
You ever been married?
Uh, no.
Just love 'em and leave 'em, huh?
Well, I can't say as I blame you.
Well, I've got nothing against marriage.
It's just that...
Well, it's the oldest story in the world.
I never met the right man.
I bet you have a great time playing the field, huh?
I know I do.
Oh!
It's a tango.
Do you do the tango?
Sorry, I don't think even you could teach me to dance.
Oh, it's all right.
No more bets.
Number 19.
Mind if I ask the lady to dance?
Hmm?
Oh, I think that's up to the lady.
You want to, Adelle?
Go on.
Go on, get out there.
You know you're just aching to.
Thank you.
I'll leave this with you.
When can I see you again?
You just ask me.

Oh no, that'll keep me awake.
All right, so I've got a snoot full.
Hey, what's going on in there?
Adelle, I tried on my new dress, and I started to decorate the hall for our recital.
Ah, don't waste your time.
We're going to have it in a real theater with scenery, lights, orchestra, the works courtesy of Mr. Lincoln Palmer.
But it's our recital!
Well--
Well, he's a very generous man.
Hmm.
Oh, yes.
Oh, he's generous and wonderful.
Helen, he's the first man I've been serious about in years.
Yes, but is he serious about you?
Yes, I think he is.
He called me a knockout.
Oh, my, isn't he a fast worker?
That's marvelous.
It's marvelous.
I'm very happy for you.
You told him about Wes?
What?
Well, that he hasn't answered any of your letters, or has he?
No.
Helen, you do act like a kill joy sometimes.
I'm sorry.
I mean, I come home from a great evening, with a great guy, and you have to bring up Wes.
But it's a realistic problem.
I mean I--
I thought that he should know about it before you get too seriously involved.
I'll tell him.
Oh, excuse me, Adelle.
Are you scared that--?
Yes, of course, I am.
I'm scared as hell.
- Good night.
- Adelle.
Adelle, uh...
Adelle?
Uh, d-- did you remember to lock the door downstairs?
I did.

I'm tired, Adelle, I--
I had to fix Sue Anne's costume.
Lt split again.
Oh, I told her mother a hundred times, that girl has to watch her diet.
Don't let it get you down, Helen, Hmm?
Rosalie, you were wonderful.
It went better at rehearsal.
You have just seen a star being born.
Now, come on, girls, it's your turn.
Come on.
Let's not be late.
Hurry, hurry.
Hurry up.
Everybody on stage.
Don't be...
Check your gloves.
Check your--
Lots of personalities, big smile.
And now, to conclude the first half of Adelle's Kiddystar Revue, a salute to our President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Military on Parade!
Helen.
Helen.
Helen?
Now, Helen, is that Sue Anne's costume?
Do let me take it to her before her fat mother has a heart attack.
Well, thank you.
"Even though I walk... through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me;
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me."
Mrs. Martin...
There is something wrong with this harness.
Sue Anne is trapped in her costume.
It's just too tight, Mama, and I can't undo it!
She's asphyxiating!
I'll fix it.
Hammy, would you come and help Sue Anne for me?
Of course, I will, darling.
I've got to get on.
Helen, Helen...
There, what's wrong?
We've got to cut her out of this.
Hasn't anybody got a knife?
A knife?
Oh, yes, I've got a knife.
Now...
Hmm.
No.
I just can't get over it.
Right there, my one big moment, all bitched up.
Honey, you carried it off just fine.
But everybody saw.
I never flubbed a moment like that in my whole life.
I'm telling ya, nobody out front knew what was going on.
Yeah, well, everybody knows now.
God knows what they must think.
What's the matter with Helen?
Well, all that Bible-punchin' that, ah... that'll get you in the end.
I honestly thought that Helen had one more foot on the ground than I did.
But to ruin our show...
It's not that important.
You hear?
You don't have to walk me to the door.
Good night.

Helen, the doctor told you to rest.
I'm all right now.
You mustn't answer it.
She's off her rocker.
What did you say?
I heard what you said.
Helen, give me the phone.
Please?
- No, no.
- Helen, this is impossible.
You better go back to working in an office or something.
"There is none so blind as those who will not see."
I am not off my rocker!
- I finally saw him.
- Who?
Him.
Him.
He was standing out there just a minute ago.
Watching you and Linc...
smooching.
You mean, you just happened to be looking out of the window when Linc drove me home?
He was standing out there, smoking a cigarette.
Just like he was that other night.
Hello?
Hello?
Who is this?
You see, Adelle?
I told you so.
Oh, my poor little creatures.
Aw...
Oh...
Oh, I've neglected them.
They've been without water all day.
This old pan is rusted through.
Oh, Helen, that's too bad.
Maybe... maybe there's another one in the cellar.
Helen!
What's the matter?
Helen, get away from here.
Come away.
Come away.
Where are we?
Well, this is just a little somethin'
I rent for the summer.
With an option to buy, of course.
I thought I heard you.
Good evening, Miss Stuart.
- Is Nonie asleep?
- Yes.
And dinner will be ready shortly.
Oh, it's just like in the movies.
You haven't seen nothing yet.
Come on.
Do you want a drink?
Uh-huh.
What's your pleasure?
- Oh, anything.
- Gin Rickey?
That's fine.
One Gin Rickey comin' up.
You want to tell me about it?
Well, I want to, but...
Or did you already tell me?
Something came in the mail this mornin'.
I thought maybe it was from you.
I never sent you this.
You didn't?
Well, I thought maybe it was your way of letting me know without havin' to talk about it.
Must have come from one of those nuts that sign themselves "a well-wisher," you know?
Yes.
That's who it must have been.
A well-wisher who lives near where I live.
So you wanted to keep a secret from me, huh?
No.
Well, we don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Oh, my.
No guy can be that marvelous.
Now I'm glad the secret's out.
You know, Helen's boy, Lenny, he was-- he was the ringleader.
He admitted it.
- Wes...
- Do you hear from him at all?
No.
I write to him every week, but he never answers.
He just won't have anything to do with me.
There's no way I can get through.
What about the appeal?
What?
I said, what about the appeal?
Oh.
It takes a lot of tap lessons to pay for an appeal.
Yeah, well, uh maybe I can be of some help.
How?
Well, judging from what I read in the papers, that, uh that lawyer was not so hot.
Do you want me to put you on to someone?
- You'd do that?
- Be my guest.
Oh.
One man can be that marvelous.
If you didn't know about that letter what's eating you, huh?
I, uh...
I've been wondering for days whether to try and tell you or not, or how.
I--
I was scared.
I want to open tonight with a poem that our dear Sister Bertha wrote and gave to me, and which I want to share with you.
"Put the love of God in action
"Make His word the main attraction.
"Sin and sickness you'll erase.
And perfect peace will take its place."
Thank you for those words, Sister Bertha.
Oh.
Water and power, telephone, gas, Hollywood Dress Store.
Helen?
A letter for you.
That letter is addressed to Mrs. Helen Hill.
Oh, I hadn't noticed.
It's mailed from around here, too.
Aren't you going to open it?
No.
See who's it from?
Mr. Mailman.
Mr. Mailman!
We're very sorry, there's no one by that name at this address.
Do you understand?
Adelle...
I refused the letter.
Very smart.
Well, it seemed like the best thing to do.
Helen?
Yes?
Do you wish me well?
- Of course, I do, dear.
- Then, you're a well-wisher.
Yes.
Some people who call themselves well-wishers do crazy things.
You know?
I'm afraid I don't understand what you're talking about.
Suppose the same person who wrecked my cutout, sent a picture of you and me at the trial to Linc?
Well, if that same person wanted to throw me off the scent she'd arrange to receive a bad piece of news herself, wouldn't she?
Adelle, you can't be imagining things like this about me.
I don't believe this.
W-- why can't you just face the truth instead?
I am facing it.
And it's not very pleasant, Helen.
"Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord."
Here we go.
Now, you listen to me, Adelle.
There is someone out there seeking revenge on us.
Despite your social preoccupations, you remember?
He cut my hand.
You heard his phone calls!
He stabbed your cutout.
Adelle, did you ever take a good look at Ellie Banner's face?
Look.
No, thank you.
Why?
She was a working woman, just like us.
About the same age.
- Quite a bit like us.
- So?
So our sons really wanted to kill us.
They hated us.
That was the substitute revenge.
I am not like you, Adelle.
I'm not trying to buy back my son's love by charming some rich man to charm--
I want you out of here!
Adelle, Linc's big lawyer might help Wes if he's paid enough.
But what will you do if you really get him back?
You can't buy back his love and respect.
You neglected him.
You deserve his hatred!
Tonight!
Right away, I want you out!
And so, to get your free mug, here's all you do.
Just print your name and address plainly on a piece of paper and send it in together with a thin metal foil seal from under the lid of a can of sweet, chocolate-flavored Ovaltine.
Mail it to Orphan Annie--
Helen, here's your check.
Thank you.
I'll be gone by the time you get back.
I'm going to a hotel.
I'll send for my things.
There's Linc.
Good-bye, Helen.
Be careful.
Adelle...
I forgive you.
"It's harder for a rich man to get into Heaven than it is for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle."
Direct from the Church of the Open Hand in Hollywood we bring you The Sister Alma Hour.
And now, Sister Alma.
Dear brethren my key word for the day is "love."
One of the greatest things we need for our goal in life is love.
Can you spell it?
L-O-V-E.
The very same love that the Lord has for us all.
I'll let this very same love be your guide.
Love the Lord with all your heart.
Let it flow out like a great river till your--
Mrs. Helen Hill?
Did you get my letter?
Matt?
Ma....
Oh.
SISTER ALMA:... consciousness of your unity with Him.
And when you love God with all your heart and with all your soul you'll find comfort.
Adelle, please, don't turn on the light.
Helen, I thought you'd be gone.
It's him.
Adelle, it's finally him.
He was up there.
He called me by my real name.
He said, "Mrs. Helen Hill?"
And so I-
- I pushed him, and he fell, he hit his head.
He's dead.
Who is he?
I don't know.
Oh, my God.
Helen...
Do you have a relative in West Virginia?
I-
- I don't think so.
- Well...
- Why?
...she died.
And, apparently, left you some money.
And that-- that man-- that man that called you by your name he-- he works for a company that locates missing heirs.
Did you hear that, Helen?
That's all he does.
Did you hear me, Helen?
Did you hear me?
Did you hear what I said?
He just locates missing heirs.
Oh, my God.
Is there any reason for this up there?
Is there any reason why I should have to start all over again?
Again?
- Call...
- What?
We have to tell someone.
Oh, you're not going to call the police?
No, no.
Linc.
He's rich.
He's important.
He's the only one who can help us now.
Put down that phone!
Your son took away one love, and you're not going to take away Linc.
- We'll get rid of him, Helen.
- No.
- Together.
- No!
Just you and me.
No, Adelle.
We are going to get rid of him.
No!
Adelle!
You and me.
Together.
Both of us.
Get him off of me!
Get him off!
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Oh.
May I have the matches?
'Cause this letter about me...
One cannot be too careful can one?
Adelle...
You and me we're going to be together again,
just like we were.
Just us together.
Friends.
Yeah.
Friends.
"A"...
"E"...
"I"...
"O" "U."
But much more. "U."
Now, "May"...
"Me"...
"My" "Mo."
And now, from the diaphragm.
Hands on your diaphragms, young ladies.
"Tray, say."
"Fee, fee..."
"Fi, Fi."
"Fo, Fo."
"Foo, foo."
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
Uh, the bird of time once more is on the wing, chickabiddies.
Class dismissed.
"And forgive our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us."
"And deliver us from evil.
For thine--"
The police just left.
Oh.
If anyone had looked up in this direction, my heart would have stopped.
I'm beat.
I'm gonna take a nap.
You okay, Helen?
"Repent and ye shall be saved."
"For there is no peace," saith the Lord,
"unto the wicked."
Yes--
Yes, I'm-
- I'm fine.
I'm fine, Adelle.
...very moment, turn away from your worldly ways, and seek the word of the Lord.
Our dear Lord says,
"Go, and sin no more."
Let me tell you, brothers and sisters.
Let me tell you, a drink of whiskey... will never give you the kind of lift
I'm talking about.
Helen?
The lift I'm talking about, brothers and sisters, is confessing your mistakes to a merciful God.
"Joy shall be in Heaven over one sinner that repenteth."
I don't care what mistakes you've made.
Tell it all-- all to God.
God is never shocked.
No, sir!
God will understand all and forgive all.

And now, beloved brothers and sisters for the glorification of our dear Lord and a continuation of our blessed work here at the haven of the Open Hand we ask your offerings of love tonight.
Now, while the ushers pass among you we come to that special moment in our service when those of you who feel the need may step forward and be anointed by the oil of everlasting youth.
Now, if you will form your line in the aisle, to your right brothers and sisters and leave your gifts in the golden basket here before me.
God bless you, sister, God bless you.
Youth is yours forever.
God bless you, sister, youth is yours forever.
God bless you, brother.
Oh, what a glorious demonstration of faith.
I feel love all around me tonight.
God bless you, sister.
Youth is yours forever.
- God bless...
- I've come to you to confess.
Confession is a matter between you and the Supreme Being, sister.
No, I've come to confess because I need his forgiveness.
You have it.
God is all-merciful and all-forgiving.
No, I need his forgiveness before they find out that--
I told you, God forgives you.
Take my word for it.
No!
You told me to come to you on the radio.
You told me I would find joy in Heaven.
Well, if I have his forgiveness, why don't I feel that joy?
I offered you my blessing, but you refused it.
Now, move along.
No, no, I need to be saved.
No, I want to be saved.
I want to be-- Please, no, no!
No!
You leave me alone!
You don't want me forgiven!
You want me damned!
You only did what had to be done, sister.
God has forgiven you.
There is no forgiveness for me.
God bless you, brother.
Youth is yours forever.
Her classes are great.
Oh, please tell me, how is poor Mrs. Martin?
The doctor gave her a sedation to sleep.
She's been working much too hard.
Oh, yes, of course, indeed.
Sensitive type, the overstrung type.
People of her type, you know, throw themselves into everything.
And then that man that man dying in the trench outside.
What has that got to do with it?
To people of that type, any shock is highly injurious.
Do you remember her first reaction to me?
Adelle?
I-
- I have to go to the doctor, Helen.
- I have to go, let me go!
- You're not supposed to--
It's only I, Mrs. Martin.
But if I can be of any help, in any way at all.
No, that-- that's all right.
Thank you.
Helen, you must get back to bed.
Helen?
You're going back to bed.
Remember the way she behaved at the recital?
Very nervous for a long time.
I'm afraid there's something odd...
You've got to get back into bed.
I-
- I know.
- You must get some sleep.
- I can't sleep!
Here, take your pill.
I can't sleep.
Have you prayed?
The damned don't pray, Adelle.
If you'd let me atone, I'd be all right.
The Lord welcomes sinners with open arms, but you-- you hit--
Linc and I are going out for a while.
You try and sleep.
I-
- I know why you did it, of course.
Just like I know why you're keeping me here.
You're afraid.
Adelle.
You're afraid of me.
That if I speak you will be damned, too.
All I want you to do is to get well, as soon as possible.
And then I want you to go away, as far as possible.
Oh, you're so beautiful.
So white, so pure.
Oh.
Helen.
Oh!
It's only I.
I'm so sorry.
I always seem to frighten you, don't I?
Look, I saw this on my way home in a garden as I passed, and so I borrowed it for you.
- Ah!
- Oh, the thorn.
Always a thorn somewhere, isn't there?
Now, there.
Now, you're so cold.
Would you like to go inside for a little?
Before I go back to that dreary hotel...
Back to that solitary room of mine.
Linc, I want to tell you something.
Certainly came a cropper that time, Milly.
Oh, shut up, George.
Marriage, there's nothing like it.
Is that what you wanted to tell me?
"There's nothing like marriage," hmm?
No, that wasn't--
You weren't suggesting something there, were you?
Huh?
No.
I-
- I had an entirely different subject--
Sometimes I wonder, you know, when a girl tells a guy on their first date that he needs to settle down, that's--
Oh, no, Linc.
I-
- I had absolutely no intention--
Honey, honey.
Now, wait a minute here.
You know, you don't have to try and fool me anymore.
- Well, I--
- You want to marry me?
Well, I'll tell you somethin',
I'm crazy about you, I want to marry you, too.
Your shot.
Well, am I accepted, hmm?
I'm dead serious, I mean it.
Well, I won't say no.
Hey, that's great, we'll drive down to Yuma tonight and tie the knot.
Tonight?
If anything's worth doing, it's worth doing right away.
Oh.
♪ Pack up all my cares and woes ♪
♪ Here I go, swingin' low ♪
♪ Bye, bye, blackbird ♪
♪ Where somebody waits for me ♪
♪ Sugar sweet, so is he ♪
♪ Bye, bye, blackbird ♪
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Helen.
Now, Adelle,
I couldn't leave my poor little creatures, could I?
I mean, I love them.
The--
The vet wouldn't take them back, and no one else would.
You know--
You know, that's exactly what happened with, uh Lenny's father, I...
I-- I had to leave him, too.
After a while I--
I couldn't stand him,
I couldn't stand him to touch me.
If you love them you-- you can't just leave them.
You--
You have to release them.
Helen.
If you're trying to tell me that you killed your husband I just don't believe you.
I--
I don't believe you.
Well, I did!
It's the truth.
I--
I pushed him.
You know, like I pushed that...
Adelle, I always--
I always told you that I was the guilty one, remember?
You-- you--
You wouldn't let me speak, Adelle.
You wouldn't help me.
You-- you didn't want to hear the truth.
Helen...
I think you should speak now.
You must.
Uh-huh.
I'm going to call Sister Alma and then I'm going to tell her to talk to you and to listen to you and to let you know that God has forgiven you.
Oh.
Oh, you'd do that?
- Yes.
- You would really do that?
Oh, thank you, Adelle.
Thank you.
I want to do everything that-- that you think best.
I really do.
You see, Helen, everything will be all right.
Uh, Sister Alma will understand and help you.
And this time I'll let her.
Thank you, Adelle, you're so good to me.
I'm-- I'm ashamed of myself.
Yes, well, Helen Linc is going to help the boys and he's going to help you.
Why?
Why should he?
Because we're going to be married and you'll confess and have the blessed peace of repentance.
Oh.
Oh, Adelle?
Adelle?
Mrs. Hill?
Yes, I am.
I'm, uh, Detective Sergeant West from Braddock.
Uh, may I come in, please?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Oh, is Mrs. Bruckner here?
Because this concerns her, too.
Uh, no.
I'm afraid she's out at the moment.
I see.
Well, Mrs. Hill, I wonder if you might mind looking at this photograph that I have here.
Certainly.
You-- you don't know him?
No.
- You've never seen him before?
- No.
Well, Mrs. Hill, they found his body just three days ago in that trench right across the street there.
Oh, yes, that dreadful accident.
He knew Ellie Banner.
He was her, uh...
her lover.
Oh, what an extraordinary coincidence.
Oh, I see.
I see, that's why you thought that...
I'm sorry, Sergeant, I can't help you.
Mrs. Hill, didn't you or Mrs. Bruckner ever receive any threatening telephone calls?
Why, no.
It's a thing they often do.
Who?
Well, the important thing is, you're out of danger now.
I am?
That's always nice to know.
Wait a minute, Sergeant.
You mean, Ms. Stuart...
I mean, Mrs. Bruckner and-- and myself, we were in danger from this man who loved Ellie Banner?
Yes, from what he said to a couple of people, he was crazy with the idea of revenge.
Of course, he suffered greatly when she died.
Your boys were out of reach, of course, and so he fixed on their mothers.
Uh, he traced you out here.
Mrs. Hill?
I think you've had a very lucky escape.
Yes.
It's all been quite a shock.
And, uh, I can't stand violence.
It's unforgivable.
You see, Sergeant, that's why when my boy...
Uh...
Do you mind if I tell Mrs. Bruckner about this?
Yes, that's perfectly all right.
Well, that's about it.
Uh, I'll just let myself out.
Yes.
Good-bye.
Uh, Sergeant?
Uh...
Uh, forgive me.
I--
I didn't even thank you... or ask you if you'd like a cup of coffee or something?
Oh, no, no, that's perfectly all right.
Thank you again, Ma'am, and, uh, good night.
Thank you.
Adelle!
Adelle!
Adelle!
Adelle, darling!
It was him!
Lt was that man!
Adelle?
Adelle?
Uh, now, just a minute, please.
Shh.
My partner is not quite finished with our recital yet.
[News theme music playing]
You have a very great opportunity not merely to provide bread and butter not merely to keep people from starving.
You have the further great social opportunity of inculcating the understanding that we've got to build from the bottom up and not merely supply food from the top down.
[News theme music playing]
ANNOUNCER:
The First Lady, about to take an aerial holiday, has a word to say before she goes.
I'm very glad to be here, and I'm just starting on an unofficial trip to Puerto Rico, hoping to see something of a very beautiful island and its people.
ANNOUNCER:
Mrs. Roosevelt gets ready for the first over-ocean flight ever made by a president's wife.
Off to Haiti, landing safely a few hours later, then Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
A triple hop of 1,250 miles for the flying First Lady.
[Music playing]
Emotion continued high in this small country courthouse, as young Leonard Hill and Wesley Bruckner, after six weeks of one of the century's grisliest murder trials, were sentenced to life imprisonment.
During the course of the trial, the jury was shown photographs such as these, depicting the brutal mutilation killing of Ellie Banner, one of Braddock's most respected citizens.
[Crowd shouting]
There was a tense moment as crowds, displeased at the verdict, threatened the orderly departure of the young killers from the courthouse.
Leaving moments later are the convicted men's mothers,
Adelle Bruckner and Helen Hill.
During the sensation-packed days of the trial,
Mrs. Bruckner and Mrs. Hill have been subjected to nearly as much public curiosity as their sons.
And so the ordeal comes to an end for these two women, as their sons go to prison for life.
[Music playing]
[Piano music playing]
Billy, get us out of here.
[Car horn honking]
Do you have a handkerchief?
Sure.
- [Horn honking] - [Adelle sighs]
ADELLE:
You're not going to cry, are you?
You never cry.
[Crowd thumping on car]
Oh, no.
What happened?
Somebody cut me.
- Somebody out there cut me.
- [Horn honking]
HELEN:
The handkerchief, put the handkerchief on it.
Oh, Billy, hurry!
[Car door closing]
[Door closes]
ADELLE:
I know it's against your religion, Helen but you better have a shot of gin.
Adelle, I'd rather have a first aid kit.
Oh, yeah, of course.
Where did I--?
Oh.
I call that real class.
Why?
What?
Well, the way-- the way you didn't scream or anything.
I'd have raised the roof.
Iodine first, dear.
Oh.
Go ahead.
Go on.
And you never saw who did it?
[Sighs]
I didn't even feel it.
I just looked down, and my palm was full of blood.
What kind of a screwball would do such a thing?
There.
Thank you, Adelle.
[Sighs] How 'bout a little shot of gin now?
[Sighs]
Holy Moses, I--
I still have a heap to get done if I'm going to get out of here on Friday.
I think I'm gonna have that shot of gin.
[Exhales]
- Helen
- Mmm?
Helen, I didn't tell you.
But you know what I've decided?
Mmm?
I decided that the school in California is going to be all different, just for kids.
You know, out there in Hollywood, kids are the cat's meow.
Cat's meow?
Since Shirley Temple, you know?
You have heard of Shirley Temple?
I hardly ever go to the movies, but I've heard of Shirley Temple.
You know, out there in Hollywood all the parents are crazy to get their kids in the movies.
And somebody has to teach them how to sing and dance, so why shouldn't I help?
Adelle...
Won't you mind being so far away from your boy?
Of course, I will.
But what can I do about it?
He turned on me.
He really turned on me, Helen.
You saw.
I just don't understand it.
I did everything I could for him.
It wasn't my fault that his father took a powder.
You know,
Adelle, men can be quite a bit lower than the angels.
[Telephone ringing]
That's for sure.
Adelle's New York School of Dance.
Hello?
This is she.
Yeah, hold on.
It's, uh... someone with asthma for you.
Hello?
Hello?
MAN:
I thought you'd like to know,
I'm the one who cut you today.
Why?
MAN:
I wanted to see you bleed.
Like Ellie Banner.
I wanted to be sure you can.
You'll bleed, all right.
So will the other one.
You have no right to talk to me like that.
ADELLE:
What's going on?
MEN:
Those boys should have gone to the gallows.
Somebody's got to pay for what they did to Ellie.
And somebody's going to.
You and her.
Wherever you are, I'm gonna--
[Hangs up phone]
- [Music playing]
- I'll call the police.
[Telephone dialing]
Don't.
No.
We'll be all over the papers again.
I can't take that anymore.
Adelle, that man's dangerous.
Helen, how do you know?
He may be just a harmless crank.
Oh Helen, please don't do anything yet.
Honestly, Helen, I can't stand any more.
ADELLE:
I don't understand.
Wes, saying that he hated me and that I was too busy when he needed me.
[Chuckles]
I was busy dancing my feet off to earn a buck so we could eat.
I did everything I could.
Adelle.
Dear, no matter how bad things get you must always tell yourself, always, there is a reason, there has to be a reason.
UP there?
Yes.
[Sobs]
I need a reason down here.
I do.
Helen.
Helen, why don't--
Why don't you come with me to California?
[Sighs]
Well, I-- l..
D--d-- don't worry.
I have a little money socked away.
Enough for two train tickets, if you don't mind riding coach.
And-- and I'll still have enough to get the school going somehow.
I'm so glad you asked me.
I didn't want to be the one that suggested it.
You're--
You're quite a girl, Mrs. Hill.
You know, you-- you really are, Mrs. Hill.
Ah!
Oh, wait a minute.
No more "Mrs. Hill."
No, from now on, you're going to be Helen Martin.
Helen Martin?
I'm going to be Adelle Stuart.
Adelle Stuart?
New names and new lives.
New lives.
Yeah, a whole new shuffle for both of us, okay?
Okay.
And-
- And if the school catches on, then, we'll-- we'll hire one of those high-priced lawyers.
Maybe even Clarence Darrow, for an appeal, for the boys.
And, anyway, we're gonna be 2,000 miles away
-from everything, - [Telephone ringing]
- Including that.
- [Telephone ringing]
[Music playing]
Hello?
MAN:
Your light went on so I know you're awake.
You will kindly refrain from disturbing us further!
[Music continues]
H-
- He's been watching us.
HELEN:
Come away from there.
Come away from there, Adelle Stuart.
California, here we come.
- [Piano music playing] - [Tap shoes clacking]
[Car horn honking]
[Tap shoes clacking]
ADELLE:
That's it, girls.
Swing those arms out.
Turn around, now.
Good, swing the arms.
Go right around, that's it.
And one more turn.
That's perfect, yes.
And around, and kick.
And turn.
And turn, turn.
- ADELLE:
Lift those hands.
- [Inaudible]
Lift.
Good.
Two.
Very good, Winona.
Good.
Now, okay, twist, twist.
Good.
Well, time's up for today, kids.
You're going to be just swell.
[Children laughing]
Miss Stuart, have any of those talent scouts said they're coming to the recital?
Well, we, uh, we heard from Universal and Columbia, but we haven't heard from the other studios.
Well, you gotta have MGM.
WOMAN:
Oh, Miss Stuart.
Miss Stuart, you know how bad Charlene's eyes are.
You know, the trouble she has with them.
Now, if you put her in the back row for the recit--
Well, I haven't forgotten, Mrs. Baker.
Mrs. Barker.
I haven't-
- I haven't forgotten.
[Children chattering]
Mrs. Palmer, excuse me.
Winona, what's the matter?
You were doing just great last time.
I hate my costume.
Well, we do like all the girls to dress alike.
It's her father's idea.
He had it made up special, in four different colors.
Well, couldn't you speak to him, being the mother?
Oh, I'm only the housekeeper, Miss Stuart.
We don't talk about my mother.
She's bad.
[Shushing]
Look, I'll try to explain it to Mr. Palmer, but I doubt he'll listen.
He's a Texas man.
Come on, Winona.
Oh, look at the little lady.
Don't stare, Donna.
It's rude.
Oh, Miss Stuart.
Miss Stuart, now, you won't forget, will you?
No, I won't.
[Jackhammering]
Helen?
[Door closing]
Helen?
[Birds singing]
Helen?
Poor little thing.
Ah.
Oh.
Oh, Adelle.
My little white one she doesn't feel well.
The poor thing doesn't feel well.
- Oh.
- Here we are.
The poor little thing.
You know, she's expecting.
Yeah, you know what they say about rabbits.
No, what?
Helen, what are you going to do with all of them?
Oh, I'm going to love them, take care of them.
[Laughs] You're still the country girl at heart.
But, all the same, you're the Marion Davies type.
Marion, who?
Well, didn't you see Marion in-- in Polly of the Circus?
No, I'm afraid the only movie
I've seen in five years is Sign of the Cross.
Oh.
Well, Marion Davies is lovely.
HELEN:
She's beautiful.
But, Adelle, I'm not one bit like her.
You could be.
Helen, you know how much I read about show business.
HELEN:
Mm-hmm.
Yes, I know.
ADELLE:
And how interested I am in everything.
HELEN:
Yes.
ADELLE:
You know, it's important to know what type you are.
You know, the public always looks for types.
Yes, I know.
Like, I am Jean Harlow, definitely.
Oh, you know, I think I've heard of her.
Uh, she's English, isn't she?
[Laughing] No.
No, no, Helen, she's from Kansas City and they call her "The Blonde Bombshell."
[Laughing]
Here, take a look.
Oh, she's lovely.
Oh, I see.
Th-- that's why you changed the color of your hair.
Oh, but you're much prettier than she is.
We could be sisters.
The public always looks for types.
All right, now here we go.
There we are.
There we go.
Oh.
And there we are.
There.
Something the matter?
Oh, no.
Oh, I know how it feels to have your hair cut off.
Here, look at yourself.
Hmm?
I used to wear my hair longer than Jeannette MacDonald's.
Isn't that gonna look nifty?
I mean, after I get it shaped in a bit, huh?
HELEN:
Adelle, why don't you wear your wedding ring anymore?
A ring doesn't mean a marriage.
Anyway, that's in the past now.
Oh, I hate to think about the past.
Sometimes I can't help it.
[Music playing]
You mean, the boys?
No, further back than that.
Lenny's father.
How he died.
Tell me.
Well, you know we had a little farm.
And one morning, it was a lovely day,
I made him a picnic lunch, and I took Lenny, and I went out into the field.
We were going to have a ride on the plough.
And we started out and then the harness seemed to come loose and Matt got off to fix it.
And then something frightened the horses.
[Horses neighing]
And I couldn't hold them.
And the blades of the plough they're big, and they're much sharper than they look.
[Scraping]
He fell.
[Screaming]
And Matt fell.
He fell.
And Lenny saw it.
He saw it all, and he blamed me for ever afterwards for-- for not being able to save his father.
But you said he was only-- only four years old.
He was too young to think anything like that.
But children do, they do somehow.
They-
- They look at you, and they just make you feel guilty.
[Music playing]
[Adelle exhales]
You have to see yourself full-length to get the whole effect.
Oh, It's lovely, Adelle, lovely.
Good?
[Kissing]
- Oh, thank you.
- It's perfect.
- [Music playing] - [Screams]
I startled you.
I'm so sorry.
But the front door was ajar, so I just came straight up.
You should have rung the bell.
I hate to spoil an entrance, I'm afraid.
Are you Miss Stuart?
No.
I am Helen Martin, Miss Stuart's partner.
Oh, but I've heard excellent reports of you... in the profession.
I give private lessons, you see, in voice and diction to a few moppets with ambitious mothers.
Among these is...
your Charlene Barker, a small but horrendous creature of absolutely no talent whatsoever.
[Chuckling]
MAN:
Now, since the arrival of the talking picture--
Uh, just what are you trying to say to us?
It's perfectly simple, my dear lady.
Just concentrate for a moment, will you?
Since the talking picture is here to stay, your moppets must learn to speak distinctly as well as shake their fat little legs.
Now, why not extend your curriculum to include courses in drama and elocution given by myself?
Maybe he's got something.
I mean, Shirley doesn't just dance, she's an actress, too.
We do not know who he is.
My name is Hamilton Starr, two "R's", but prophetic nonetheless.
[Chuckling]
Now, a-- at what time do you conclude your classes in the morning?
-11 o'clock.
- Good.
And that is when I shall return with some rather impressive letters of reference.
Until then, ladies, good night.
"Good night, sweet ladies."
That's Hamlet, of course.
STARR:
Oh, don't bother.
I like to find my own way out as well as in.
By the way shall I close the front door?
Rather unwise, you know, to leave it open.
- [Piano playing] - [Tap shoes clacking]
ADELLE:
Girls!
Girls!
Now, kids, you've got the steps okay, but we need to jazz it up a bit.
Hmm?
Let me show you what I mean.
[Children laughing]
[Jazz music playing]
[Tap shoes clacking]
[Jazz music ends]
[Applause]
Well, you see what I mean?
Now, it's after 11.
I'll see you all on Wednesday.
Helen, on Goody, Goody, after the break, make a note to speed it up a little bit, hmm?
Uh, Miss Stuart, any word from the other talent scouts?
Sure, we have Paramount coming, too.
You didn't look at my Rosalie once today.
How do you know if she's doing good or bad or what?
Oh, I did look, Mrs. Greenbaum, and she's doing exceptionally well.
Mr. Palmer?
I'll see you on Wednesday, Mrs. Greenbaum.
They're very interested in Rosalie at RKO.
ADELLE:
Oh, that's wonderful, Mrs. Greenbaum.
She could make you famous.
Yes, well, I'll bet she will.
Why don't you bring her a little earlier on Wednesday?
- Hmm?
- I will if she's not testing.
Uh, Mr. Palmer, about Winona's practice costumes...
You don't like 'em?
I think they're dumb.
Daddy, can we go home now?
We do have a rule here that all the girls dress alike, and it makes Winona self-conscious to stand out from all the others.
Really?
Well, it shouldn't.
I mean, if you got it, why be afraid to let it stand out, Miss Stuart?
Well, if you've got it, you don't have to draw attention to it,
Mr. Palmer.
[Chuckles]
I'm hungry-
Ah.
That's a-- that's a very interesting subject,
Miss Stuart.
I'd-
- I'd like to chat some more about that, but--
Maybe over dinner tonight?
Tonight?
You got a date?
We'll make it tomorrow night, then.
- Oh, no, tonight'd be just fine.
- Seven o'clock?
Mm-hmm.
I'll pick you UP-
Come on, baby doll.
WINONA:
I want a giant chocolate malted.

[Helen screaming]
HELEN:
Adelle!
ADELLE:
Holy Moses!
Ladies, ladies, please!
HELEN:
I found him up here.
He-- he startled me.
Your class was running a bit late, so I decided to inspect the facilities.
I'm so sorry if I alarmed your partner.
Surprise entrances are one thing, Mr. Starr.
Snooping is another.
[Laughing] How right you are.
Oh, I admit, I am subject to the disease of curiosity.
Now, where do we discuss these sordid business details?
Do you still have your instinct, Adelle?
He makes me laugh.
Oh.
We have the bond of humor, Miss Stuart.
I'm so glad.
Mrs. Martin may still think that I'm Jack the Ripper, but my references are A-1.
You could make a start by calling up Constance Bennett.
Constance Bennett?
Did you hear that, Helen?
We still don't know a thing about him.
But I have letters from the immortals!
Let me see.
Oh, Belasco, of course.
And then, here's John Barrymore.
I played the ghost, not the gravedigger...
- Oh.
-...to his Hamlet, you see.
George Bernard Shaw, good enough for anyone,
I should imagine.
Then there's Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree,
Mrs. Patrick Campbell--
Kay Francis!
Did you hear all these names, Helen?
Those people don't mean a thing to me.
But, of course anything concerning the school is up to you.
Now what is there about me that makes Mrs. Martin so nervous?
Oh, well, Helen just isn't used to theatrical types.
What?
In this town?
Well, even for this town, you're a pretty special kind of ham, Mr. Starr.
Oh, Madame.
[Speaks French]
[Laughing] Shall we go to my office?
I should love it.
Thank you.

Everywhere I go, folks come up to me and say,

Oh, how I love these evening visits with my dear friends.
A chance for us to get together...

What do you want?
A cup of coffee, a pie, a sandwich.
I've had nothing to eat in a couple of days.
Do you know what it is to go hungry?
[Chuckles]
I lost my job six months ago.
It's a hard life out there.
Why did you ring this bell?
Why pick on me?
You look like you could spare a dime.
I came out without any money.
Look for yourself.

Here's my date.

This man wants a handout.
Do you have any change?
Well, fella have a little something on me, but let's not be bothering the lady.

You ever been married?
Uh, no.
Just love 'em and leave 'em, huh?
Well, I can't say as I blame you.
Well, I've got nothing against marriage.

Ah, don't waste your time.
We're going to have it in a real theater with scenery, lights, orchestra, the works courtesy of Mr. Lincoln Palmer.
But it's our recital!

Or did you already tell me?
Something came in the mail this mornin'.
I thought maybe it was from you.
I never sent you this.
You didn't?
Well, I thought maybe it was your way of letting me know without havin' to talk about it.
Must have come from one of those nuts that sign themselves "a well-wisher," you know?
Yes.
That's who it must have been.
A well-wisher who lives near where I live.
So you wanted to keep a secret from me, huh?
No.
Well, we don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Oh, my.
No guy can be that marvelous.
Now I'm glad the secret's out.
You know, Helen's boy, Lenny, he was-- he was the ringleader.
He admitted it.

No.

I want to open tonight with a poem that our dear Sister Bertha wrote and gave to me, and which I want to share with you.
"Put the love of God in action
"Make His word the main attraction.
"Sin and sickness you'll erase.
"And perfect peace will take its place."
Thank you for those words, Sister Bertha.

Water and power, telephone, gas, Hollywood Dress Store.
Helen?
A letter for you.
That letter is addressed to Mrs. Helen Hill.
Oh, I hadn't noticed.
It's mailed from around here, too.
Aren't you going to open it?
No.
See who's it from?
[Whimpers]
Mr. Mailman.
Mr. Mailman!
We're very sorry, there's no one by that name at this address.
Do you understand?
Adelle...
I refused the letter.
Very smart.
Well, it seemed like the best thing to do.
Helen?
Yes?
Do you wish me well?
- Of course, I do, dear.
- Then, you're a well-wisher.
Yes.
Some people who call themselves well-wishers do crazy things.
You know?
I'm afraid I don't understand what you're talking about.
Suppose the same person who wrecked my cutout, sent a picture of you and me at the trial to Linc?
Well, if that same person wanted to throw me off the scent she'd arrange to receive a bad piece of news herself, wouldn't she?
Adelle, you can't be imagining things like this about me.
[Scoffs]
I don't believe this.
W-- why can't you just face the truth instead?
I am facing it.
And it's not very pleasant, Helen.
"Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord."
[Sighs] Here we go.
Now, you listen to me, Adelle.
There is someone out there seeking revenge on us.
Despite your social preoccupations, you remember?
He cut my hand.
You heard his phone calls!
He stabbed your cutout.
Adelle, did you ever take a good look at Ellie Banner's face?
Look.
No, thank you.
Why?
She was a working woman, just like us.
About the same age.
- Quite a bit like us.
- So?
So our sons really wanted to kill us.
They hated us.
That was the substitute revenge.
I am not like you, Adelle.
I'm not trying to buy back my son's love by charming some rich man to charm--
[Grunts]
I want you out of here!
[Sighs]
[Panting]
Adelle, Line's big lawyer might help Wes if he's paid enough.
But what will you do if you really get him back?
You can't buy back his love and respect.
You neglected him.
You deserve his hatred!
Tonight!
Right away, I want you out!

"It's harder for a rich man to get into Heaven than it is for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle."
MAN ON RADIO:
Direct from the Church of the Open Hand in Hollywood we bring you The Sister Alma Hour.
And now, Sister Alma.
SISTER ALMA:
Dear brethren my key word for the day is "love."
One of the greatest things we need for our goal in life is love.
Can you spell it?
L-O-V-E.
The very same love that the Lord has for us all.
I'll let this very same love be your guide.
Love the Lord with all your heart.
Let it flow out like a great river till your--

Mrs. Helen Hill?
Mrs. Helen Hill?
[Ominous music playing]
Did you get my letter?
[Ominous music continues]
[Grunts]
[Screaming]
[Thunder cracking]
[Ominous music playing]
Matt?
Ma...
[Blades scraping] [whimpering]
[Blades scraping]
Oh.
[whimpering]
SISTER ALMA: ...consciousness of your unity with Him.
[sighing]
And when you love God with all your heart and with all your soul you'll find comfort.
[Rain falling]
[Sighs]
[Gasps]
Adelle, please, don't turn on the light.
Helen, I thought you'd be gone.
It's him.
Adelle, it's finally him.
[Gasps]
HELEN:
He was up there.
He called me by my real name.
He said, "Mrs. Helen Hill?"
And so I-
- I pushed him, and he fell, he hit his head.
He's dead.
[whimpering]
Who is he?
[Sighs] I don't know.
[Panting]
Oh, my God.
Helen...
Do you have a relative in West Virginia?
L-
- I don't think so.
- Well...
- Why?
...she died.
And, apparently, left you some money.
And that-- that man-- that man that called you by your name he-- he works for a company that locates missing heirs.
Did you hear that, Helen?
[Laughing]
That's all he does.
Did you hear me, Helen?
Did you hear me?
Did you hear what I said?
He just locates missing heirs.
[whimpering]
[Both sobbing] Oh, my God.
Is there any reason for this up there?
Is there any reason why I should have to start all over again?
Again?
- Call...
- What?
We have to tell someone.
Oh, you're not going to call the police?
No, no.
Linc.
Linc.
Linc.
He's rich.
He's important.
He's the only one who can help us now.
Put down that phone!
[Music playing]
Your son took away one love, and you're not going to take away Linc.
- We'll get rid of him, Helen.
- No.
- Together.
- No!
Just you and me.
No, Adelle.
We are going to get rid of him.
No!
Adelle!
You and me.
Together.
Both of us.
[Ominous music playing]
[Thunder rumbling]
[Sighs]
[Screaming]
Get him off of me!
Get him off!
[Gasps] Oh.
[whimpering]
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh.
[Muttering]
[Sobbing]
May I have the matches?
[Ominous music playing]
'Cause this letter about me...
One cannot be too careful can one?
[Sighs]
Adelle...
You and me we're going to be together again,
just like we were.
[Chuckles]
Just us together.
Friends.
Yeah.
Friends.
ALL: "A"...
"E"...
CHILDREN: "I"...
"O" "U."
But much more.
Now, "May"...
ALL: "Me"...
"My"
..."Mo."
STARR:
And now, from the diaphragm.
Hands on your diaphragms, young ladies.
"Tray, say."
CHILDREN: "Fee, fee..."
[Engine starting]
ALL: "Fi, Fi."
"Fo, fo."
"Foo, foo."
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
Uh, the bird of time once more is on the wing, chickabiddies.
Class dismissed.
[Children chattering]
HELEN:
"And forgive our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us."
"And deliver us from evil.
For thine--"
The police just left.
ADELLE:
Oh.
If anyone had looked up in this direction, my heart would have stopped.
[Sighs] I'm beat.
I'm gonna take a nap.
You okay, Helen?
"Repent and ye shall be saved."
"For there is no peace," saith the Lord,
"unto the wicked."
Yes--
Yes, I'm-
- I'm fine.
I'm fine, Adelle.
SISTER ALMA:
...very moment, turn away from your worldly ways, and seek the word of the Lord.
[Sighs]
Our dear Lord says,
"Go, and sin no more."
Let me tell you, brothers and sisters.
Let me tell you, a drink of whiskey... will never give you the kind of lift
I'm talking about.
Helen?
SISTER ALMA:
The lift I'm talking about, brothers and sisters, is confessing your mistakes to a merciful God.
"Joy shall be in Heaven over one sinner that repenteth."
I don't care what mistakes you've made.
Tell it all-- all to God.
God is never shocked.
No, sir!
God will understand all and forgive all.

[Man coughing]
And now, beloved brothers and sisters for the glorification of our dear Lord and a continuation of our blessed work here at the haven of the Open Hand we ask your offerings of love tonight.
Now, while the ushers pass among you we come to that special moment in our service when those of you who feel the need may step forward and be anointed by the oil of everlasting youth.
[Man coughing]
Now, if you will form your line in the aisle, to your right brothers and sisters and leave your gifts in the golden basket here before me.
[Organ playing]
God bless you, sister, God bless you.
Youth is yours forever.
God bless you, sister, youth is yours forever.
God bless you, brother.
Oh, what a glorious demonstration of faith.
I feel love all around me tonight.
God bless you, sister.
Youth is yours forever.
- God bless...
- I've come to you to confess.
Confession is a matter between you and the Supreme Being, sister.
No, I've come to confess because I need his forgiveness.
You have it.
God is all-merciful and all-forgiving.
No, I need his forgiveness before they find out that--
I told you, God forgives you.
Take my word for it.
No!
You told me to come to you on the radio.
You told me I would find joy in Heaven.
Well, if I have his forgiveness, why don't I feel that joy?
I offered you my blessing, but you refused it.
Now, move along.
No, no, I need to be saved.
No, I want to be saved.
I want to be-- Please, no, no!
No!
You leave me alone!
You don't want me forgiven!
You want me damned!
- [Slap] - [Groans] [whimpering]
You only did what had to be done, sister.
God has forgiven you.
There is no forgiveness for me.
God bless you, brother.
Youth is yours forever.
WOMAN:
Her classes are great.
[Children laughing]
[Children chattering]
Oh, please tell me, how is poor Mrs. Martin?
The doctor gave her a sedation to sleep.
She's been working much too hard.
Oh, yes, of course, indeed.
Sensitive type, the overstrung type.
People of her type, you know, throw themselves into everything.
And then that man that man dying in the trench outside.
What has that got to do with it?
To people of that type, any shock is highly injurious.
Do you remember her first reaction to me?
HELEN:
Adelle?
I-
- I have to go to the doctor, Helen.
- I have to go, let me go!
- You're not supposed to--
[Screams]
STARR:
It's only I, Mrs. Martin.
But if I can be of any help, in any way at all.
No, that-- that's all right.
Thank you.
ADELLE:
Helen, you must get back to bed.
- [Whimpering]
- Helen?
You're going back to bed.
[Women muttering]
Remember the way she behaved at the recital?
Very nervous for a long time.
I'm afraid there's something odd...
[Muttering]
[Door closing]
You've got to get back into bed.
L-
- I know.
[Groaning]
- You must get some sleep.
- I can't sleep!
Here, take your pill.
I can't sleep.
Have you prayed?
The damned don't pray, Adelle.
If you'd let me atone, I'd be all right.
The Lord welcomes sinners with open arms, but you-- you hit--
[Panting]
Linc and I are going out for a while.
You try and sleep.
L-
- I know why you did it, of course.
Just like I know why you're keeping me here.
You're afraid.
Adelle.
[Laughing] You're afraid of me.
That if I speak you will be damned, too.
[Helen laughing]
All I want you to do is to get well, as soon as possible.
And then I want you to go away, as far as possible.

Oh, you're so beautiful.
So white, so pure.
Oh.
[whimpering]
- Helen.
- [Gasps]
Oh!
It's only I.
I'm so sorry.
I always seem to frighten you, don't I?
Look, I saw this on my way home in a garden as I passed, and so I borrowed it for you.
- Ah!
- Oh, the thorn.
Always a thorn somewhere, isn't there?
[Dog barking]
[Chuckles]
Now, there.
[whimpering]
Now, you're so cold.
Would you like to go inside for a little?
Before I go back to that dreary hotel...
Back to that solitary room of mine.
[Dog barking]
[Ominous music playing]
Linc, I want to tell you something.
MAN:
Certainly came a cropper that time, Milly.
WOMAN:
Oh, shut up, George.
Marriage, there's nothing like it.
[Chuckles]
Is that what you wanted to tell me?
"There's nothing like marriage," hmm?
No, that wasn't--
You weren't suggesting something there, were you?
Huh?
No.
I-
- I had an entirely different subject--
Sometimes I wonder, you know, when a girl tells a guy on their first date that he needs to settle down, that's--
Oh, no, Linc.
L-
- I had absolutely no intention--
Honey, honey.
Now, wait a minute here.
You know, you don't have to try and fool me anymore.
- Well, I--
- You want to marry me?
Well, I'll tell you somethin',
I'm crazy about you, I want to marry you, too.
[Ball falling into hole]
Your shot.
Well, am I accepted, hmm?
I'm dead serious, I mean it.
[Laughing]
Well, I won't say no.
Hey, that's great, we'll drive down to Yuma tonight and tie the knot.
Tonight?
If anything's worth doing, it's worth doing right away.
Oh.

[Screaming]
Helen.
Now, Adelle,
I couldn't leave my poor little creatures, could I?
I mean, I love them.
The--
The vet wouldn't take them back, and no one else would.
You know--
You know, that's exactly what happened with, uh Lenny's father, I...
I..
I had to leave him, too.
After a while I--
I couldn't stand him,
I couldn't stand him to touch me.
If you love them you-- you can't just leave them.
You--
You have to release them.
Helen.
If you're trying to tell me that you killed your husband I just don't believe you.
ADELLE:
I--
I don't believe you.
Well, I did!
It's the truth.
I pushed him.
You know, like I pushed that...
Adelle, I always--
I always told you that I was the guilty one, remember?
[Gasps]
You-- you--.
You wouldn't let me speak, Adelle.
You wouldn't help me.
You-- you didn't want to hear the truth.
Helen...
- I think you should speak now.
- [Music playing]
You must.
Uh-huh.
I'm going to call Sister Alma and then I'm going to tell her to talk to you and to listen to you and to let you know that God has forgiven you.
Oh.
Oh, you'd do that?
- Yes.
- You would really do that?
Oh, thank you, Adelle.
Thank you.
I want to do everything that-- that you think best.
I really do.
[Music continues playing]
You see, Helen, everything will be all right.
Uh, Sister Alma will understand and help you.
And this time I'll let her.
Thank you, Adelle, you're so good to me.
[Chuckling]
I'm-- I'm ashamed of myself.
Yes, well, Helen Linc is going to help the boys and he's going to help you.
- Why?
Why should he?
- [Dialing telephone]
Because we're going to be married and you'll confess and have the blessed peace of repentance.
[Ominous music playing]
[Groans]
[Screaming]
Oh.
Oh, Adelle?

Adelle?
Adelle?

[Wind howling]
- [Grunting] - [Buzzing]
Mrs. Hill?
Yes, I am.
I'm, uh, Detective Sergeant West from Braddock.
Uh, may I come in, please?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Oh, is Mrs. Bruckner here?
Because this concerns her, too.
Uh, no.
I'm afraid she's out at the moment.
I see.
Well, Mrs. Hill, I wonder if you might mind looking at this photograph that I have here.
Certainly.
You-- you don't know him?
No.
- You've never seen him before?
- No.
Well, Mrs. Hill, they found his body just three days ago in that trench right across the street there.
Oh, yes, that dreadful accident.
He knew Ellie Banner.
He was her, uh...
her lover.
Oh, what an extraordinary coincidence.
Oh, I see.
I see, that's why you thought that...
I'm sorry, Sergeant, I can't help you.
Mrs. Hill, didn't you or Mrs. Bruckner ever receive any threatening telephone calls?
Why, no.
It's a thing they often do.
Who?
Well, the important thing is, you're out of danger now.
I am?
That's always nice to know.
Wait a minute, Sergeant.
You mean, Ms. Stuart...
I mean, Mrs. Bruckner and-- and myself, we were in danger from this man who loved Ellie Banner?
WEST:
Yes, from what he said to a couple of people, he was crazy with the idea of revenge.
Of course, he suffered greatly when she died.
Your boys were out of reach, of course, and so he fixed on their mothers.
Uh, he traced you out here.
Mrs. Hill?
Mrs. Hill?
[Helen sighs]
I think you've had a very lucky escape.
Yes.
It's all been quite a shock.
And, uh, I can't stand violence.
It's unforgivable.
You see, Sergeant, that's why when my boy...
Uh...
Do you mind if I tell Mrs. Bruckner about this?
Yes, that's perfectly all right.
Well, that's about it.
Uh, I'll just let myself out.
Yes.
Good-bye.
HELEN:
Uh, Sergeant?
Uh...
Uh, forgive me.
I--
I didn't even thank you... or ask you if you'd like a cup of coffee or something?
Oh, no, no, that's perfectly all right.
Thank you again, Ma'am, and, uh, good night.
Thank you.
[Door closing]
Adelle!
Adelle!
Adelle!
Adelle, darling!
It was him!
It was that man!
[Piano playing "Goody, Goody"]
[Buzzing]
- [Buzzing continues]
- Adelle?
[Piano playing continues]
Adelle?
Uh, now, just a minute, please.
Shh.
My partner is not quite finished with our recital yet.
[Laughing]
[Playing "Goody, Goody"]
[Piano playing ends]
The krauts came and made the old men dig up the potatoes.
The potatoes were buried in a hole behind the village.
The krauts poured petrol or something on them.
My nephew tasted the potatoes and became ill.
He didn't die of that.
It happened later in January.
Oh my god!
Then they returned to the village.
Quite a show started!
They tried to drag our cow off the yard - but mother was strong and fearless.
She grabbed a pitchfork and struck the village eldest, that creep.
Mother was taken in for questioning but she was soon let off.
She was hit with a baton.
She was all black with bruises when she got home.
They took all the foodstuffs.
They did it to get people out of the villages - and to kill off the partisans.
They didn't care much about what would happen to us.
I still have dreams about it.
I see my brother and my sister and my friend.
Some things to reminisce about.
Trial on the Road
Wearing glasses.
Eat on, crook.
Chess pieces and all.
Suffocating.
Officer... not too old.
Fox fur on the shoes.
They'd fit you.
Shut up!
End of the road, crook!
Ready!
What are you looking at, leery-eyes!
Fire!
Let 'em have it!
Oh shit!
That's our Rosa!
Where are you going, Rosa?
Are you living alone in an empty village?
I'll live until I drop dead.
- Is your husband on the front?
- He fled.
He's probably on the Volga by now.
Now it won't be any easier for him there.
Haven't you anyone else to talk with?
I don't need your pity.
A death patrol will come tomorrow with more pity.
Damn it!
I'll show you yet!
Why are you loafing around here!
You bring me food rations, petrol or flour!
You stop me from dying from hunger!
What are you looking at, poor devil?
Go to hell!
I never asked you to step inside my house.
Hands up!
Drop your rifle.
No tricks!
I'll let the air out of you!
It'll feel cold lying in the dirt.
Get up!
Take it!
Here you go!
Move it!
Hey listen, don't tell the command that you returned my rifle.
Did you hear me?
Keep chopping wood but don't get married.
They blew up the petrol.
The cows got scared and scattered in different directions.
You can't catch them.
- Who?
- The Avdejev brothers, Kulikov and Suhorutskov.
- It's a pity.
- Pity the cows for escaping.
Look at that, Mitka has caught a Fritz.
He gave himself up and gave his rifle.
A former junior sergeant of the Red Army.
Aleksandr Lazarev.
The poor kid didn't know enough to take everything.
You surrendered but hid a pistol just in case.
Get a move on!
They have machine guns.
Why did you bring him here?
You should have shot him in the forest.
The kid thinks he'll be decorated.
As soon as peace comes.
Maintain order!
Hello, comrade woman.
We'll meet again, God permitting.
Well, God's own, tell me your story.
But no lying.
It gives me headache.
Could I have some tobacco?
I lost my own.
No, you can't.
There's not enough for ourselves.
- So, who are you?
- I already told you, a junior sergeant.
Former.
So you went over to the German side?
That I did.
- Why were you in the forest?
- Looking for partisans.
I wanted to surrender.
- Did you do something disallowed on their side?
- I wanted to come here.
Look at that!
A defector with an ideology.
First there, then here.
You chose the wrong path.
A miscalculation.
I didn't choose.
The path found me.
Sweet Jesus that Asian can wail.
It breaks my heart.
Could someone continue on foot?
The gelding is all exhausted.
Just sit.
One more question.
How were you captured?
- It's a long story.
- No hurry.
Tell me.
We broke out of a siege in August.
We'd been walking for ten days.
We came to a village and entered it.
We were mad from hunger.
The Germans came while you were getting warm.
- You were drowsy.
- How did you know?
It happens, I've heard.
You have a right not to believe.
We have a right to judge you in the name of the people you betrayed.
I'm leaving you in the spring.
I'm an artillery man.
A rifle isn't enough for me.
Hey neighbour, got a cigarette?
No.
Nervous?
All right.
They promised to blast some holes into me too tomorrow.
What for?
I'm only eighteen.
I don't know anything about life.
What is it?
Give me vodka, you partisan louse!
I'm entitled to a last drink!
Come on, you sleaze!
Stop screaming or I'll beat you up so bad you won't recover for the morning!
Listen, my aunt made me do it.
She told me to enlist as a policeman to get food rations.
I was going to live quietly.
But we were sent to the neighbouring village.
There three komsomols told me to shoot.
I told them I can't do it.
But they said: "Shoot or stand against the wall yourself."
Should I have stood against the wall?
Did I let the krauts in?
Tomorrow I'll be shot.
I wish they had been forced!
I feel sick.
And you don't say a word.
Say something.
How were you caught?
I came by myself.
Moron!
You'll hang tomorrow.
Oh, why'd my aunt force me.
Aching, eh?
I saw some great felt boots on a Fritz today.
I couldn't shoot.
The felt boots looked great.
I was thinking, how will we get to the station.
It hurts my head.
Before the war I knew a doctor, a powerful woman.
She could get snake poison just like that.
I met her at the stadium.
The Basques were on.
What a game!
- What were they playing?
- Football.
Ever seen it?
Of course.
The kids played it at the village.
You're a poet.
They even write poems about football.
- It's a complicated game.
- An art form in itself.
Tell me, where was your wife - when you were watching football with the healer?
At home.
She doesn't like football.
She even made my son quit, even though he played well.
He'd be a champion by now.
I can't take those bastards prisoner.
It breaks my heart remembering.
I strike their teeth in.
I kill them even if they're already dead!
Calm down.
Anger is all right as long as you don't lose your head.
Life is hard and war is miserable.
Sleep, you're only dreaming.
Listen, who won back then?
We did.
Good.
What?
Hitler sat in the storage room and cried.
Vasjok!
What time is it?
Vasjok!
Punishment patrol!
Forward!
Quick!
Forward!
No procrastinating!
I'm not worried.
Fire!
Oh my god!
Mother, please let me go!
Don't do it!
All head for the swamp!
Everyone to the swamp!
At whose mercy did you leave us?
My beloved...
We might've gotten some more time to live.
Out!
Where to?
Move it, wretches!
Run!
Stop!
Don't leave there standing!
Butterfingers.
- Where's the other one?
- He's standing there.
Take him to the bush and finish him.
What's wrong?
Hold on.
I haven't examined the case yet.
- It's no use waiting.
He'll escape in the fog.
- No, he won't.
- Did he give his word of honour?
- Oh, please.
He came to stay.
What'd he do to you?
- He took my rifle but gave it back.
- What's that?
When I chanced upon him in the forest.
He could have killed me.
What about it?
He didn't give a shit about you!
- What a soldier, relinquishing his gun.
- Get out of my sight.
Don't let him out of your sight or I'll rip your head off!
- Brat.
- Let it be.
March!
Move it, you filthy bastard!
Citizen Senior Lieutenant, as I already told you, - if I had taken part in the shootings, I wouldn't have come.
Give me a rifle.
Citizen Senior Lieutenant, I want to fight.
Your fatherland already gave you a rifle, but you threw it away.
I wasn't the only one.
It's you we're talking about.
One more question.
Tell me, former Sergeant, - why didn't you leave Karnouha earlier?
What were you waiting for?
- Have you been there?
- I don't care.
Two left.
They were caught and beaten to death.
Oh please.
How dare you pressure me!
Enough of sentimentality.
Guards at the station towers, are they ours or Germans?
It varies.
Our guys are in and krauts at the command.
Is there a way to get to the train - besides through the command post?
I don't know.
I guess not.
- They bring in foodstuffs from the whole area.
- I know it.
Listen...
Could you get to the train?
- Yes I could.
- On what grounds?
They know my face.
Listen, how did you... escape Karnouha?
I got a weeks leave.
I took a train to Pskov and jumped off it.
What if you arrived at Karnouha tomorrow?
Could you do it without drawing too much attention?
- I'm not returning.
- Why not?
I won't live as a traitor.
I'd rather have you shoot me.
It was all right earlier, eh?
I broke down.
I wanted to live.
Can't a man start over once - after making a mistake the first time?
Lazarev...
Before the war I was a police chief near here.
In a district of seven villages.
Guess how many of these stories I've heard.
About people toiling to get a decent life.
Right?
Ptuha!
Have you been fed?
Ptuha, take the former Sergeant to the kitchen to get fed.
What is it?
I said I'd find myself a younger bather.
I was told to give him food.
- There isn't enough food for humans.
- Commander's orders.
And a drink to go with it!
Hello!
Don't stay there.
Viktor, give him a spoon.
Go.
If it had been me who found you in the forest...
Scoundrel!
What?
Viktor!
Too bad we didn't meet.
Viktor, don't.
It's no use.
Do you pity him?
Hang the bastard!
Stop it at once!
What's happening here?
It doesn't take courage to beat up a prisoner.
You shall report to Lokotkov and tell him everything.
Hitler is driving in a car through Berlin.
No one salutes him and he gets upset.
Suddenly he sees a soldier in the middle of a square.
He salutes and Hitler drives closer, happy.
" Who are you and where are you from?",
Hitler asks. " From the Eastern front."
"You'll be decorated for your attitude."
"I've got no attitude."
"I'm merely showing you how deep in shit we are in Russia."
You guys are all skin and bones.
Looking at you makes a man go for the bottle.
One more joke.
Hitler came to a madhouse.
where loonies live.
- Here.
- Stay on the door and let no one enter.
Friends and comrades!
Now you'll eat and sleep like in a rest-home.
You'll get potatoes, too
They're frozen, though.
You should at least look a bit like the krauts.
Krauts are nowadays roddy and voluptuous.
You'll eat and sleep for a few days.
There's tobacco.
Maybe you'll recover.
Go for it!
What about you?
They're not for me.
Only you'll eat them, and only here
Petka Sankov got killed for these sardines.
I didn't mean it that way...
Just so you understand.
Let's get married.
We'll ask Lokotkov to marry us.
We'll do that.
- I'm a womaniser, though.
- And you can't kiss!
- Shall I teach you?
- Please do.
Viktor!
Solomin!
- Are you here?
- Yeah!
- Lokotkov asks for you.
- I'll be right out.
- Now, he said.
- Get out!
- What is it?
- Nothing.
Keep sleeping.
Get up!
Get up!
Let's go.
- To where?
- To where we need to go.
- Where's that?
- To a New Year's party.
Should I take my greatcoat?
Yes.
You got scared, didn't you?
Why so scared?
Are you kidding?
Solomin!
- Where are you going?
- Taking Junior Sergeant Lazarev for a check-up.
- Who sent you?
- Lokotkov.
- You?
- Jerofeits too.
Go.
- Be careful with him!
- Sure.
- Where are you from?
- What?
- I asked you where you come from.
- Sverdlovsk.
That's where our interpreter is from.
- What did you do for a living?
- Drove a taxi.
- Go and ask for a ride.
- I know.
Move it.
Remember I'll shoot at once.
Don't try anything.
- I'll say, it's in vain.
- Let him show it in a real situation.
Mister officer, wait!
What is it, you fool?
Just a second!
I...
- Take it easy.
Let him handle it.
- In vain, all right!
Why didn't you shoot?
The kraut was closer to you.
Give me a hand.
Lift the leg.
Scared again?
- You're brave.
- Brave or not, I didn't get caught.
- The war won't stop tomorrow.
- Nor did it start yesterday.
Quiet!
Ready.
Works like a charm.
Quick!
Herbert, what are you doing?
Herbert!
Jerofeits, search the men!
Where did it hit you?
In the back?
Control.
Guardpoint inspection.
Short o.
- In Estonia all the krauts talk like this.
- Listen to her.
We haven't had a chance to learn, but she's been to a university.
Vasja, keep your mouth shut there.
You work the engine.
What an officer!
One can't make a kraut out of you.
- He has a decent pronunciation.
- But the gaze of a cow.
Sew in the stripes.
My stomach is full and I want to sleep.
When I see a fascist, the cow's gaze is gone.
- Who else is coming?
- None of your business.
I'm coming.
Are you so busy to get to hell?
Don't stretch the O.
It'll be all right.
- Did you grab the papers?
- I did.
- Lazarev, what is your first name?
- Aleksandr.
Forgive me.
- I did a foul thing.
- It's all right.
What?
Stop!
Viktor!
We seized a car that runs.
It's hidden in the snow in the forest.
- How was Lazarev?
- Good.
Didn't try to escape.
I see.
Go get yourself warm.
Did you know Solomin struck Lazarev last evening?
No, I didn't know.
- How'd Solomin die?
- We thought a kraut was dead.
But he came to himself and fired.
- Where were you?
- Searching the prisoners.
My back was turned and I didn't see it.
Otherwise I'd have knocked him.
- Where was Lazarev?
- In the car, looking for the papers.
- So you didn't see the German shoot?
- Who else?
Answer the question!
Did you see it or not?
I did not see it directly.
- Maybe someone else shot at Solomin?
- Who then if not a German?
Answer me!
Did you see the German shoot?
No I didn't, but...
How can you be sure if you didn't see it?
- Huh?
- How can you be certain of something you didn't see?
- I'm leaving.
- I didn't give you permission.
If you didn't see the German shoot, - can't we, in theory, assume it was someone else who shot?
Answer me!
Theoretically yes, only theoretically.
We can therefore assume Lazarev killed him.
I don't know...
Please, Comrade Major.
That's outrageous.
Stand up when you address your superior!
Your check-ups aren't worth on single penny!
I don't believe in them!
All kinds of opportunists - take advantage of wimps like you!
Don't you worry about it, Major!
Loves me, loves me not, believes me, believes me not.
Let the maidens guess their luck when the war is over!
As the section commander I'm in charge here - according to my Party-following conscience, excuse me!
You want to display goodness when lives are at stake!
I won't allow it!
That got principled.
The Major is very strict.
He's hero material, of course.
But what will come of it?
You found him in the forest, half-dead.
You showed him your favours but look at him!
Think of it back there on the bridge!
Understand it if you can.
He's no derelict, that Lazarev.
Give in to the Major anyway, to calm him down.
- Are we playing with game pieces here?
- That's right!
He'll tarnish your name for ever!
Stand up when you address your superior.
- What?
- Stand up!
Go to hell, I've had enough of you.
It's all in vain, let me say it.
- Why didn't you blow it up?
- There's thousands of people in there.
- Prisoners!
- Russian prisoners of war.
- Shut up.
An ammunitions train.
- There'll be more.
Do you think your wimpiness saves lives?
They're our own!
Some of them will return to our ranks.
My son was shot down.
He could have parachuted himself.
But he chose another path and hit a string of tanks!
Maybe he had no choice.
You'll hear from me!
I was supposed to blow up a bridge.
Hit it, Solomin!
January is approaching...
SOLOMIN
It happened in the morning, around ten o'clock.
They got me a check-up job.
Without the war we would never have met.
Yes, the war has turned everything upside down.
Before the war life was easy, no worries.
Am I boring you?
I drove a cab.
Tidy job.
Turn the wheel, collect the tips.
At home you'd sew clothes and have a drink on pay-day.
Everything as it should be.
Boom and war.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes I do.
I don't care about politics.
About the fascists, I only knew the song.
"No fear of the fascists, I'll slay them with my bayonet."
I thought I could take it.
I was wrong.
It wasn't until at the camp I understood.
Get it?
- Got tobacco?
- Yeah.
We had a tough spot with Ivan Jegorits today.
The Major wants your blood.
He kept saying you shot Solomin.
I wondered about it at the Major.
I told him you were a hero.
Ivan Jegoryts tried to calm him down as well.
Told him to listen to the old charger.
We saved you, don't worry.
Give me some tobacco.
- Where'd you get it from?
- Solomin.
- Brothers-in-arms already?
- Just having a smoke.
Arrest him!
Arrest him!
I'm giving the orders.
Can't you hear me?
Take him away.
Sorry, buddy.
Look at that, his ankles are busted.
Hard snow cuts like a knife.
Wanna put felt boots on a horse?
Why not?
The day after tomorrow they'll have to fly like a sparrow.
Just hope they don't drag us to the graveyard.
Chatterboxes!
Hello, Ivan Jegoryts.
Listen to this one.
Once Hitler was...
- Is Lokotkov here?
- I'm here.
Göring, Himmler and Mussolini from Italy were there.
They had assembled to divvy up Russia.
They ate and drank.
Ivan Jegoryts, Lazarev's gone to get hanged.
A noose around his neck.
Make way.
- How'd he...
- A German belt made of artificial leather failed.
Guys, I have to...
He needs something hot.
Kolja!
Where will I get it?
The reconnaissance has it ready.
Tell them it's my orders.
I heard him step from one corner to another.
Suddenly it got quiet.
I took a peek and...
Listen...
- Enough with the yammering!
- Get rid of your cigarettes!
Give me a hand.
Take it off.
Go away.
Have a drink!
Have a hot drink!
Stop staring!
Get out, fast!
Go!
All right, lad.
Tell me - where the vile enemy put its hope -
when it decided to crush our common Soviet fatherland - with its iron boot?
What did it base its hope in?
Tell me!
Or tell me - which uniform are you wearing -
and which am I wearing?
Today -
I bear the uniform of a Senior Lieutenant in the Red Army.
But in this day of war - you are a traitor of the fatherland.
Things being as they are, I'm not going to have a smoke with you.
I don't feel like it.
That's how it is, Sasa Lazarev.
That's how it is.
Rest now.
It will be a difficult day tomorrow.
You'll go to Karnouha.
A foodstuff-train will leave for Vaterland.
It must go to the other direction.
There will be four of you.
Dying is not allowed - nor is disappearing.
You must turn the train this way.
And make it so the others can witness it.
Clear?
Thank you.
Everything's OK.
You may proceed.
Let it through!
Go to the pumping station.
I'll jump on when it's underway.
Don't wait for me!
Hey you, in the tower!
Is it Kutenko?
- Lazarev!
- That's me.
- What've you been up to?
- I've been in Pskov.
The girls at Pskov aren't too shy.
Even the domes at the gentlemen's room start falling.
Climb up for a cigarette!
Don't press against the wood, my new skirt is tearing up...
I can't get anyone to take over for me.
I've been on duty since the night.
I can't even get a half-fur.
The platoon leader is withholding those.
- Were you there when he borrowed 20 Marks?
- Yes, I was.
He refuses to pay it back.
- Will you be my witness?
- Sure.
Hop on!
Happy New Year, your highness!
Your highness!
Corporal!
Partisans!
Come here!
Partisans!
What is it?
Blow the siren!
You crook!
Wait.
Ivan Yegorovich.
- At your orders.
- Lokotkov!
Don't you recognise me?
I'm Bolshekov.
Lieutenant then.
Can't say I do, Comrade Colonel.
You got us out of encirclement in '42!
In July!
I'm sorry, I got out quite a few.
Hello, Comrade Colonel!
Ivan Yegorovich, my darling man,
I kept remembering you all through the war.
Hold on!
How come you're still a Captain?
Lokotkov's a Captain, but our guns are shelling Berlin!
That suits me fine.
- To you, then!
- To victory.
Victory!
I'll write to the Marshal about you, how you got us out and how many you saved.
Comrade Colonel!
We're late as it is!
- Comrade Colonel!
- I'll write to the Marshal!
- Take it.
- I'm beat.
- Let me.
Hey guys, come on, let's give her a push!
Go on!
Give her some more!
Here she goes!
Go on, my dears!
There!
Some more!
Go on!
The krauts came and made the old men dig up the potatoes.
The potatoes were buried in a hole behind the village.
The krauts poured petrol or something on them.
My nephew tasted the potatoes and became ill.
He didn't die of that.
It happened later in January.
Oh my god!
Then they returned to the village.
Quite a show started!
They tried to drag our cow off the yard - but mother was strong and fearless.
She grabbed a pitchfork and struck the village eldest, that creep.
Mother was taken in for questioning but she was soon let off.
She was hit with a baton.
She was all black with bruises when she got home.
They took all the foodstuffs.
They did it to get people out of the villages - and to kill off the partisans.
They didn't care much about what would happen to us.
I still have dreams about it.
I see my brother and my sister and my friend.
Somer things to reminisce about.
Trial on the Road
Wearing glasses.
Eat on, crook.
Chess pieces and all.
Suffocating.
Officer... not too old.
Fox fur on the shoes.
They'd fit you.
Shut up!
End of the road, crook!
Ready!
What are you looking at, leery-eyes!
Fire!
Let 'em have it!
Oh shit!
That's our Rosa!
Where are you going, Rosa?
Are you living alone in an empty village?
I'll live until I drop dead.
Is your husband on the front?
- He fled.
He's probably on the Volga by now.
Now it won't be any easier for him there.
Haven't you anyone else to talk with?
I don't need your pity.
A death patrol will come tomorrow with more pity.
Damn it!
I'll show you yet!
Why are you loafing around here!
You bring me food rations, petrol or flour!
You stop me from dying from hunger!
What are you looking at, poor devil?
Go to hell!
I never asked you to step inside my house.
Hände hoch!
Drop your rifle.
No tricks!
I'll let the air off you!
It'l feel cold lying in the dirt.
Get up!
Take it!
Here you go!
Move it!
Hey listen, don't tell the command that you returned my rifle.
Did you hear me?
Keep chopping wood but don't get married.
They blew up the petrol.
The cows got scared and scattered in different directions.
You can't catch them.
Who?
- The Avdejev brothers, Kulikov and Suhorutskov.
It's a pity.
- Pity the cows for escaping.
Look at that, Mitka has caught a Fritz.
He gave himself up and gave his rifle.
A former junior sergeant of the Red Army.
Aleksandr Lazarev.
The poor kid didn't know enough to take everything.
You surrendered but hid a pistol just in case.
Get a move on!
They have machine guns.
Why did you bring him here?
You should have shot him in the forest.
The kid thinks he'll be decorated.
As soon as peace comes.
Order!
Hello, comrade woman.
We'll meet again, God permitting.
Well, God's own, tell me your story.
But no lying.
It gives me headache.
Could I have some tobacco?
I lost my own.
No, you can't.
There's not enough for ourselves.
So, who are you?
- I already told you, a junior sergeant.
Former.
So you went over to the German side?
That I did.
Why were you in the forest?
- Looking for partisans.
I wanted to surrender.
Did you do something disallowed on their side?
- I wanted to come here.
Look at that!
A defector with an ideology.
First there, then here.
You chose the wrong path.
A miscalculation.
I didn't choose.
The path found me.
Sweet Jesus that Asian can wail.
It breaks my heart.
Could someone continue on foot?
The gelding is all exhausted.
Just sit.
One more question.
How were you captured?
It's a long story.
- No hurry.
Tell me.
We broke out of a siege in August.
We'd been walking for ten days.
We came to a village and entered it.
We were mad from hunger.
The Germans came while you were getting warm.
You were drowsy.
- How did you know?
It happens, I've heard.
You have a right not to believe.
We have a right to judge you in the name of the people you betrayed.
I'm leaving you in the spring.
I'm an artillery man.
A rifle isn't enough for me.
Hey neighbour, got a cigarette?
No.
Nervous?
All right.
They promised to blast some holes into me too tomorrow.
What for?
I'm only eighteen.
I don't know anything about life.
What is it?
Give me vodka, you partisan louse!
I'm entitled to a last drink!
Come on, you sleaze!
Stop screaming or I'll beat you up so bad you won't recover for the morning!
Listen, my aunt made me do it.
She told me to enlist as a policeman to get food rations.
I was going to live quietly.
But we were sent to the neighbouring village.
There three komsomols told me to shoot.
I told them I can't do it.
But they said: "Shoot or stand against the wall yourself."
Should I have stood against the wall?
Did I let the krauts in?
Tomorrow I'll be shot.
I wish they had been forced!
I feel sick.
And you don't say a word.
Say something.
How were you caught?
I came by myself.
Moron!
You'll hang tomorrow.
Oh, why'd my aunt force me.
Aching, eh?
I saw some great felt boots on a Fritz today.
I couldn't shoot.
The felt boots looked great.
I was thinking, how will we get to the station.
It hurts my head.
Before the war I knew a doctor, a powerful woman.
She could get snake poison just like that.
I met her at the stadium.
The basques were on.
What a game!
What were they playing?
- Football.
Ever seen it?
Of course.
The kids played it at the village.
You're a poet.
They even write poems about football.
It's a complicated game.
- An artform in itself.
Tell me, where was your wife - when you were watching football with the healer?
At home.
She doesn't like football.
She even made my son quit, even though he played well.
He'd be a champion by now.
I can't take those bastards prisoner.
It breaks my heart remembering.
I strike their teeth in.
I kill them even if they're already dead!
Calm down.
Anger is all right as long as you don't lose your head.
Life is hard and war is miserable.
Sleep, you're only dreaming.
Listen, who won back then?
We did.
Good.
What?
Hitler sat in the storage room and cried.
Vasjok!
What time is it?
Vasjok!
Punishment patrol!
Forward!
Quick!
Forward!
No procrastinating!
I'm not worried.
Fire!
Oh my god!
Mother, please let me go!
Don't do it!
All head for the swamp!
Everyone to the swamp!
At whose mercy did you leave us?
My beloved...
We might've gotten some more time to live.
Out!
Where to?
Move it, wretches!
Run!
Stop!
Don't leave there standing!
Butterfingers.
Where's the other one?
- He's standing there.
Take him to the bush and finish him.
What's wrong?
Hold on.
I haven't examined the case yet.
It's no use waiting.
He'll escape in the fog.
- No, he won't.
Did he give his word of honour?
- Oh, please.
He came to stay.
What'd he do to you?
He took my rifle but gave it back.
- What's that?
When I chanced upon him in the forest.
He could have killed me.
What about it?
He didn't give a shit about you!
What a soldier, relinquishing his gun.
- Get out of my sight.
Don't let him out of your sight or I'll rip your head off!
Brat.
- Let it be.
March!
Move it, you filthy bastard!
Citizen Senior Lieutenant, as I already told you, - if I had taken part in the shootings, I wouldn't have come.
Give me a rifle.
Citizen Senior Lieutenant, I want to fight.
Your fatherland already gave you a rifle, but you threw it away.
I wasn't the only one.
It's you we're talking about.
One more question.
Tell me, former Sergeant, - why didn't you leave Karnouha earlier?
What were you waiting for?
Have you been there?
- I don't care.
Two left.
They were caught and beaten to death.
Oh please.
How dare you pressure me!
Enough of sentimetality.
Guards at the station towers, are they ours or Germans?
It varies.
Our guys are in and krauts at the command.
Is there a way to get to the train - besides through the command post?
I don't know.
I guess not.
They bring in foodstuffs from the whole area.
- I know it.
Listen...
Could you get to the train?
Yes I could.
- On what grounds?
They know my face.
Listen, how did you... escape Karnouha?
I got a weeks leave.
I took a train to Pskov and jumped off it.
What if you arrived at Karnouha tomorrow?
Could you do it without drawing too much attention?
I'm not returning.
- Why not?
I won't live as a traitor.
I'd rather have you shoot me.
It was all right earlier, eh?
I broke down.
I wanted to live.
Can't a man start over once - after making a mistake the first time?
Lazarev...
Before the war I was a police chief near here.
In a district of seven villages.
Guess how many of these stories I've heard.
About people toiling to get a decent life.
Right?
Ptuha!
Have you been fed?
Ptuha, take the former Sergeant to the kitchen to get fed.
What is it?
I said I'd find myself a younger bather.
I was told to give him food.
There isn't enough food for humans.
- Commander's orders.
And a drink to go with it!
Hello!
Don't stay there.
Viktor, give him a spoon.
Go.
If it had been me who found you in the forest...
Scoundrel!
What?
Viktor!
Too bad we didn't meet.
Viktor, don't.
It's no use.
Do you pity him?
Hang the bastard!
Stop it at once!
What's happening here?
It doesn't take courage to beat up a prisoner.
You shall report to Lokotkov and tell him everything.
Hitler is driving in a car through Berlin.
No one salutes him and he gets upset.
Suddenly he sees a soldier in the middle of a square.
He salutes and Hitler drives closer, happy.
" Who are you and where are you from?",
Hitler asks. " From the Eastern front."
"You'll be decorated for your attitude."
"I've got no attitude."
"I'm merely showing you how deep in shit we are in Russia."
You guys are all skin and bones.
Looking at you makes a man go for the bottle.
One more joke.
Hitler came to a madhouse.
where loonies live.
Here.
- Stay on the door and let no one enter.
Friends and comrades!
Now you'll eat and sleep like in a rest-home.
You'll get potatoes, too
They're frozen, though.
You should at least look a bit like the krauts.
Krauts are nowadays roddy and voluptuous.
You'll eat and sleep for a few days.
There's tobacco.
Maybe you'll recover.
Go for it!
What about you?
They're not for me.
Only you'll eat them, and only here
Petka Sankov got killed for these sardines.
I didn't mean it that way...
Just so you understand.
Let's get married.
We'll ask Lokotkov to marry us.
We'll do that.
I'm a womanizer, though.
- And you can't kiss!
Shall I teach you?
- Please do.
Viktor!
Solomin!
Are you here?
- Yeah!
Lokotkov asks for you.
- I'll be right out.
Now, he said.
- Get out!
What is it?
- Nothing.
Keep sleeping.
Get up!
Get up!
Let's go.
To where?
- To where we need to go.
Where's that?
- To a New Year's party.
Should I take my greatcoat?
Yes.
You got scared, didn't you?
Why so scared?
Are you kidding?
Solomin!
Where are you going?
- Taking Junior Sergeant Lazarev to a checkup.
Who sent you?
- Lokotkov.
You?
- Jerofeits too.
Go.
Be careful with him!
- Sure.
Where are you from?
- What?
I asked you where you come from.
- Sverdlovsk.
That's where our interpreter is from.
What did you do for a living?
- Drove a taxi.
Go and ask for a ride.
- I know.
Move it.
Remember I'll shoot at once.
Don't try anything.
I'll say, it's in vain.
- Let him show it in a real situation.
Mister officer, wait!
What is it, you fool?
Just a second!
I...
Take it easy.
Let him handle it.
- In vain, all right!
Why didn't you shoot?
The kraut was closer to you.
Give me a hand.
Lift the leg.
Scared again?
You're brave.
- Brave or not, I didn't get caught.
The war won't stop tomorrow.
- Nor did it start yeasterday.
Quiet!
Ready.
Works like a charm.
Quick!
Herbert, what are you doing?
Herbert!
Jerofeits, search the men!
Where did it hit you?
In the back?
Control.
Guardpoint inspection.
Short o.
In Estonia all the krauts talk like this.
- Listen to her.
We haven't had a chance to learn, but she's been to a university.
Vasja, keep your mouth shut there.
You work the engine.
What an officer!
One can't make a kraut out of you.
He has a decent pronunciation.
- But the gaze of a cow.
Sew in the stripes.
My stomach is full and I want to sleep.
When I see a fascist, the cow's gaze is gone.
Who else is coming?
- None of your business.
I'm coming.
Are you so busy to get to hell?
Don't stretch the O.
It'll be all right.
Did you grab the papers?
- I did.
Lazarev, what is your first name?
- Aleksandr.
Forgive me.
I did a foul thing.
- It's all right.
What?
Stop!
Viktor!
We seized a car that runs.
It's hidden in the snow in the forest.
How was Lazarev?
- Good.
Didn't try to escape.
I see.
Go get yourself warm.
Did you know Solomin struck Lazarev last evening?
No, I didn't know.
How'd Solomin die?
- We thought a kraut was dead.
But he came to himself and fired.
Where were you?
- Searching the prisoners.
My back was turned and I din't see it.
Otherwise I'd have knocked him.
Where was Lazarev?
- In the car, looking for the papers.
So you didn't see the German shoot?
- Who else?
Answer the question!
Did you see it or not?
I did not see it directly.
Maybe someone else shot at Solomin?
- Who then if not a German?
Answer me!
Did you see the German shoot?
No I didn't, but...
How can you be sure if you didn't see it?
Huh?
- How can you be certain of something you didn't see?
I'm leaving.
- I didn't give you permission.
If you didn't see the German shoot, - can't we, in theory, assume it was someone else who shot?
Answer me!
Yheoretically yes, only theoretically.
We can therefore assume Lazarev killed him.
I don't know...
Please, Comrade Major.
That's outrageous.
Stand up when you address your superior!
Your checkups aren't worth on single penny!
I don't believe in them!
All kinds of opportunists - take advantage of wimps like you!
Don't you worry about it, Major!
Loves me, loves me not, believes me, believes me not.
Let the maidens guess their luck when the war is over!
As the section commander I'm in charge here - according to my Party-following conscience, excuse me!
You want to display goodness when lives are at stake!
I won't allow it!
That got principled.
The Major is very strict.
He's hero material, of course.
But what will come of it?
You found him in the forest, half-dead.
You showed him your favours but look at him!
Think of it back there on the bridge!
Understand it if you can.
He's no derelict, that Lazarev.
Give in to the Major anyway, to calm him down.
Are we playing with game pieces here?
- That's right!
He'll tarnish your name for ever!
Stand up when you addrress your superior.
What?
- Stand up!
Go to hell, I've had enough of you.
It's all in vain, let me say it.
Why didn't you blow it up?
- There's thousands of people in there.
Prisoners!
- Russian prisoners of war.
Shut up.
An ammunitions train.
- There'll be more.
Do you think your wimpiness saves lives?
They're our own!
Some of them will return to our ranks.
My son was shot down.
He could have parachuted himself.
But he chose another path and hit a string of tanks!
Maybe he had no choice.
You'll hear from me!
I was supposed to blow up a bridge.
Hit it, Solomin!
January is approaching...
SOLOMIN
It happened in the morning, around ten o'clock.
They got me a checkup job.
Without the war we would never have met.
Yes, the war has turned everything upside down.
Before the war life was easy, no worries.
Am I boring you?
I drove a cab.
Tidy job.
Turn the wheel, collect the tips.
At home you'd sew clothes and have a drink on payday.
Everything as it should be.
Boom and war.
Do you understand me?
- Yes I do.
I don't care about politics.
About the fascists, I only knew the song.
"No fear of the fascists, I'll slay them with my bayonet."
I thought I could take it.
I was wrong.
It wasn't until at the camp I undestood.
Get it?
Got tobacco?
- Yeah.
We had a tough spot with Ivan Jegorits today.
The Major wants your blood.
He kept saying you shot Solomin.
I wondered about it at the Major.
I tol him you were a hero.
Ivan Jegoryts tried to calm him down as well.
Told him to listen to the old charger.
We saved you, don't worry.
Give me some tobacco.
Where'd you get it from?
- Solomin.
Brothers-in-arms already?
- Just having a smoke.
Arrest him!
Arrest him!
I'm giving the orders.
Can't you hear me?
Take him away.
Sorry, buddy.
Look at that, his ankles are busted.
Hard snow cuts like a knife.
Wanna put felt boots on a horse?
Why not?
The day after tomorrow they'll have to fly like a sparrow.
Just hope they don't drag us to the graveyard.
Chatterboxes!
Hello, Ivan Jegoryts.
Listen to this one.
Once Hitler was...
Is Lokotkov here?
- I'm here.
Göring, Himmler and Mussolini from Italy were there.
They had assembled to divvy up Russia.
Tey ate and drank.
Ivan Jegoryts, Lazarev's gone to get hanged.
A noose around his neck.
Make way.
How'd he...
- A German belt made of artificial leather failed.
Guys, I have to...
He needs something hot.
Kolja!
Where will I get it?
The reconnaissance has it ready.
Tell them it's my orders.
I heard him step from one corner to another.
Suddenly it got quiet.
I took a peek and...
Listen...
Enough with the yammering!
- Get rid of your cigarettes!
Give me a hand.
Take it off.
Go away.
Have a drink!
Have a hot drink!
Stop staring!
Get out, fast!
Go!
All right, lad.
Tell me - where the vile enemy put its hope -
when it decided to crush our common Soviet fatherland - with its iron boot?
What did it base its hope in?
Tell me!
Or tell me - which uniform are you wearing -
and which am I wearing?
Today -
I bear the uniform of a Senior Lieutenant in the Red Army.
But in this day of war - you are a traitor of the fatherland.
Things being as they are, I'm not going to have a smoke with you.
I don't feel like it.
That's how it is, Sasa Lazarev.
That's how it is.
Rest now.
It will be a difficult day tomorrow.
You'll go to Karnouha.
A foodstuff-train will leave for Vaterland.
It must go to the other direction.
There will be four of you.
Dying is not allowed - nor is disappearing.
You must turn the train this way.
And make it so the others can witness it.
Clear?
Thank you.
Everything's OK.
You may proceed.
Let it through!
Go to the pumping station.
I'll jump on when it's underway.
Don't wait for me!
Hey you, in the tower!
Is it Kutenko?
Lazarev!
- That's me.
What've you been up to?
- I've been in Pskov.
The girls at Pskov aren't too shy.
Even the domes at the gentlemen's room start falling.
Climb up for a cigarette!
Don't press against the wood, my new skirt is tearing up...
I can't get anyone to take over for me.
I've been on duty since the night.
I can't even get a half-fur.
The platoon leader is wthholding those.
Were you there when he borrowed 20 Marks?
- Yes, I was.
He refuses to pay it back.
Will you be my witness?
- Sure.
Hop on!
Happy New Year, your highness!
Your highness!
Corporal!
Partisans!
Come here!
Partisans!
What is it?
Blow the siren!
You crook!
Wait.
Ivan Yegorovich.
- At your orders.
- Lokotkov!
Don't you recognize me?
I'm Bolshekov.
Lieutenant then.
Can't say I do, Comrade Colonel.
You got us out of encirclement in '42!
In July!
I'm sorry, I got out quite a few.
Hello, Comrade Colonel!
Ivan Yegorovich, my darling man,
I kept remembering you all through the war.
Hold on!
How come you're still a Captain?
Lokotkov's a Captain, but our guns are shelling Berlin!
That suits me fine.
- To you, then!
- To victory.
Victory!
I'll write to the Marshal about you, how you got us out and how many you saved.
Comrade Colonel!
We're late as it is!
- Comrade Colonel!
- I'll write to the Marshal!
- Take it.
- I'm beat.
- Let me.
Hey guys, come on, let's give her a push!
Go on!
Give her some more!
Here she goes!
Go on, my dears!
There!
Some more!
Go on!
The krauts came and made the old men dig up the potatoes.
The potatoes were buried in a hole behind the village.
The krauts poured petrol or something on them.
My nephew tasted the potatoes and became ill.
He didn't die of that.
It happened later in January.
Oh my god!
Then they returned to the village.
Quite a show started!
They tried to drag our cow off the yard - but mother was strong and fearless.
She grabbed a pitchfork and struck the village eldest, that creep.
Mother was taken in for questioning but she was soon let off.
She was hit with a baton.
She was all black with bruises when she got home.
They took all the foodstuffs.
They did it to get people out of the villages - and to kill off the partisans.
They didn't care much about what would happen to us.
I still have dreams about it.
I see my brother and my sister and my friend.
Somer things to reminisce about.
Wearing glasses.
Eat on, crook.
Chess pieces and all.
Suffocating.
Officer... not too old.
Fox fur on the shoes.
They'd fit you.
Shut up!
End of the road, crook!
Ready!
What are you looking at, leery-eyes!
Fire!
Let 'em have it!
Oh shit!
That's our Rosa!
Where are you going, Rosa?
Are you living alone in an empty village?
I'll live until I drop dead.
Is your husband on the front?
- He fled.
He's probably on the Volga by now.
Now it won't be any easier for him there.
Haven't you anyone else to talk with?
I don't need your pity.
A death patrol will come tomorrow with more pity.
Damn it!
I'll show you yet!
Why are you loafing around here!
You bring me food rations, petrol or flour!
You stop me from dying from hunger!
What are you looking at, poor devil?
Go to hell!
I never asked you to step inside my house.
H?
nde hoch!
Drop your rifle.
No tricks!
I'll let the air off you!
It'l feel cold lying in the dirt.
Get up!
Take it!
Here you go!
Move it!
Hey listen, don't tell the command that you returned my rifle.
Did you hear me?
Keep chopping wood but don't get married.
They blew up the petrol.
The cows got scared and scattered in different directions.
You can't catch them.
Who?
- The Avdejev brothers, Kulikov ja Suhorut?
kov.
It's a pity.
- Pity the cows for escaping.
Look at that, Mitka has caught a Fritz.
He gave himself up and gave his rifle.
A former junior sergeant of the Red Army.
Aleksandr Lazarev.
The poor kid didn't know enough to take everything.
You surrendered but hid a pistol just in case.
Get a move on!
They have machine guns.
Why did you bring him here?
You should have shot him in the forest.
The kid thinks he'll be decorated.
As soon as peace comes.
Order!
Hello, comrade woman.
We'll meet again, God permitting.
Well, God's own, tell me your story.
But no lying.
It gives me headache.
Could I have some tobacco?
I lost my own.
No, you can't.
There's not enough for ourselves.
So, who are you?
- I already told you, a junior sergeant.
Former.
So you went over to the German side?
That I did.
Why were you in the forest?
- Looking for partisans.
I wanted to surrender.
Did you do something disallowed on their side?
- I wanted to come here.
Look at that!
A defector with an ideology.
First there, then here.
You chose the wrong path.
A miscalculation.
I didn't choose.
The path found me.
Sweet Jesus that Asian can wail.
It breaks my heart.
Could someone continue on foot?
The gelding is all exhausted.
Just sit.
One more question.
How were you captured?
It's a long story.
- No hurry.
Tell me.
Pitk?
tarina.
- Ei hoputeta.
Kerro.
We broke out of a siege in August.
We'd been walking for ten days.
We came to a village and entered it.
We were mad from hunger.
The Germans came while you were getting warm.
You were drowsy.
- How did you know?
It happens, I've heard.
You have a right not to believe.
We have a right to judge you in the name of the people you betrayed.
I'm leaving you in the spring.
I'm an artillery man.
A rifle isn't enough for me.
Hey neighbour, got a cigarette?
No.
Nervous?
All right.
They promised to blast some holes into me too tomorrow.
What for?
I'm only eighteen.
I don't know anything about life.
What is it?
Give me vodka, you partisan louse!
I'm entitled to a last drink!
Come on, you sleaze!
Stop screaming or I'll beat you up so bad you won't recover for the morning!
Listen, my aunt made me do it.
She told me to enlist as a policeman to get food rations.
I was going to live quietly.
But we were sent to the neighbouring village.
There three komsomols told me to shoot.
I told them I can't do it.
But they said: "Shoot or stand against the wall yourself."
Should I have stood against the wall?
Did I let the krauts in?
Tomorrow I'll be shot.
I wish they had been forced!
I feel sick.
And you don't say a word.
Say something.
How were you caught?
I came by myself.
Moron!
You'll hang tomorrow.
Oh, why'd my aunt force me.
Aching, eh?
I saw some great felt boots on a Fritz today.
I couldn't shoot.
The felt boots looked great.
I was thinking, how will we get to the station.
It hurts my head.
Before the war I knew a doctor, a powerful woman.
She could get snake poison just like that.
I met her at the stadium.
The basques were on.
What a game!
What were they playing?
- Football.
Ever seen it?
Of course.
The kids played it at the village.
You're a poet.
They even write poems about football.
It's a complicated game.
- An artform in itself.
Tell me, where was your wife - when you were watching football with the healer?
At home.
She doesn't like football.
She even made my son quit, even though he played well.
He'd be a champion by now.
I can't take those bastards prisoner.
It breaks my heart remembering.
I strike their teeth in.
I kill them even if they're already dead!
Calm down.
Anger is all right as long as you don't lose your head.
Life is hard and war is miserable.
Sleep, you're only dreaming.
Listen, who won back then?
We did.
Good.
What?
Hitler sat in the storage room and cried.
Vasjok!
What time is it?
Vasjok!
Punishment patrol!
Forward!
Quick!
Forward!
No procrastinating!
I'm not worried.
Fire!
Oh my god!
Mother, please let me go!
Don't do it!
All head for the swamp!
Everyone to the swamp!
At whose mercy did you leave us?
My beloved...
We might've gotten some more time to live.
Out!
Where to?
Move it, wretches!
Run!
Stop!
Don't leave there standing!
Butterfingers.
Where's the other one?
- He's standing there.
Take him to the bush and finish him.
What's wrong?
Hold on.
I haven't examined the case yet.
It's no use waiting.
He'll escape in the fog.
- No, he won't.
Did he give his word of honour?
- Oh, please.
He came to stay.
What'd he do to you?
He took my rifle but gave it back.
- What's that?
When I chanced upon him in the forest.
He could have killed me.
What about it?
He didn't give a shit about you!
What a soldier, relinquishing his gun.
- Get out of my sight.
Don't let him out of your sight or I'll rip your head off!
Brat.
- Let it be.
March!
Move it, you filthy bastard!
Citizen Senior Lieutenant, as I already told you, - if I had taken part in the shootings, I wouldn't have come.
Give me a rifle.
Citizen Senior Lieutenant, I want to fight.
Your fatherland already gave you a rifle, but you threw it away.
I wasn't the only one.
It's you we're talking about.
One more question.
Tell me, former Sergeant, - why didn't you leave Karnouha earlier?
What were you waiting for?
Have you been there?
- I don't care.
Two left.
They were caught and beaten to death.
Oh please.
How dare you pressure me!
Enough of sentimetality.
Guards at the station towers, are they ours or Germans?
It varies.
Our guys are in and krauts at the command.
Is there a way to get to the train - besides through the command post?
I don't know.
I guess not.
They bring in foodstuffs from the whole area.
- I know it.
Listen...
Could you get to the train?
Yes I could.
- On what grounds?
They know my face.
Listen, how did you... escape Karnouha?
I got a weeks leave.
I took a train to Pskov and jumped off it.
What if you arrived at Karnouha tomorrow?
Could you do it without drawing too much attention?
I'm not returning.
- Why not?
I won't live as a traitor.
I'd rather have you shoot me.
It was all right earlier, eh?
I broke down.
I wanted to live.
Can't a man start over once - after making a mistake the first time?
Lazarev...
Before the war I was a police chief near here.
In a district of seven villages.
Guess how many of these stories I've heard.
About people toiling to get a decent life.
Right?
Ptuha!
Have you been fed?
Ptuha, take the former Sergeant to the kitchen to get fed.
What is it?
I said I'd find myself a younger bather.
I was told to give him food.
There isn't enough food for humans.
- Commander's orders.
And a drink to go with it!
Hello!
Don't stay there.
Viktor, give him a spoon.
Go.
If it had been me who found you in the forest...
Scoundrel!
What?
Viktor!
Too bad we didn't meet.
Viktor, don't.
It's no use.
Do you pity him?
Hang the bastard!
Stop it at once!
What's happening here?
It doesn't take courage to beat up a prisoner.
You shall report to Lokotkov and tell him everything.
Hitler is driving in a car through Berlin.
No one salutes him and he gets upset.
Suddenly he sees a soldier in the middle of a square.
He salutes and Hitler drives closer, happy.
" Who are you and where are you from?", Hitler asks. " From the Eastern front."
"You'll be decorated for your attitude."
"I've got no attitude."
"I'm merely showing you how deep in shit we are in Russia."
You guys are all skin and bones.
Looking at you makes a man go for the bottle.
One more joke.
Hitler came to a madhouse.
where loonies live.
Here.
- Stay on the door and let no one enter.
Friends and comrades!
Now you'll eat and sleep like in a rest-home.
You'll get potatoes, too
They're frozen, though.
You should at least look a bit like the krauts.
Krauts are nowadays roddy and voluptuous.
You'll eat and sleep for a few days.
There's tobacco.
Maybe you'll recover.
Go for it!
What about you?
They're not for me.
Only you'll eat them, and only here
Petka Sankov got killed for these sardines.
I didn't mean it that way...
Just so you understand.
Let's get married.
We'll ask Lokotkov to marry us.
We'll do that.
I'm a womanizer, though.
- And you can't kiss!
Shall I teach you?
- Please do.
Viktor!
Solomin!
Are you here?
- Yeah!
Lokotkov asks for you.
- I'll be right out.
Now, he said.
- Get out!
What is it?
- Nothing.
Keep sleeping.
Get up!
Get up!
Let's go.
To where?
- To where we need to go.
Where's that?
- To a New Year's party.
Should I take my greatcoat?
Yes.
You got scared, didn't you?
Why so scared?
Are you kidding?
Solomin!
Where are you going?
- Taking Junior Sergeant Lazarev to a checkup.
Who sent you?
- Lokotkov.
You?
- Jerofeit?
too.
Go.
Be careful with him!
- Sure.
Where are you from?
- What?
I asked you where you come from.
- Sverdlovsk.
That's where our interpreter is from.
What did you do for a living?
- Drove a taxi.
Go and ask for a ride.
- I know.
Move it.
Remember I'll shoot at once.
Don't try anything.
I'll say, it's in vain.
- Let him show it in a real situation.
Mister officer, wait!
What is it, you fool?
Just a second!
I...
Take it easy.
Let him handle it.
- In vain, all right!
Why didn't you shoot?
The kraut was closer to you.
Give me a hand.
Lift the leg.
Scared again?
You're brave.
- Brave or not, I didn't get caught.
The war won't stop tomorrow.
- Nor did it start yeasterday.
Quiet!
Ready.
Works like a charm.
Quick!
Herbert, what are you doing?
Herbert!
Jerofeit?
, search the men!
Where did it hit you?
In the back?
Control.
Guardpoint inspection.
Short o.
In Estonia all the krauts talk like this.
- Listen to her.
We haven't had a chance to learn, but she's been to a university.
Vasja, keep you r mouth shut there.
You work the engine.
What an officer!
One can't make a kraut out of you.
He has a decent pronunciation.
- But the gaze of a cow.
Sew in the stripes.
My stomach is full and I want to sleep.
When I see a fascist, the cow's gaze is gone.
Who else is coming?
- None of your business.
I'm coming.
Are you so busy to get to hell?
Don't stretch the O.
It'll be all right.
Did you grab the papers?
- I did.
Lazarev, what is your first name?
- Aleksandr.
Forgive me.
I did a foul thing.
- It's all right.
What?
Stop!
Viktor!
We seized a car that runs.
It's hidden in the snow in the forest.
How was Lazarev?
- Good.
Didn't try to escape.
I see.
Go get yourself warm.
Did you know Solomin struck Lazarev last evening?
No, I didn't know.
How'd Solomin die?
- We thought a kraut was dead.
But he came to himself and fired.
Where were you?
- Searching the prisoners.
My back was turned and I din't see it.
Otherwise I'd have knocked him.
Where was Lazarev?
- In the car, looking for the papers.
So you didn't see the German shoot?
- Who else?
Answer the question!
Did you see it or not?
I did not see it directly.
Maybe someone else shot at Solomin?
- Who then if not a German?
Answer me!
Did you see the German shoot?
No I didn't, but...
How can you be sure if you didn't see it?
Huh?
- How can you be certain of something you didn't see?
I'm leaving.
- I didn't give you permission.
If you didn't see the German shoot, - can't we, in theory, assume it was someone else who shot?
Answer me!
Yheoretically yes, only theoretically.
We can therefore assume Lazarev killed him.
I don't know...
Please, Comrade Major.
That's outrageous.
Stand up when you address your superior!
Your checkups aren't worth on single penny!
I don't believe in them!
All kinds of opportunists - take advantage of wimps like you!
Don't you worry about it, Major!
Loves me, loves me not, believes me, believes me not.
Let the maidens guess their luck when the war is over!
As the section commander I'm in charge here - according to my Party-following conscience, excuse me!
You want to display goodness when lives are at stake!
I won't allow it!
That got principled.
The Major is very strict.
He's hero material, of course.
But what will come of it?
You found him in the forest, half-dead.
You showed him your favours but look at him!
Think of it back there on the bridge!
Understand it if you can.
He's no derelict, that Lazarev.
Give in to the Major anyway, to calm him down.
Are we playing with game pieces here?
- That's right!
He'll tarnish your name for ever!
Stand up when you addrress your superior.
What?
- Stand up!
Go to hell, I've had enough of you.
It's all in vain, let me say it.
Why didn't you blow it up?
- There's thousands of people in there.
Miksette r?
j?
ytt?
neet?
- Siell?
on tuhansia ihmisi?
.
Prisoners!
- Russian prisoners of war.
Shut up.
An ammunitions train.
- There'll be more.
Do you think your wimpiness saves lives?
They're our own!
Some of them will return to our ranks.
My son was shot down.
He could have parachuted himself.
But he chose another path and hit a string of tanks!
Maybe he had no choice.
You'll hear from me!
I was supposed to blow up a bridge.
Hit it, Solomin!
January is approaching...
SOLOMIN
It happened in the morning, around ten o'clock.
They got me a checkup job.
Without the war we would never have met.
Yes, the war has turned everything upside down.
Before the war life was easy, no worries.
Am I boring you?
I drove a cab.
Tidy job.
Turn the wheel, collect the tips.
At home you'd sew clothes and have a drink on payday.
Everything as it should be.
Boom and war.
Do you understand me?
- Yes I do.
I don't care about politics.
About the fascists, I only knew the song.
"No fear of the fascists, I'll slay them with my bayonet." "Ei fasisteista pelkoa, pistimeen ne seiv?
st?
n."
I thought I could take it.
I was wrong.
It wasn't until at the camp I undestood.
Get it?
Got tobacco?
- Yeah.
We had a tough spot with Ivan Jegorit?
today.
The Major wants your blood.
He kept saying you shot Solomin.
I wondered about it at the Major.
I tol him you were a hero.
Ivan Jegoryt?

Give me some tobacco.
Where'd you get it from?
- Solomin.
Brothers-in-arms already?
- Just having a smoke.
Arrest him!
Arrest him!
I'm giving the orders.
Can't you hear me?
Take him away.
Sorry, buddy.
Look at that, his ankles are busted.
Hard snow cuts like a knife.
Wanna put felt boots on a horse?
Why not?
The day after tomorrow they'll have to fly like a sparrow.
Ylihuomenna niiden pit?
lent?
kuin varpuset.
Just hope they don't drag us to the graveyard.
Chatterboxes!
Hello, Ivan Jegoryt?
.
Listen to this one.
Once Hitler was...
Is Lokotkov here?
- I'm here.
G?
ring, Himmler and Mussolini from Italy were there.
They had assembled to divvy up Russia.
Tey ate and drank.
Ivan Jegoryt?
, Lazarev's gone to get hanged.
A noose around his neck.
Make way.
How'd he...
- A German belt made of artificial leather failed.
Guys, I have to...
He needs something hot.
Kolja!
Where will I get it?
The reconnaissance has it ready.
Tell them it's my orders.
I heard him step from one corner to another.
Suddenly it got quiet.
I took a peek and...
Listen...
Enough with the yammering!
- Get rid of your cigarettes!
Give me a hand.
Take it off.
Go away.
Have a drink!
Have a hot drink!
Stop staring!
Get out, fast!
Go!
All right, lad.
Tell me - where the vile enemy put its hope -
when it decided to crush our common Soviet fatherland - with its iron boot?
What did it base its hope in?
Tell me!
Or tell me - which uniform are you wearing -
and which am I wearing?
Today -
I bear the uniform of a Senior Lieutenant in the Red Army.
But in this day of war - you are a traitor of the fatherland.
Things being as they are, I'm not going to have a smoke with you.
I don't feel like it.
That's how it is, Sa?
a Lazarev.
That's how it is.
Rest now.
It will be a difficult day tomorrow.
You'll go to Karnouha.
A foodstuff-train will leave for Vaterland.
It must go to the other direction.
There will be four of you.
Dying is not allowed - nor is disappearing.
You must turn the train this way.
And make it so the others can witness it.
Clear?
Thank you.
Everything's OK.
You may proceed.
Let it through!
Go to the pumping station.
I'll jump on when it's underway.
Don't wait for me!
Hey you, in the tower!
Is it Kutenko?
Lazarev!
- That's me.
What've you been up to?
- I've been in Pskov.
The girls at Pskov aren't too shy.
Even the domes at the gentlemen's room start falling.
Climb up for a cigarette!
Don't press against the wood, my new skirt is tearing up...
I can't get anyone to take over for me.
I've been on duty since the night.
I can't even get a half-fur.
The platoon leader is wthholding those.
Were you there when he borrowed 20 Marks?
- Yes, I was.
He refuses to pay it back.
Will you be my witness?
- Sure.
Hop on!
Happy New Year, your highness!
Your highness!
Corporal!
Partisans!
Come here!
Partisans!
What is it?
Blow the siren!
You crook!
Wait.
Ivan Yegorovich.
- At your orders.
- Lokotkov!
Don't you recognize me?
I'm Bolshekov.
Lieutenant then.
Can't say I do, Comrade Colonel.
You got us out of encirclement in '42!
In July!
I'm sorry, I got out quite a few.
Hello, Comrade Colonel!
Ivan Yegorovich, my darling man,
I kept remembering you all through the war.
Hold on!
How come you're still a Captain?
Lokotkov's a Captain, but our guns are shelling Berlin!
That suits me fine.
- To you, then!
- To victory.
Victory!
I'll write to the Marshal about you, how you got us out and how many you saved.
Comrade Colonel!
We're late as it is!
- Comrade Colonel!
- I'll write to the Marshal!
- Take it.
- I'm beat.
- Let me.
Hey guys, come on, let's give her a push!
Go on!
Give her some more!
Here she goes!
Go on, my dears!
There!
Some more!
Go on!
NIGHT OVER CHINA
Written and directed by Alexandr Medvedkin
Narrated by Yuri Kolychev
The movie uses footage from USSR Central Film Archive, State Film Foundation and foreign sources.
Central Documentary Studio.
Moscow, 1971
To the east of the land of Russia lies the country of Zhongguo.
This is what the Chinese nations have always called themselves.
5000 years ago, the ancient culture of this country had already contributed greatly to the development of human civilization.
For centuries, the hearts of Russian people respected their neighbor.
The friendship between our nations is sealed with blood.
Thousands of Chinese volunteers perished fighting for the Soviet revolution in 1919.
Thousands of Soviet soldiers died fighting to free China from the Japanese occupation in 1945.
A neighbor is always a neighbor.
Not matter, how many times the morning sun rises over the world our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren will always seek friendship with the people of China.
Then why is there so much unease today when we talk about China?
Our movie will try to answer this question.
This movie will attempt to defend the Chinese people from their worst enemy, the Maoists.
This is real footage.
Beijing, 1969.
You are watching the so-called 9th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.
Listen to what Mao's successor and assistant Lin Biao has to say:
"Chinese Communist Party is fighting to crush modern revisionism that has its core in the clique of Soviet revisionists."
This formula worked its way into new regulations.
It worries me to hear my country and my Party being slandered.
What do our two great nations have to argue about?
What dark forces are building a Great Wall of enmity and alienation between us?
There's no end to the good will expressed by our motherland, and we want to restore our good friendship.
Take a look at our newspapers.
You will not find evil insults to China.
We only encourage a feeling of respect and good disposition towards the Chinese people.
This is what the future demands of us.
Now, here are Beijing newspapers.
They are full of profanity, scorn and libel aimed at our Party and the Soviet government.
"Curse the black Soviet revisionists!" Renmin Ribao writes.
"Starve and get ready for the great war with social imperialists!" echoes Guangmin Ribao.
And yet, the good will of the Soviet government is immeasurable.
In 1965, the head of the ministry of USSR, Nikolai Kosygin, visited Beijing.
The talk was about being good neighbors.
Meanwhile, however, Beijing was secretly preparing the Cultural Revolution and being good neighbors could interfere with what would become a political coup.
The Maoists did everything to alienate our two great nations.
They raged at the Soviet Embassy gates.
They insulted the Soviet people.
They damaged our cars.
They shed the blood of Soviet frontier guards.
It seemed, the last sparks of warmth and friendship had disappeared.
But in 1969, on his way from Hanoi to Moscow Alexey Kosygin visited Beijing again.
Once again, the Soviet government attempted to normalize relations.
What is there to fight over?
Only due to the peace-loving efforts of the Soviet people did negotiations in Beijing began again.
Here we have curious documentary footage shot at different times in China.
Even now, over 80% of the population are peasants.
For centuries, the Chinese countryside has been miserably poor and backward.
People could not own their land.
In the past, their lot was drudgery on the landowners' property.
Hunger and merciless oppression by the rich was ended by the revolution.
I have never seen anything more moving than this footage.
This is a trial of landowners by liberated Chinese farmers.
How bitter must be the farmers' grievances to make them scream their lungs out after a lifetime of silence.
These old men never dreamed of owning a horse or owning the land that feeds them.
Their own land.
Now, no force can snatch it away from the hands of victorious people.
The communists gave the land to impoverished farmers.
The communists brought 700 million people to the socialist reconstruction of their country.
The first five-year plan awakened the enormous creative potential of the Chinese people.
During those years, the Chinese Communist Party trained thousands of gifted organizers as well as workers, engineers and scientists.
Who could foresee that only a few years later many would become the victims of repression and schemes that disrupted the second five-year plan.
Today, it is still hard to tell the whole truth about Mao Zedong and his supporters.
But you cannot alter history.
Moscow is very far from Beijing.
But the tragedy of the Chinese people still resonates with my motherland.
Sooner or later, a direct and uncompromising depiction of Maoism will appear on the screen.
Sooner or later, we must unearth real footage that testifies to the criminal nature of Maoism.
And we will do that now.
Beijing, 1956.
The 8th Congress of the CCP is opening today.
You can see guests from friendly socialist countries.
These are not 'black revisionists'.
Communists all over the world rejoiced at the victories of their Chinese brothers.
The 8th Congress gathered during the successful fulfillment of the first five-year plan.
The delegates represented 10 million communists united by the integrity of Lenin's ideas.
Devotion to Lenin.
Unity in fighting imperialism.
How could this audience foresee that comrade Mao, who is seen opening the congress, will later deal cruelly with most of these people and shatter the Party by mobilizing 30 million Red Guards.
In those days, Mao Zedong kept his plans for a political coup a secret.
"Our Party", he proclaimed from this pedestal, "is a politically mature and great Marxist and Leninist Party."
"Now our Party is united and strong as never before."
These words expressed the opinion of all delegates of the 8th Congress.
"Our country and all socialist counties want peace", said Mao Zedong.
That, too, resonated with the feelings of the communists.
How could they know that ten years later, having shattered the Party,
Mao would throw a different slogan at his people:
"Get ready to starve!
Get ready for the war with Soviet revisionists!"
But this is later.
Right now, at the 8th Congress, Mao Zedong speaks with emotion:
"We have to be able to learn from the leading Soviet Union."
"We have to avoid great-power arrogance at all costs."
"At all costs, we have to avoid putting on airs."
Why would he insist on what he himself never believed in?
He had no other choice.
Try arguing at this Congress, held under Lenin's banner of unity of communists from all countries.
Now it's time to remind the Beijing schismatics about the international solidarity of Marxist-Leninists.
Let us leave this congress hall for a while and return to footage of China's first five-year plan.
You are witnessing the reconstruction of Anshan metallurgical factory.
Soviet specialists practically rebuilt it from scratch.
It is equipped with Soviet technology.
Here, Moscow engineers worked side by side with Chinese friends, as well as managers from Ukraine and Ural mountains.
Now we are watching the metallurgical factory in Wuhan, one of the largest in Asia.
This is the first steel fusion.
Soviet construction workers share their enthusiasm with Chinese comrades.
The oldest Russian metallurgist, Alexandr Padurov, led a team of 250 Soviet engineers and technicians.
Back then, they were not called 'social-imperialists'.
How could they know the dark day would come when Mao would shoot the steel from this factory at the heads of Soviet frontier guards.
Shanxi cement plant was planned and built by specialists from the DDR.
How could they foresee that soon Mao would stretch a friendly hand over their heads to the worst enemies of German people-- West German revanchists.
The Maoists would approve the non-recognition of the border over the river Oder.
Guests from Poland did not expect this betrayal, either.
Trying to help their Chinese friends, they built them a large sugar factory, and taught young specialists to work there.
These are Czech power engineers.
They were dispatched by Golden Prague.
They are repairing a turbine at the Changshou power station.
If only they knew that on the 'black day' the voices of Beijing traitors would actually encourage counter-revolution.
The victorious pace of China's first five-year plan created many complex problems and unexpected difficulties.
The selfless help from socialist countries was a living example of our unsurpassed unity.
With the help of Muscovites, Changchun automobile factory is being built.
Where would the many thousands of auto engineers come from?
They are trained in Moscow.
In the morning, you can see them among hospitable workers at Likhachev's factory.
During the day, they are in the workshops.
Their class brothers teach them.
We can see them in the construction department.
Together with their Moscow friends, they work out complex technological issues of the future factory.
Changchun's auto brand is a sister of Likhachev's factory brand.
But you cannot alter history.
Here is a teacher and his student.
I think, they would not believe that soon, the student will be forced to manufacture tanks that will threaten his own teacher.
We taught them in peace and friendship.
Changchun factory won't be launched for a while.
But China needs automobiles now.
You can see a caravan of ships transporting trucks along the Yangtse river.
This is also a contribution of the Soviet people for the socialist reconstruction of China.
All of their priceless experience, all of the achievements and benefits of socialism, my motherland and my Party offered to our Chinese brothers.
We had no other choice.
This is what Lenin taught us.
Avid Chinese were enchanted by the Soviet way of life.
They came to us to study.
In the Soviet Union, they saw a university for a new socialist world.
Indeed, Chinese farmers have much to learn here.
The best farmers shared their experiences.
Farmers from faraway Jiangsu province were astounded at the amazing scope of collective farming, and its high culture.
What a long way to go for their motherland to achieve such heights!
In today's China, archaic poverty still exists.
Poverty will impede the progress of Chinese farmers for years to come.
That's why they are eyeing thirstily the achievements of our agronomists.
They are smitten by the mighty technology that brings unsurpassed plenty.
Among the guests, there was a Chinese tractor driver.
She was so nervous, laying her first track in the friendly soil of Ukraine.
This is Tibet.
The footage is from a documentary about the first tractor driver in the most backwards province of China.
Same as we had here in 1930's.
When our guests from Jiangsu realized how far the Communist Party of Soviet Union had brought its people they could get see their own future.
Let's go back to Jiangsu.
The Chinese communists were taking them along the same path until Mao Zedong sabotaged their progress with his Great Leap Forward.
Step by step, the province was overcoming its grinding poverty.
It was moving forward not in great leaps, but with the basics.
The simple plow, the village blacksmith...
What could get in the way of their economic development?
Mao Zedong's adventurism.
The destruction of the Communist Party by the Maoists.
A political coup that brought the miseries of military dictatorship upon the Chinese people.
Cynically deceiving the people under the pretext of "Cultural Revolution".
Here I want to reflect on how it could happen.
To answer this question, let's get back to the 8th Congress of the CCP.
Nothing foretold the imminent tragedy.
Mao insisted: "Now our Party is united and strong as ever."
Liu Shaoqi, deputy chairman of the Central Committee, reported on the success of the first five-year plan.
"Overcoming extreme backwardness of a poor economy, step by step, the Party enforced the practice of socialism."
With great difficulty, the Chinese people have begun to build a socialist society.
Who among the delegates at the 8th Congress did not want to move faster?
It is time to remember that in this same speech
Liu Shaoqi, speaking on behalf of the delegates, warned the supporters of experimentation of the dangers of economic adventurism and thoughtless haste.
Why did Mao Zedong applaud those words?
Was he not ready for the Great Leap Forward?
We will tell you about that Leap now.
The logic behind this invention is amazing.
It was perfectly anticipated by the strategy of "The Great Sparrow War" in Beijing.
One day, the entire population of the capital was called up to gather at the streets to perform a strange mission.
"Liquidate every sparrow in Beijing."
Beijing strategists elaborated:
"We have a million sparrows."
"Each sparrow eats a grain of rice -- that's one million grains."
"One hundred grains per sparrow a day -- that's one hundred million."
"One year has 365 days...
The sparrows will eat us alive!"
"What will the people eat?"
"Destroy the sparrows!"
At the signal, all Beijing's sparrows were driven into the air.
People chased them to death.
Sparrows were not allowed to land until they fell on the ground, dead from exhaustion.
The entire population of Beijing was mobilized for this bizarre battle.
Military troops were assembled too.
An old ironic phrase "Using cannons to hunt sparrows" was morbidly realized.
The battle is over.
The last little bird is killed.
Dozens of trucks carry piles of bird bodies out of Beijing.
What an incredible mechanistic logic:
Extinguish a million birds -- save millions of tons of grain.
Feed the country.
We would not mention this tragi-comic event unless the planning of the Great Leap Forward did not utilize the same mechanistic logic.
One Beijing strategist pondered:
China has 200 million farmyards.
If every farmyard starts smelting steel in two years our steel production will surpass USA, Soviet Union and West Germany.
This is not a joke.
They just forgot about the overwhelming poverty of the Chinese provinces.
A mechanistic, sparrow-like logic informed the basis of the Great Leap Forward.
At the beckoning of an omnipotent hand, all the decisions of the 8th Congress were overturned.
New numbers from Chairman Mao shocked the whole world.
In two years, China will produce not 8 million, but 100 million tons of steel.
There will be a 6.5 times increase in industrial production.
and a 2.5 times increase in harvests.
This is unique footage.
This is homegrown metallurgy.
Since antiquity, technologically backwards China practiced this kind of steelmaking.
It more or less satisfied pre-industrial demands for metal.
In old times, village blacksmiths smelted low-quality pig iron.
Chairman Mao ordered countrywide mobilization.
Every village was converted into a smelting factory.
Every farmyard built a furnace.
80 million farmers were torn away from the land and transferred to metallurgy.
They had no time to plant and grow rice, and two harvests were skipped.
80 million peasant metallurgists.
Day and night they smelted pig iron.
They wasted millions of tons of ore.
They burned millions of tons of coal.
They made mountains of useless junk.
They wrecked the country's economy.
This was The Great Fraud perpetrated upon the people.
When you look at these inspired faces you can't help but ask:
"How could they know that eclipsing America in steel production within a mere two years was the delirious dream of a fanatic."
It was a popular deception on a massive scale.
People simplemindedly trusted the slogans of a demagogue.
Extinguish all sparrows, smelt mountains of steel, or triple rice harvests in two years...
Triple the harvest!
An order from above can only abolish destitution on paper.
A paper that will print anything.
Every farmer was forcibly recruited to 'people's communes'.
The communes were maintained by strict military regime.
Line up!
Right!
Left!
Turn around!
In the field, they line up for morning prayer.
The god, Chairman Mao, promised them:
"After 3 years of persistent labor -- 10 thousand years of happiness."
He obviously never read Lenin.
It is as if Lenin saw the Great Leap Forward with his own eyes.
Log ago, at the 10th Congress of Workers' Communist Party Bureau, he warned:
"If some communist fantasized about changing economic foundations of private farming in three years, he certainly was a dreamer."
The beautiful fantasy of the Great Leap Forward has evaporated.
It brought the people chaos and destruction.
The country suffered unprecedented famine.
With the famine, sickness and death visited millions of peasant families.
It is as if the ghosts of a malignant past returned to the villages.
"Poverty is good." This is how Chairman Mao comforted them.
"It's scary to think what might happen if everybody became a rich man."
These were his words: "Scary to think."
But the anguished farmers were fed up with famine.
The inventor of the Great Leap Forward received the disapproval of the Party.
He had to resign from his position as the country's leader.
But he wasted no time.
This footage is no less amazing than that of the Sparrow War.
You can see Chairman Mao swimming in the Yangtze.
Why does he need this romantic water circus?
He is appealing to the youth of China.
Now, he needs millions of ecstatic young people.
Now, he has even more dizzying 'leaps' in mind.
This man will do anything for power.
Power over the people.
Power over the country.
In his youth, he swung from anarchism to monarchism, until he joined communists.
In the caves of Yan'an, he fostered plans for absolute dictatorship.
He waited and maneuvered for years, gathering his followers.
He destroyed the Party's best people.
Today, this cunning politician has a good reason to go swimming.
Soon, he will give the malevolent order:
"Fire on the headquarters."
The Maoists incited 30 million immature youths against the Chinese Communist Party.
It was a political coup.
They called it "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution".
But this was not a 'cultural' revolution.
The blind force of misguided youth was thrown into a political game with only one goal:
to steal the authority from the CCP, to remove the party from the political arena, and clear the way for Mao's dictatorship.
Here is "China" magazine.
It is published in Russian in Beijing.
"To crush the bourgeois headquarters."
Where is this headquarters?
The article is afraid to name it directly because it implies the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
The rhetoric beats around the bush, explaining that bourgeois headquarters consists of a bunch of powerful Party heads who chose the capitalist way of development.
They are the target of this great cultural revolution.
Their complete eradication is the main goal of this revolution.
Observe how this goal is achieved.
Red Guards handcuff members of the Central Committee.
This is the Secretary of the Central Committee, Luo Ruiqing.
Politburo member Peng Zhen.
Vice-mayor of Beijing Fang Jin.
Minister of higher education Jiang Nanxiang.
Secretary of Beijing City Party Committee Wan Li.
Politburo candidate Lu Dingyi.
Deputy minister of culture Xia Yan.
Dramatist Tian Han.
Professor of Beijing University Peng Peiyun.
Millions of communists were subject to repression.
These were the organizers of socialist reconstruction, scientists, engineers, writers.
Millions of the nation's best people.
Nobody counted how many.
China was shut off from the outside world.
Through the curtain of lies and disinformation we received only shreds of truth.
We want to find out exactly what happened in China.
Who are these bizarre revolutionaries?
What did they know about the real intentions of Chairman Mao?
We need to understand how they were caught up in this amazing religious madness, this blind readiness to crush the Party and the government, to disturb daily peace.
They are not revolutionaries.
They had no understanding of the treacherous plans of the Maoists.
Their overwhelming religious hysteria was provoked artificially.
Otherwise, the Cultural Revolution would not be possible.
Millions of naive boys and girls were subjected to merciless indoctrination.
The Chinese people were helpless to protest this madness of the youths who fell victim to cynical Maoism.
Chinese have an ancient toy, called 'dummy'.
It embodies humiliating thoughtlessness and pathetic callousness.
You don't need to think.
Your brightest sun is doing your thinking for you.
Do everything he says.
Understand?
Execute.
Don't understand?
Execute anyway.
You'll understand later.
It's incredible how any living human thought is blocked out.
This little red book is a famous compilation of quotations.
It was published in 29 languages, 3.5 billion copies.
Five books per person, including babies.
This book is mandatory for all occasions.
Let's take a look.
Here is a typical phrase from Chairman Mao.
"Movement for normalization of style is a total movement for Marxist upbringing."
Take another one:
"There's no fixing without bending."
There's nothing special about these quotations.
The problem is, the whole population is bound to look for answers to all life's questions in a collection of pointless abstractions.
They are struggling to understand.
And so they read.
Farmers read in the fields while worrying about the harvest.
Doctors read before a complex operation.
Seamen read during their morning prayer to the Great Chairman.
Children read instead of having fun.
Soldiers read before they advance and when they rest.
While traveling, while resting, with the family...
Everywhere, only this red book can give one the right to live.
Behind its deliberate obscurity there is an inhuman prerogative:
"Don't try to think."
Trust blindly and pray to the Chairman Mao, like to a god.
Never disobey.
A watchful minder will tear your head off.
The hysterical system of Mao Zedong's personality cult, and all this religious ecstasy around his name serve the most mundane purpose:
to eliminate every chance for a simple man to figure out what's going on.
Is this why millions of Red Guards are discouraged from reading any other books?
The Chairman explained:
"The more books you read, the more stupid you get."
Was this a slip of a tongue?
No, it's no slip.
In support of this idea, he said on another occasion:
"You won't become an emperor after reading many books."
This "Marxist"'s cherished dream is to become an all-powerful emperor.
He once proclaimed: "I was charmed by the successes of China's emperors, namely, Yao Yishun, Qin Shi Huangdi, Lu Ban, after reading many books about them."
Indeed, there were times when everything in China was simple.
Cut off one head -- thousands tremble with fear.
Torture one Chinese to death, break another one's ribs -- thousands will drop on their knees.
This was real power, real order.
Emperor Qin Shi Huangdi ordered all books to be burned and scientists thrown into cellars.
Why did he do that?
Ancient Chinese official Shang Yang explained:
"When people are illiterate they are easier to govern."
"Easier to govern."
Isn't this why the Maoists pushed Red Guards to struggle against culture and education?
Universities were closed.
Students burned books and manuscripts.
Schoolchildren scorned their classes.
Teachers were made to wear dunce caps.
Professors were executed.
Ancient scrolls were burned.
Books were thrown in the fire.
Maoist slogans were pasted over masterpieces.
Painting of ancient masters were thrown out from their frames.
Priceless sculptures were defaced.
Monuments and statues were knocked down.
Crushing everything not connected with the name of Mao, these boys and girls were naive like children.
Single-handedly, they destroyed a host of masterpieces the world's finest museums would covet.
Children were converted into weapons of the dictatorship.
Soon, there was nothing was left to crush.
The country swept by the hurricane of destruction required a respite.
30 million feverishly excited boys and girls had finished their job and now were obsolete.
Let's go back to the beginning of their crusade.
It seems, just yesterday they hurried along these roads in response to Chairman Mao's call.
If only they had known that soon, some of them would end their lives in suicide and others would perish far away from home.
Children of the working class, they were ready for any sacrifice in the name of the revolution.
How inhuman, and how cynical, to send these exalted youths to crush the Party and destroy the people's government,
to squeeze them like lemons and then discard the whole battered generation.
Chairman Mao forgot them very quickly.
Only the army could remain at the foundation of his dictatorship.
Indoctrinating the army had always been the Maoists' prerogative.
At the 9th Congress of the CCP, Lin Biao proclaimed:
"Cultural Revolution would not be possible without the army, and Mao Zedong's ideas would not be possible to propagate."
It was true from the very beginning.
Behind the Red Guards' backs, at the factories and in the countryside, there were generals and officers.
Army divisions intervened when angry masses resisted revolutionary committees and chased away Red Guards.
The tidal wave of militarism washed over the country.
The Chairman's order was:
"Get ready to starve and fight the great war."
Beijing newspapers revealed who the new enemy was.
"Get ready to fight with Soviet revisionists."
Military psychosis.
To the horror of residents, trenches appeared in Beijing.
Young people were taught to shoot and prepared for war.
It's sad to see military psychosis engulfing even children.
Hatred for the Soviet people became the new defining core of the Maoism.
Now, Maoism cannot exist without frenzied anti-Sovietism.
Maoism today is the betrayal of the international communist movement.
When you see the tragic footage from the Vietnam war you can't help but ask:
Does anti-communism of Beijing's sectarians not encourage the impudence of American military?
Beijing is oddly tolerant to military aggression right on China's border.
But how intolerant they have become of the other communist movements in the world.
Remember the incident in Czech Republic.
Beijing newspapers were more reactionary than capitalist media and defended counter-revolution.
In the grave crisis in Poland, Beijing papers shamelessly encouraged reactionaries to crush the power of the people.
Beijing leaders -- who are they with?
What political coalition are they in and whose interests are they fighting for?
Such a tragic paradox.
The founder of Maoism has not renounced Lenin's teaching yet.
By lying to Chinese people he is trying to camouflage the anti-Leninist essence of his military dictatorship.
He would use any means to dismember and crush the coalition of socialist countries that maintain their struggle with imperialism.
Propagandists in Beijing might use this strange slogan:
"Under the banner of Marxism, hand in hand with imperialism, against the communism."
This frightening situation seems unreal.
Let's go back to the 9th Congress of the CCP.
Weren't they professing Marxism on their way to the congress?
And was not smashing international communism proposed as the first priority?
Fallen victim to a political coup, the Chinese Communist Party would never comply with such a betrayal.
By usurping its proud name, a different party did it.
Mao Zedong's party.
These Red Guards were not elected to attend the congress.
They were assigned after careful selection and repeated purges.
They will vote enthusiastically for anything, as many times as needed, as long as their brightest sun orders them to do so.
But we will honor the memory of the delegates of a different congress.
Thirteen years ago, different people represented the Party.
Where are they?
Of 173 elected members of the Central Committee only 48 would appear at the 9th Congress.
How many communists were killed?
How many were driven to suicide?
What could we expect from the 9th Congress?
A different party has gathered.
It just made Mao Zedong its lifetime leader.
Lin Biao was assigned to be his successor.
The Beijing Marxists have just restored the rule of dynastic succession from imperial China.
Here he is, the strange successor to the throne.
Less than three years later, Lin Biao will be declared Chairman's enemy and eliminated.
This is the nature of Mao Zedong's party.
Still calling it a communist party, Mao and his successor secured their dynastic positions at the 9th Congress.
The Politburo's new members include Mao's wife, Jiang Qing,
Lin Biao's wife, Ye Qun,
Mao's son-in-law, Yao Wenyuan,
Mao's former secretary, Chen Boda, and his bodyguard, Wang Dongxing.
What a bunch!
That's what kind of party this is.
Even Red Guards might balk at such a vote.
But the voting was handled by Chairman Mao himself.
Who protests?
Try to revolt.
Who protests?
The dark night over China, like any night, will come to an end.
The day will come.
The red sun of truth will rise over China.
No Maoists will be able to replace it.

The odds against finding that particular innocent man are a little frightening.
But you will try?
Uh, please don't expect a miracle.
Joe, we're always expecting miracles.
That's our bag.
Yeah.
You proved that on a golf course.
Albert Murphy, killed in a traffic accident a couple of nights ago.
That's him.
(PAPERS RUSTLING)
Well, two arrests for drunk driving.
According to the coroner's report, he was loaded that night.
What did he do for a living?
He ran a pizza parlor the last six years.
Before that?
Before that, he was a desk clerk.
Where?
Well, a desk clerk is a desk clerk.
What difference does it make?
Art, uh, does it say?
The Vallejo Towers.
The Vallejo Towers.
Vallejo Towers.
Art, wasn't there a murder or something there about five, six years ago?
Yeah.
Uh, Mrs. C.W. Taggart was strangled by her boyfriend.
Yeah.
And for a couple of weeks, the columnists had a ball with the secret life of C.W. Taggart, the billionaire who couldn't buy everything.
What has that got to do with Al Murphy?
He was working the desk at the Vallejo Towers.
There could've been some connection.
I was there when they interrogated the murderer-- a man named Kilgore.
He was a junior executive in the Taggart Enterprises.
Did Homicide question Al Murphy at the time?
Wouldn't have made any difference.
Kilgore gave us a full confession.
What happened to him?
He pleaded guilty in return for a reduced sentence.
Drew ten to life.
Where's he doing his time?
(Art) Soledad.
Al Murphy?
(Mannix) He was a witness at your trial.
He was working the desk at the Vallejo Towers the day you were arrested.
Yeah, I remember him.
Is it possible that what he said on the witness stand helped convict you?
Are you kidding?
I killed Alice Taggart.
I confessed to the police and pleaded guilty.
Al Murphy didn't send me up.
I made it on my own.
Before he died, he confessed that he had helped send an innocent man to prison.
Some other guy, Mannix.
If Lyle Grandt hadn't handled my case,
I would've been doing death-row time.
As it is, I'm eligible for parole in a couple of years, so let it be, okay?
When I'm sure it is okay.
What's that?
A transcript of your trial.
Why bring all that up again?
Maybe some of these words will sound different to you after six years.
Enough to remember something.
Now, let's, uh, start with the confession you signed at the Wilshire station after your arrest.
(Kilgore) Mrs. Taggart-- Alyce.. called me at the office at 2:00 this afternoon.
You getting all this?
She sounded strange, nervous.
She told me she was at the suite at the Vallejo Towers, and she wanted me to come over right away.
What's this all about, Alyce?
About goodbye, Ted.
Why?
You bore me.
You can't end it just like that.
I have ended it.
It's over.
"I'd never seen Alyce like that.
I didn't know what to think.
"I was desperate.
All I knew was I was losing her.
I couldn't let her go."
Alyce, can't we talk it over?
I don't know what's happened, but--
Stop begging, Ted.
It's not becoming.
Well, maybe this is.
It's going to take more than a couple of ice cubes to put me off.
Don't touch me.
You've been watching too many late movies on television.
(GRUNTING)
(SCREAMS)
(SCREAMS)
(SQUEALS)
(SCREAMING)
(GRUNTS)
(GASPS)
(Mannix) "That's the last I remember
"until I realized my hands were around her throat.
I knew she was dead."
It says here you then went to the phone, told the desk to call the police 'cause you'd murdered a woman.
Yeah.
And the man on the desk was Al Murphy?
I guess so.
If you thought Murphy knew something that might clear you, you still wouldn't care to change your confession?
What could Murphy know?
I told it the way it happened.
Let it be, Mannix.
(Mannix) For a while, I thought we might have a small miracle going for us, Sister, but Kilgore insists he's guilty.
Joe, maybe that's the miracle we should be looking for.
What miracle's that?
The convicted man who clings steadfastly to his own guilt.
Well, as you say, in the world behind bars, all prisoners protest their innocence.
Well, doesn't Kilgore's attitude strike you as significant?
I'm afraid I find it's a dead end, Father.
Mr. Mannix, perhaps we could talk to the attorney that defended Mr. Kilgore.
But, uh, what could we hope to accomplish, Sister?
Al Murphy's testimony didn't send Kilgore to prison.
Oh, but Mr. Murphy clearly thought otherwise to the very depths of his soul.
All right.
Uh...
I'll arrange a meeting with Kilgore's attorney, Lyle Grandt.
As a matter of fact, Sister, I remember Mr. Murphy very well.
Then his testimony at the Kilgore trial was a decisive factor?
No.
I'm sorry.
What convinced you that Kilgore was guilty, Mr. Grandt?
Well, my client himself.
He made a full confession to the police and refused to retract a word of it.
I took all the delays I could reasonably ask of the court, hoping he'd change his mind, but he didn't.
Believe me, it was a battle all the way.
Even to convince him that he had to make an initial plea of innocent so that we could see the prosecution's case.
Are you saying that you had doubts about Mr. Kilgore's confession?
No, Sister.
I believed it.
But an attorney has a special obligation to a client.
Not to turn the guilty loose on society, but to be certain that the person standing trial has every opportunity to present mitigating circumstances.
In other words, you were hoping that during the prosecution's presentation, something would make Kilgore want to fight for his life?
Yes, I was.
However, that wasn't to be.
(CHUCKLES)
Poor Kilgore.
Imagine his temptation.
Not only was Alyce Taggart a devastatingly beautiful woman, she was the wife of the world's wealthiest enigma--
C.W. Taggart, man or myth?
Kilgore's love affair was... a secret within a mystery.
The danger alone... exciting.
(SIGH)
I'm really sorry, Sister.
That's all right.
I..
I think I understand.
Well, it comes down to this.
Kilgore went into his trial wanting the gas chamber.
At least I was able to talk him out of that.
Well, I guess that about covers it.
You agree, Sister?
Yes, I suppose so.
Thank you for your time, Mr. Grandt.
Not at all.
Yes.
You've been most considerate.
My pleasure.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Ed Noble, please.
This is Lyle Grandt.
(INTERCOM BUZZES)
Noble.
Ed, a private detective named Mannix just left my office.
He's taking an interest in the Kilgore case.
Naturally, Ed.
It's my job to be convincing.
I just thought that you should know in case you thought something should be done.
Hi, Peggy.
How was the meeting with Kilgore's attorney?
Well, I hate to see a man lose his shot at salvation, Peggy, but I'm afraid Al Murphy's going to have to make it without my help.
I wouldn't bet on that.
You know that pizza parlor of his?
Yeah.
What about it?
It's a franchise operation.
I wired the home office.
Here's their answer.
Al Murphy paid $15,000 for that business, in cash.
Hmm.
And just two days after Kilgore was sentenced.
Mr. Murphy didn't make that kind of money working the desk at the Vallejo Towers.
Nice work, Peggy.
Oh, uh, see if you can get Sister Meg on the phone.
You're gonna tell her about it?
Not exactly.
I just want her to know that we may have stubbed our toe on a small miracle.
What do you got?
My friend at the credit bureau dug up Al Murphy's file out of the dead accounts section.
Very bad rating.
Well, that sure keeps our miracle alive, doesn't it?
The question is, where'd he get the money to buy that franchise?
(DOOR OPENS)
Mr. Mannix?
Yes.
Come in, Miss--
Linholm.
Adrianne Linholm.
How do you do?
Would you like some coffee, Miss Linholm?
No, thank you.
Please, sit down.
Now, uh, what can I do for you, Miss Linholm?
Save me a great deal of money.
At least my board of directors are convinced you're the man to do it.
Board of directors?
Royal Palms Sugar.
We have a director's meeting here on the mainland twice a year.
Our plant's in Hawaii.
I see.
Now, uh, about this money you mentioned.
We're losing over $100,000 a year.
A product that never reaches the market.
After it's refined, it vanishes.
Well, don't you have plant security forces, private police?
They're not very efficient, or professional, obviously.
Mm-hmm.
That's why I'm here.
To offer you a $5,000 retainer, Mr. Mannix, against 15,000 if you can stop these thieves.
That's very generous.
We're very worried.
And I suppose you want me on the job yesterday?
Well, naturally.
This thing has to be stopped as quickly as possible.
We'll fly to the islands in my private jet tomorrow morning.
(SIGH)
I'm afraid that's out of the question, Miss Linholm.
Why?
Well, I'm committed to another client right now.
What would it take to get you uncommitted?
I'm sorry.
Really sorry.
My personal check for $5,000.
It's yours if you can make some arrangement for this other case.
Don't take too long, Mr. Mannix.
You know how perishable paper can be.
Hmm.
I do, indeed.
At least $100 an ounce.
(DOOR OPENS)
(DOOR CLOSES) What was that all about, Joe?
I strongly suspect, Peggy, it has something to do with keeping Al Murphy out of heaven.
I know my coming here like this can't make any sense to you, Sister.
Mrs. Kilgore, I really don't understand you.
I would think you'd go to all lengths to secure your husband's vindication and freedom.
If that were possible, Sister, yes.
But, you see, I've..
I've lived with that hope for a long time.
Dreamed that something might happen to reverse Ted's conviction.
But if your husband is innocent--
But he isn't, Sister.
That's the point.
He did kill that woman.
If I can say it, and I can believe it, certainly anyone can.
I loved Ted.
I still love him.
But it happened.
Mr. Murphy believed your husband was innocent.
What could he have done to make him believe that he had helped send your husband to prison unjustly?
I don't know anything about Mr. Murphy.
I'm sorry for him, but he did not put my husband in prison.
Sister, we lived through the trial, the years after the trial-- the children and I.
You don't know how hard that was on them.
I don't think we could take it again.
Not a new trial.
Not when it has to come out the same way.
She said she got a letter from her husband that he was worried and afraid that you might spoil his chances for a parole, so she called his lawyer.
And he sent her to you.
She might be right.
I thought we were just fulfilling Al Murphy's intentions to die with a clear conscience.
But not everyone can be wrong.
I'm not so sure, Sister.
For example, this is the testimony
Murphy gave in the Kilgore trial.
Now, if you'll, uh, just start there with paragraph two.
That's the questioning by the prosecutor.
Mr. Murphy, will you tell the court, in your own words, what you recall about the afternoon in question?
Well, about 2:00, our regular switchboard operator was taking a break, so I had the board and the desk as well.
Got a call from Room 418.
It was a woman's voice asking to make an outside call.
To what number, Mr. Murphy?
Uh, KL5-6131.
For the record, that phone is listed as a private line in the office of the defendant, Theodore Kilgore.
Go on, Mr. Murphy, please.
Well, about 20 minutes later, I saw the defendant walking through the lobby.
Then it must have been 10, 12 minutes later,
I got another call from Room 418.
This time it was Mr. Kilgore.
He identified himself?
Yes, he did.
He said he killed a woman, and would I call the police.
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.
Your witness, Mr. Grandt.
No cross-examination, Your Honor.
I don't understand.
Is this all?
That's it.
That's Murphy's entire contribution.
But it's nothing we haven't heard from everyone else.
That's what shakes me up, Sister.
If Murphy lied, then everyone is lying.
Item 1:
Grandt passed on cross-examining Murphy.
Why?
At that point in the trial, he was supposed to be defending his client all-out.
Item 2:
Kilgore is supposed to have taken a year's lease on Suite 418.
Now, how can a man that only makes $20,000 dollars a year afford a suite that goes for $75 a day?
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Yeah, Peggy?
The corporate pedigree of Miss Linholm's Royal Palms Sugar Corporation--
Uh, let me guess.
A subsidiary of C.W. Taggart Enterprises.
After you get through all the fine print.
Look, Peggy, would you make a call for me?
Call Miss Linholm.
Tell her I'm very sorry, but I'm going to have to let that check of hers deteriorate.
Right.
You know, Sister, I suddenly feel very good about Mr. Murphy getting his visa into heaven.
Let's see if we can give his cause a little nudge in the right direction.
Where are we going, Mr. Mannix?
I'd like to ask Mrs. Kilgore about her husband's financial situation.
Oh, Mr. Mannix, I promised Mrs. Kilgore that I'd ask you to drop the case.
Well, if you don't mind, Sister, I'd like her to ask me.
Mrs. Kilgore?
Yes?
Uh, my name is Joe Mannix.
I'm a private investigator.
You know the sister.
No, I'm afraid I don't.
No.
No, we've never met.
Well, uh, Sister Costello and I would like to talk to you about your husband.
Come in.
Thank you.
All right, Mr. Mannix.
What about my husband?
We feel there's a good chance that he didn't kill Alyce Taggart.
Have you talked to Ted about that?
The other day.
And he's still saying he's guilty.
Then why should I believe you?
Do you think he's a murderer?
What difference does it make?
It's not going to change anything, is it?
And you're satisfied he was having an affair with Alyce Taggart?
He testified that he was, under oath.
According to the record of the trial, your husband was paying over $500 a week to lease that apartment at the Vallejo Towers.
Now, did he have that kind of money?
Of course not.
He was under oath when he told the court he did.
Now, if that was a lie, couldn't the testimony regarding his relationship with Mrs. Taggart also have been a lie?
He's a man.
He had his pride.
Mrs. Taggart was paying for that apartment.
Did your husband tell you that?
He didn't have to.
That's him.
Oh, thank you.
The woman who pretended she was Mrs. Kilgore merely wanted me to take you off the case.
That's right.
Mr. Mannix, I find it hard to believe that there are people who are really like that.
Well, they don't usually come in your place of business, Sister.
Thank you.
(ENGINE STARTS)
Let's go.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(TIRES CONTINUE SCREECHING)
(RIFLE FIRES)
(RIFLE FIRES)
(RIFLE FIRES)
(RIFLE FIRES)
(Mannix) What's the news, Doc?
Surprisingly good.
Your seat belt kept you from ramming your head through that windshield.
Now tell me the bad news.
You'll feel a little shaky for the next few days.
Expect some headaches, neck pains.
I'd recommend several days of bed rest.
(Peggy) He won't listen to you, Doctor.
(Mannix) Hi, Peggy.
Joe, you all right?
Yeah, sure.
Sure.
I'm fine, I guess.
Stay in bed, Mr. Mannix.
Take it easy.
That's the word.
Who did it, Joe?
I don't know, but if you'll leave me alone so I can get dressed and get out of here, I may find out.
But the doctor just said you have to give yourself a chance.
Peggy, somebody wants me to join Al Murphy.
I can't just lie around here and wait.
But, Joe, the doctor just said--
Peggy, would you leave me alone so I can get dressed?
(SIGH)
Where are you going?
Back to prison.
Thought I'd seen the last of you.
Someone tried to arrange that.
What happened?
There's a contract out on me.
Contract?
And I got a feeling your name's on it, too.
You've seen it?
I don't have to.
Once they get me, you're the only one left who can make waves over Alyce Taggart's murder.
Why would I make waves?
I killed her.
You didn't kill her.
No?
Then tell me all about it.
Someone else strangled Alyce Taggart.
You're getting paid off to take the rap.
More money than you'd ever see in a lifetime.
(CHUCKLE) Fairy tale.
Well, the attempt on my life was real.
And it happened because I wouldn't buy your confession.
Don't be a fool, Kilgore.
You'll never see dime one of that payoff.
It'll be a knife in the back.
In the shower room or the recreation yard, someplace.
There's nothing much I can do about that, is there, according to you?
You can tell me who really killed Alyce Taggart.
I killed her!
All right, Kilgore.
If you won't help me, I can't help you.
You stick to your story, but don't turn your back on anyone.
Did I send for you, Mannix?
No.
But when you do, it'll be too late.
It'll happen, believe me, before you ever hit the outside.
Mannix!
Mannix, how could anything I say now make any difference?
Who'd believe me?
Everybody here on the inside wants out.
No one's going to think you're stir-crazy if I can make what you tell me hold up.
(SIGH)
I...
I d..
I don't know.
I--
I'm thinking of my wife and kids.
Was that part of the deal-- their safety?
Yeah.
How long do you think that deal will hold up if you're hit?
Now, the real killer has got to think you told your wife the whole story.
Look, Kilgore, you're the only one that can do it.
Either you tell me who killed Alyce Taggart, or you're dead and so is your whole family.
They'd kill you before you could get close to C.W. Taggart.
Are you saying Taggart killed his wife?
And that Taggart paid the rent on that apartment?
Even though it was in your name, it was his playpen?
Was Taggart there when you got there that afternoon?
Let's hear it, Kilgore.
Someone was in that suite.
Who?
Who?
Ed Noble, first vice president, next down the line from Taggart.
It was he who called me at the office, and it was he who told me to come over to the Towers.
Noble called you, not Mrs. Taggart?
That's right.
And you accepted his story that Taggart killed his wife?
That's the way it is when you work for C.W. Taggart.
After a while, you get used to the idea that Ed Noble's voice is C.W. Taggart's.
I never met the great man face-to-face, and I was a Taggart executive for two years.
Everything you've ever heard about C.W.'s lifestyle is gospel.
Uh-huh.
Oh, uh, what did Noble tell you when you got to that apartment?
Well, he showed me her body.
Then he told me that she'd caught C.W. with another woman and that she was going to create a scandal.
She was going to drag him through the courts.
So... there was a fight, and, uh, he strangled her.
You accepted that?
Of course I accepted it.
She was lying there dead.
Yeah.
I heard that you were shot at, your car had been forced off the road.
You could've been killed.
I want you to stop worrying, Sister.
In my job, if you don't have nine lives, you can't get a license.
Was the attack in any way connected with what you've been doing about Mr. Murphy?
Well, I could tell you a little white lie.
I won't.
The truth is yes.
In that case, I worry about even one of your lives being threatened.
Excuse me, Sister.
Peggy, I want you to build a fire under that manager at the Vallejo Towers.
I need that employment record now.
I'm on it.
Let me know the second you get anything.
Mr. Mannix, I'd like you to drop the case.
There's no need to sacrifice your life to save a dead man from his own sins.
I appreciate your releasing me, Sister, but right now I'm not fighting to save Al Murphy's soul.
I'm fighting to stay alive.
I see.
Then there's nothing I can say.
I'm afraid not.
It's out of my hands.
Then I can pray for your intentions.
That I can do.
I can use all the help I can get, Sister.
Is that it?
Al Murphy's employment record.
Yeah.
This does it for me.
Call Lieutenant Malcolm, tell him I'll be in his office in half an hour.
(Art) All right.
Maybe Kilgore was telling you the truth, Joe, but your theory about this whole case is pretty wild.
Yeah, well, somebody doesn't agree with you.
All right.
The dynamite's real enough.
But the rest of it?
It all makes sense, Art.
Nobody has seen C.W. Taggart for years.
Maybe he's dead.
Oh, come on, Joe.
Well, have you talked to him recently?
Has anyone?
For you, Lieutenant.
Oh, thanks, Mike.
Here.
This is a picture of C.W. Taggart taken three months ago, with a telephoto lens, by an enterprising freelance photographer.
Here's when he made his last public appearance-- a Congressional hearing nine years ago.
Now, you're not going to tell me that isn't the same man?
I don't know.
The man in this photo could be a double standing in for Taggart.
(ART CHUCKLES) That's going to be a very tough sale, Joe.
All right now.
Let's just assume, for argument's sake, Art, that I'm right-- that C.W. Taggart died eight years ago, and, like he did everything else, in secret.
And his board of directors put a look-alike in his chair?
That's right.
And they even married him off to Alyce Taggart for window dressing.
That way, they could control the whole Taggart empire.
Joe, when a C.W. Taggart chooses not to show up anywhere for a while, all sorts of stories spring up.
Come on, Art.
We're talking about billions of dollars.
The men who fronted for Taggart wouldn't let that kind of money get away from them.
And Taggart's lifestyle would make it easy.
Except for the palace guards and Alyce
Taggart, who'd ever know there was a switch?
I have one question.
How do you prove you're right?
Make Taggart prove I'm wrong.
That's very interesting.
How?
I'll charge him with attempted murder.
Of whom?
Me.
Gentlemen, what can I do for you?
Mr. Noble, I'm Lieutenant Malcolm, Los Angeles Police Department.
I'd like to see Mr. Taggart, please.
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
That's impossible.
No one's allowed in his private suite.
But I'm his first vice president.
Perhaps you can discuss your business with me.
I'm afraid not.
This is an official matter.
Can you tell me what it's all about?
Yeah.
Mr. Mannix here has sworn out a complaint against Mr. Taggart.
Your boss hired a couple of killers to get rid of me.
There have been two near misses.
That's absurd.
We didn't come here for your opinion, Mr. Noble.
We'd like to see Mr. Taggart.
I'm sorry, Mr. Mannix, but I can assure you Mr. Taggart doesn't even know you're alive.
What possible interest could he have in killing you?
That's why we'd like to talk to him.
We'd like to hear the answer.
Out of the question.
We could always come back with a warrant for Mr. Taggart's arrest.
Do that, Lieutenant.
At your own risk, of course.
All we want to do is talk to him.
Mr. Taggart has nothing to say to you.
Why?
Because the real C.W. Taggart died eight years ago, and you don't trust the look-alike you've got warming his seat to handle a few questions as to why he wants me dead?
(CHUCKLES)
Perhaps we can make a deal, Mr. Mannix.
What if I could satisfy you on that score?
Try me.
We've heard the imposter allegation before, of course.
I suppose it's to be expected when a man like Mr. Taggart decides he's had enough of public life.
If you gentlemen will excuse me for a minute.
Where are you going?
It's 6:00.
Mr. Taggart will be having his sundown martini.
I should be able to switch glasses without his realizing what I'm doing.
Of course, I expect Mr. Mannix to accept the fingerprints on that glass as proof that he's totally mistaken in his conclusions.
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)
Noble shot you down in flames, Joe.
The prints on that glass are fresh, and they belong to Mr. C.W. Taggart.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Taggart was a navy flyer during World War ll.
We verified the prints off his enlistment record.
Face it, Joe.
C.W. Taggart is alive and drinking.
If he is, Kilgore's story adds up.
Noble got him to take the rap for the murder.
How do you know Kilgore wasn't lying to you when he said he didn't do it?
Maybe he saw a way out for himself.
If he was lying, why the contract out on me?
You've been a target before.
Maybe it's somebody else's idea.
An old friend out of the past.
All right, Art.
But if we're going to talk about what happened to Alyce Taggart, let's take a long look at Al Murphy and his employment record.
Does it matter now?
Now that we know C.W. Taggart's alive?
But Al Murphy worked the desk at the Barrington Hotel before he moved over to the Vallejo Towers.
And Taggart Enterprises, including C.W. Taggart, occupy the two top floors of the Barrington Hotel, including the penthouse.
Yeah.
Now, if he was the desk clerk at the Barrington Hotel, he would have certainly recognized the voice of the person who called Kilgore from the Vallejo Towers the afternoon of the killing.
I'll buy that, in view of Murphy's troubled conscience.
Why didn't they simply wipe him out?
They needed him alive and happy, so they paid him $15,000 to sew up the case against Kilgore.
Joe, Kilgore confessed.
That wasn't enough.
The case against Kilgore had to be documented, or somebody in your department might have smelled a rat.
For my money, that case was documented, Joe.
Art, uh, in your tender lifetime, you've had a few martinis?
One or two.
Off duty.
Uh, have you ever looked at the glass after you finished the drink?
Why?
Well, a gin or vodka martini doesn't leave a ring around the glass, does it?
No, it doesn't.
As you say, uh, C.W. Taggart is alive and drinking.
The question is, what is he drinking?
Do you mind if I have the lab check this out?
Come on, Joe.
What difference does it make?
Only that somebody's trying to kill me and I'd like to know why.
I got a feeling that the only one who can give me all the answers is C.W. Taggart himself.
You can't get in to see him.
Maybe if I drop in unexpectedly, huh?
When I make the next pass, you go, right?
Mannix, you were in that helicopter.
That's right.
I wanted to return Mr. Taggart's martini glass.
You chose an unconventional way of doing it.
Well, being that I raised the question about Mr. Taggart's identity,
I thought it was up to me to apologize.
Unnecessary.
But your apology's accepted.
Thank you.
The fingerprints on that glass were definitely Mr. Taggart's, and I was all wrong about his being replaced.
However, the lab did do an analysis of the contents of that glass, and, uh, there's something about it that bothers me.
Why would Mr. Taggart drink a martini that tested out as pure ginger ale?
Off the record, Mr. Taggart hasn't been well.
He's been taken off alcoholic beverages for a while.
But, uh, you said, specifically, he was having a martini.
Well, you can surely understand why.
Of course.
Of course.
Just one of the many secrets about the legendary C.W. Taggart.
It is.
But then, uh, not really important enough to kill anyone over, is it?
No one's going to kill you, Mr. Mannix.
We'll escort you downstairs.
But I'd suggest that you might save yourself a lot of trouble by staying away from here in the future.
Mmm.
(GRUNT)
Hold it!
(RHYTHMIC METALLIC CREAKING)
Is that you, Uncle?
It's all right.
Don't be frightened.
Who is that with you?
Are they going to play with me?
No, sonny.
They can't stay.
I'm sorry.
Let's go.
Why don't you just go ahead and shoot me here?
I'm sure you can make him think it's just a game.. cowboys and Indians.

But it does give us the motive for the murder of Alyce Taggart.

Is it?
A great man has a stroke.
It affects his brain.
To dispel any rumors that he might be incapacitated, a wedding's arranged with some girl from the company.
She goes along with it for a couple of years, then decides she wants to cash in.
She wants a lot of money or she'll have C.W. committed and take over herself.
Of course, you couldn't allow her to do that.
No, I couldn't.
Now move.
(GRUNT)
Art.
Yeah.
Well, Mr. Noble, we had a report of a prowler here.
Got to check it out, you know.

THE FLIGHT Part One
Who are you?
I wanted to help you...
Snow!
Snow.
Sometimes it seems to me that I am dreaming...
Indeed.
What's wrong with you?
You are burning.
Sit down.
I'll be right back.
Stop!
Stop!
- Water!
- What water?
Forward!
Wait.
Just some water...
Give me a flask!
Nude in the frost!
Nude in the frost!
The best Italian troupe from Viazma!
Nude in the frost!
Excuse me, Your Excellency!
The Reds are in town!
General Krapchikov!
The cards are dealed!
Go away!
Where?
Pass.
Lose.
Excuse me...
Please!
Another.
To yourself.
Yours.
Excuse me!
Excuse me, here you are!
Carefully...
Hooray, viva, hurray!
- Come, madam!
- Where?
There...
There!
Give in the name of Christ.
Search the monastery!
And who are you?
- Paisiy.
- Paisiy.
Well, well...
Come here.
Did you burn the fire on the bell tower?
- By no means!
- Did you give the signs to the Whites?
- No, there're only ours here!
Gently!
- Who are these?
- Refugees.
Your IDs, gentlemen!
We got under fire and rushed here, to the monastery.
- And this one?
- A woman!
She is in labor.
Here's the passport.
Barabanchikova, married.
And where is her husband?
Just the right place and time to give birth!
- Whites!
- Let's go!
Squadron!
To horse!
Now!
Where did these Reds come from?
And why did it all happen?
- De Brizar!
- Your Excellency!
A coat!
A papakha for me!
And a cigarette.
- Yes, sir!
And you, civil worm, aren't you a procurator?
Your ID!
I am not a procurator.
I am a privatdozent.
We're escaping from Petersburg.
- And you, madam?
- I am the wife of the Minister of Commerce.
Serafima Karzukhina.
Here are my false documents, and here are the real ones.
A thousand apologies, madam!
- Excuse me.
Let's go, madam.
- Noah's Ark!
Music!
Cossacks!
General Charnota is recaptured from the Reds!
- Hello, cossacks!
- Viva, Your Excellency!
Lyuska!
Lyuska...
- Grishka, alive!
- Lyuska!
Excuse me, gentlemen.
And we were going to serve your requiem mass...
I saw death as close as you now.
Let me go, I'm cold.
Can you imagine, when I came to Headquarters of General Krapchikov, he, that son of a bitch, made me play vint.
A dispatch was sent to him but he postponed the decoding until morning!
And Budionny troops - here - out of the blue!
I went by the backyard to Mr. Barabanchikov and said: "Give me some ID".
When I came here and looked - the ID is female, his wife's, Mrs. Barabanchikova.
And it says "pregnant"!
So I told them: "Lay me down like this, in the church!"
So I am lying, in labor...
And so cold!
And suddenly I hear - Commissar...
His spurs - flop-flop, flop-flop..
Well, I think "Where are you going?
Here the death awaits you under my horsecloth!
Come on, uncover me quickly!"
He took my passport but didn't lift the horsecloth.
Pardon me, gentlemen...
To get to Crimea.
Under Roman Khludov's wing.
- Go out in 5 minutes!
- Wait!
Holy fathers, wait!
Are you mad?
Started this ceremony!
You must flee!
The corps are on our heels!
General!
You must, do you hear, you must take her with you!
Serafima Vladimirovna is sick!
I know you have some field hospital.
- Did you study in the university?
- Yes.
But you make an impression of a completely uneducated person.
And if you get a bullet in your forehead, will field hospital be of much help, civil worm?
We must take her!
To leave a beautiful woman to the Reds?
- I beg you!
- All right.
Into the wagon!
Thank you!
Dear, get up, they let us, do you hear?
We need to go!
You go, and I will lie down.
It's hot.
I want to drink... to Petersburg...
- Oh Lord, what is it?
...
- It's typhus alright!
Krapilin, persuade the lady.
- Just so, you should go!
- Krapilin, take her by force!
- Please, help me!
Where to, general?
Won't you stand up for the monastery that gave you shelter and salvation?
Don't upset me, old man!
Tie the bells, men, and hide underground!
Go!
Halt!
Go ahead, don't wait for us.
What are you doing?
Krapilin, go away!
Let me go...
Excuse us.
Is it better?
Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet reports, despite of estreme efforts,
Azov flotilla can not leave Taganrog.
The 12 degrees frost, the ice is solid.
The flotilla isn't physically capable to join the meant operation.
The absence of the fleet makes our initiative on the left flang impossible.
The centre of impact is transferred to the Turkish wall, frontal attack.
And Sivash with 15th and 52nd divisions move to Perekop force's rear.
I will set the troops' tasks personally in the initial positions.
The start of the operation is on the 7th, at 10 p.m.
The commanders will receive my instructions tonight.
That's it.
Any questions?
I doubt it.
I doubt infantry a lot, comrade Commander of the Southern front.
Nine versts on the rotten sea - they'll all freeze.
They'll transform in icicles on the coast, instead of division.
And icicles can be broken with fingers!
Don't you doubt the infantry!
I can see through you, Bayev...
Horses aren't fish - there's nothing for them to do in water.
- What do you suggest?
- To include cavalry into the assault troop.
My cavalry!
You're looking for glory, aren't you?
I've never run from glory in my short Red life.
And now, on the eve of the third anniversary of our revolution,
I am ready to clink glasses with you and drink Sivash water, if you are ready to share.
Share it, Brigade Commander.
You all may leave now.
- Don't forget the orchestra.
- I won't.
How is it, Semen?
- I washed it.
- All right.
Superintendant and station master are required to the front commander!
Sevastopol!
Sevastopol! but Frunze refused to represent the assigned enemy during the maneuvers.
Full stop.
This is neither a chess board nor the unforgettable Czar Village.
Full stop, signature:
Khludov.
Codify it and send to the Commander-in-chief!
Tragedies are beginning.
Armoured train is paralysed.
It walks on crutches.
Nobody likes us... nobody!
Thence a tragedy.
The oven smokes!
By no means.
No smoke!
I've been waiting for an hour for the train to Taganash.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
..
What's wrong?
..
The station master calimed that "The Officer" can't get through!
Did you claim that the train can't get through?
That's true, Your Excellency!
No physical possibility!
After the sorting the road's blocked.
Then the second one smokes!
- At once!
Put out the oven!
- Smoke!
Smoke!
Somehow it seems to me that you favour the bolshevicks.
Do not be afraid.
Be sincere with me.
Everyone has their own beliefs.
Slyboots!
Your Excellency!
Why this suspicion?
I haven't slept for 30 hours!
I have children...
Olya and Pavlik...
Sincere man, hum?
No, we need love.
Nothing can be done without it in the war.
They don't love me.
Find sappers.
Push it, sort it...
The "Officer" should pass the semaphore in 15 minutes!
If the order is not carried out, shoot the superintendant and hang the station master, writing "Sabotage" under him.
- Please!
- Your Excellency!
I have children!
Waltz?
What's he doing?
!
Come on!
The combined cavalry division arrived from Chongar marching, Your Excellency.
Sit down!
Golovan, chair!
What are you doing, Roma?
Roma, stop it...
Stop!
Quiet!
- You are from general staff after all!
- Shut up!
Leave the transport here.
You'll go to the Karpov gorge and stay there.
Yes, sir!
- The transport and wounded stay here.
- And I?
- You stay here as well!
- Grisha!
Your Excellency, it has passed!
They're entering the Lithuanian peninsula.
Where?
Here.
Squadron!
Follow me!
Stop!
Stop!
Retreat!
Start the music - commander's order.
It's my honour to introduce myself:
Korzukhin, the friend of Minister of Commerce.
I'm listening.
The Council of Ministers has authorised me to address you with three questions.
Firstly, I am comissioned to find out the destiny of 5 workers arrested in Simferopol.
Captain, present the arrested to Mr. Minister's friend!
- Please follow me!
- Yes, be so kind...
Thank you.
The first question is settled.
The second?
The second?
What second?
Oh, the second...
The second refers directly to my ministry.
Here on the station the cargo of essential purpose was stuck.
I ask for permission and assistance of Your Excellency to urgently push this cargo through to Sevastopol.
- And what cargo is it?
- Export furs.
Export furs...
And in what train is the cargo?
Here.
Golovan, drive the mentioned train to the dead-end and burn it with kerosene!
- Yes, sir.
The third question!
The situation in the front-line.
What situation can there be?
The fools shoot the canons.
The commander was given a smoking stove.
There are no restaurants, no girls.
Boredom...
We're sitting like parrots on the stools!
Go to Sevastopol and tell the rear stinkers to pack - the Reds will be here tomorrow!
And also say, that the foreign whores won't see sable cuffs!
This is unheard!
I will have the honour to report this to the Commander-in-Chief!
Do it!
Roma!
Roma, Roma...
Hello!
It's me!
- Feed her!
- Roma!
- Feed her!
Will you please come with me!
Be so kind!
- You know, he's always in a hurry.
Last time we met...
- Yes, yes...
- Golovan, what's burning there?
- Furs.
- Wait!
- Who is Roman Khludov here?
- Let her.
I am Khludov.
- She is sick!
Back!
We're running from Petersburg.
Running and running...
Where to?
Under Roman Khludov's wing!
Always Khludov, Khludov...
Khludov's even in our dreams.
Now we have the honour to behold him.
Sitting on a barrel, and sacks're hanging around...
Only sacks and sacks...
Beast!
Jackal!
They'll come and finish you off!
- She's a Communist!
- You are mad!
Let me!
- Back!
She is no Communist.
She's Korzukhin's wife.
She has no idea what she says!
That's good.
Because when they have the idea, they never say the truth.
Wait, wait...
Korzukhina?
Furs...
That scoundrel has a Communist wife!
Opportunity!
Bring him here!
- Yes, sir.
Opportunity.
- Paramon Ilych Korzukhin?
- Yes, I am.
Your wife, Serafima Vladimirovna, came to you from Petersburg.
Excuse me.
Thank God!
I see this woman for the first time.
I don't know any Serafima Vladimirovna.
I'm not expecting anyone from Petersburg.
This is a lie!
- What?
- A lie?
Disavowed!
Skunk!
- This is blackmailing!
- Sincere man, ha?
Luckily for you, Mr. Korzukhin...
Fur...
Away!
Take her in and interrogate!
Your Excellency, this is a misunderstanding!
That's true...
Jackal...
As written in the books:
jackal!
You can't win a war with strangleholds only!
Why did you, beast, cut out the soldiers under Perekop?
However you came across someone... a woman...
She took a pity on the hanged, nothing more.
But no one can slip past you, no one:
you put them into a sack right away!
You feed on the dead flesh!
- Let me take him away, Your Excellency!
- No!
His words suggest sober thoughts about the war.
Speak, soldier, speak!
- Bring a sack!
- What is your surname, soldier?
- Surname...
What's with the surname?
My surname isn't famous:
Krapilin, an orderly.
And you will perish, wild beast, perish in a gutter!
Sit here, on your barrel!
Oh no, you'll run!
Run away to Constantinople!
You are only brave to hang women and mechanics!
You are wrong, soldier!
I've been to log-path of Chongar, with music, wounded twice there!
All provinces spit upon your music!
Farewell, Your Excellency, I've said it all.
No, you're a bad soldier.
Well begun, poorly done.
Hang him, I can not look at him!
Flag!
Flag!
Flag!
Forward!
Stand back!
Give way!
Orchestra!
- Hello, gentlemen!
- Viva, Your Excellency!
I ask for permission to report to Your Excellency confidentially!
- Yes.
Leave us!
- Everybody move 20 steps away!
3 hours ago the enemy captured Yushun.
The Bolshevicks are in Crimea.
- The end...
- The end.
Your Beatitude!
In this fearsome hour we set hopes only on Lord's mercy.
Pray, Your Beatitude.
- Where is the train to Sevastopol?
- Lord Almighty...
Why do Thee send new ordeals to your creatures?
Why, Lord?
- Your Grace, you bother our Lord in vain.
He abondoned us long ago.
Look - the water went away from Sivash.
The Bolshevicks walked through like on the parquet.
Saint George is laughing at us!
- General, what are you saying?
I am strongly against such a tone!
Apparently you are sick, general.
I am sorry you didn't go abroad for treatment in summer, like I advised.
Oh, and who would make your soldiers to defend the wall at Perekop?
Who would send Charnota to Karpov gorge?
Who would hang, your Excellency?
You must return to Sevastopol immediately.
Gentlemen officers, the Commander-in-Chief is leaving us.
Orchestra!
Into carriages - march!
Get away!
Gentlemen officers!
Wind up the headquarters immediately.
The Crimea fell.
Amen.
Go to your units immediately, gentlemen.
Protect the station with all means.
I order: no soldier should stay alive.
You are free.
Colonel...
Colonel!
Excuse me.
Regiment!
Halt!
- Warrant officer!
- Here.
- Tear the muslin off.
- Yes, sir!
- What's going on here?
- Order to raise the spirits, Colonel!
Regiment, attention!
Eyes front!
Officers!
Colonel Sir!
- Hello, gunners!
- Good day, Colonel sir!
Some hours ago in our situation, in the situation of the army,
I would say in national status of Southern Russia, sudden changes occurred.
Therefore I announce that the regiment is dismissed!
I suggest you should take off badges of rank and walk away and hide.
- Gentlemen!
- Betrayal!
- High treason!
What's going on?
- Calm down!
- Colonel, you are under arrest!
- Silence!
So, in brief.
I do not have time and I assure you neither.
The question is:
who do you want to defend?
Who do you want to defend?
- Russia!
- Russia is against us and you know it.
What is left?
Void...
Rumble of steps...
This dusty Emperor?
But we have an order!
- Whose?
- The Commander-in-Chief's.
The Commander-in Chief's!
Excellent!
Regiment, fall in!
Attention!
Listen!
The Commander-in-Chief after shamefully leaving us to the mercy of fate, ran away like the lowest coward and rascal.
Now, at this moment, the Front Line Commander Khludov is escaping.
In several hours, we will witness the catastrophe.
Listen...
My children...
I, an active officer who survived war with the Germans, assume everything on my conscience!
Everything!
I send you home!
Trumpeter!
Retreat!
Go.
By no means, Colonel, I am with you.
Colonel, in my own name and on behalf of the officers whom I incited to disgraceful act, I apologise.
I accept it.
Chair to the Commander!
- What's wrong?
- My legs.
Memory of the irons.
Urgent radiogram!
Radiogram to the Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Russia, General Wrangel.
- To whom?
- To General Wrangel.
Don't you hear?
Write.
Considering the obvious uselessness of your army resistance, threatening only to shed unnecessary blood,
I suggest you should stop resisting.
If you accept the mentioned proposal, revolution-military Board of Southern Army Front, basing on the privilege given by the central Soviet government, guarantee to the surrendered the complete remission of their misdeeds related to the Civil War.
Thank you, Comrades.
And you sit down, comrade!
Continue.
Write:
Remember that we are talking about tens of thousands lives of people involved in the fight against Soviet Russia.
If you refuse the mentioned fair proposal all fault for senselessly shed Russian blood falls on you.
Commander of the Southern Front Mikhail Frunze.
"Orderly Krapilin.
Bolshevik. "
Who is there?
Cossack captain...
Captain!
Look, who is it?
- No one, your Excellency.
- What do you mean no one?
Come here!
Sit down!
Look!
... standing!
Do you see?
Krapilin!
I am sorry, I don't see...
No one, your Excellency!
Krapilin is hanged.
He can't stand.
Yes...
I probably dreamed it...
Although I wasn't sleeping.
May be I was?
- That's true, Your Excellency.
Yes, yes, go...
No, wait!
What is this?
The Holy Bible, Your Excellency.
Archbishop Afrikan sent it to you as a gift.
I reported you.
- Yes, I remember.
Look here...
I am bored, brother.
Read aloud for me!
- Excuse me...
I am illiterate.
- Well, well...
Listen here:
"They be blind leaders of the blind.
And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch."
Who is this about?
- I do not know, your Excellency.
About us, about us...
About me!
As you wish, your Excellency!
Don't go away, Captain.
And do not let me sleep.
Wake me up!
- Would you like...
- Yes, and louder.
Someone who can see...
Someone who can see - tell me what is around me!
Soldier, I know you're here!
Don't be silent, Krapilin!
Don't be silent!
Don't be silent, Krapilin!
Captain!
You were sleeping.
- I am sorry!
Give me a towel.
Damn, I dream all sort of nonsense...
You were sleeping, did you dream of something?
- Yes, sir!
- What?
- Excuse me, your Excellency...
I dreamed of a woman...
You are a happy man, captain.
Does your soul ache, captain?
By no means.
Soul doesn't ache.
Teeth ache.
Caught a cold.
Get out!
- What?
- Out!
- Astrakhan fur, astrakhan...
- I don't need!
Dear Marya Konstantinovna, allow me to help you...
- No, no...
- Oh, it's broken!
Obviously you are an intelligent man and I hope you understand how it's important for us to know the truth.
Take a seat!
They spread dirty rumors about counter-intelligence.
In reality this institution performs the most difficult task to protect the state.
Please smoke!
- Thank you, I don't smoke.
- Are you afraid of me?
- Yes, I am.
Don't worry.
I beg you, tell me what happened to her?
- To whom?
- You can understand, it is the most ridiculous story...
- Enough playing privatdozent.
I am fed up with this comedy!
Scoundrel!
How dare you sit?
Rise!
Let us agree that you will tell me the pure truth.
If you start lying...
Do you hear?
- I've never lied!
Well, silent and answer only my questions.
Take a seat, please!
Why did you come to the Whites?
Why did the so called Serafima Korzukhina come here?
But I am sure, I know that she really is Korzukhina!
But in your presence, on the station, Korzukhin said that this was a lie!
- He lied.
He was just scared.
- Why was he scared?
Write.
I will dictate, thus it'll be easier for you.
But I warn you:
if you stop, you alone are to blame!
Write: "I, the undersigned, Sergei Pavlovich Golbukov, testified under interrogation, two-spot:
Serafima Vladimirovna Korzukhina...
- But she's ill!
- Don't stop!
...arrived to the area occupied by the Armed Forces of Southern Russia for Communist propaganda and contact with the underground..
Don't stop!
Privatdozent... and signature.
Thank you for the frank testimony!
- But this is not f...
Take him out and let him go!
Skunski!
Appreciate the document.
How much will Korzukhin give for ransom?
- Here, before the departure?
Ten thousand dollars.
In Constantinople less.
I suggest you to get Korzukhina's confession.
Delay Korzukhin's boarding under some pretext, at least for an hour.
- And my share?
- Gurin, take her!
- Help me, save me, somebody!
Help me, it's crime, save me!
Help!
Save me, help!
Look what they made him to write!
Please immediately vacate the premises of counter-intelligence!
Gurin, call the guards!
Buy a house.
I accept any currency.
Even counterfeit.
Oh, my God, what a nonsense, why am I sitting here?
Shut up, your Excellency, let me listen.
You must agree that I am in a strange situation.
Ah, my God, what an idiot!
I am a minister's friend and you will answer for it!
- What a difficult person.
Waiter!
Another bottle.
I am going to the restroom.
Hope, you have nothing against it.
Semyon, accompany him!
- Why are you stuck here?
- Stuck?
I'm waiting for Commander-in-Chief.
Do you know what will you wait until?
The Reds.
Go to the ship!
Commander-in-Chief doesn't receive, gentlemen.
You are expected!
Gentlemen!
Thank God...
I've been waiting impatiently for you.
- It's cold.
- What?
So, did everybody leave?
They strongly beat the cavalry on the way...
But you can say they left...
I travelled very comfortably.
Hid in the corner of compartment,
I don't harm anyone and nobody harms me...
Twilight, in short...
like in the kitchen.
I don't understand you, what are you talking about?
It was in my childhood.
Once I entered the kitchen in the dusk...
A stove, cockroaches on the stove.
I lit up a match, and they ran.
When the match went out,
I heard them rustling with their feet.
That's how it is now - darkness and rustling...
I look and think: where do they run to?
Like cockroaches to the bucket...
From the kitchen table - buh!
- Thank you.
For all you've done for Crimea with your huge strategic talent.
I'm not keeping you any longer.
I'm moving to the hotel myself.
- Closer to the water?
If you do not stop being bold, I'll arrest you.
I foresaw it.
My guards are in the lobby.
It'll be a big scandal
- I am popular.
No, it is not a disease...
For the whole year now you've been hiding your hatred towards me under abominable joking.
- I don't hide that I hate you!
Envy?
Lust for power?
No.
I hate you because you involved me in all this.
Where are the promised Allied troops?
Where is the Russian empire?
How could you start fighting them, when you are powerless?
You have become a cause of my disease!
However, it's not the time...
We both are relegated to oblivion...
I don't keep you any longer, general.
- Turning a faithful servant out...
- Clown!
Hey, who is here?
Soldier!
The court!
Seat!
The court!
Seat!
Don't be silent, Krapilin...
Say something!
Excuse me...
But they promised to let me see you...
Everybody has gone somewhere.
What do you want?
I came here to tell you about atrocious crimes carried out by counter-intelligence, the cause of which is General Khludov.
This is interesting.
Excuse me, but you are alive, aren't you?
I hope you aren't hung...
What are your claims?
You make a good impression.
I've seen you somewhere before.
Would you be so kind as to say what are your claims.
- The day before yesterday you ordered to arrest a woman.
- I Remember...
Remember, remember.
Yes, yes, remember...
Now I remember...
I recognize you.
Excuse me, and to whom were you going to complain about me?
To the Commander-in-Chief.
It's too late.
He's gone.
Bucket of water...
Sank to oblivion...
Forever.
There's no one to complain to about General Khludov.
Captain!
Listen, Golovan: take the guards and go to counter-intelligence.
There is a woman registered by me - Korzukhina?
Serafima Vladimirovna!
If she hasn't been shot, bring her to the palace.
What did you say?
If you have done it...
- Behave as a man!
Let's wait.
If she is not alive, I'll kill you.
Well...
Maybe this is the best outcome.
Seat down!
You see, soldier, you just got under the wheel and it ground you down!
Broke your bones!
It's no use following me, do you hear?
- Are you talking to me?
- What?
Who are you talking to?
Who?
Now we'll understand.
To no one, to myself.
- You are crazy...
Listen, you!
She isn't coming.
She was shot!
Rascal!
Do me a favour, shoot!
Who is she to you, a lover?
No, a person I met accidentally.
But I love her.
- Was she shot?
- By no means!
- What happened to her?
- Quiet!
In that case, why haven't you brought her?
- I am sorry...
- Speak in his presence.
- Major-General Charnota burst into counter-intelligence, and recaptured the arrested by force and took her.
- Where to?
- Quiet!
Where to?
- To the steamboat "Knight".
It departured at 5 o'clock.
So she is alive.
Your woman Serafima is alive.
Alive...
Captain, take the flag and board on the "Prelate".
Go.
- Yes, sir!
Khludov!
Take me with you to Constantinople!
Damn!
Some Serafima, Constantinople...
We should hurry!
Everyone else has run away...
- So?
- Done!
Three the most expensive coffins, as ordered.
And a varnished catafalque, with tassels.
- And this...
- Your Excellency, the coffin-maker is here waiting.
- And you wait as well, brother.
- Yes, sir.
Well...
Now I will announce my last order to the regiment.
Soldiers and officers!
Brothers!
We have nothing left - neither the flag, nor the army, nor the Motherland.
I've been leading you by the road of lies.
It is my fault, my sin.
I will atone for it!
God help you... to survive the Russian hard times.
Signature.
We voluntarily chose this end.
This is an honor, gentlemen!
We have a favour to ask, my dear.
Three people need to be buried.
Rest assured, Your Excellency, everything will be done first class, in spite of the situation.
Where are the deseased?
- How can I explain...
We need to be buried.
- Who?
- We!
We won't wrong you, will pay generously.
Only honestly perform your duty.
Captain, give the money.
Spare me, Your Excellency, let me go, I am innocent!
Don't be afraid, my dear, no one wants to harm you.
On the contrary - you'll get a fortune.
This is your job after all!
With pleasure, of course, but...
Who is to be buried?
- You fool, you'll bury who we tell you!
- Captain, without manhandling, please!
I am sorry, Your Excellency.
We, my dear, we are to be buried!
These gentlemen here and I!
I see...
I accept.
Are you nuts, scoundrel?
He isn't shaven.
It's better to shave alive, then it'll be more difficult.
This isn't your business!
Shut up!
- Wait outside.
- Yes, sir.
- See to it that he does everything!
- Yes, sir!
Gentlemen, maybe someone of you... has changed his mind?
I appreciate, gentlemen!
Captain, you smell like a wine barrel!
Shame on you!
Let us.
The first!
- The second.
- The third!
One...
Captain, this is basely!
- What is your name?
- Petka Sheglov.

THE FLIGHT Part Two
Doesn't break, doesn't wreck, only somersaults!
- Viva, Your Excellency!
- Sit down...
Doesn't break, doesn't wreck, only somersaults...
- Kebab!
- I hope you choke on it!
Doesn't break, doesn't wreck, only somersaults!
Fifty piastres...
Madam, buy a Red Commissar for your kids' entertainment.
Your little angels'...
Doesn't break, doesn't wreck!
A caring mother!
Pourquoi...
No, not pourquoi...
Antre pour enfant...
Enfant!

A 50 piastre, madam!
Madam... madam!
Well, well - 40!

Damn you!
You've never had kids at all!
Go!
Go to your harem!
Yok!
Yok, I say!
Damned city!
Damned city!
- Maria Konstantinovna!
- What is it, Gregory Lukyanovich?
Well...
Can't I see Janizary on credit today?
Spare me, Gregory Lukyanovich...
I can't!
But I'm not some swindler, or freemason of Constantinople...
Neither am I some stranger to you...
I think you still can trust a general!
Well, this is all true, Gregory Lukyanovich.
But ask Arthur Arturovich yourself.
Arthur Art...
What's wrong?
Who needs me?
What can I do for you?
- Well... you see...
No!
But it is rude after all, Arthur Arturovich!
I know what you'll say.
I wonder, what?
Much more interesting is what I'll tell you.
Got it!
I wonder, what?
On credit - to no one!
What a rascal!
What a city!
I've seen many cities, but such...
- What cities have you seen?
- Oh, Lord!
Kharkov...
Rostov!
Kiev!
Monastery shining in the mountains...
Chartoroy-town on the Dnieper... smell of hay.
I remember, what a nice battle it was near Kiev!
Lovely battle!
It was warm...
Sunny...
Warm, but not hot!
Arthur!
Why are you shouting?
I look at you, Arthur, and admire you!
You've already put the tails on.
You are not a man, but the sport of nature!
Cockroaches' king.
Lucky you!
Arthur Arturovich, I decided to liquidate my business.
Fifty.
Are you joking with me?
I sell one piece for fifty!
- Keep doing it then!
Are you planning to go on sucking blood?
I am not imposing myself on you!
Buy cartridges.
Silver.
Cartridges, together with the cabinet - two liras and fifty!
Here, take it!
Pardon, general...
Give me for 2 liras and 50 on Janizary.
Attention!
Sensation in Constantinople with the police permission!
Ladies and Gentlemen, the races are open!
Never seen anywhere in the world, Russian court game -
Cockroach races!
The deseased Empress' favorite game...
Please, gentlemen, please, ladies!
Carefully!
Attention!
Achtung!
Attention!
Ladies and Gentlemen, the cockroaches live in a sealed box under the supervision of entomology professor of Imperial
University of Kazan, by miracle escaped from the Bosheviks... and his assistant.
First round!
Calling on the stage number one
- Eastern Pearl!
Number two
- Baba Yaga!
Number three - dapple-grey cockroach the favorite Janizary!
Janizary!
Number four
- Don't-Cry-Baby.
Number five and six - Button and Hooligan.
So...
To the start!
Janizary won!
Second round!
Calling the same participants.
Orchestra...
Janizary!
Janizary turned back...
Look!
What are you doing!
What are you doing, you'll kill it!
Janizary, Janizary...
Go, Janizary, my dear!
Go...
Janizary is stopped!
- Cannot be...
- Arthur, you gave Janizary to drink!
Music louder!
Boatswain!
Where have you seen a drunk cockroach?
Where!
Look here
- Janizary is sober as a diamond.
Janizary, attention!
Look, he took a leap!
Do not touch me, I am an officer!
My institution is authorized by police!
Death is too good for him!
Your Excellency!
Where is Janizary...
Don't crush Janizary!
Run, Janizary!
Police!
Help!
Help...
Where have you seen a drunk cockroach?
How you multiplied!
And you, bold head, are here...
I assure you that Janizary is sober as a diamond!
Oh you, with meat...
Police!
Quickly...
Gentlemen...
This is a misunderstanding - I'm the victim!
That's me!
Take them!
Scoundrels!
...
Rascals!
My establishment is the best in Constantinople!
- Exactly!
- To the hospital, Maria Konstantinovna.
Well, brother Janizary...
We are done...
Finished!
And what a lovely battle it was!
I won in vint a white felt cloak...
White...
White, white like snow.
It was a lovely battle, brother Janizary!
Stop, stop!
Viva!
Don't you recognize me?
Excuse me...
I am Tihiy.
I almost hanged you in Crimea, do you recall?
You are so inattentive to people!
I humbly ask for 10 - minute confidential conversation, considering our old acquaintance.
- Be brief.
I am leaving for Paris.
- I won't delay you, Your Excellency!
- I am listening.
- I will be brief.
My perspective is an almshouse.
Too bad.
- I have a principle not to lend anyone.
I don't ask.
Not due to the pride, but because I know who I am dealing with.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
I want to work.
- I am sorry, but I don't need you.
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't!
- Yes, you do, you do!
Let me explain.
I made a huge study to clarify the political picture among emigration.
I gathered data about many people that might be of interest.
Excuse me, but what does it have to do with me?
I am not in the least interested.
I have processed and registered the collected data in relation of intellectual qualities, as well as the peculiarities and features of characters!
This will give certain guarantee of not making a mistake while using a person.
Well, this is smart, but what do I have to do with it?
I am not interested in politics.
Yet, out of mere curiosity - let me read it!
- Well, only if out of curiosity...
- Out of mere curiosity...
Here, for example.
So...
Gregory Lukyanovich Charnota...
Due to the lack of time and not to tire you, I will read selectively...
For example, the "merits" column, "Landowner.
In 1918 lost his manor and stud farm in Chernihiv.
Was at war, in theory healthy.
Sly.
Brave.
Lucky in cards." In total 107 merits.
And here is the "Weaknesses" column.
"Drinks...
Hot-tempered.
Straightforward.
Sly.
Brave."...
- Excuse me, you've just listed these characteristics as merits!
- That's right!
Sly and brave are both merits and weaknesses, depending on the situation.
Let me continue.
Thank you for entertainment and I won't keep you any longer.
I am sorry, I didn't keep within the time...
I strongly ask for 3 minutes more!
Here is this folder...
The title is "Paramon Ilych Korzukhin".
- Me?
- That's right.
Excuse me, Your Excellency.
- Well, it's curious.
- Allow me to skip the biography, I hope you know it.
- Yes, I do.
- Here is a curious article.
"Political beliefs".
It's written:
"Is not interested in politics..." Pardon...
It is generally known.
You do not need to be very perspicacious to...
- It's true, but I have a footnote in this article.
- What?
A footnote!
- Oh, a footnote!
- That's right.
Here it is:
"Connected with organizations aiming to restore the overthrown system in Russia.
In the recent months had 7 informal meetings with persons concerned."
- I did?
- That's true, you did!
"Finances a newspaper in Russian through men of straw... "
- Enough!
- Yes, sir!
- What can you do?
- Everything!
Shoot, cook halvah, shoe a stallion, open a safe, falsify documents, assist in childbirth, write an article... sing... in the choir.
Tenors sing: "Those evening bells..."
We sing: "Bom-bom..."
They: "Those evening bells...", and we: "bom-bom, how many a tale their music tells..."
Of youth, and home, and those sweet time...
Bom-bom...
Enough!
- Yes, sir!
- You moved me.
What is your full name?
- Just Tihiy.
You are an intelligent person, Mr. Tihiy.
I will think what I can do for you.
I need faithful people.
Remember - faithful.
- Allow me one question, Your Excellency.
- Please.
Do you have any doubts that I would have hanged you, if oredered respectively?
Not in the least.
I am certain of that.
- Your Excellency...
- Eat, eat!
- Thank you!
- Did you hear?
- Yes, sir!
Give me his file.
Tihiy.
Widower.
Flat-foot.
Excuse me!
We met in Sevastopol.
I am Tihiy, do you recognize me?
That's good.
May I sit down?
Well, well, quite unnecessary premature wrinkles...
I sympathize and understand you, it is not easy to lose everything.
But I am ready to help you.
Let me explain my unequivocal proposal.
I give you money.
Naturally, the question is what I want in return?
The answer is nothing!
A scrap of paper, a receipt...
Possibly some little services in indefinite future.
I emphasize:
of pure business nature!
Estimate the prospect.
Option one: you agree.
And you get all the components of the human existence:
oysters, cheese, Chablis, floral perfume, electric blue dress, restaurants with good service, healthy stomach,
Love - it's up to your judgement.
The second option - you refuse!
And what happens then?
Already mentioned wrinkles, quick aging of your body...
Only a miracle can save you from prostitution.
The proposal remains in force.
Viva, Your Excellency!
- Hello, rascal.
I am surprised with your radical manners.
Although my proposal applies to you as well.
Think, I do not hurry you up!
- There's nothing to think about!
I am an official...
I am an official, I am authorized by...
Careful, stairs!
Damn it, I almost drowned!
Viva, Your Excellency.
- Hello, Lyusenka.
- Why are you so early?
If I were you, I would gad about until night.
All the more, it's boring at home.
Neither food nor money...
Would you please give me the money!
Lyusenka...
The catastrophe happened.
Where are the cartridges?
I sold them... sold...
I mean, wanted to sell...
I wanted to sell and put them in the box...
And I left the box in the Grand-Bazar... and..
- It was stolen.
- Yes...
Well then...
Grisha, do you know who you are?
- Who?
- The lowest rascal!
- Shame on you...
- I am not ashamed!
- Shame on you!
- I am not ashamed, because the box was bought with my money!
- You are my wife... and money is ours!
The husband's money is from devils sale, and the wife's money is from selling very different things.
- What did you say?
- Stop fooling around.
Last week I went to sing psalms with the Frenchman.
Did anybody ask me where I got those 5 liras?
We have lived through the whole week with this money, you and me, and Serafima!
Lyusya!
Overhearing doesn't suit you, Serafima Vladimirovna.
Do not worry, Lyusya, I will work it off.
Without nobleness, please.
Tomorrow the owner turns us out from the hotel, we have nothing to eat, everything's sold.
He drove me to it!
Tell me - did you play it through?
- I did.
- For shame...
Understand my position, I can't sell the devils.
I was at war!
So you were with the Frenchman?
You lie, lie!
Go to hell!
Don't be offended with my words.
I won't stay with nothing to eat, I don't have principles!
I will not eat at your expense.
Stop it...
He'll sell the revolver.
- Well no...
I will sell my pants, I will sell everything, but not the revolver.
I can't live without revolver.
- It replaces your head!
Then eat at women's expense!
Lyuska, don't tempt me!
Only try to lay a finger on me, I'll poison you at night.
What are you planning there?
Wait for me.
But, please, without fighting.
Sima!
Sima!
Simka, where are you going?
Come back!
Serafima!
Sima!
Simka!
What a filthy city!
Bugs!
Damn Bosporus!
And you...
I hate you!
And myself, and all the emigrants!
Damned outcasts, I hate you...
- Silence!
That's it...
I've drained my cup of Constantinople...
Enough!
Farewell, Gregory Lukyanovich.
Our living together is over.
I wish you all the best.
Where are you going?
To Paris.
Paris...
Paris!
Away!
And wherever should I go now?
Whether to Madrid?
The Spanish city...
I haven't been there..
But I can bet it's a god-forsaken hole...
Damned city!
Thank you, general.
Give me...
I am a General, I want to eat...
Give me...
Stop, stop tormenting my soul...
Privatdozent...
Hello!
Hello...
You've grown old...
And we thought you'd stayed there...
Where have you been?
Half a year in camps, then I had typhus, and now in Constantinople.
I've been looking for you, Gregory Lukyanovich.
Do you remember, Serafima Vladimirovna left Crimea with you?
She was sick...
Is she dead?
- No, she got well, she's alive...
She is here.
- Where is she?
Here, nearby, she'll come soon.
She went to Pera...
- Where?
To hunt men!
To Pera!
What are you staring at, docent!
We're starving.
We've hit the bottom, Seryozha...
And today she broke down and went to Pera.
- How come?
- She went for the first time.
And I am drawn to Madrid...
I dreamt all night about Madrid...
Where are you going, docent?
Wait, Seryozha...
Pardon...
I found it!
- Where?
Here.
Faster!
Stop!
- What?
- Hold it.
- Yes, yes...
- Hello, Sergey Pavlovich.
- Hello, professor.
Would you please guard it!
- Quick!
Quickly, quickly!
What?
- Haven't you seen a couple?
...
- Get away!
Go up!
Quickly, quickly...
- It's locked!
- Let me, docent!
Gregory Lukyanovich, let me introduce you...
Out!
Away!
Take my purse...
I have a wife, children, a shop...
- Away!
Mr. Greek...
I ran and swam, only to find you...
I was in the hospital, my head was shaven...
What are you doing here?
Answer me!
Who gave you the right to reproach me?
I love you.
"Averov..."
I am sorry.
Let's go, docent.
Thank you, Alexander Nikolaevich.
It is time to go home.
All the best.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
- Have a cheburek.
- Thank you.
Farewell.
Here...
Well, hello, Khludov.
Hello, Gregory Lukyanovich.
I see you're now a civilian, like me.
What, no result today again?
No.
Today I found her.
Found her...
Khludov, can you do me a favour?
Only you can help me now.
Find her.
- Where?
I do not know.
Wherever you want.
Here, in the city, find her!
Give her to eat and don't let her go until I come back.
- And you?
- I will go to Paris and find Korzukhin.
He must help her.
It was him who destroyed her...
Just don't let her go.
She won't escape from me.
Not without reason one orderly said:
"No one can go past you".
God, pray for him.
Take it.
Sell it in case of extreme need.
And I will go with you.
I need to go somewhere.
I was thinking of Madrid, but...
Paris sounds somehow more decent.
- It's time.
- Let it be Paris.
What?
- Let's go...
- I will show you...
Good morning, gentlemen beggars!
As they say, bonsoir!
Let me introduce myself:
Major-General Charnota!
Wait.
Pardon, bonjour!
You see...
Would you lend me your trousers, please?
Translate it.
- Let's go!
- This was expected.
Well, let's try our luck wearing dishabille.
I wish you good alms, gentlemen beggars!
I will be back.
At night there will be another cruise from Marseilles.
I will wake you up.
For how long are we going to go there?
It doesn't have sense.
They will not return.
- I will wake you up.
- Fine.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Roman Valerianovitch.
Roman Valerianovich!
Let me go!
I can't live here any more.
Please!
I am tormented, I cannot sleep, I am afraid of you!
I hate you!
Let me go...
I have sold a ring...
There is money.
I invite you!
Cossacs dzhigit cavalry group under the direction of captain Golovan!
Captain Golovan!
Captain!
Yes, Your Excellency!
- Bring Krapilin to me!
- What's wrong with you, Roman Valerianovich?
- Bring Krapilin.
- Yes, sir!
Are you mad, Your Excellency?
Please.
Yes.
All of them are here... around me.
I have put up with it.
But I don't understand...
How could you escape the long chain of sacks and pillars?
How did you escape from the eternal rest?
There were a lot of you, you were not alone!
Pray for him, Lord.
Say something, soldier...
Don't be silent!
And what happened then?
Just darkness, nothingness, heat...
And you, hunter, followed me to this far-away land and caught me into the sack!
- Again?
What is it?
- Who are you talking to?
- To no one!
I just have the habit of muttering while asleep.
I was sleeping.
Captain!
Captain!
- Don't, Roman Valerianovich!
Please!
You behave outrageously again, Your Excellency!
You've spoilt my life, now you're spoiling the performance!
Can't you calm down!
- Silence!
I will finish you, Your Excellency!
Take him!
Your Excellency!
It's a shame to sully the General's rank, our Homeland's begging for salvation...
Calm down, gentlemen, sit dowm, the show goes on.
- It's here.
- Listen, give me your pants!
- And what will I do?
- Yes, true...
Go, I'll wait here.
Antoine!
It seems you didn't understand anything, Antoine!
That's right, Paramon Ilych, I didn't.
How do you say "that's right" in French?
I do not know, Paramon Ilych.
You are a lazy person, Antoine!
What are you doing right now?
Jo...
Je, Antoine, je!
- Jo...
- Je!
Jop...
Je!
I am cleaning the knives, Paramon Ilych.
How do you say "knives" in French?
Le..
...couteau?
Correct!
Study, Antoine, study!
Receive.
I am in.
Yes, sir!
Mr. Golubkov!
What can I do for you?
You do not recognize me.
We met a year ago.
In Crimea, on the station...
When your wife was detained.
Serafima Vladimirovna is in Constantinople now.
She is on the verge of ruin.
- On the verge of what?
Excuse me, firstly I have no wife and I do not remember any station.
You do not remember the frost... during the capture of Crimea?
Unfortunately, I don't.
You are mistaken.
You are Korzukhin.
You were in Crimea, I recognize you!
Indeed, I've been living in Crimea for some time.
When those mad generals were raging there.
But, you see, it was right then that I left Russia, and I don't have and don't intend to have any connections with it.
And I must tell you that a Russian emigrant lives in my house as a secretary.
And this creature moved my heart so much, that I intend to marry her soon and therefore I find all the conversations about some so called wife of mine, very unpleasant.
I understand, she hinders you.
Very well then...
Suppose, she is not your wife, better still.
But you should pull her out of poverty!
Lend me one thousand dollars...
I swear, I will pay you back!
I will work it off, it will be my life goal...
I though so, that a conversation about a mythical wife will lead exactly to dollars.
A thousand, didn't I mishear?
- A thousand.
Tell me, do I look insane?
- No, it's rather me who looks insane.
- In that case, Mr. Golubkov,
I think you will not insist on my giving a thousand dollars to an unknown person.
- No, I will not insist...
But I want to tell you, that you are the most terrible person
I have ever met.
Farewell.
General Charnota!
Paramosha, my dear...
Hello, my dear Paramon...
- Have we met?
- Paramon, what are you, mad?
What about Sevastopol?
- Yes, yes, of course...
Have we drunk brotherhood?
- If we have met, shure we have drunk!
- Excuse me, you seem to be wearing underpants!
- And why does it surprise you so?
I think I am not a woman, who can't wear this piece of clothing.
Were you walking around Paris like this?
No, I was walking around Paris wearing trousers, that I took off in your hall.
What a silly question, Paramon!
What's wrong with you, Paramosha?
What?
Your countrymen, who fought with Bolsheviks for you, are standing before you,
And you refuse to give them a trifling amount!
Can you imagine that Serafima is starving in Constantinople?
I suppose, this topic is exhausted.
You know, Paramon, a sinner as I am,
I would join the Bolsheviks on purpose, just to shoot you down.
I would shoot you down and right after that would leave them.
Wait, what's this?
Cards?
Do you play cards?
Yes, imagine, I like to play nine very much.
Well, then play with me!
You see,
I like to play for cash.
Golubkov, come here!
Give me Khludov's medallion!
Take it!
I am leaving.
You aren't going anywhere.
I won't let you!
Lie there on the sofa!
Sleep!
A decent thing...
Well...
Ten dollars.
Paramon, this thing is worth a lot more.
But I see you don't understand anything about these things.
Well, come on!
For how much?
- For these ten dollars.
A nine.
I want to win back.
More?
Yes.
Doublure.
Paramon...
- Win back again.
- Again...
Another card?
- Yes.
Seven.
Eight!
In this case I want to win back again.
- What's your slave's name?
- Antoine.
Anton!
Anton, bring something, my dear...
And snacks.
Card?
Another?
For how much we play, excuse me?
Naturally for the entire amount.
One hundred and sixty.
I begin?
Doublure again.
Doublure what?
Ah, doublure..
In cash, please.
Gregory Lukyanovich, quit it, quit it right now!
Come to your senses, let's go away!
You're a gambler, Paramosha!
That's what ruins you!
Seven.
Seven and a half...
I am joking - eight!
Come on!
More?
Mine..
- How so?
- Well, it's mine...
"Storm-clouds hurtle, storm-clouds hover;
Flying snow is set alight
By the moon whose form they cover, Blurred the heavens, blurred the night
We can't whirl so any longer!
Suddenly, the bell has ceased,
Horses halted...
- Hey, what's wrong there?
Who can tell!
- a stump?
a beast?"
...a stump?
a beast?
Sorry.
- 50, 60...
- Yes, that's all.
Paramosha, this is mine...
Don't you have a newspaper... to wrap...
It's a pity that underpants don't have pockets.
I don't have a newspaper.
Give me the cash, I will draw you a check!
- Will you?
Paramosha!
What's wrong with you, Paramosha...
- I don't have a newspaper...
- Do you think any bank will give...
- I don't have a newspaper...
- ...20 thousand to a man without trousers!
No thanks...
So you don't have a newspaper, Paramosha?
No... at least leave me this...
Strange...
I won so much money.
Then why am I so sad?
Golubkov!
Where is Golubkov?
- There he is.
- Where?
There.
Golubkov!
Paramosha, behave yourself!
Privatdozent, why am I so sad?
Buy the medallion back from him!
- Here...
- Buy it back, we must return it!
300 dollars!
- Here you are.
- And now let's leave!
For God's sake, let's leave now, you hear?
Paramosha...
We've stayed too long.
We're leaving.
We're leaving now, Paramosha...
That's it, it's time...
No!
I am sick, I have a fever...
You took an advantage of my fever...
My fever...
- Wait, Paramosha.
Give me my money back!
My money back!
- What's wrong with you, Paramosha?
Return my money, I'll give you 500 dollars each as a compensation.
What are you saying, my dear...
Don't make me angry, don't spoil such a nice evening!
Charnota, let's go, for God's sake.
Let's go.
- Bye, Paramosha.
- I'll call the police!
You robbed me, you poisoned me...
Well, Paramosha, pray to your Parisian Virgin Mary.
Antoine, stop teasing the dog, you don't let me sleep!
You are not in the army, Antoine!
My God...
Not in vain I dreamed of cockroaches...
Let's introduce ourselves, gentlemen.
General Charnota.
Well, gentlemen, what happened?
He won my money and I want him to give it back!
- No, it is impossible.
- Why impossible?
You played it over.
You aren't a child, there's nothing to do.
Gentlemen, the money belongs to you and there is no misunderstanding.
Go, my boy, go to sleep, you have shadows under the eyes...
A shadow or shadows?
Shadows...
Paramon...
Paramon, wait!
Paramoshka, you...
Bon matin, madame!
Not bon matin, au revoir...
Whatever...
Adieu.
Let's go, Golubkov!
- Not here, there.
- It's a window.
- Go right now.
Farewell, Lyuska.
Charnota, buy yourself pants!
Rascals!
Your master is being robbed, and you...
I am sorry, Your Excellency, I thought you were having a confidential meeting with general, discussing the salvation of our Homeland...
Fools!
I'll fire you, parasites!
Lock all the doors, don't let them out!
Yes, sir!
Good morning, gentlemen beggars, it's me, General Charnota!
Pour out, servants!
I like you all...
- Let's go!
Gentlemen, it would be my pleasure to give you all warm pants with stripes...
But alas, they don't sell them in this filthy city...
- Stop it, let's go!
- Silence, privat.
I am sad.
I like you, gentlemen!
I got huge aims today, I'm rich!
But somehow I am sad.
I have never been so sad...
Even when I was shot at...
It has nothing to do with trousers...
- Where are you going?
Stand up!
- Wait, wait...
When they lead you to heaven,
I will be sitting there at the gates and there will be a hat before me.
I'll be sitting there for a 1000 years and begging... and nobody will give me alms, nobody!
Even the best of us
- God.
If you want, you can get everything - money, fame, power...
But not Homeland, gentlemen...
Especially such as mine...
- It is time!
- Wait!
Russia does not fit, does not fit into a hat, gentlemen beggars!
Wait...
Does not fit into a hat...
Farewell, gentlemen, see you in heaven!
Servant, serve them until morning!
- Let's go, you're drunk...
Leave me!
See you in heaven!
Come to your senses!
The Bolsheviks will meet you with cannons!
They will bury you alive!
There is no reason to crawl on your bellies, we need to regain power, and return on horseback!
I am sick of feeding foreign bugs!
Hey, you!
Shut up!
We come to meet, and come again...
It's in vain.
They won't come back.
They let cossacs return.
- What?
I say, they let cossacs return home, to Russia...
That's it.
We haven't met them today.
Brothers, we need to go home, go to Russia...
They gave land to farmers!
It's time to plough the land!
Enough fighting, it's time to go home!
Sergey Pavlovich!
Why are your silent?
Hello, Sima!
Hello, Serafima!
Well, everything is all right?
You love her, sincere man.
Goodbye now.
- Allow me to ask you where to?
There'll be a steamboat.
I will go with it.
To Russia.
Come with me, Charnota!
What, are you going to be held responsible?
Then know, Roman, that you will live exactly as long as it takes to bring you from the steamboat to the nearest wall, and with the strongest guards, not to let them to tear you to pieces on the way!
You have left a big memory of yourself, brother!
And along with you they will take me, a God's servant.
I am responsible for many things as well.
Although I don't have pillars in the home front.
- You will be sad, Charnota.
- Eh, Khludov...
I've been sad since long ago.
I didn't run from death.
But I won't look for it either.
- Farewell.
- Farewell!
Let's go.
The cabman won't wait for us.
Go!
Go!
- Sensation!
- Stop!
Sensation in Constantinople...
Well...
Our ways part here.
The fate separated us.
Some - into the loop, some - to Petersburg...
And where will I go?
Who am I now?
Now I am the Wandering Jew!
I am Ahasver...
The Flying Dutchman I am!
I am a demon... of dogs..
Ladies and gentlemen, the deseased Empress' favourite entertainment...
Hello again.
Arthur, the cockroaches' Czar!
Hat...
Take off the hat!
To all Janizary's rounds!
Sensation, sensation!
The fortune is bet on the favourite!
Don't miss your chance, gentlemen!
Catch the fortune, ladies, now or never!
Janizary is no longer with us, Your Excellency, his grandson is working
- Janizary III.
The most brilliant kid.
Not a cockroach, a lion, an Orlov Trotter!
Shall we begin?
Yes, sir!
Attention!
Achtung!
The favourite, Janizary's grandson, is on the first track -
Professor Gore!
We've been living here.
Khludov - here, and I - there.
Now it's your room.
You won't go anywhere now.
I won't let you.
Make yourself comfortable.
- Yes, thank you...
Serafima Vladimirovna.
- Yes, Sergey Pavlovich?
I came to say goodbye to you.
Do you hear me?
Yes, Sergey Pavlovich.
I am going to Russia.
Farewell.
I won't be able to explain you...
Sometimes I dream that I am still alive, that I am there, in Russia, in the whirlwind of great events... and hopes...
I believe my truth is there.
Do you hear me?
- Yes, Sergey Pavlovich...
- And I am not here.
I have never been here, I stayed there.
Now I am just coming back to myself...
Do you hear me?
Yes...
Farewell...
Farewell.
Forgive me...
Sergey Pavlovich!
Go on!
Sergey Pavlovich!
Seryozha...
- I forgot...
- What?
- A face.
- What face?
Of the boy in Sevastopol, on the last day of the escape...
On the pavement.
Everything else has confused, blended, gone...
But I remember him.
But I forgot his face.
My God...
What was it all that happened this year and a half?
Dreams?
Explain it to me - where,
why did we run?
Pillars on the platforms, black sacks, then heat...
I want to go to Liteyny street again, I want to see... snow again...
I want to forget everything as if nothing has happened...
Nothing has happened indeed...
It was a dream.
We will make it...
It will snow again... and will cover our footsteps...
I have remembered!
- What?
I've remembered his face.
What is this?
The horses are waiting for us.
It's time.
The End
ETERNAL GLORY TO THE FALLEN IN THE BATTLES OF THE GREAT PATRIOTIC WAR
MOSFILM
TEHERAN November 30, 1943
Gentlemen.
I have some good news for Marshal Stalin.
Today, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with the participation of the British Prime Minister and the US President, have decided to open a second front in the north of France
in May 1944.
I'm satisfied with that decision.
In my turn,
I'd like to inform Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill that by the beginning of landing operations in France the Russians will prepare a massive blow against the Germans.
To our victory!
ANKARA December 15, 1943
Mister Ambassador, these are the protocols of the Teheran conference.
Her Majesty's Prime Minister asked me to tell you that you may need this information in connection with the talks on Turkey's entering the war.
The President Inonu is already thinking about it.
The Prime Minister atso asked me to tell you that you should't really hurry up President Inonu.
If I understood the Prime Minister correctly, we shall need the million-strong, Turkish Army when the Russians will be approaching the Barlkans.
Let's have dinner together.
Elyas, I'll be back in about 2 hours.
BERLIN.
Reich Chancellery.
January 6, 1944
Where did you get these documents?
The valet of the British ambassador in Ankara is our agent.
He's von Papen's agent.
I don't trust von Papen.
In the materials of the Teheran Conference, there's the date of the Anglo-American troops landing in the north of France.
That is the opening of a second front.
You don't know Churchill.
He's an old master of dismformation.
These documents were thrust on you deliberately.
My Fuhrer, my information is different.
Your trustfulness has cost me very dearly.
We all but lost Italy.
You overlooked the plot against the Duce.
I don't believe these false documents.
Churchill will never dare land in Normandy!
LIBERATION
The great battle at Kursk proved to be one of the greatest battles of World War II.
Here, in the summer of 1943, the tank hordes of Fascist Germany had been routed.
From here, the German army, which had enslaved Europe had begun its retreat.
Our troops mounted a wide offensive in the right-bank Ukraine and were moving towards the state border of the USSR.

First Ukrainian Front February 29, 1944
Commander of the 1st Ukranian Front Arm Ganeeai Vatutin
What is the Polish for 'butter'?
Butter, Comrade General.
And 'meat'?
Meat.
And 'bread'?
Bread, Comrade General.
See?
Such a close language.
No need to learn it.
And what will be 'life' in Polish?
Zycie.
Zycie?
A little different, though.
But actually,it's the same.
Turn around.
The Germans!
Fire back!
Nikolai Fyodorovich.
Bad timing.
Didn't get a chance to start it.
Who will be commanding the front?
I've taken on command, Nikolai Fyodorovich.
Good luck to you.
Get well soon.
We'll meet in Poland yet.
- Zycie.
- What?
He keeps repeating that word, Comrade Marshal.
Zycie... means 'life' in Polish.
On March 4, 1944 the troops of the 1st Ukrainian Front under the command of Marshal Zhukov, the 2nd Ukrainian Front under the command of Marshal Konev
and the 3rd Ukrainian Front under the command of Army General Malinovsky had gone over to offensive actions.
In the course of the winter campaign of 1943-1944, the Red Army has won a battle for the Dnieper and right-bank Ukraine, shattered strong defensive fortification near Leningrad and in the Crimea,
overrun the enemy on the water lines of the South Bug, Dniestr, Prut, and is continuing the offensive in the conditions of springtime flooding.
However, our operational-strategy position, though advantageous, remains very critical.
The German resistant is increasing.
Our troops are tired, and they need a serious reinforcement in strength and materiel.
It's time-to go over to defensive actions.
We have gathened here, Comrade Zhukov, to talk about offensive, and not the deffensive actions.
I'm talking about the defease as a forced measure, Comrade Stalin.
This will allow us to better prepare are for the offensive.
We understand that, Comrade Zhukov, but today we must define the direction of the main blow of the summer campaign.
Let's listen to what the front commanders have to say.
Let's begin with the north.
Comrade Bagramyan.
We propose to strike a blow in the Baltic and cut off the Army Group North from the territory of Germany.
To this end, the 1st Baltic Front should attack alone the Western Dvina on the direction Polotsk
- Dvinsk and come out to Riga.
What does the General Staff to say to this?
The General Staff believes that in the Baltic we can't achieve suddenness while preparing a massive offensive.
In that sector of the front, the enemy
the well-deveoped railway and highway network.
At the same time, the terrain is unfavorable for our tanks - too many lakes and marshes.
It's a serious consideration.
For the tank armies' action on the direction of the main blow, we need wide expanses.
But Germans think the same way, Camrade Stalin.
What do you mean?
I mean the German military doctrine.
It's more expedient to use the tank armies in flat country.
That's what they expect from us.
And what do you propose?
I propose to strike the main blow where we're not expected.
In the boggy and wooded localities of Byelorussia.
It was Suvorov who once said "Where deer cannot ass, the Russian soldier will."
It's not the Devil's Bridge for you.
This is a modern-day war.
But the modern-day war means suddenness, Comrade Stalin.
Moreover, the General Staff supports the idea of a blow in Byelorussia.
Go to Byelorussia.
Study the situation on the spot...
Comrade Zhukov.
Yes, Comrade Stalin.
Come on!
Forward!
Come on!
Put me through to the regiment commander.
Now!
Comrade Captain, your wounded are behind the road.
- Well?
What?
- The regiment commander's on the line.
I can't take the height!
One more attack like this, and I'll lose all my men.
I know the order.
What?
What did he say?
I can't repeat it in front of women.
Your wounded are behind the road.
Can't you hear me?
Give me two men, and I'll carry the wounded out.
You want to die gallantly, don't you, Zoya?
Every man counts here.
- Comrade Captain!
- We'll carry them out at night.
I demand that the wounded be carried out immediately!
Go away, medical instructor!
Comrade Captain!
- What is it?
- Look.
That girl has gone crazy.
Guys, it's our Zoya!
Oh, she's the devil of a girl, they'll capture her!
- Cut the Germans off!
- But we may hit her.
Move over!
Why not attack them, Comrade Captain?
Or we'll lose the nurse.
Company commanders, come here!
Well, boys, you can only die once.
Get ready to attack!
Take our places!
Come on, guys!
Move it!
Communists, follow me!
Forward!
Forward!
To attack, follow me!
Forward!
You alive?
Good girl!
Comrade Marshal, I conduct reconnaissance in force in the Parichi direction.
The 2nd Battalion of the 36th Regiment has taken height 217.
Further advance has been checked by massive enemy fire.
The battalion suffered big losses.
- Stop the offensive.
- Yes, Comrade Marshal.
Transmit it - stop the offensive.
Pavel Ivanovich, tell me now.
Can we advance to Parichi?
What do you think of this direction?
Of course, it's a tempting direction.
That part of terrain is dry.
But the enemy is no fool, either.
He got astride the commanding heights and created strong defenses.
Advancing to Parichi means suffering great losses.
Yes, that's the right conclusion.
A blow towards Parichi will not be unexpected.
That's where they're waiting for us.
And how are things at your left flank?
The terrain here is hard for maneuver.
A lot of small rivers with wide flood-lands and boggy marshes.
- When have you been there?
- Last night.
Can we drive there?
I don't recommend it.
It's an open country covered by enemy artillery fire.
Better to go at night.
We'll go now.
Pavel Ivanovich, what are the German positions here?
There're no solid defense lines here.
The defense is built on the principle of isolated strong points on dry elevations.
I see.
What are you having?
The second front, Comrade General.
What?
Here, American Spam.
We nicknamed it second front here.
When are they going to open it, Comrade General?
Can't you cope by ourselves?
We ll cope alright, only as they say in our village,
"He who joins a fight last, will be boasting the most."
What is this you got?
These are wet shoes, Comrade General.
- What wet shoes?
- Made of bast.
For your feet not to sink into quagmire.
A smart idea.
If people can walk through a bog, then we'll find a way to get the materiel over, too.
- Anything's possible, isn't it?
- You mean tanks?
We'll try.
But what a surprise it will be for the Germans!
Yes, that's the place, Georgy Konstantinovich, eh?
MOSCOW, Kremlin, May 23 And our intelligence reports confirm our assumptions.
First, the enemy rules out the possibility of our offensive in this direction, and doesn't have here as strong defenses as in the other sectors.
Second, the bogs are passable for people, and if we lay roads of brushwood, for the materiel too.
That's why I propose to strike the main blow with the right flank of the front, with four field armies:
the 3rd, 48th, 65th and 28th in the direction of Bobruisk.
Still, you and Zhukov are dragging us into the bog, Comrade Rokossovsky.
It's not an easy way, Comrade Stalin.
But it promises success.
We have thought everything through, Comrade Stalin.
It doesn't look like you thought everything through.
Go out into the next room and think over your proposal once more, Comrade Rokossovsky.
In the meantime, we'll hear what Comrade Vassilevsky has to say.
As you know, a successful operation of liberating the Crimea had been conducted under the command of Comrade Vassilevsky.
After that, Comrade Vassilevsky, together with Zhukov, was elaborating the plan of the entire summer campaign.
While working on the plan of the summer campaign, Comrade Stalin, we first of all took into account the considerations of the front commanders present here.
The summer campaign of 1944 will be a system of major operations taking place on a vast territory from the Baltic to the Carpathians.
The plan of the summer campaign is drawn up in the following succession.
The first blow, in early June, well be dealt by the Leningrad, and then Karelian Front in the direction of Vyborg.
These operations must lead th the routing of Finland and its exit from the war.
I wish you good luck,
Comrade Meretskov.
Thank you, Comrade Stalin.
Furthermore, the General Staff proposes to strike the main blow in Byelorussia.
This direction, Comrade Stalin.
has a number of serous advantages.
First, the shortest way to Berlin lies through Byelorussia.
Secondly, we'll be supported here by Byelorussian partisans.
As you know, Comrade Stalin, 270,000 partisans are operating in Byelorussia.
And, thirdly, after the liberation of Byelorussia, when our troops step onto the Polish land, they'll be welcomed by our friendly Polish people who have been struggling with the fascist occupants for 5 years.
All this convinces us that we've made the right choice.
Operating on the direction of the main blow will be the 3rd Byelorussian Front under General Chernyakhovsky, and the 1st Byelorussian Front under General Rokossovsky.
I suggest that we name the Byelorussian operation
Operation Bagration in honour of our fellow-countryman, the military leader who brought glory to Russian arms in 1812.
Go on, Comrade Vassilevsky.
After the start of Operation Bagration, when the German High Command realizes that's here, in Byelorussia, that the decisive battles take place, and shifts here their reserves from the south,
Marshal Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front will strike its blow in the direction of Lvov.
When, as a result of those powerful blows, the enemy suffers a defeat, we can unfold an offensive in the Balkans - in Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Hungary.
Does Comrade Zhukov wish to add anything?
Before the war, I served for a long time in the Byelorussian District, and I'm very much familiar with the theatre of operations there.
On that boggy and wooded terrain, it's impossible to use large masses of tanks.
That's why I propose to send into a breakthrough only tank corps, and not commit the four tank armies - the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th, which are stationed behind the right flank of the 1st Ukrainian Front.
Thereby, first, we'll mislead the enemy.
Knowing the location of those armies, he'll expect the main blow not in Byelorussia, but in the Ukraine.
Second, it'll be our powerful reserve in the 2nd stage of the offensive.
And, third, we'll securely provide for the left flank of General Rokossovsky's attacking armies.
I agree.
And now invite Rokossovsky.
Where, after all, are you going to strike the main blow,
Comrade Rokossovsky?
Through the bogs?
Yes, Comrade Stalin.
The direction of the main blow towards Bobruisk by the front's right wing.
I'm convinced that this is the right decision, Comrade Stalin.
The persistence of the Front Commander only proves that the organization of the offensive has been well thought out.
Give me your map, Comrade Rokossovsky.
On June 6, 1944, the Anglo-American troops landed in Northern France
WASHINGTON
I'm happy to have lived to see this day.
Even if it were the only thing I've done, my life would still have been justified.
Of course, there will be much discussion about the second front but the only thing that matters is that the second front has been opened.
Do you mean discussions with Churchill?
Why was he so insistent on the invasion through the Balkans?
It's this way, Eleanor.
To begin with, he wanted to drive a wedge into Central Europe, so that keep the Russians out of Austria and Romania, and, possibly, out of Hungary.
Anc this, of course, Stalin realized, and so I did.
And all the rest of us.
Maybe, he was right, and we should have struck a blow in the Balkans?
No, Eleanor.
This time we have chosen the shortest way to victory.
And that's about all at there's to it.
Churchill is too busy thinking about what would be after the war
and, naturally, what would the situation of Britain.
And I do not see why I should risk the lives of American soldiers for the interests of Britain on the European continent.
By the way, could you read me again today's telegram from Mr. Stalin?
I didn't quite understand it.
The summer offensive of the Soviet troops, organized according to our agreement at the Teheran Conference, will be launched by mid-June on one of the important sections of the front.
Important sections of the front?
Some kind of Asiatic cunning.
He doesn't believe anyone.
Not even his allies.
BERLIN, Reich Chancery June 12
What's this?
Stalin's telegram to Churchill.
It's a radio intercept, deciphered with the secret code that was passed over to us by our agent in Turkey.
His information about a second front proved true.
Yes, I remember.
Stalin writes to Churchill that the Russians' summer offensive will begin in one of the front's sectors.
Which one?
Keitel, what do you think?
My Fuhrer, apparently, it's the northern Ukraine.
General Model thinks so, too.
Yes, I'm sure that the Russians will direct their main blow against the Army Group North Ukraine.
Then they'll try to break through to Poland or turn to the Balkans.
Do you agree, Field Marshal Kluge?
I don't exclude the possibility of the Russian offensive through the Baltic, either.
Four Russian tank armies are concentrated facing my front.
That's 3,000 tanks.
There's no doubt that they will attack here.
It's quite realistic, my Fuhrer.
We should first expect the Russian offensive in the northern Ukraine.
BYELORUSSIA
Where's Kozlov?
Moving by the bank.
It's all right, Vassily Ivanovich, ahead of us are ours.
Secretary of the Minsk Regional Underground Committee of the Communist Party Kozlov
First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia Ponomarenko
Come in, Vassily Ivanovich.
How was your trip?
With no real difficulties, Panteleimon Kondratyevich.
Wall, let's begin, comrades.
Present here are the secretaries of Byelorussia's underground committees and the commanders of major units of Byelorussian artisans.
We realize that it wasn't so easy to gather you all here.
Nor was it easy for you to get here from the enemy's rear.
Yet we decided to do that.
My friends, that long-awaited day is near.
The Army will launch an offensive in Byelorussia.
June 20
On June 20, two days before the start of Operation Bagration, the partisans of Byelorussia attacked the enemy's railway communications along the whole frontline up to the state border.
3rd Byelorussian Front June 23
The long-range aviation is in the air.
Good.
The 2nd Air Army in readiness one.
The 3rd Air Army in readiness one.
The front's artillery is ready for action, Comrade Marshal.
The 5th Tank Army has taken its initial position.
- Put me through to Bagramyan.
- Yes, Comrade Marshal.
The 1st Baltic Front is ready, Comrade Marshal.
Operation Bagration is starting.
Do it, Ivan Khristoforovich.
Silence.
It's a pity to break it.
But we'll break it, anyway.
Commander of the 3rd Byelorussian Front Colonel-General Chernyakhovsky
Well, good luck.
We start, comrade generals.
Commander of the 303rd Fighter Aviation Division
Major-General Zakharov
Comrade General, Colonel Golubov is here af our command.
Come in, Anatoly Yemelyanovich.
Call here Commander of the "Normandy" Regiment.
"Tulip", "Tulip".
"Tulip".
To you from me, Tanechka.
Here, a daisy.
"Tulip", "Tulip".
"Tulip"?
Commander of "Normandy" is called to the general.
Commander of the Normandy Fighter Aviation Regiment Lieutenant-Colonel Pouillarde
Still nothing?
Nothing for three days now.
Roll up his bedding.
When shall we fly?
Soon.
It's your second shaving today, Baron.
I always shave before a fight.
I'd rather do it myself than let the Messerschmitts shave me.
You like it?
Not bad.
I hope to meet her after the war, Lieutenant-Colonel.
I need you, Jacques.
Hello!
Hello!
My pilots are wondering whether we came here for holidays.
Tell them not to worry, there'll be enough fights for everyone.
The task is like this, Comrade Pouillarde.
Your regiment, together with Golubov's regiment, will blockade Vitebsk from air.
Why not?
Such a charming blonde would look great smoking.
I noticed that the blonde girls smoke so nicely and enigmatically.
They hold a cigarette with the big and index fingers, like this.
Didn't you understand that the girl doesn't smoke?
You got it or not?
I didn't mean to offend the lovely mademoiselle.
The Soviet pilot is wrong if he wants to play the role of Othello.
Normandy, cut out this Othello thing.
It's war here, not theatre.
Comrade Senior Lieutenant, why are you quarreling?
He's very nice.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
My name is Jacques.
What's yours?
Ivan?
Sasha?
Pasha?
Not Sasha-Pasha, but Senior Lieutenant Zaitsev.
Anton, you'll fly with "Normandy" and maintain connection with me.
Right.
For luck.
Four Messerschmitts on my right.
I attack.
Othello!
A Messer is behind you!
Jacque!
Try to make it beyond the forest!
Jacque!
Jacque, get up, quick!
Hurry!
Hurry, come on!
Thanks, Othello.
Come on!
There we go.
Part Two 1st Byelorussian Front, June 24, 3 a.m. In the course of the past day, Operation Bagration was successfully developing.
Bagramyan broke the German front, forced the crossing of the Western Dvina and surrounded Vitebsk.
Chernyakhovsky is rapidly advancing, with his right flank, to the Berezina in the direction of Borisov.
Zakharov's 2nd Byelorussian Front has successfully broken the defenses and is moving to Mogilev.
The Byelorussian partisans have done a very good job.
Last night they paralyzed all the railways in the enemy's rear.
Well, now is your turn.
The direction of the main blow.
Judging by all reports, the Germans still don't expect our blow here.
I got everything ready, we only have to lay a corduroy road.
Why are you lingering?
We decided to drive in the piles during the artillery preparation, for the Germans not to hear it spot us and open fire.
Will you be able to do it in time?
We must.
Well...
As Bonaparte said, artillery, forward!
Come on, swam army, follow me!
Forward!
Everyone will get a medal!
Forward!
Follow me!
Forward!
Let Panov's corps go.
"Storm-5"!
Five!
Five!
Commander of the 1st Guards Armoured Corps Major-General Panov
Well, good luck, boys.
"Storm"! "Storm"!
First gear, 100-meter interval, don't lag behind.
Panov's tank corps made a gap in the enemy battle formations, and is rapidly moving to Bobruisk.
Exploiting Panov's success, the rifle corps of the 65th and 28th Armies and Pliev's group are pushing further north.
Sensing the threat of encirclement, the enemy wavered and, according to air reconnaissance, withdraws behind the Berezina.
What are you planning to do?
I want to throw in all reserves at the right flank and break through to Bobruisk from the east.
And simultaneously commit the Dnieper Flotilla.
It will strike at the enemy crossing points and secure them.
The Berezina River June 25, 8 a.m.
Brigade Commander of the Dnieper Military Flotilla
Captain of the Second Rank Lyalko
All ships get ready for a landing operation!
Field Marshal Model
Commander of Army Group Center Field Marshal Buchs
Field Marshal, the Fuhrer entrusted me with a difficult mission to inform you that I have to replace you at our post.
I already know that.
You're facing a more difficult mission to stop the Russian offensive.
What is the situation at this moment?
The armies of Bagramyan and Chernyakhovsky have occupied Polotsk, Vitebsk, Orsha,
and are pushing towards Vilnius and Minsk, going round the left flank of the main forces of Army Group Center.
Rokossovsky's troops have broken through to Bobruisk and trapped there 40,000 of our soldiers.
How could the Russians be so successful?
They acted against any military logic.
There's only one logic in war - knowing how to win.
Who commands the surrounded troops in Bobruisk?
- General Haman.
- I want to talk with him.
We'll break through, Herr Field Marshal.
We'll break the encirclement.
Give the soldiers all our stock of schnapps!
There's no way back to the city!
Set everything on fire!
Everything!
BOBRUISK June 28, 2 a.m.
What?
What are you doing?
You're my wife, and I'm not afraid of anybody.
I'm your field wife, as long as the war goes on.
And then you'll fall out of love with me and forget me.
Stop it, Zoya.
I'm happy I've found you at war, I wouldn't have found you otherwise.
I love you.
Division, with a volley, fire!
Fire!
All German counterattacks from the Bobruisk cauldron had been repulsed.
On June 29, our troops had liberated the city of Bobruisk.
Please accept this with our respect,
Your Excellency Comrade General.
Thank you.
But why Excellency?
If you're a general, it means you're excellent.
No, it's they who are excellent, our soldiers.
So we've learned how to beat Germans?
It seems so, father, we've learned.
After their defeat at Vitebsk and Bobruisk, the Germans, instead of retreating, engaged in prolonged frontal fighting.
And thus, I believe, they made a big mistake.
That's why you have a new task to carry out.
Panov's 1st Tank Corps should advance to Minsk, with the main forces concentrated on Slutsk and Baranovichi, in order to cut off the routes for the enemy's retreat.
Chernyakhovsky is already advancing to Minsk.
We must completely surround them as soon as possible.
So, by completely surrounding them and destroying their Minsk grouping, we'll end up the first stage of Operation Bagration.
And then we'll get down to the second stage.
We're speaking, comrades, about the 1st Byelorussian Front advancing in the direction Kovel-Brest and approaching Poland's border.
We begin the liberation of Poland, comrades.
We invited you in order to clarify the action of the 1st Polish Army.
What's the latest information about the Polish resistance?
Yesterday we received a coded message from Comrade Duniak.
He reports that five partisan brigades are advancing to the Vistula, to assist the Red Army in securing the crossings.
And now about the actions of the Polish Army.
We would like, Comrade Marshal, the Polish Army to be attacking in the first echelon.
Well, General, shall we show Germans that Poland is still alive and kicking?
We'll sure show them, Comrade Marshal!
But wait, before that I'll have to capture Minsk.
Tell Panov that the direction is Minsk.
South-west of Minsk 1st Guards Armoured Corps
Turn to north-west immediately, cut off the routes of retreat for the Germans, and join with the 3rd Byelorussian Front.
You have to complete the encirclement and not let the enemy out.
Roger.
I got you.
I'm 50 kilometers ahead of the infantry.
Am turning north-west.
Storm, we're turning north-westward.
The direction is Minsk Forward!
Who are you?
We're partisans from Kozlov's brigade.
Get on here.
Get on the tanks.
The infantry is just what I need.
Hey, boys, get on the tanks!
Move it!
Give it more life!
MINSK Cargo Station
Come here!
- How was the attack?
- Great
- And what's this?
- A pillow, Comrade General.
I got hold of it in a train car It's too hard here.
Want to travel in a sleeping car?
Forward!
Come on, forward!
Stop!
That's ours!
A bit longer, and we would have tousled one another.
- 3rd Byelorussian?
- Right.
Commander of the 2nd Guards Corps Burdeiny.
Commander of the 1st Corps Panov.
- So the Germans are in a circle?
- It's not a circle, call cauldron.
Let's embrace as a sign of our meeting, 1st Byelorussian.
Let's do it, 3rd Byelorussian.
Comrade Stalin, the surrounded east of Minsk 105,000-strong Germans grouping has been destroyed by the armies of Chernyakhovsky and Rokossovsky.
57,000 have been taken prisoner.
Our troops are advancing towards the Polish border.
According to our intelligence, Comrade Stalin, the Germans Command has transferred a great number of troops from the south to stop the gape, thereby weakening its grouping facing the 1st Ukrainian Front.
Marshal Konev proposes to take advantage of that and strike in the direction of Lvov and Sandomir, in accordance with the adopted plan.
Let Konev begin.
Comrade Antonov, what do the Germans report in their official summaries of operations in Byelorussia?
They claim they're withdrawing from Byelorussia according to their plan.
You're taking prisoners.
Yet neither the enemy nor the allies believe you.
Do not hide your prisoners.
Show them, let everybody see.
MOSCOW
BERLIN
Come for me in an hour.
Herr von Kluge, if I'm not mistaken?
You're right, Herr Field Marshal von Witzleben.
Come in, we've been waiting for you.
Your transfer to the West, is that a punishment?
What difference does it make?
The Furer still believes that we can be saved by replacing commanders.
I have a different opinion.
Have you already made our decision?
Are there resolute people?
Men of action?
There are.
And they're ready to resort to the extreme measures?
Certainly.
I'd like to meet with them.
Excuse me, I'll be right back.
This way, please.
I'm glad to see you, Colonel-General Bek.
Let me introduce to you our friends.
Doctor Carl Goerdeler.
Well, you've met before.
General Friedrich Olbricht,
Deputy Commander of the Reserve Army.
Colonel Count Claus von Stauffenberg,
Chief of Staff of the Reserve Army.
Our army can be proud of such officers.
Herr Field Marshal, may I introduce to you
Oberleutnant Werner von Haeften, adjutant to the Chief of Staff of the Reserve Army.
Please, sit down, gentlemen.
You've come just in time, Herr Field Marshal.
We're trying here to understand what's happening on the Eastern Front.
The front has been broken in many places.
The Russian offensive is going on so rapidly.
In Byelorussia, they advance 40 kilometers each day.
It seems they're already approaching the Polish borders.
In short, the Russian armies are at the gates to Europe.
Gentlemen.
There's only one thing left for us to do - remove Hitler and make peace in the West.
Then we'll be able to throw all our forces against Russia and fulfill our historic mission - stop Communism at German's gates.
You're still thinking in obsolete categories, Dr. Goeldeler.
The Communists have long been operating in Germany.
You think that the Communist Party of German doesn't exist, but they're a real force.
I don't picture the new Germany without Socialists and Communists.
That's why I insist on making peace with the West and the East.
Gentlemen, our political differences must not stand in our way.
Our objective is to save Germany from defeat.
Let's get down to discussing the details of Operation Valkyrie.
Please, Count Stauffenberg.
Gentlemen, please make no written notes.
The Valkyrie's signal will be passed to the troops by all means of communication.
It will transfer all the executive power to the army.
Following the Valkyrie signal, it is necessary to cordon off the government quarter in the Reich's capital, occupy government and party offices, the radio station the telegraph, arrest Goebbels.
Excuse me, Stauffenberg.
I agree to you proposals, but I would like to know one thing:
when you give the Valkyrie signal, will Hitler be alive?
I'm taking this action on myself.
On July I'll be at the Wolfsschanze to report on the situation of reserves.
July 20
Good morning, Werner.
Claus is expecting you in his study.
- Would you like to have breakfast?
- No, thank you.
Good morning, Herr Colonel Good morning, Werner.
Which briefcase is mine?
They'll identical, as diplomats say.
You're in a good humor, Werner, it's always easy to deal with you.
We're going to visit the Fuhrer.
How can we be gloomy?
I'll take this one.
The capsule is here.
And this is pliers to crush the capsule.
And remember, you'll have only 10 minutes, not a second more.
You think I don't want to live longer?
May God help us.
RASTENBURG July 20, 12 hours
Your passes, please.
Your special passes.
You can drive on.
The Fuhrer has changed the schedule.
Your report is not at 14 hours, but at 12:30.
And not in the bunker, but at the staff barrack.
Yes, sir.
Let's go.
Herr Field Marshal, excuse me, I forgot my cap.
Hurry up.
Hurry, Stauffenberg, we're being late.
I'm sorry, Herr Field Marshal.
At Brest, Field Marshal Model is successfully repulsing the attacks of Russian tanks.
Model was in a desperate situation, but he reduced the front and gathered all his forces in one fist.
Heusinger!
Why do you say nothing about my 21 generals who surrendered to Russians?
You think I'm going to bow my head in mourning?
They've saved their skins, but for us those cowards are dead.
They were paraded through Moscow's streets like wild animals.
And I'm happy about it!
They deserve it.
Go on, Heusinger.
The Russian troops forced a crossing of the Western Bug with heavy losses and entered the Generalgouvernement.
The Bolsheviks will never be in the Generalgouvernement!
I believe Model!
But we must help him with reserves.
Maybe Colonel Stauffenberg will report now on the situation with the reserve units?
No, only at the end of the conference.
What's the situation in the north, Heusinger?
I have to make a call to Berlin.
Brandt, bring the maps.
- How long will it take now?
- Just seconds.
To the airfield.
Let us out It's the Fuhrer's order!
By the Commandant's order, the exit is forbidden.
Give me Field Marshal Keitel now!
It's Stauffenberg They don't let me out.
And I got the Fuhrer's order to fly to Berlin immediately.
Open up!
BERLIN 16 hours 40 minutes
The bomb detonated.
The briefcase was at the Fuhrer's feet He just couldn't survive.
Lieutenant Roering, get in touch with Leipzig and Munich.
The Operation Valkyrie is on.
And now let's go to Fromm.
Commander of the Reserve Army Colonel-General Fromm
Herr Colonel-General, Hitler has become a victim of assassination.
Hitler is alive.
I've just spoken to Keitel.
He told me about the explosion at the Wolfsschanze, but Hitler wasn't killed.
Keitel is lying, as usual.
Hitler is dead.
I planted a bomb under him.
You must shoot yourself now.
Colonel-General Bek, what's going on?
It's Operation Valkyrie.
But it's a plot!
Colonel-General, we begin a struggle for the new Germany.
Do you want to join us?
You're talking to the future head of state.
Future, but not present.
Hitler is alive.
I'm carrying out his orders.
Gentlemen, you're under arrest.
I have to arrest you, General.
What is this?
Arrest this man.
He betrayed our nation at the most critical moment.
You've gone too far.
You'll be sorry about that.
To the basement!
Check if Goebbels has been arrested.
Major Remer's guard battalion has been sent for him.
I need to see Dr. Goebbels.
- Who are you?
- I'm Major Remer.
On what matter?
I'll report to him.
I've got orders to arrest Dr. Goebbels.
Who wants to arrest me?
I received an order from Berlin's Military Commandant.
I'm a Reich Minister.
No one can arrest me but the Fuhrer.
The Fuhrer has been killed and, as the Military Commandant told me, the power has been transferred to a new Chancellor.
No, Major, the Fuhrer is alive.
I'll put you through to him on the phone.
Stay here.
It's Goebbels.
I wish to speak to the Fuhrer.
This oak table saved me from the blast.
I take it as a manifestation of God's will that direct me in pursuing the aim of my life.
It's a real miracle, my Fuhrer.
I know it was the generals' conspiracy.
I've never trusted them.
When I gain victories, the take the credit for them, and in case of a failure, they accuse me of it.
This criminal clique of traitors must be ruthlessly exterminated.
My Fuhrer, Reich Minister Goebbels wants to speak to you urgently.
I'm listening, Goebbels.
My Fuhrer, I have here Major Remer, commander of the guard battalion, who got orders from Berlin's Military Commandant to arrest me.
Get Major Remer on the phone.
Major Remer is listening.
I cancel the military commandant's order.
Is it understood?
I promote you to the rank of colonel and appoint you Commander of Berlin garrison.
Immediately arrest all traitors and betrayers who tried to stab the great German in the back.
If anyone resists, shoot them on the spot.
Act in my name, Colonel Remer!
Yes, my Fuhrer.
An appeal to the German people.
Hitler is dead.
We want to stop this senseless war
and achieve a just peace.
Has Goebbels been arrested, Herr General?
I think he has been by now.
How are things going?
The approaches to radio stations are guarded by the fortified SS details.
Take the radio station by storm.
The new head of state Bek is to go on the air now.
It's Paris.
Put me through to Field Marshal Kluge.
Bek speaking.
I'm informing you that Hitler has been killed.
I received news to the contrary from the Wolfsschanze.
Kluge, make up our mind!
The fate of Germany and Europe depends on you now.
I'll call you again after dinner.
It's just like Kluge.
Hands up!
Claus, are you all right?
Your mutiny has failed.
It's not a mutiny.
We were saving the future of Germany, Major.
I'm Colonel Remer.
Oh, you're colonel.
If you have at least some honor left...
It's not for you to speak of honor.
You've betrayed the Fuhrer.
Even if he escaped death now, he'll be executed anyway.
It's you who will be executed.
Take everybody to the courtyard.
Leave General Bek here.
Bek, you were my teacher once.
I had poor pupils among others.
We have no time for puns.
This is all I can do for you.
Would you like me to pass anything on to your family?
No, nothing.
My wife knows everything.
Help this old man.
I announce the court martial verdict.
For activities constituting high treason and damaging the Fuhrer... sentenced to execution by firing squad are
Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim,
Infantry General Olbricht,
this colonel and this lieutenant, whose names I don't even want to remember.
Germany will remember our names.
Carry out the verdict immediately.
Lieutenant Schade, do it.
My Fuhrer, the conspirators who made an attempt at your life have been executed.
The retribution has been done.
Unfortunately, Stauffenberg has escaped the noose.
Stauffenberg!
For how long I'll be hearing that name?
I ordered to send his wife and children to the camp.
Everybody, everybody must forget him.
Himmler, dig him up from his grave, burn him and scatter the ashes.
There must not be either his name or his grave.
My Fuhrer, you once mentioned Stauffenberg's family.
Yes, the ancient Germans had a fine custom of blood feud.
We should apply that custom to the Stauffenberg family.
He must be destroyed, Himmler!
Yes, my Fuhrer.
I want to introduce to you the new Chief of the General Staff,
Colonel-General Guderian.
General Guderian is a prominent theorist in panzer forces.
In the late 20s he finished a tank school in Russia.
He knows about the Red Army's tactics as no one else.
Come on, Guderian, make your report.
My Fuhrer, now is the time when you must receive only absolutely accurate information.
Any attempt to smooth the situation will lead to tragic consequences
I'll begin with the losses.
In the last three months our losses amounted to 1 million 200 thousand men.
I have 5.5 million under arms and 2 million reserves in the rear.
This is a great force.
I shall stop the Russian offensive.
I won't let them into Europe!
LONDON
To Prime Minister Mr. Churchill, personally.
Sir, the latest news from Germany.
Unfortunately, the plot against Hitler failed.
The conspirators have been executed.
The top officers have been arrested.
Did you say "unfortunately"?
Yes, sir.
Don't you think that success of the conspiracy would have made headway?
Headway?
You mean peace, perhaps?
Maybe so, sir.
If the conspirators had killed Hitler, it wouldn't have served, our purposes.
And I trust that Stalin doesn't want it, either.
Only fools would accept peace when the smell of victory is in the air.
Just imagine that the end of the war would see us in Normandy and Stalin somewhere at Poland's border.
By the way, about Poland.
Is there anything new there?
Russian troops are advancing to the border.
Now here you can say "unfortunately", sir.
I foresaw a situation in Teheran.
And now we're faced with the most serious problem.
From Marshal Stalin for you, sir.
Was there no letter?
I noticed long ago that Uncle Joe adores his own portraits.
It's not as simple as all that.
There must be something behind it.
Somewhere he's got the better of me.
Oh yes, of course, be Russian troops have crossed the Polish border.
THE WESTERN BUG
Frankly speaking, I'm overcome with emotions.
For five years I've been thinking of the day when we approach the Polish border.
We've come to the border at 15:36 Let s remember that, General.
I'll remember that hour, too, Comrade Generals.
Forward!
To Poland!
The army of the Soviet people, together with the soldiers of the Polish Army, had stepped on the long-suffering Polish land.
The liberation of the enslaved Europe had begun.
Still ahead there were
Warsaw and Budapest,
Belgrade and Sofia,
Vienna and Bucharest,
Bratislava and Prague.
Berlin was ahead!

## [Whistling]
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi, Milt.
How come Ted's gettin' so much mail lately?
I guess it's in response to that editorial he did last week against junk mail.
He told people they could send in for printed copies.
- You really wanna help stamp out junk mail?
- Yeah?
- Don't send out copies ofTed's editorial.
- [Laughs] Yeah!
Oh, no.
Not another rejection.
- Yeah, I guess.
- Oh, poor Murray.
He's been writing this play for three years.
You'd think Broadway producers would be sensitive enough to do more than just stick...
- mimeographed rejection slips in when they send it back.
- What do you mean?
You know, something like a nice, handwritten note saying,
"Good work, Murray.
Nice try.
Love, David Merrick."
Well, when you shoot high like Murray's doing, you gotta expect to be disappointed.
- I know.
- What do you mean, you know?
You don't think I want to stay in the mailroom all my life?
- I've got my eye on another job.
- Oh?
What job is that?
- Yours.
- Oh.
Well, why not?
No reason you couldn't be associate producer.
Yeah.
I like the title.
The work seems easy enough.
I just don't know if I can take the cut in pay.
- Hi.
- What do ya say, Milt?
- Good morning, Mr. Grant.
- Hiya.
- What?
Another one, huh?
- Yeah.
- That's bad.
- I know.
Poor Murray.
No, not poor Murray, poor Lou.
You know he's been using our postage machine to mail these?
What's wrong with Murray wanting to be a playwright?
Look...
Murray is a terrific newswriter.
He makes Ted Baxter sound almost intelligent.
- What's wrong with doing that for a living?
- Well, nothing...
- What do you want to be?
- What do you mean?
I gather you have some ambition beyond that of associate producer.
Well, just, you know, wife and mother.
But other than that, I'm perfectly happy doing what I'm doing.
Then you're the only one in the office, perhaps the whole building, maybe even the world.
Everybody wants to do something else.
Look.
This is a little, uh, something from Ted.
It's a television series idea called The Ted Baxter Show.
- What's it about?
- Beats me.
All he submitted was the title.
I guess he thought I could just take it from there.
Here's an idea for an original musical comedy from Gordy the weatherman.
Fair and Warmer.
How is it?
Predictable.
And here's the worst one of them all.
My novel.
- Mr. Grant, you wrote this?
- Mm-hmm.
It's beautifully typed.
That's what the last publisher said.
I thought I was gonna be the new Norman Mailer or something.
- What's it about?
- It's based on my experiences... on IwoJima and Guadalcanal.
- Wow, that sounds exciting.
- You wanna read it?
Oh, yes, I'd really like that.
Twenty-two publishers used the word "dull."
How could your experiences on IwoJima and Guadalcanal be called "dull"?
Well, for one thing, I was there in 1958.
- Morning, Mary.
- Oh, hi, Murray.
Listen, I just, uh, made some fresh coffee over there.
Why don't you go have a cup?
Gee, you know, we never see enough of each other.
How's Marie and all?
She's, what, seven months along now?
Why don't you come over to the house for dinner, say, Thursday?
- Where is it?
- On your desk.
- Oh, boy.
- Aw, come on, Murray.
Listen.
You know how many times Noel Coward's first play was turned down...
- before it was finally produced?
- How many?
l-I don't know.
But I'll bet it was lots of times.
- Not this many.
- [Package Thuds]
Murray, why do you wanna do that?
It just seemed like the appropriate thing to do.
That's where it belongs.
It does not belong there.
I happen to like your play.
Then I'm glad they sent it back.
You can read it again.
I'll tell you one thing.
That is the thickest rejection letter I've ever gotten.
- Murray...
- Go ahead...
No, don't go ahead.
I know them by heart.
"Our schedule is full," or " We are not in the market for any new productions."
How about, "And we are delighted to do your play"?
Yeah, that one too.
What?
"And we're delighted to do your play.
"We plan to go into rehearsal within the next few weeks.
"Enclosed are the standard Dramatist Guild contracts for your signature.
"The Twin Cities Playhouse is proud to have a play of this caliber... by a promising new local playwright as part of our 17 th season."
- Oh, Murray!
- Mary!
[Chuckling]
Wait a minute.
I don't remember submitting my play to the Twin Cities Playhouse.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- How do you suppose they got it?
- [Ted] Hi, guys.
- Hi.
- Say, Murray, I just read this item I think we should use.
It's about a man who went on television to make a plea to send turkeys to convicts.
For pets or for dinner?
I don't know.
I think it was in "Ar-kansas."
Yeah, I think they're doing the same thing in Arkansas too.
How do you like that?
It's spreading from state to state.
Speaking of turkeys, uh, Ted, last year when you acted in that production...
- of The Man Who Came to Dinner, what was the name of that theater group?
- Ah.
The Twin Cities Playhouse.
I'm their resident star.
I'm the only really big name they've got.
Ted, did you know they're gonna do Murray's play?
Oh, are they?
Good.
I was hoping they might.
I submitted it to them.
- Where did you get your hands on it?
- In the mailroom.
I accidentally came across it when I was going through my fan mail.
I was halfway through it before I realized it was your play.
- You read the whole script?
- Well, most of it.
I'm surprised it held your interest that long.
- It doesn't have any pictures.
- Come on, Murray.
The point is, Ted submitted it, and they're gonna do it.
That's the important thing.
It's important to me too.
You see, I'll undoubtedly play the lead.
If you'd like some tickets, Murr, I might arrange it for you.
Maybe he won't be too bad.
The star of the play that I worked on for three years... can't pronounce the names of states.
- Oh.
- [Knocking] - [Rhoda] Mary?
- Mary, you in there?
- Yeah.
Come on in, Rhoda.
Mary, I haven't seen you all week.
Where've you been?
Why don't you call me?
Do you care that I was worried sick about you?
Wait, don't answer.
I left home because of questions like that.
- Okay.
I won't answer.
- Good.
So, where have you been?
Tonight, for example?
I was, uh, at the theater.
They don't dress up much for that anymore, do they?
What'd you see?
- Well, I didn't exactly see anything.
- Bad seats?
No.
Oh, Rhoda, if I tell you, you'll make a whole big deal out of it.
I'll make a whole big deal out of it if you don't tell me.
That's true.
- Well, I'm in, uh... sort of a play.
- Oh.
I didn't tell you, because I knew if I did you'd start putting it down.
- Why would I do that?
- Because you're very, uh...
- Competitive?
- Well, yeah.
You're wrong.
I'm very pleased you got a big part in a play.
Terrific.
So what did you have to do to get it?
What happened is that Murray wrote a play about a newsroom, and there's a part in it, a girl who works there... who's single and whose name is Mary.
- Wonder why they thought of you.
- [Laughs]
Well, what's she like, this girl in the play?
Real cute and perky, right?
Uh, well, yeah.
Ted Baxter talked me into auditioning for the part, and I got it.
You know, it's really kind of fun.
I'm having a lot of fun with it.
You know, Mary, I've had quite a bit of theatrical experience myself.
Oh, really?
No, I didn't know that.
- Barbra Streisand and I went to high school together.
- Uh-huh.
We did.
Well, not exactly together.
She was there three years after I was.
But it was definitely the same high school.
Well, with all that, uh, theatrical background, then,
[Chuckles] you undoubtedly know it's not all tinsel and glitter, right?
I mean, Rhoda, look, I do have to memorize this play by day after tomorrow, so...
Oh.
You know, Mary, it gets, uh, lonely at the top.
At least that's what Barbs always used to tell me.
Rhoda, would you do me a favor?
Please don't start treating me like I'm in show business.
I'm still working in the newsroom.
This is just something I'm doing for fun.
- Okay.
Good night, Mary.
- Good night.
So what are you gonna change your name to?
- Good morning, Mary.
- Hi, Murray.
I thought rehearsal went pretty well last night, didn't you?
Well, it's coming along, except for Ted.
You know, you're really very good.
You've got a real flair for comedy.
Oh, thanks.
I had a little stage experience in college.
- Oh?
Like what?
- I was a homecoming princess.
- That's terrific training all right.
- Yeah.
Well, who needs experience when the part is that good?
- I mean, it's so funnily written.
- Hey, thanks.
- Hey, Murray?
- Hmm?
- Do you really think I'm that dumb?
- What are you talking about?
Well, it can't be a coincidence.
The girl I play has my name, she works at my job and is pretty much of a, you know, dum-dum.
Mary, it isn't you.
Sure, the character is somewhat like you in some ways.
But I made that stuff up about her being a dum-dum for the sake of the comedy.
Look, I'm a writer.
Some of it is like you and some of it isn't.
Wh
- What about the part about her being, uh, attra-attractive?
- That was based on you.
- Oh, yeah?
Thank you.
Murray.
I took the liberty of reading your script last night, and it's very good.
- Thank you, Lou.
- Very good.
However, I'm a little confused about the character... who's the head of the newsroom.
Believe he's called "Lou."
Every time he speaks, he seems to be yelling or shouting.
Does somebody around here named Lou do that?
Mr. Grant, Murray is a writer.
Some of it is like you and some of it isn't.
Oh, I see.
I was certain that was it.
I was also fairly certain that in your rewrite... you'd change the name of that character.
- You know, I intended to do that.
- I thought you'd might.
Thank you.
Oh, Murr.
Heh!
I'm having a little disagreement with the director.
He refuses to put up applause signs.
Uh, Ted, I don't think they have applause signs in the theater.
Then how do the people know when to laugh or applaud?
In your case, it might be a problem.
Another thing, Murr.
I think the script needs a little pinching up.
You mean "punching up," and who said it needs punching up?
My lines are a little weak.
Everybody's getting laughs but me.
Work on it, will ya, Murr?
I've gotta have it all put on cue cards pretty soon.
- If there is nothing else, I have work to do.
- About my part, the anchorman.
I'm sure it'd be easy to punch it up a little.
It's so rich with material.
Actually, it was the hardest part to write.
- Oh?
Why's that?
- Because, Ted, basically,
I consider anchormen to be colorless and dull.
Many of them are.
Work on it anyway, will you, Murr?
This must be fun for you, seeing your play come alive like this.
Come on, Murray.
There are some good points about Ted being in the play.
- Name one.
- Well, like, he got it produced for you in the first place.
- Name one.
- Come on, Murray.
It's your play.
People are finally gonna see it.
- You had to say that?
The fewer people who'll see it, the better.
- Oh!
Oh, Murr, I just remembered.
I think I have a marvelous surprise for you.
- You have a case of laryngitis coming on?
- Oh, no!
I have pulled off the coup of the year.
I arranged forJohn Stymetz to come see us opening night.
That's good.
At least we'll have one person there.
Happens to be the drama critic for the Times-Herald.
Pulled a couple of strings, and he's coming to review us.
Mary, remember how rotten I felt...
- when I thought my play was being rejected again?
- Uh-huh.
Well, looking back on that now,
I think it was a high point of my career.
Believe me, Mary, I'm not putting you on.
You were really good.
And you know how competitive I am.
I was just playing myself, Rhoda... cute and perky and dumb.
Hey, you want to know how good you were?
You were so good, I was filled with hate and envy.
- You're not just saying that?
- No, I mean it.
Thanks.
Boy, oh, boy.
That Ted Baxter?
- I now have a new standard for terrible.
Oh!
- Yeah.
I can't imagine what that critic is gonna say about it.
Maybe I better tell you now.
Sort of soften the blow.
I was sitting next to him, and he kept taking notes.
He was writing down words like "bad" and "awful"... and a couple I don't think they'll print.
No, Rhoda, I saw where you were sitting.
It was next to the director.
- Hey, will you give me a hand?
- Sure, whatever.
- Put this dip on the table.
- Mary, I think one is plenty.
From what I could hear, not that many people are gonna come to the party.
How'd you get stuck giving a cast party anyway?
In New York, we'd all go to Sardi's and wait for the reviews.
Hey, that's a great idea.
Let's go to New York and wait for the review.
- [Doorbell Buzzing]
- I'll get it.
- Thanks.
Hey, listen, no matter what you think, you were terrific tonight.
Coming!
Hi, Ted.
- We were just talking about you.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Ted, you've met my friend, Rhoda Morgenstern, haven't you?
- Yes, we've met.
- No, I don't believe we have.
I guess I've met you, but you haven't met me.
I guess that's it.
Oh, what did you think of me tonight?
Well, uh, Ted, you were, uh, just incredible.
- Oh, ho!
You're too generous.
- Yes.
Say, Mar, I lost track.
How many curtain calls were there?
- One.
- [Buzzing]
- That must be Murray and Marie.
- [Ted] I'll bet he's a happy man tonight.
[Sighs] Hi!
Author!
Author!
[Chuckling]
Where are your friends?
The ones that were with you at the theater?
- They had to go home.
- It was right after the first act.
Oh, what a darling apartment.
- I thought that the play went just great, didn't you, Mary?
- Oh...
Murray wrote quite a play.
I'm so proud of you, honey. [Laughs]
- And you were really just great, Mary.
- Well, with a part like that...
Oh, ho!
[Clears Throat]
Uh, what did you think of me?
You were just... unbelievable.
Thank you, thank you.
What did you think, Murr?
- You were...
everything I expected you to be.
- Thank you, thank you.
- Well, can I get a drink for anyone?
- Nothing for me, Mar.
- I'd love some milk.
- I'll have a double scotch.
- He's drinking for two.
- Oh!
The only good thing is, he or she wasn't here to see the play.
You know, I think it went awfully well tonight.
I'm sorry I forgot a few lines, but I think I ad-libbed my way out of it very neatly.
Ted, saying "excuse me" and walking off the stage... to check your script is not an ad-lib!
- By the way, Mary, where's Lou?
- He stopped off at the Times-Herald to pick up the reviews.
- Oh.
Is there such a thing as a triple scotch?
- Oh...
Say, Mar, you're too modest.
Why didn't you come out with me for that second bow?
Because I thought we were supposed to wait until someone applauded.
I'll get your milk.
- What are you doing in here?
- Trying to think of a new word to tell Ted... if he asks me again what I thought of his acting.
I've run out of noncommittal ways of saying "rotten."
Would you just get out there?
I invited you here because you're fun at a party.
I'm fun at a party where there's a lot of single men, and you do what my mother used to refer to as "mixing."
I am not fun at a party where one of the men is here with his pregnant wife, and the other one is going steady with himself.
Would you just please go out there and get the conversation started?
- But just don't bring up anything that has anything to do with acting.
- Gotcha.
Hi, all.
Did any of you know that I went to high school with Barbra Streisand?
Who?
Mary!
And then, when Barbra and I were in the tenth grade, we started harmonizing together.
That's when I told her. "Barbs," I said, "don't get your nose fixed."
And the rest, of course, is history.
Mar, what did you think of me?
Oh, Ted...
playing opposite you was just...
- [Buzzing]
- Thank you.
- Mr. Grant, how's the review?
- Well...
He loved it, right?
What'd he say?
What'd he say?
- I can't find it.
Where is it?
- Reviews aren't on the front page, Ted.
It's on page 26.
"Tragedy Strikes Twin Cities."
Wait a minute.
That's not it.
There.
- "Bomb Hits Minneapolis."
- That's it.
"There's been the atomic, there's been the hydrogen...
"and now, the worst bomb of them all,
"a play about a newsroom called All Work and No Play.
I'll vouch for the second part.
There's no play here."
How does he like it so far?
Mary, why don't you read the rest of it so Ted can hear it?
"Not everything about the evening was a catastrophe.
"The intermission was satisfactory.
- " The main character is a TV anchorman...
- I want absolute quiet.
If I were you, I'd ask for noise.
"played by an actor named Ted Baxter...
"who obviously has no conception of what a TV anchorman is like.
Maybe it was a mistake to make him pay for his ticket.
"As you all know, I have long been an opponent of nudity on the stage.
"However, in this case, I would make an exception.
"At least it would give the audience something to look at.
He didn't even like my suit.
As for the performance of Mary Richards..."
Oh... well...
Oh, ho-ho-ho, can't take a little criticism, eh?
Well, if Murray can take it and I can take it, you can take it.
Listen to this. "A s for the performance of Mary Richards, she was the one adequate note in a dismal evening."
He liked her.
So, Marie, what are you hoping for?
A boy or girl?
Oh, yes.
- Morning, Murray.
- Hi.
What's the matter?
Nothing's the matter.
Everything's great.
I'm an ex-playwright, okay?
Or as John Stymetz so aptly put it, a"playwrong."
- It's a good play, Murray.
- John Stymetz didn't think so.
- So?
He's only one person.
- But he told half a million.
That doesn't mean they'll all believe it.
No?
My sister already canceled her tickets for tonight.
Murray, I can't believe that you're going to let... one man's opinion really get to you like this.
I mean, you have to trust yourself.
You must know your play is good, even if the production was lousy.
A writer has to know these things.
Like, I wrote a book, and I don't care what anyone says.
I know my book... is rotten.
Lou, I don't want to discuss last night anymore.
I'm a lucky guy.
I enjoy this crummy job.
- What's so bad about being a no-talent failure?
- Ohh!
Good morning, everybody.
See how beautiful being called "adequate" is?
Murray, if what I have here doesn't make you feel better, then nothing will.
I don't think Norman Vincent Peale's gonna do it for me today, thanks.
These are books of play reviews, including some ofJohn Stymetz's more memorable criticisms... when he was reviewing plays in New York.
- [Lou] Mary, what are you doing?
- Would you just listen, please?
"In my time, I have been to some funerals and even a couple of wakes,
"but last night was a first for me.
"I watched an actual death, a happy little number... that should take a hint and expire quickly, Death of a Salesman. "
- You're kidding.
- No.
It's right there.
Listen to this little beauty.
"If you love George Bernard Shaw coupled with great music,
"I suggest you put Mozart on your phonograph and read Pygmalion.
"But don't go to see an abomination called...
- My Fair Lady. "
- My Fair Lady.
Lou, he hated My Fair Lady!
[Chuckling]
He hates everything!
Wait till I read you what he said about Richard Burton's Hamlet.
- He didn't like Burton?
- He didn't like the play!
John Stymetz hasn't liked one major Broadway hit... in the ten years he's been reviewing plays.
- He hates everything.
- What did I tell you, Murray?
But I wanted to be the first thing he liked.
Murray, the point is, he has been wrong every time.
I wonder...
Does that mean that I wasn't even adequate?
Hi, guys.
Hey, listen to this.
"Last night a new star was born in Minneapolis.
"His name is Ted Baxter, and the Twin Cities has rarely witnessed such a virtuoso performance."
- Ted, that's fantastic.
- I know.
Now if I can only get someone to print it.
Thank you.
Thank you.

- Hi, Mary.
- Hi, Milt.
How come Ted's gettin' so much mail lately?
I guess it's in response to that editorial he did last week against junk mail.
He told people they could send in for printed copies.
- You really wanna help stamp out junk mail?
- Yeah?
- Don't send out copies ofTed's editorial.
- [Laughs] Yeah!
Oh, no.
Not another rejection.
- Yeah, I guess.
- Oh, poor Murray.
He's been writing this play for three years.
You'd think Broadway producers would be sensitive enough to do more than just stick...
- mimeographed rejection slips in when they send it back.
- What do you mean?
You know, something like a nice, handwritten note saying,
"Good work, Murray.
Nice try.
Love, David Merrick."
Well, when you shoot high like Murray's doing, you gotta expect to be disappointed.
- I know.
- What do you mean, you know?
You don't think I want to stay in the mailroom all my life?
- I've got my eye on another job.
- Oh?
What job is that?
- Yours.
- Oh.
Well, why not?
No reason you couldn't be associate producer.
Yeah.
I like the title.
The work seems easy enough.
I just don't know if I can take the cut in pay.
- Hi.
- What do ya say, Milt?
- Good morning, Mr. Grant.
- Hiya.
- What?
Another one, huh?
- Yeah.
- That's bad.
- I know.
Poor Murray.
No, not poor Murray, poor Lou.
You know he's been using our postage machine to mail these?
- I sure wish he'd stop this.
- Oh, you don't mean that.
- Oh, yes, I do.
- Oh, come on, Mr. Grant.
What's wrong with Murray wanting to be a playwright?
Look...
Murray is a terrific newswriter.
He makes Ted Baxter sound almost intelligent.
- What's wrong with doing that for a living?
- Well, nothing...

You know how many times Noel Coward's first play was turned down...

That's where it belongs.
It does not belong there.

Mary, I haven't seen you all week.
Where've you been?
Why don't you call me?
Do you care that I was worried sick about you?
Wait, don't answer.
I left home because of questions like that.
- Okay.
I won't answer.
- Good.
So, where have you been?
Tonight, for example?
I was, uh, at the theater.
They don't dress up much for that anymore, do they?
What'd you see?
- Well, I didn't exactly see anything.
- Bad seats?
No.
Oh, Rhoda, if I tell you, you'll make a whole big deal out of it.
I'll make a whole big deal out of it if you don't tell me.
That's true.
- Well, I'm in, uh... sort of a play.
- Oh.
I didn't tell you, because I knew if I did you'd start putting it down.
- Why would I do that?
- Because you're very, uh...
- Competitive?
- Well, yeah.
You're wrong.
I'm very pleased you got a big part in a play.
Terrific.
So what did you have to do to get it?
What happened is that Murray wrote a play about a newsroom, and there's a part in it, a girl who works there... who's single and whose name is Mary.
- Wonder why they thought of you.
- [Laughs]
Well, what's she like, this girl in the play?
Real cute and perky, right?
Uh, well, yeah.
Ted Baxter talked me into auditioning for the part, and I got it.
You know, it's really kind of fun.
I'm having a lot of fun with it.
You know, Mary, I've had quite a bit of theatrical experience myself.
Oh, really?
No, I didn't know that.
- Barbra Streisand and I went to high school together.
- Uh-huh.
We did.
Well, not exactly together.
She was there three years after I was.
But it was definitely the same high school.
Well, with all that, uh, theatrical background, then,
[Chuckles] you undoubtedly know it's not all tinsel and glitter, right?
I mean, Rhoda, look, I do have to memorize this play by day after tomorrow, so...
Oh.
You know, Mary, it gets, uh, lonely at the top.
At least that's what Barbs always used to tell me.
Rhoda, would you do me a favor?
Please don't start treating me like I'm in show business.
I'm still working in the newsroom.
This is just something I'm doing for fun.
- Okay.
Good night, Mary.
- Good night.
So what are you gonna change your name to?
- Good morning, Mary.
- Hi, Murray.
I thought rehearsal went pretty well last night, didn't you?
Well, it's coming along, except for Ted.
You know, you're really very good.
You've got a real flair for comedy.
Oh, thanks.
I had a little stage experience in college.
- Oh?
Like what?
- I was a homecoming princess.
- That's terrific training all right.
- Yeah.
Well, who needs experience when the part is that good?
- I mean, it's so funnily written.
- Hey, thanks.
- Hey, Murray?
- Hmm?
- Do you really think I'm that dumb?
- What are you talking about?
Well, it can't be a coincidence.
The girl I play has my name, she works at my job and is pretty much of a, you know, dum-dum.
Mary, it isn't you.
Sure, the character is somewhat like you in some ways.
But I made that stuff up about her being a dum-dum for the sake of the comedy.
Look, I'm a writer.
Some of it is like you and some of it isn't.
Wh
- What about the part about her being, uh, attra-attractive?
- That was based on you.
- Oh, yeah?
Thank you.
Murray.
I took the liberty of reading your script last night, and it's very good.
- Thank you, Lou.
- Very good.
However, I'm a little confused about the character... who's the head of the newsroom.
Believe he's called "Lou."
Every time he speaks, he seems to be yelling or shouting.
Does somebody around here named Lou do that?
Mr. Grant, Murray is a writer.
Some of it is like you and some of it isn't.
Oh, I see.
I was certain that was it.
I was also fairly certain that in your rewrite... you'd change the name of that character.
- You know, I intended to do that.
- I thought you'd might.
Thank you.
Oh, Murr.
Heh!
I'm having a little disagreement with the director.
He refuses to put up applause signs.
Uh, Ted, I don't think they have applause signs in the theater.
Then how do the people know when to laugh or applaud?
In your case, it might be a problem.
Another thing, Murr.
I think the script needs a little pinching up.
You mean "punching up," and who said it needs punching up?
My lines are a little weak.
Everybody's getting laughs but me.
Work on it, will ya, Murr?
I've gotta have it all put on cue cards pretty soon.
- If there is nothing else, I have work to do.
- About my part, the anchorman.
I'm sure it'd be easy to punch it up a little.
It's so rich with material.
Actually, it was the hardest part to write.
- Oh?
Why's that?
- Because, Ted, basically,
I consider anchormen to be colorless and dull.
Many of them are.
Work on it anyway, will you, Murr?
This must be fun for you, seeing your play come alive like this.
Come on, Murray.
There are some good points about Ted being in the play.
- Name one.
- Well, like, he got it produced for you in the first place.
- Name one.
- Come on, Murray.
It's your play.
People are finally gonna see it.
- You had to say that?
The fewer people who'll see it, the better.
- Oh!
Oh, Murr, I just remembered.
I think I have a marvelous surprise for you.
- You have a case of laryngitis coming on?
- Oh, no!
I have pulled off the coup of the year.
I arranged forJohn Stymetz to come see us opening night.
That's good.
At least we'll have one person there.
Happens to be the drama critic for the Times-Herald.
Pulled a couple of strings, and he's coming to review us.
Mary, remember how rotten I felt...
- when I thought my play was being rejected again?
- Uh-huh.
Well, looking back on that now,
I think it was a high point of my career.
Believe me, Mary, I'm not putting you on.
You were really good.
And you know how competitive I am.
I was just playing myself, Rhoda... cute and perky and dumb.
Hey, you want to know how good you were?
You were so good, I was filled with hate and envy.
- You're not just saying that?
- No, I mean it.
Thanks.
Boy, oh, boy.
That Ted Baxter?
- I now have a new standard for terrible.
Oh!
- Yeah.
I can't imagine what that critic is gonna say about it.
Maybe I better tell you now.
Sort of soften the blow.
I was sitting next to him, and he kept taking notes.
He was writing down words like "bad" and "awful"... and a couple I don't think they'll print.
No, Rhoda, I saw where you were sitting.
It was next to the director.
- Hey, will you give me a hand?
- Sure, whatever.
- Put this dip on the table.
- Mary, I think one is plenty.
From what I could hear, not that many people are gonna come to the party.
How'd you get stuck giving a cast party anyway?
In New York, we'd all go to Sardi's and wait for the reviews.
Hey, that's a great idea.
Let's go to New York and wait for the review.
- [Doorbell Buzzing]
- I'll get it.
- Thanks.
Hey, listen, no matter what you think, you were terrific tonight.
Coming!
Hi, Ted.
- We were just talking about you.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Ted, you've met my friend, Rhoda Morgenstern, haven't you?
- Yes, we've met.
- No, I don't believe we have.
I guess I've met you, but you haven't met me.
I guess that's it.
Oh, what did you think of me tonight?
Well, uh, Ted, you were, uh, just incredible.
- Oh, ho!
You're too generous.
- Yes.
Say, Mar, I lost track.
How many curtain calls were there?
- One.
- [Buzzing]
- That must be Murray and Marie.
- [Ted] I'll bet he's a happy man tonight.
[Sighs] Hi!
Author!
Author!
[Chuckling]
Where are your friends?
The ones that were with you at the theater?
- They had to go home.
- It was right after the first act.
Oh, what a darling apartment.
- I thought that the play went just great, didn't you, Mary?
- Oh...
Murray wrote quite a play.
I'm so proud of you, honey. [Laughs]
- And you were really just great, Mary.
- Well, with a part like that...
Oh, ho!
[Clears Throat]
Uh, what did you think of me?
You were just... unbelievable.
Thank you, thank you.
What did you think, Murr?
- You were...
everything I expected you to be.
- Thank you, thank you.
- Well, can I get a drink for anyone?
- Nothing for me, Mar.
- I'd love some milk.
- I'll have a double scotch.
- He's drinking for two.
- Oh!
The only good thing is, he or she wasn't here to see the play.
You know, I think it went awfully well tonight.
I'm sorry I forgot a few lines, but I think I ad-libbed my way out of it very neatly.
Ted, saying "excuse me" and walking off the stage... to check your script is not an ad-lib!
- By the way, Mary, where's Lou?
- He stopped off at the Times-Herald to pick up the reviews.
- Oh.
Is there such a thing as a triple scotch?
- Oh...
Say, Mar, you're too modest.
Why didn't you come out with me for that second bow?
Because I thought we were supposed to wait until someone applauded.
I'll get your milk.
- What are you doing in here?
- Trying to think of a new word to tell Ted... if he asks me again what I thought of his acting.
I've run out of noncommittal ways of saying "rotten."
Would you just get out there?
I invited you here because you're fun at a party.
I'm fun at a party where there's a lot of single men, and you do what my mother used to refer to as "mixing."
I am not fun at a party where one of the men is here with his pregnant wife, and the other one is going steady with himself.
Would you just please go out there and get the conversation started?
- But just don't bring up anything that has anything to do with acting.
- Gotcha.
Hi, all.
Did any of you know that I went to high school with Barbra Streisand?
Who?
Mary!
And then, when Barbra and I were in the tenth grade, we started harmonizing together.
That's when I told her. "Barbs," I said, "don't get your nose fixed."
And the rest, of course, is history.
Mar, what did you think of me?
Oh, Ted...
playing opposite you was just...
- [Buzzing]
- Thank you.
- Mr. Grant, how's the review?
- Well...
He loved it, right?
What'd he say?
What'd he say?
- I can't find it.
Where is it?
- Reviews aren't on the front page, Ted.
It's on page 26.
"Tragedy Strikes Twin Cities."
Wait a minute.
That's not it.
There.
- "Bomb Hits Minneapolis."
- That's it.
"There's been the atomic, there's been the hydrogen...
"and now, the worst bomb of them all,
"a play about a newsroom called All Work and No Play.
I'll vouch for the second part.
There's no play here."
How does he like it so far?
Mary, why don't you read the rest of it so Ted can hear it?
"Not everything about the evening was a catastrophe.
"The intermission was satisfactory.
- " The main character is a TV anchorman...
- I want absolute quiet.
If I were you, I'd ask for noise.
"played by an actor named Ted Baxter...
"who obviously has no conception of what a TV anchorman is like.
Maybe it was a mistake to make him pay for his ticket.
"As you all know, I have long been an opponent of nudity on the stage.
"However, in this case, I would make an exception.
"At least it would give the audience something to look at.
He didn't even like my suit.
As for the performance of Mary Richards..."
Oh... well...
Oh, ho-ho-ho, can't take a little criticism, eh?
Well, if Murray can take it and I can take it, you can take it.
Listen to this. "A s for the performance of Mary Richards, she was the one adequate note in a dismal evening."
He liked her.
So, Marie, what are you hoping for?
A boy or girl?
Oh, yes.
- Morning, Murray.
- Hi.
What's the matter?
Nothing's the matter.
Everything's great.
I'm an ex-playwright, okay?
Or as John Stymetz so aptly put it, a"playwrong."
- It's a good play, Murray.
- John Stymetz didn't think so.
- So?
He's only one person.
- But he told half a million.
That doesn't mean they'll all believe it.
No?
My sister already canceled her tickets for tonight.
Murray, I can't believe that you're going to let... one man's opinion really get to you like this.
I mean, you have to trust yourself.
You must know your play is good, even if the production was lousy.
A writer has to know these things.
Like, I wrote a book, and I don't care what anyone says.
I know my book... is rotten.
Lou, I don't want to discuss last night anymore.
I'm a lucky guy.
I enjoy this crummy job.
- What's so bad about being a no-talent failure?
- Ohh!
Good morning, everybody.
See how beautiful being called "adequate" is?
Murray, if what I have here doesn't make you feel better, then nothing will.
I don't think Norman Vincent Peale's gonna do it for me today, thanks.
These are books of play reviews, including some ofJohn Stymetz's more memorable criticisms... when he was reviewing plays in New York.
- [Lou] Mary, what are you doing?
- Would you just listen, please?
"In my time, I have been to some funerals and even a couple of wakes,
"but last night was a first for me.
"I watched an actual death, a happy little number... that should take a hint and expire quickly, Death of a Salesman. "
- You're kidding.
- No.
It's right there.
Listen to this little beauty.
"If you love George Bernard Shaw coupled with great music,
"I suggest you put Mozart on your phonograph and read Pygmalion.
"But don't go to see an abomination called...
- My Fair Lady. "
- My Fair Lady.
Lou, he hated My Fair Lady!
[Chuckling]
He hates everything!
Wait till I read you what he said about Richard Burton's Hamlet.
- He didn't like Burton?
- He didn't like the play!
John Stymetz hasn't liked one major Broadway hit... in the ten years he's been reviewing plays.
- He hates everything.
- What did I tell you, Murray?
But I wanted to be the first thing he liked.
Murray, the point is, he has been wrong every time.
I wonder...
Does that mean that I wasn't even adequate?
Hi, guys.
Hey, listen to this.
"Last night a new star was born in Minneapolis.
"His name is Ted Baxter, and the Twin Cities has rarely witnessed such a virtuoso performance."
- Ted, that's fantastic.
- I know.
Now if I can only get someone to print it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[Mews]
A first class
What happened to you, guy?
We don't see you any longer.
Well, I'm very busy now, a small participation in a film.
We just form a soccer team and you could play as centre forward.
I'm sorry, it's impossible.
I have no time.
We met in the evening.
But I can't.
I told you I'm working.
I leave next week for one-month period.
What a pity.
But you could stop by one night to see our training.
Of course.
I'll do that.
-Here you are.
Bye.
-Bye.
Paul, wait.
There are some mail for your mother and this will avoid me going up.
Here you are, Paul.
He looks nice, this guy.
What does he do?
I think he's a theatre actor.
Here we are, Paul.
I'm coming, Mom.
If you intend to be back for sleeping be sure not make any noise.
Do they let you completely free?
Yes, yes!
How long?
For ever.
Did you say you're leaving with me for a couple of days?
Don't worry.
It's not important.
But this is important, Paul.
She doesn't care, anyway.
Why?
Oh, don't know.
It has been this way since I can remember.
How old you were when your parents split up?
Around 10.
The judge decided that I would stay with dad and my sister with mom.
Why didn't you stay with him?
He used to beat me up.
One day, I was grounded at school, he was called by the principal.
He made such threat, I did not dare go back home.
I spent the night outside.
What did you do the next day?
In the morning, I went to mother's place but at the very same day she took me back to dad's place.
And I stayed there for one year.
but soon he lost interest in me.
Then, there has been another judgement, and I could return to mom's place.
If she accepted you back it's because she loves you very much.
I don't know anything.
I think that she did to upset dad.
It was her way to revenge.
And then, have you ever seen your dad again?
Never more.
And he did make an effort to seeing you?
No, he completely lost the interest in me.
How old were you?
Around 11 or 12.
Do you have a light on you?
Thank you.
Good morning, madam!
Good morning, Paul.
Good morning, sir.
Did you have a good trip?
Very good, Vincent.
Thank you.
Did the vet show up.
Yesterday, sir.
The foal is in the small clearing.
Is my wife here?
Yes, sir.
In her very room.
She is having the breakfast.
-How are you?
-Fine.
And you?
-Your chest.
-Ah, thanks.
It was hard to find it.
What are you reading?
I'm rereading Industrial Collectivisation by Richard.
Ah, it's interesting!
You know that a new riding club was just opened near here.
Why don't you go?
You know I hate horses.
I'm afraid of them.
So, you should come back to tennis.
You are completely closed in the time.
How many times I'll have to repeat that I hate sports of any kind?
Sorry.
Let's not talk more about this.
-How did you spend your season in Paris?
-As usual.
Ah, as usual...
When will start this great interregional tournament?
-Within few days, darling.
-I hope you're in good shape.
See you tonight.
-Aren't you coming for lunch?
-I won't have lunch today.
I'm very buy.
I'm ready, mom.
-Send a letter to your sister and brother-in-law.
-OK.
-When do you leave on vacation?
-Saturday.
-May I meet you next week?
-You know very well that it is quite small.
What should I do when I get back?
You're big enough to help yourself.
OK.
Have a nice vacation, mom.
-See you.
-See you.
Don't forget to write to your sister!
Don't worry.
Tell me!
Do you prefer the sea or the field?
Why is that?
Just answer!
Do you prefer the sea or the field?
The sea.
-The Sailboats or Chris Craft?
-The Sailboats.
-You rather go to America by ship or plane?
-By ship.
Why?
Oh!
I've seen an ad a while ago.
We could see people in the armchairs, with blanket in the legs.
Is this stupid?
Of course not.
Would you prefer to live in a cottage without any penny or in a studio with lots of money?
If I have lots of money, I'll buy the cottage.
And which do you prefer the dogs or the cats?
The horses.
Yes, I know that.
-It is inadmissible!
-Our apologies, my lady.
I paid additional 15 francs for the dog and I don't want him to get the Canigou.
You can count on me, my lady, this won't happen again.
I booked 2 rooms with communication in the name of Guérin.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Guérin, perfectly.
226 and 228.
Are you coming?
Thank you.
How do you like it?
It's really fantastic!
Look!
Look at this!
I would like to know how to ride horses.
Why not?
I don't have the proper equipment.
I have not to wear.
-This really would give you pleasure?
-Oh, yes!
Let's take a bath?
Not me!
I will leave.
The water is too cold.
Eh, sissy!
Watch out!
Don't touch it or it can get nervous.
Excuse me, miss.
Stop it.
You're hurting me.
Stop it!
-Be nice, when asking.
-Paul, you hurting me, would you please be so kind as to stop it.
-Please, Paul.
-Please, Paul.
Attention, not too fast.
Follow the right side of the road.
What your foot is doing down there?
Slowly.
Engage the third.
The third!
Very well.
Look forward.
No!
Pay attention where you are going to.
Come back to the right.
A bit to the left.
No, back to the right.
To the right!
Philippe...
-how are you?
-Very well, how about you?
It is unexpected to find you here.
Do you intend to stay a few days?
Just to watch the match of my horse tomorrow.
By the way, did you know that Guimard and Paskier made a joint venture?
I've heard about it.
It was time to happen.
All right, them.
Good look tomorrow.
-Goodbye, Philippe.
-Goodbye.
Who is he?
A director in Reims.
Do tell me, what's your job?
I'm a printer.
I know.
But what do you print?
Ah, lots of things.
Brochures, flyers, posters.
We work closely with advertising.
So, it is a big printer?
No.
Normal, average size.
How long have you been married?
Why so many questions?
Because sometimes I think.
Do you get to think?
And how about me?
-Of course.
-I know.
Just kidding.
It has been around 20 years.
20 years!
-Does your wife work?
-Yes.
You could say that.
What does she do?
Oh, she reads, thinks a lot, plays chess.
Is it all?
She also makes a little politics.
What's up?
Why so many questions all of a sudden?
I've told you.
I always think.
But I wanted you tell me too.
You don't have children.
Leave sort of apart.
Then, why are you still together?
My little Paul.
It's not that simple.
We met each other since we're kids, our parents were close friends.
Nowadays it isn't the same thing, but many things remain...
The tenderness...
The memories...
They are important, you know?
So, why should we split up?
Just to start again?
And what is more, there are the habits.
Habits are terrible... but they are comforting too.
Do you think it would be different if you have had children?
I always ask me that.
I don't know.
Let's go.
Let's buy your boots, if you want ride a horse.
I thank you very much, Philippe.
It suits you very well.
You are pretty elegant.
It's doing well.
If the ground remains soft, it has chance.
But a gallop before the match won't let it very tired?
No, it is to put it in shape.
-Do you let me ride when I know how?
-Yes, yes, we will see.
Riding a thoroughbred is totally different than riding saddle horses.
It's more difficult?
No, it's something else.
Tell me Paul, why do you want to be an actor?
I can't explain very well.
At least, give a try.
It's hard to explain.
To act as characters that I would like to be in life, and then we travel, we're well known.
This must be nice.
You know that a good actor is not made in a split of a moment.
All the works require a technician, knowledge.
I don't have a choice, as I don't know how to do anything, anyway.
Precisely!
You could make some courses.
-Of acting?
-Sure.
And other things.
Listen to me, you've quit school with 13 years, which wasn't your fault nor a big deal, we were obliged to do so.
But it is necessary to recover the time you've lost.
You need reading.
And I could help you.
It's the only thing I ask.
But your collaboration is a condition sine qua non.
Now it's too late.
Don't be foolish.
When we are 16 years old, nothing is too late.
Come on.
When we get back, you could start the acting course.
Where?
Don't worry, I will take care of that.
-How long have you been there?
-I'm here for a while.
-What did you do?
-I took a bath.
With this weather?
Why not?
I just love the sea when the weather is like it is.
Why do you insist in wearing a tie here?
-It suits the place.
-Ah, I couldn't agree more.
Tell me, do you know that game?
We cross our arms this way and the first who drops it is the loser.
Let's try?
No, no.
Not here.
Please.
Stop it!
And now, young arrogant?
-Let's try with the left arm.
-Ah, no.
It was enough.
Ah, you flinched, hein?
Another time, when you'll be stronger.
When do you come back?
Within 2 or 3 days.
I'll go down immediately, thank you.
I'll call you on Saturday.
-See you.
-Goodbye.
I was about to forget.
You don't have any money.
-You should have told, idiot.
-Thank you.
Dear Mom,
The weather is beautiful which is very unexpected in Normandy,
I hope you are having good vacations and enough rest.
I'm attaching a little help, 250 francs.
See you soon, Mom, I kindly kiss you.
Adjust the reins.
Press, press with your legs...
The reins.
Trotting the horse, trotting...
The legs, control your legs.
Lean back and low heels.
Speed up the pace, speed up the pace.
Hold the reins in the hand and drive the horse with the knees.
Slower
Head up.
Look forward.
staring the shoulder of the second.
The heels down, your heels down and back.
You lost a stirrup.
Find it.
Here you are.
Pay attention to the reins.
Now, marching.
Ease, ease, the knees, pay attention to your knees.
Don't let the horse sleep, here you are.
Come on, let's tighten... in order to stop.
Stop it!
The long reins, take out the stirrup.
It's over.
Except for Mr. and Mrs. Saint-Martin,
I thank you all.
How long do you ride?
This is the third time.
-You're doing OK.
-Thank you.
-And you?
Do you ride?
-No, I don't like.
-How was everything?
-Very nice, year.
Have been waiting long?
-A bit.
Where have you been?
-To the sea cost.
I love galloping on the beach.
-Let's go to Miok's place?
-If you want.
Come with us, let's have a glass of wine.
Marie-Laure!
I have to go.
Have an appointment with the hairdresser.
-Let's go.
Bye.
-Bye.
-See you, miss.
-Marie-Laure.
She is cool, this girl.
Do you always see her?
You know that you can treat me more informally.
Her parents and mines have a village here, so we met during vacations.
How about you?
I'm in the hotel.
-With your parents?
-No, by myself.
My godfather stops by once in a while to see me.
What a lucky boy!
Why?
It's quieter this way.
What do you do in Paris?
I attend the Louis-le-Grand.
-You prepare Elementary Mathematics, but don't have a mathematical air.
You are right.
I'm stronger in French.
How about you?
Where do you attend classes?
Institute of Art and Decoration.
Is it interesting?
It's not bad.
And it pleases my parents.
The water was cold?
More or less.
That guy is a pain in the ass, he's always around her!
Why?
Do you have any interest in her?
I think she is nice.
She has a sweet air.
It's true.
She is beautiful, but I would rather say that her air is hard.
-This is great!
You did not swim.
-I know, I know.
-Give-me my robe.
-Here you are.
-Will you join us for dinner?
-No, I can't.
-Olivier, will you come?
-Go ahead I will be with him.
Place your bets.
Alea jact est.
Bets are closed.
-Black 6.
-Pair and Manqué
Ah, damn, could you lend me some money?
No way.
Now is 21.
Even or odd.
I have nothing but 300 francs.
-I lost.
-Oh, no!
You bet everything.
Are you bored?
No, not at all.
You have a sad expression.
No, no.
It's the way I am.
I was thinking in the winter sports.
Are you good at skiing?
Pretty much, yes.
Every year I go my parents have a cottage.
Where?
St. Moritz, do you know there?
Only by its fame.
It's fantastic, isn't it?
-Jean-Marc, let's play.
-I'm coming.
What does your dad do?
My father has a large printer.
Another sonny boy.
-Jean-Marc, are you coming or not?
-I'm coming.
Bruno!
You are a very naughty boy.
I'm going to talk to your mom.
Coward, why left without saying anything?
-Where are you going to?
-To Honfleur, have a dinner at Jean-Marc's.
-Come on.
-Come on, let's go.
Paul, come to my side.
I won't let go any longer.
Hello, Paul?
How are you?
Did I wake you up?
You sounded sleepy.
Listen, I have business to do at the printer.
It's a lot of things to do and I can't pick you up.
Are you hearing me?
So, I'm sending you some cash.
You pay the hotel and return by train.
How about the car?
The keys are hidden in a small box, at the left side, you deliver them to the desk boy.
Oh, what a pity!
I made so many friends so far.
Can't I stay a bit longer?
I won't find anybody at home.
What should I do when I get there?
I can't pick you up before 4 to 5 days.
Let me stay, Philippe,
I'm having such a good time!
OK!
I understand.
If this gives you pleasure.
What did you do last night?
Did you go to bed late?
Not at all.
And how about the riding lessons.
How are them?
Oh yes, I do them every day.
I made amazing progress.
I will call you tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
See you!
Kisses.
Bye.
She is so beautiful!
Christ!
Anyway, I prefer the brunettes.
And her big blue eyes like a doll cause me chills on my back.
Oh, you're exaggerating.
You have been fooled by appearances, I assure you.
Why?
Because.
I think you are too sentimental.
Oh, Lord!
She's fantastic!
All right, all right, she's fantastic.
Tell me, you do have good parents.
They let you spend the whole vacation here, alone, in a sort of palace.
It's rare.
Yes, yes.
Come on, let's go, it is over.
It's pretty windy.
Whose car is this?
My godfather's.
He let you drive it?
No, he wasn't there so I picked up the keys.
But you don't have a drivers license.
Don't worry, I know how to drive.
Do you want a cigarette?
Not now.
Are you feeling cold?
A bit, yes.
Do you want me to turn on the hot air?
I want you to hold me.
Marie-Laure!
My darling!
I'm so happy.
When I could imagine that the girl of my dreams...
I imagined her like you, blonde,
blue eyes,
I never thought that it would happen to me.
I love you.
It's the first time.
Give me a cigarette.
Let's go back, my parents will be worried.
Philippe,
Philippe!
What?
How about watching a film this afternoon?
Tables of Disorder.
Oh, why don't we go to the casino?
No, please, Paul.
Well, well, as you wish.
Hello, are you alone?
Yes, yes.
My godfather, Nicolas.
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening.
-Come and sit with us!
-All right.
What are you drinking?
-What do you want?
-A beer.
Me too.
Three, please.
What did you do this afternoon?
We went to the cinema.
What did you see?
Tables of Disorder, very good.
Yes, I've heard good critics.
You should see it.
The film is very god.
Good evening.
Here goes the artist!
Marie-Laure, Olivier, my godfather.
Good evening.
-Sit down.
-thank you.
We have a meeting with friends.
And then we'll stop by Hi-fi.
Could you meet us there?
I don't know, yes, perhaps.
Let's go Paul.
-I see.
-Bye.
See you later.
Your friends are very polite.
How did you meet them?
They are Nicolas' friends and we met every day.
Their parents have houses here and they come every year for vacations.
But why do they call you "artist"?
Because they don't understand anything,
I'm a kind of joke, for them.
-Really?
Why is that?
-I don't know.
Because my scale of values, for them is updated.
It's pretty that girls.
What's her name?
Marie-Laure.
I've gotten the impression that your friends are waiting for you,
I'll go inside and you could meet them.
No, I don't want to.
I'm going in with you.
No, no.
I'm tired.
You go with them.
I'm going in, good night.
Good night, sir.
It's nice, your godfather.
Yes, yes, he is very nice.
He belong to your family or he is an outsider.
No, no!
He's a friend to my parents.
Let's go?
Let's go to Hi-fi?
-Good night.
-Good night, sir.
-Good night, sir.
-Good night.
Philippe, are you sleeping?
Philippe?
Philippe!
-Good bye, madam.
-Good bye.
Thank you.
Marie-Laure.
Marie-Laure!
-They are for you.
-For me?
A memento of our vacations, see you soon, in Paris.
Paul.
He's a good kid.
Very nice.
Oh, yeah, he's really very nice.
-Seven.
-Seven.
-One, two, three, four, five six, seven
Ah, Faubourg St. Honoré, 4 houses,
97.500 francs, paid to the landlord.
Let's pay!
-I can't.
I don't have such amount.
-So, you must sell.
To sell what?
I don't have anything left.
You already won once, I will arrange the dishes.
-I'll do it.
-Oh, why the rush!
Let's play another.
Not me!
Paul, do you want me teaching you to play?
I must go.
I have a date.
You did not tell us much about your vacation.
Another time.
At least were they good?
Who were your friends?
The friends.
Gee, Paul, you know how to live.
Do you think so?
Don't you think you are lucky?
And now, what do intend to do?
Get ready for the conservatory.
Conservatory?
This can't be serious.
You're kidding!
This is not the way to bring money home.
The money doesn't matter.
I think it is better this than start as a trainee somewhere.
It would be good if you would do as everybody: earn your own life.
Yes, but the way I want.
You always think you are the best, fortunately there are very few like you.
And if you continue doing like this you won't be able to have a family nor to live as Richard!
You may be right, but I don't care.
My ambitions are others.
Paul, stop it, please, be polite with your sister.
I wasn't me who've started.
Now I'm leaving.
I have an appointment.
Where are you going?
-It doesn't matter.
-Let's see a film?
Yes...
-What's up?
-They depressed me.
What did they say?
Always the same thing, that I need to work.
They might be right.
Of course they are right.
Of course it is necessary that I work but it is the way they talk, their point of view.
I'm not sure when they talk about work is as if there were always a threat.
It's normal.
I know it's normal, but I'm not their way.
I'm afraid.
Yes, but you are afraid of the opposite.
How is that?
You are afraid the thing they are looking for: stability.
You don't are afraid of the material problems.
-It's the kind of life you live that scares them.
-Yes, that's right.
I begin to know you, Paul,
I know that you want to work, of doing what interests you and, above all, do the things you would like to continue doing the next day.
And why they can't understand?
I hate them!
If they could understand, everything would be different now it's necessary for you to tell them.
Be indulgent.
Come on, let's see a film!
Nicolas,
It has been a long time since I want to tell you something.
What?
My godfather
Philippe, is not my godfather.
I kind knew it.
Why?
Some details.
Do you know whom he is?
I guess so.
And?
And, what?
-What do you think.
-For me, it's all right.
Louis-le-Grand, my studies, my family everything is a big lie.
Of course.
Why do you say that?
Because I like you.
And more, I trust you.
I've never told this to anybody.
I'd need to tell you that.
To your godfather and his godson.
Is this your first year in political science, my dear Gerard.
No, it's the second.
And you study Law concomitantly?
Yes, yes.
And I intend to make a contest in ENA.
Ah, very good.
I congratulate you.
It's a good school.
How about you, Paul?
What do you do when you're not sending flowers to my daughter?
I study.
Are you in the Pasteur?
No.
I attend Louis-le-Grand.
Don't you live in Neuilly, Paul?
Yes.
So?
I thought the inscriptions at the high school were mandatory to those living nearby.
Absolutely,
I mean my father graduated in Louis-le-Grand
so he wanted me to attend there too.
He's a friend to the Principal.
Very well, young man.
It's profitable to have good relations.
Marie-Laure, you fail in their duties, offer a drink to your friends.
Sorry, madam, I have to go.
I have a test tomorrow at 8AM and promised my mother not to sleep very late.
Stay another 5 minutes.
-I will give you I ride, if you want.
-OK.
Thank you.
Are you going to Megeve this winter?
No, I'll go to Gstaad.
It's more international and I prefer it.
Do you have friends over there?
Yes, yes.
They have wonderful cottages.
After all, I will walk back.
It will be good for me.
-Good night.
-Good night.
-Good night.
-Good night.
Do you think we are taking chance?
No.
Don't you worry.
Anyway, lock the door.
It is no wish of mine to vaunt my merits,
But, if I may lay claim to any virtue,
I think beyond all else I have displayed
Abhorrence of those sins with which I'm charged.
The daylight is not purer than my heart.
How, then, could I, burning with fire profane
Phaedra alone bewitched your shameless eyes;
Your soul, to others' charms indifferent,
,Disdained the blameless fires of lawful love.
No, father, I have hidden it too long,
This heart has not disdain'd a sacred flame.
Here at your feet I own my real offence:
Ilove,andloveintruth where you forbid me;
You love her?
Heavens!
But no, I see the trick.
You feign a crime to justify yourself.
Sir, I have shunn'd her for six months, and still love her
To you yourself I came to tell it, trembling the while
Can nothing clear your mind...
Of your mistake?
Ofyourmistake
No one wanted...
Can nothing clear your mind of your mistake...
It's all I know.
It's really good.
-This interests you?
-Ah, yes!
And you friend Nicolas, do you see him very often?
Always, yes.
And the others?
-Which ones?
-All the gang from Deauville.
Them too.
Why do you see them?
Nicolas I can understand, but the others don't have no frenzy, no excitement.
You are right.
I know nothing.
I would like to be like them.
And the blonde, do you always meet?
Marie-Laure?
Sometimes.
Hello?
Maillo 00-42?
I would like to talk to Marie-Laure, please.
It's Paul.
Ah, good morning, Paul.
This is Marie-Laure's mother.
Oh, Paul, I'm so sorry.
She isn't in.
She just left.
Well, it doesn't matter.
Thank you, madam.
Go away, I'll meet you.
Don't come to see me here.
It's forbidden.
Marie-Laure, I've been trying to talk to you by phone.
I can't talk now.
I'm with my friend.
Call me home.
But what you are doing?
I saw you leaving Racing.
Ah, this won't stop?
Are you following me?
-Who was that guy?
-A friend.
You were kissing in the car.
Listen, Paul.
I won't give you any answer.
-What happen between us.
-Oh, Paul, leave me alone!
-Why you acting like that?
-Stop it.
You're exasperating me.
Marie-Laure...
Listen, I'm late.
Don't try to see me again, nor call me.
Paul, it's noon.
Get up, your sister will come.
Mom, we already took you on vacation the whole month of August.
At Christmas it won't be possible.
I don't want to impose you to Richard all the time.
As you wish...
Did you get any money from Paul?
Some days ago he gave me 300 francs.
-Is he working?
-I need to see, to believe it.
-Coffee, please.
-In the pot.
Have you already set the date of baptism?
Yes.
It will be on the 15th, at Richard's parents.
-Why?
-They have a large dining room.
It will be more agreeable.
Are you expecting too many people?
Yes, quite.
We want to make something very impressive, you know?
We don't want commonplace.
This is madness, what is happening?
I don't know anything...
How long have you been here?
I don't know.
What's up?
You look tired.
What is going on?
Yes, yes.
Paul!
What's happening, Paul?
Come on, come on, come, my dear.
Calm down.
Stop crying.
Put yourself together.
It's not that serious, come on.
Calm down, Paul.
Do not get into despair.
You're not alone.
-This pleases you?
-Yes, very much.
It was the last I've made.
Do you like it?
Ah, it's fantastic!
I'll give you.
Really?
Wait, I will finish it.
Why don't you let you hair grow up?
It would be nice.
I don't dare.
It's Philippe who does want?
No, it's myself.
It seems bad, we have endless stories.
Only with the idiots.
Yes, but there are many idiots.
E Philippe, everything all right?
Do you see him often?
There are 15 days I don't see him.
He's very busy and does not have much time.
Did he know about Marie-Laure?
He never told me anything.
He's very polite.
Wasn't him jealous?
Not at all.
What are you smiling at?
I was thinking in other thing.
What?
There was one thing my father used to say, when we were living together.
And that was...
When I was born, my mother wanted to strangle me.
Why?
She didn't want a boy but another daughter.
May that was the reason she put me internal, since I was 6.
My princess, do you want to worry me?
Are you thinking in the pain that will you cause me?
You do not say me anything!
What a reception.
What an ice!
Is this way your eyes help me with my disgrace?
Speak: we are alone.
Our enemies, betrayed, while I herein talk to you, is busy the other way.
Let's enjoy the moments of this happy absence.
You are in places full of his power
These walls, sir, may have eyes;
And never, the emperor is away of these places.
And since when, milady you are so shy?
What?
Your love is suffering already in the captivity?
What happen to your heart, that promised even Neron would envy our love?
Very well, Paul, it's enough for today.
It was not bad.
-Who is the next?
-Me, if you allow me, mater.
-Come on, what do you gives us?
-Cherubim, the scene with the Countess.
Oh, no, Bob.
It has been over one month that you repeat this scene.
Work another thing.
Bring me something more updating.
Paul, pay attention to you breathing, after all, you have a little accent "faubourgien"
I need to correct that.
Or, it won't be good.
And you, my darling, give me Agnes.
You made amazing progress.
The classical is very difficult.
Keep going.
I have faith on you.
I need to go.
I have a meeting at 2 PM, in Reims.
-We are not having lunch together?
-No, I cannot.
-Your promised me!
-I know, but we never do only what we want.
Aren't you going to wait until the end of the class?
No, I cannot.
I'm late.
All right, very well.
It is always the same!
Be reasonable, Paul.
Don't play the little boy.
All right.
We'll meet on Saturday at the studio.
-Near 8 PM.
-I will not go.
Be kind, Paul.
I'll see you Saturday.
It is hard to believe.
I was standing in the counter, arranging the strawberries, when I saw, through the trees, over there a young man, who staring my eyes with a humble reverence greeted me:
Hello?
Please, I would like to talk to Mr. Paul Mattei.
Yes, sure, he is a student in the course.
Ah, he just left.
It does not matter.
Will you please tell him that Mr. Guérin will call him tomorrow?
Does he have class tomorrow?
From 9 till noon, perfect.
Goodbye sir, thank you very much.
Mr. Paul
I would like to talk to you.
Please, come with me.
All right.
Understood.
Yes, yes.
You can count on me.
See you.
Who was it?
Paul!
I don't like that boy, Nicolas, I think I've already told you that.
I don't like his manner.
-You talk too much.
You don't even know him.
-Nicolas!
Mom, a great misfortune happened to him.
He just lost a close friend whom he loved very much.
Do you think you should leave home?
Yes, I guess so.
If you stay, they will have to accept.
You return to the ranks, like them.
Perhaps I'm good at that.
Don't say nonsense!
I don't care, Nicolas!
It was been this way since ever.
I will not leave.
Paul, don't despair.
I don't care!
Since I was a little boy this is my fate.
I'm not lucky.
With Philippe I was well enough.
Before, nobody care less.
He was so gentle, he understood me.
I loved him very much.
Now, I'm alone again.
Let's go, Paul
I would prefer to lose my father or my mother rather than him.
You say silly things.
I promise, Nicolas, it's the truth.
-I'll leave home.
-She will let you go?
She is demanding that.
So, please, do not hesitate.
Leave immediately.
-Do you really think I am right?
-Yes, Paul, of course you are.
And how about your course, everything is fine?
Yes, nothing bad, I believe, anyway.
For this Hippolytus is known in Greece,
So continent that he is deem'd austere.
All know my abstinence inflexible:
The daylight is not purer than my heart.
How, then, could I, burning with fire profane
Yes, dastard, 'tis that very pride condemns you.
I see the odious reason of your coldness
Phaedra alone bewitch'd your shameless eyes;
Your soul, to others' charms indifferent,
Disdain'd the blameless fires of lawful love.
No, father, I have hidden it too long,
This heart has not disdain'd a sacred flame.
I love, and love in truth where you forbid me...

- LuStoker
Salem, you're drinking like a dog.
I just started a new exercise programme, and I need to replenish my fluids.
Then, I'm gonna get to the exercise part.
If that's a new fashion statement, I'd rethink it.
Mark the date.
I've just invented the first portable x-ray helmet.
Take a look.
Uhn.
Can it detect internal bleeding?
It's a work in progress.
Hey, who ate all the Wheat-ios?
Did you know Addis Ababa is the capital of Ethiopia?
Not that I'm trying to change the subject.
Let's try a cat scan.
Salem, you even ate the prize.
Did someone order a Scotch?
Ha-ha-ha.
- What are you doing?
- Scanning the mailman.
I wouldn't have picked him for a boxer man.
Check to see if he's got my Muscle Fitness magazine.
I wanna read the interview with Joe Piscopo.
That's Harvey.
Quick witch check.
I'll take this.
You take that.
No problem, honey.
Is there anything that I can get rid of?
- You?
- Gotcha.
- Hey, Harvey.
- Hey.
I brought our Social Studies project.
- Great, did you get much done?
- Yeah.
I bought the poster board.
Okay, well, we have all day to work on it.
So, what would be a good transportation system
- for the town of Westbridge?
- Hmm.
- So did you finish your project?
- No.
- Did you start your project?
- No.
Sabrina, you've really gotta stop procrastinating.
We weren't procrastinating.
Harvey and I just got busy doing other more fun things.
We rotated every mattress in the house.
Sabrina, procrastination only makes things worse.
Ask Hilda about the time--
Well, ask Hilda about any time.
I'll think of a comeback for her tomorrow.
- I just wish I could get motivated.
- Three words:
magical jumping beans.
One word:
Huh?
No, come on.
They really make you hop to.
Beans, beans, the magical fruit.
Oh, grow up.
This sounds easy.
"Potassium benzoate, a shot of B12, and fruit extract."
And we just happen to be out of potassium benzoate,
- a shot of B12, and fruit extract.
- You'll have to go to the Piggly Wiggly in the Other Realm.
They have everything.
I can't stand that place.
Pigs aren't very good at making change.
Who are they kidding with that sneezeguard over the slop bar?
Well, I'm on my way.
Sabrina, Valerie's on the phone!
Just as soon as I talk to Valerie.
Val, I don't believe in shampoo-conditioners in one.
What you gain in time you lose in body.
Look at that.
Zelda got invited to Amy Kahn's wedding and I didn't.
I forgot to put in an alarm system.
No, there's not a car in my kitchen.
If Libby says that to you again, you look her in the eye, and you say-
- My beans!
No, I mean, I gotta go to the store.
I'll call you later.
The store's closed by now.
- What?
Why didn't you tell me?
- Don't blame me.
I wasn't the one procrastinating by talking on the phone.
Eavesdropping was at the top of my to-do list.
I've gotta work on my project.
I need those magical jumping beans.
I'll just substitute the ingredients.
Perfect.
I knew corn would work as well as phosphoric acid.
"Hold beans in hand, shake vigorously, and you'll feel instantly energetic."
Come on.
Ugh.
These beans are lame.
Oh, and they melt in your hands.
I should take this out to the kerb.
No, I'll do it tomorrow.
- Going to bed, Salem?
- In a minute.
I'm having a staring contest with the cat across the street.
Ha-ha!
I won!
In your face, Fluffy!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Earthquake!
- But we're in Massachusetts.
- Well, then, what is it?
- Is that a beanstalk?
- Beanstalk!
Oh, no!
Now where are we gonna plant our bulbs?
Did someone throw out some magic beans?
I threw out some magical jumping beans.
But it doesn't say anything about beanstalks.
Did you follow the recipe carefully?
Sure.
With a few substitutions.
Well, what were they?
Maybe we could just reverse the spell.
Well, extract of something, some other gobbledegook.
And tapioca.
- I was gonna write it down, but--
- See, Sabrina?
Procrastination only makes things worse.
Then you and I have to listen to Zelda.
She cannot resist--
Can we please focus on hiding the 300-foot beanstalk?
Fog?
I bet you guys did stuff like this all the time when you were my age, huh?
No, never.
Next, we have to figure out what to do about the giant.
Right.
That's what I-
- Giant?
There's actually a giant at the top of the beanstalk?
- Or worse.
- Beanstalks always lead
- to a bad neighbourhood.
- Here's a thought.
We don't go up.
It's not what doesn't go up there.
It's what might come down.
Exactly.
So we need someone to go up the beanstalk and stand guard.
- I vote Salem.
- I'm scared of heights.
You're a cat.
Mean.
Does the Other Realm have tree trimmers or something that might help?
Tree trimmers.
Isn't she cute?
If only it were that simple.
This is a magical beanstalk, Sabrina.
It's going to take a lot more than tree trimmers.
Hey, what about that plutonium-based root killer?
Oh, it didn't make a dent in the dandelions.
Hello.
This is your guard.
Harvey's at the front door, and send me a sandwich.
Oh, no.
Harvey's here to work on our project.
Hey.
Have you guys seen all the fog?
- It's cool.
- Thank you.
Wow, is this one of those virtual-reality games?
Sure.
That's a good explanation.
- Can I try it?
- No.
Because we need to go get something to eat before we work.
I had three chilidogs for breakfast, but sure.
Can we please not leave that thing lying around?
You're worried about a helmet, and Harvey's about to walk
- into a kitchen with a beanstalk?
- Good point.
- Oh, boy, jellybeans.
- Harvey, don't look at the--
No, don't eat those!
I really meant to put these away.
Harvey!
Salem!
- Salem, did you see Harvey?
- No!
I was too busy looking for that sandwich.
Oh, where is he?
Harvey!
Harvey!
Sabrina?
Sabrina.
- Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda!
- Honey, what's wrong?
Harvey thought the beans were jellybeans.
He ate them and flew out the door and up the beanstalk.
He's gonna suspect something.
Okay, first things first.
Let's see if we can see him.
Since when do we have a periscope in the kitchen?
You've lived here two years, you never noticed it?
Teenagers.
Let me look.
- Oh, good.
It's not a giant.
- Let me look.
- Oh!
It's worse.
It's the Wicked Witch.
- Oh!
Wicked?
But she's so pretty.
Oh, she's had a lot of work done.
And worst of all, she feasts on mortals.
- That's horrible.
- Hence the "wicked" part
- of Wicked Witch.
- I've gotta get up and save Harvey.
Sabrina, wait.
You're not used to the high altitude.
It could knock out your powers.
You'll be no match for her.
But it's almost noon.
What if she wants a Harvey melt?
Don't worry, we'll have time.
She always fattens them up first.
Sabrina, here's the new plan.
You wait here and keep an eye on Harvey through the periscope.
- Hilda and I will go to the YMCA.
- This is no time to go to the gym.
No, it stands for Yikes!
Magic Crisis Agency.
They specialise in these sorts of problems.
We'll be back in a flash.
I'm sure the line will move quickly.
Excuse me, ma'am.
How long have you been waiting?
My oldest boy, Tom, is 52.
That's nice, but how long have you been here?
He was born in this line.
What's taking them so long?
Nice to meet you, Harvey.
I'm the Wick-
- Woman of the house.
Do you know where you are?
Well, last thing I remember, I was eating some jellybeans, and then suddenly I was swept up into the air.
Oh, I must've died.
But I had so much to give, so much to do.
I was supposed to mow the lawn.
It's okay, Harvey.
It's okay.
- Are we in heaven?
- Let's just call it a weigh station to heaven.
On the scale, on the scale.
You see, Harvey, the big guy upstairs doesn't trust skinny people.
Or the French.
I don't know why.
Hmm.
"Alarmingly svelte"?
Oh, this will never do.
Here, eat this stick of butter while I think of something.
That's it.
I can't wait any longer.
Peach pie, my favourite.
How did I know?
And now for a little sprinkle of my secret ingredient.
Save room for dessert.
As the official watchcat, I order you to get down.
I'm going up, and don't try to stop me, cat.
You leave me with no choice than to go with you and protect you.
- You're afraid of heights.
- Right.
Then you leave me no choice than to wish you well.
Pull it together.
Be a man, Saberhagen.
Climb, climb.
I hope we don't get caught up in all that red tape.
I made it.
Good thing that pilot knew how to swerve.
Harvey.
Anyone with a friend or a family member up to their neck in quicksand, come to the head of the line.
Hey!
We've been waiting for hours.
We have a boy in a beanstalk about to be eaten by the Wicked Witch.
I'll get to that.
Wait.
I need a plan.
Got it.
Nothing wrong with my magic.
Yes?
Hello, I'm with the Confectionery Construction Company.
We specialise in gingerbread siding.
I don't know.
The sugary smell really attracts the kids.
Mmm.
I do love children, especially with a béarnaise sauce.
Come in.
Allow me to demonstrate.
- Ooh.
- See how nicely it blends in with your decor?
Which, by the way, is lovely.
Oh, thank you.
It was designed by I.M. Pie.
Why don't you take a look at the sample book
- while I take a few measurements.
- Hmm.
Is this one of those deals where you give me a great price on the gingerbread and then kill me on the frosting?
Our price includes all extras
- and you could win a trip to Hawaii.
- Ooh.
- Harvey?
- Sabrina.
Oh, no, you ate a bad bean and died too?
- What are the odds of that?
- Harvey, you're not dead, but you will be if we don't get you out.
But I haven't touched the stuffed pork chops.
Harvey, listen, that woman out there is wicked.
You wouldn't say that if you had her pralines.
- She's an awesome cook.
- She's gonna cook you.
- See?
- "Monday, Hansel.
Tuesday, Gretel.
Wednesday, Harv--"
"Harvey"?
Let's get out of here.
Does this sweater make me look fat?
Oh, I see you two have met.
He is so cute, I could just eat him up with a spoon.
Heh.
Now, I wanted to ask you the price of the candy-cane rain gutters.
I just put some on the house.
Why don't you look before you decide?
She is so efficient.
I'm going to put in a good word to your supervisor.
Don't forget the éclairs.
- Go, go, go!
- Oh, my thighs are rubbing.
I know this isn't the time to ask, but what the heck is happening?
Fee, fi, fo, fum, I smell a half mortal.
So have you decided on those gutters?
Make yourselves at home.
We dress for dinner here.
In your case that means oyster dressing.
Heh.
Don't look down.
One branch at a time.
Oh, a blue jay.
Eat up, kids.
I can only see one chin.
Oh, I forgot.
I have ladyfingers in the oven.
Keep an eye on the door.
I'm gonna try to pick the lock.
Got it.
Oh!
It must be the high altitude.
My powers are knocked out.
Why are my aunts always right?
Harvey!
Quick, we've gotta eat through this gingerbread wall.
- I'm kind of full.
- Just eat!
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Why, you pesky little entrées.
If you keep trying to escape, I'll just have to move up my dinner party.
Lift up your arm, please.
Meat thermometer.
You know, in her defence, the peach pie was good.
We're finally getting somewhere.
Uh-oh.
You're in the line for family members encased in stone.
You've got a beanstalk problem.
That's Window C.
No.
Window C told us to come here.
Well, then you need Window E. That's the window for people
Window C incorrectly told to go to Window B. Next, please!
Where is the window for people who pull people through windows?
Oh, no!
I'm out of mushrooms.
You can't make a decent gravy without mushrooms.
Harvey and I'd be happy to go to the store and pick some up for you.
Nice try.
Store's closed.
I'll just have to serve you dry.
Or you could put it off until tomorrow.
By then we'll be nice and tender.
- Undercooked Kinkle can be gristly.
- Yeah, and think about it.
What we'll taste like when we're smothered in a nice mushroom gravy.
Hmm.
And there's a wonderful tart that goes great with teenager.
The recipe's in that magazine.
Sounds delicious.
Save a piece of my leg for me.
I have been wanting to catch up on my cooking journals.
What the hey.
I'll eat you tomorrow.
Soon as I say so, we make a break for it.
Silly me, I almost forgot to keep you from getting away.
Not yet.
I gotta stop melting cheese and drinking it as a beverage.
I'm beginning to worry.
- We're starting to smell good.
- Shh!
Harvey, move over.
I need a clear shot at the door.
Soufflé.
Didn't your mom ever teach you not to slam doors?
Sorry.
I don't like fast food!
Serpentine, Harvey!
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
I know what to do.
It didn't work.
She's not melting!
Get real, Harvey.
This isn't fantasy.
Now let's get off this cloud and down that beanstalk.
Now I've got you.
Nuh-uh.
Oh!
Whoa!
Finally.
I made it all the way up.
Go down, go down!
You gotta be kidding.
- You two are dead meat!
- Back off, lady.
It's the '90s.
Nobody eats mortals anymore.
And I'll have kitty for dessert.
Would you look at the time?
Huh-huh.
Huh-huh-huh!
I hope you land on your feet!
Ooh!
I'm alive!
Now where's that sandwich?
Uh-huh.
So you've got a Code 937:
mortal on a beanstalk with Wicked Witch.
Yes.
Are we in the right line?
- Yes, indeed.
- Oh!
You just need to get hold of a 329-K.
- What's that?
- Tree trimmer.
Look, Sabrina.
I'm sweating off all my weight.
That's great, Harvey.
Hey, look, there's Westbridge!
You know, we could really use a monorail down Main Street.
Yeah, we should remember that for our report!
Hey, my power's back on.
Get back here, you little Lean Cuisines!
Why didn't I eat you when I had the chance?
Because you procrastinated.
Take that!
No.
No!
She's turned me into a vegetarian!
- We made it.
- Yeah.
- Coming through.
- We've gotta save Harvey.
Harvey?
Sabrina, did you go up that beanstalk?
At least I didn't procrastinate.
Hey, you brought a tree trimmer?
He prefers to be called an arbourist.
Okay, let's get rid of this puppy.
Okay, everyone, stand clear.
Timber!
- Cool.
- Yeah, cool.
What's he gonna think when he comes to?
It's showtime.
Oh, no, the witch is gaining on us!
Harvey, you're really enjoying that virtual-reality game.
It was a game?
I knew that.
Didn't look that real.
Maybe we should work on our project.
Actually, I'd like to give this another try.
No, no more procrastinating.
Procrastinating is bad.
It only leads to terrible things.
- I will never procrastinate again.
- Good for you.
Wanna bake brownies and eat the dough?
That could be fun.
Another lesson well-learned.
What's that?
Has anyone seen Salem?
He hasn't come home for dinner.
Well, that's not like him.
Salem!
Here, kitty, kitty!
Oh, yeah, he hates that.
I can't move.
Oh, no, is he hurt?
"Fatten Up"?
This must've fallen off the beanstalk.
Oh!
Salem, you didn't.
I did.
Well, don't just stand there.
Somebody get me a diet soda.
VILA [ON TV]:
So you grab a chain and whack away.
- After you.
- I feel weird.
I haven't even had an argument with this cabinet.
Hold me back.
It's got a good beat and I can dance to it.
- I give it a 92.
SABRINA:
What are you doing?
It sounds like you're smashing furniture.
Oh.
You are smashing furniture.
Why?
It's our new hobby.
We're antiquing this cabinet.
Some people wait a hundred years.
We're just beating the tar out of it.
Personally, I find knitting relaxing.
It's a great way to get out your frustration.
Take that, stupid Nobel Prize committee.
May I?
Take that, people who won't buy their dear niece a car.
Oh, shoot, I missed what Bob did with the linseed oil.
Well, let's ask him.
- Could you go over step four again?
- How did I get...?
Whoa, this needs a lot of work.
Say, Bob, you ever wired a litter box for cable?
I gotta remember to crack a window when I work with varnish.
I'm ready for my close-up.
Do I have food in my teeth?
[SALEM SNORING]
- Salem.
SALEM:
What?
What?
- It was like this when I found it.
- Val and I are going to the movies.
If I'm not dressed in five minutes, I'm gonna miss my ride.
Why didn't you say so?
I don't mind moving.
Even if I knew what I wanted to wear, I couldn't pick it out of this mess.
- It's full of kibble crumbs.
SALEM:
Brush them in a pile.
I'll eat them later.
Better clean this up.
I forgot, I'm only allowed incantations this week.
Thank you, quizmaster.
Uh...
Stuff is messy This place is a zoo
Make things that need it Brand-spanking new
Let's see if it worked.
Excellent.
"Extra charge for cat-hair removal"?
I think this is the nicest thing we ever beat up.
Except for that teamster.
Oh, no.
Our antique is brand-new again.
- That's odd.
- Meeting Valerie, Rialto Cinema.
- See you.
- Freeze.
- What?
Oh, yeah.
Back by 10.
- Cast any spells lately?
Yeah, I cast a make-everything-new spell.
- Why?
- You made it too general.
Look.
I guess now would be the wrong time to say I think it looks better like that.
- Sorry.
I was in a hurry.
- We witches have a saying:
Haste makes a gigantic mess.
Got it.
Did I screw anything else up?
SALEM:
I found the Fountain of Youth.
It's the toilet.
No problem.
I'll just fix it with an undo spell.
I made things new And that was bad
So undo it all So they won't be mad
SALEM:
Welcome back, trick knee.
Sabrina, you don't wanna rely on undo spells.
It's not in the spirit of magic.
You really have to get it exactly right the first time.
Otherwise, there may be side effects.
I remember one time, I was making rum balls and I got tired, so I made a make-everything-round spell.
Well, let's just say you can thank me for Columbus Day.
I'll be careful.
I don't have time to think of a spell to get rid of these wrinkles.
Help.
We think that outfit will serve as a helpful reminder.
I like her best.
- Hey.
- Hey, how can you stand it?
- The school is freezing.
- Oh, yeah.
Guess I'm too miserable to be miserable.
My Uncle Lloyd's coming to the football game on Friday.
Family members coming to cheer you on.
- It sounds terrible.
- It is terrible.
I can just hear my dad now:
"Lloyd's three boys are first-string."
I never get to play.
Sure you do, that time we were up by 53.
Just once I'd like to start and shut Uncle Lloyd up.
And his two sons who can form sentences.
Well, maybe this Friday You'll start the game
And Uncle Lloyd Will leave in shame
Why are you talking in rhyme?
Kinkle, you're starting on Friday.
- I am?
- You are?
Well, look at that.
I love this carpet.
Yeah, this old thing is gonna go perfectly with the new stuff we made look old.
Hey, Val, look.
The Slicery's under new management.
Wow, that's the first time this month.
And they're looking for people to work after school.
- We should get jobs.
- You think?
Yeah, maybe we could save enough money to buy a car.
Or maybe our parents will get so sick of driving us to work that they'll buy us cars.
- It's win-win.
- All right, I'm in.
But I gotta warn you, I haven't had much luck with jobs.
When I was a camp counsellor, they fired me after two days.
They didn't give you a chance.
- They didn't even get to know you.
- Yeah.
And they eventually found those kids.
Hey.
[HARVEY SNEEZING]
Whoa, didn't mean to make you explode.
I think this cold weather's giving me the flu.
I told you to bundle up for math.
Coach finally gives me a chance to start, and now this.
I can hear my dad now, "Your nose runs faster than you do."
See you.
Poor Harvey.
Feel better.
And you will.
No spells at school unless I gotta And I do, so make it hotter
Well, that concludes your orientation to the Slicery.
I'm Mrs. Popowski.
If you have any problems, my office is always open.
It's between the fryer and the wall.
Mrs. Popowski, there's a mistake on my nametag.
- My name is Sabrina, not Salinas.
- Live with it.
Yeah, and my name is Valerie, not Fred.
When I said "problems," I meant things like:
"My hand is caught in the meatball maker."
Okay, Val, I'll do the dough and the sauce,
- and you do the toppings.
- Check.
[PHONE RINGING]
Slicery.
Okay, that's a large pizza, extra anchovies.
Hold the crust.
Hold the sauce.
Hold the cheese.
Salem, quit fooling around.
Crank call.
Okay.
Medium cheese.
- Medium cheese.
Check.
- Crust.
Sauce.
Cheese.
Oven.
- Check.
- We're a well-oiled machine.
- Okay.
Large pepperoni.
- Large pepperoni.
Check.
Crust.
Sauce.
Pepperoni.
Cheese.
Oh, no.
That was supposed to be cheese, pepperoni.
Okay, large, extra cheese, half mushroom.
Crust.
Sauce.
Things are gonna start hopping.
Weight Watchers meeting just let out.
I'll help.
Think that'll melt down?
- There.
Perfect.
- I don't believe it.
You've taken a beautiful rug and put it in the worst place ever.
Well, where would you put it?
- There.
Perfect.
- Yes, I see.
That is perfect, if we had our eyes gouged out.
[PHONE RINGING]
I need a medium, half sausage, half pepperoni, quarter mushroom, quarter anchovy, extra cheese.
Val, could you get that?
Valerie?
Val, we have to get these pizzas finished now.
- Am I moving?
- No.
How about now?
- Somebody's gonna get fired.
- Oh, gosh.
This is faster than it happened at camp.
I can't tell the future That would make me omniscient
But something bad's gonna happen Unless Val's more efficient
Okay, that's medium, half sausage, half pepperoni, quarter mushroom, quarter anchovy, extra cheese.
Check.
Okay, the inert gases are neon, argon, krypton, leon?
Leon?
Boy, public schools have really gone downhill.
Hi, how you been?
I've been fine.
Let's get this quiz over with.
The fine art of conversation lives.
It's an easy one.
- Just clean up your room.
- It is clean.
Fine.
Here's a quiz I know I'll ace
Put everything back In its rightful place
Hey, that's my diary.
And I was just getting to the awkward teenage years.
Well, that was so easy, I almost feel guilty taking an A.
Well, then this will make you feel a lot better.
- You failed.
- What?
You were only to clean your room, and you "put things back"
where they belong.
That was a very sloppy spell.
With good results.
The room's clean and I busted Salem.
Listen to the man.
It was a sloppy spell.
Clean up your spells.
I still say it was a fine incantation.
Now, talk me through this kissing game,
Seven Minutes in Heaven?
Wow, it's hot in here.
The boiler must be broken.
- What are you doing in my locker?
- Sweating.
Somebody left a heat spell running.
- Uh-oh.
That'd be me.
- I told you to be more precise.
No problem.
I'll fix it with an undo.
Let's see:
It's hot in here It's making us perspire
Undo the spell Or the straits will be dire.
Aah!
What's going on?
I've taken away your undoing privileges, partly to teach you a valuable lesson, partly fun for me.
How about this for fun?
Auditioning for Stomp.
So you can see by these projections, Mrs. Quick, we can easily put out two editions of the paper each week rather than one, and we can do it for 38 percent less money.
Good work, Val.
That's an excellent use of your resources.
- Check.
- Not that we need two papers a week.
You see that?
The efficiency spell I put on Val is working out great.
Oh, it looks good now, and that heat spell looked good too, yesterday.
HARVEY:
Ow.
Ow.
- Harvey, what's the matter?
- I just burned my hand on my locker.
Oh, great, I have enough trouble catching with two good hands.
Now, how do you expect me to fix all this without an undo spell?
That's the part that's fun for me.
Think, Sabrina, think.
Okay, first let's take care of the temperature.
It's hot in here The sweat's a-pooling
So let's get down To some serious cooling
Cool.
Okay, now Harvey.
I got it.
The team doesn't need A Harvey that's tame
So make him worthy Of the hall of fame
See?
All done and no undo.
Oh, yes, but there was a hot front, which is now meeting a cold front, resulting in an occluded front.
- Oh, no.
That means--
- Yep.
Showers.
Everyone outside, where it's not raining.
I meant to do that.
[THUNDER CRASHING]
And that too.
Come on.
Admit it.
That rug would look better in my room.
Please, that rug is an object of taste and refinement.
Your room is decorated with stuff a clown takes out of his pockets at night.
It's gone.
You've put it in your room, haven't you?
I most certainly did not.
Well, it's gotta be around here somewhere, then.
SALEM:
Psst, psst.
Tell you what happened to it for a belly rub.
Hi.
Gotta go to work.
Forgot my nametag.
The ulprit-cay just walked into the oyer-fay.
- What?
- Sabrina did it with an everything-in-its-place spell.
They threatened me.
- What did I do?
- Made our rug disappear.
Sabrina, normally I don't advocate undo spells, but I want that rug back.
I'd love to undo it, but:
- If you can undo this, I can undo that.
- We can't undo that.
There's no undoing a no-can-undo.
It's a triple negative.
It's magically ungrammatical.
Sorry.
I gotta get to work.
We're introducing garlic sticks.
Now how are we gonna get our rug back?
Excuse me.
There's someone whose belly earned a rubbing.
Oh, I know.
Everyone inside is beginning to bug Help them find their stupid lost rug
Close enough.
SALEM:
Come on, you can't vanish and rub at the same time?
- Where are we?
- I don't know.
But I bet I know who's to blame.
- Sabrina.
- Sabrina.
Oh, I'm sure she heard that.
- Salem, that's not helping.
- Hey, there's your rug.
HILDA:
That is our rug.
- That was helping.
You know, this place reminds me of Merlin's old weekend castle.
Oh, man.
You guys had a vicious breakup.
ZELDA:
That was awful.
By the time it was over, the only thing I liked about him was- -this rug.
This is Merlin's castle.
We better get out of here.
Yeah.
For a guy who wears a dress, he's a real misogynist.
Leaving?
So soon?
- Hi, Merl.
- Zelda Spellman.
I haven't seen you in 500 years.
So, what you been up to?
Oh, a little bit of this, a little bit of that.
And you?
Uh...
Waiting for revenge.
- Why don't you stay a while?
- How long a while?
Until you love me again.
How about if I love you?
Or me?
I can be quite tender.
I feel like we've made a hundred pizzas today.
Seventy-four.
Seventy-five.
- Check.
- Fred.
Sabrina, this is hard for me.
I'm your friend,
- but also your supervisor.
- When did you become supervisor?
- Just now.
- Way to go.
I've already celebrated.
Who arranged these pepperonis?
The pepperoni fairy.
Back when I was on the line, I liked to remember the three P's:
precision, placement, promptness.
- You forgot "pannoying."
- You're on your ten-minute break.
Go.
- Spellman.
- Sorry, I must have dozed off.
And you extended your break by 55 seconds.
I'll make it up at the end of the day.
I'll run into the walk-in cooler.
That would be fine if you were still part of the Slicery, but you're fired.
Look at that.
I gave myself two minutes to dismiss you, and it only took one.
Check-a-roonie.
The garlic sticks bite.
- We need a plan.
- How about we weep uncontrollably?
[SALEM SOBBING]
If only we could get a message to Sabrina, she could reverse her spell.
But we can't, so we have to work on Merlin.
Now, one thing I remember about him is he doesn't like to be challenged.
That's right.
You once questioned a word he used in Scrabble, and he turned you into an oryx, which, as I recall, was also the word.
Exactly.
Maybe if we're nice to Merlin, he'll feel sorry for us and let us go.
- So let's not antagonise him.
- Good plan.
- Dead magician walking.
- How is everyone?
- Got everything you need?
SALEM:
No, no, we're fine.
Now that I think about it, I could use a little freedom.
So have you decided to love me again?
I'd rather lick a dead seal.
Am I the only one who remembers the plan?
- Excuse me--
- Oh, shut up, conehead.
It can't be done.
It's a shame you've decided now to be so nasty, just when I was about to feed you.
- You're not gonna feed us?
- That's right.
And they look mighty hungry, so I'd sleep with one eye open, cat.
[SALEM SOBBING]
You're not gonna be able to keep us here forever.
My niece, Sabrina's, gonna find out we're missing, and she's gonna come after us with a lot of help.
And drunken bouncers.
Oh, I'm so scared.
Maybe I ought to send you back.
Wait a minute.
I think I got a better idea.
You're never gonna believe what happened.
My friend-- I mean soon-to-be ex-friend, Val.
--fired me.
And I know what you're gonna say:
"Sloppy spells, more specific:" So please don't.
I'm pooped.
I'm going to bed.
Thanks for listening, guys.
Guess I won't be needing this anymore.
Yes, that was a better idea.
You can always count on a teenager to be self-absorbed.
Attica!
Attica!
Attica!
Please, I'm trying to concentrate on a new escape plan.
Well, why don't you try coming up with some decorating ideas for this cell, because we're never leaving?
I've got it, the perfect escape plan.
It's so simple.
I can't believe I haven't thought of it before.
- What is it?
- You marry Merlin.
What do you think about painting these bars Navajo White?
Come on, Sabrina.
No time for breakfast.
I'm late and I have to try to fix Val.
I can't believe I put a spell on her.
I'm such a dummy.
Sabrina's never gonna save us.
There's no hope.
None.
And the worst part is, we're not gonna die.
We're gonna live here forever without hope.
No hope.
Uh-oh.
I bet I had something to do with this.
- Hot news coming through.
- Hey, Val, got a sec?
No, I have to get out the next edition of the paper.
By typing continuously, I can make it a daily.
You look like you haven't slept.
If I sleep, I won't have time to learn opera.
- Can we talk?
- Friendship is inefficient use of time.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Coming through, sorry.
Harvey?
I think I might have overdone it with the pull-ups.
I can take care of this.
Somehow.
- Blizzard!
- Oh, no.
Think fast.
Block that snow from pouring out
And stick something in That spewing spout
Help, quizmaster.
Are you sure you need help?
I mean, like you said, there's nothing wrong with inexact spells as long as they get the job done.
I got it wrong, very wrong.
It was all wrong.
It was a correctness shutout.
By the way, did I say I was wrong?
Because she admitted She'd been wrong and a lout
Every spell she incanted Will be undone
Including several ones She doesn't even know about
They just have to be exact, not pretty.
[SALEM MUMBLING]
- You wanna shut him up?
- Let's do it together.
SALEM:
Who's going to share--?
Cool.
So all I had to do was admit I was wrong?
And?
And that I have to be more careful with my magic?
And?
And I can learn something from my elders?
And?
And that the barn door on your ski suit is open?
See you.
You'll never believe the day I had.
I've learned so much.
I'll never do an inexact spell again.
In fact, I'm gonna go upstairs and clean my room the old-fashioned way.
We've gotta send something to the quizmaster for undoing Sabrina's spell and saving us.
He strikes me as a cheese-log person.
I am forever grateful.
I don't think I've ever been in a more terrifying situation.
And yet, I remembered to grab the rug.
SALEM:
And I learned a valuable lesson.
Whenever there's a crisis, I can depend on you guys to turn on me.
Come on.
We're sorry.
How about that belly rub?
I'm so cheap.
Lovely.
So how'd it go at the Slicery this weekend?
Terrible.
I fell apart and overcooked some pizzas.
Once the fire department was gone and Mrs. Popowski came to, she asked me to leave.
- How'd you get fired?
- Well, it's a long story.
Hey, Harvey, you really bulked down over the weekend.
- So how'd the game go?
- Great.
I caught a pass.
And if it had been inbounds, it would've been great.
Did anyone bring an umbrella?
I hear it's supposed to rain.
Not indoors.
They fixed the roof.
Let's never talk about it again.
You skipped your breakfast again, didn't you?
Yeah.
I'll catch up with you guys in a minute.
I'm gonna put my books away.
[SCREAMS]
Hey.
Quizmaster, what are you still doing in there?
QUIZMASTER:
My apartment's being painted.
I needed a place to crash.
Well, just don't get cheese log all over my books.
Sabrina, it's Valentine's Day.
You should definitely wear red to the dance.
Yeah, because no one else will have that idea.
Hey, there's Ken.
I'll bet he followed you here.
Stop it.
Hi, Ken.
Valerie.
What do you think?
Picture it with a Wonderbra.
[LAUGHS]
He loves you.
Yeah, that was him asking me to marry him.
Hey, Val, you should get this dress for the dance.
That way you'll be ready if...
Let's see, who might ask you?
Kenny-poo?
This is a great dress.
- Look at the price.
Ouch.
- Oh, well.
My mom's plaid formal has a certain charm.
[MOANING]
Oh!
Now, I didn't do that.
- Hey, Val.
You didn't see this tag.
- Wow, 20 percent off.
Hey, with a sale like this,
I might be able to afford an even better dress.
Val, this one.
I-
- I think it's a Presidents' Day sale, and all the other dresses are Canadian.
Do you like my wedding dress?
I'm on my way, Val, as soon as I find my red sweater.
SALEM:
I'm reading.
Yes, I've been listening to what you said.
Let me recap: "Ken, Ken, Ken." See you.
Salem, my sweater.
Did you do this?
Hey, I was as shocked as you.
We have a major moth problem.
Oh.
By the way,
Zelda and I are chaperoning the school dance Friday.
What?
Why don't you just hang a big "nerd girl" sign around my neck?
Okay.
Nobody likes a house where you can't speak figuratively.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Hello, Sabrina.
- Actually, I was here--
- My Aunt Hilda is right in there.
Oh, you dropped your "nerd girl" sign.
- Thanks.
- What can we do for you, Mr. Kraft?
Well, I heard you were chaperoning, so I thought I'd drop off the dance rules.
Okay, then.
Be careful driving home.
Our street tends to be slick.
You know, I will be at the dance myself, and I was just thinking, you know, if the kids are under control, and there's a slow dance--
You know, especially watch the dip at the bottom of the hill.
- I will.
Okay.
HILDA:
Very dangerous.
And thanks for the rules.
We'll make sure there's no--
Racketeering?
We have to get dates or you have to kill me.
Do you have any more money?
- We don't have enough for a tip.
- I think I'm wiped out.
Let me see.
There.
Fifty cents.
Think it's the thought that counts?
- Hi, Mrs. Popowski.
- Salinas.
Wow, two whole quarters.
Won't have to sweat the rent this month.
Emergency.
We just ran out of money, and for once, I'm actually being fun.
- We're tapped out.
- Oh.
Great.
Ken's leaving.
Hey, Val, we won some free ones.
I shall have to postpone my victory dance.
It's my lucky day.
Gotta call the mister.
It's steak tonight.
Where's my algebra book?
- Looking for this?
- Roland.
Give me that.
You're a finder, not a taker.
Not anymore.
I've changed careers.
I'm an equaliser.
By the way, you look lovely.
- A what?
- An equaliser.
You take from someone, I take from you.
It evens things out in the universe.
And this job has dental.
- What have I taken?
- Well, let's see.
You took 20 percent off a dress, I took 20 percent of your sweater.
You took pinball games, I took your algebra book.
- Sabrina, who is this gentleman?
- Roland, my cousin.
And who's this bozo?
Your new boyfriend?
Our vice principal.
Roland, perhaps you missed the sign stating that all visitors must report to the office before wandering aimlessly around the school grounds.
Are you implying that I can't read?
Sorry, he's hypoglycemic.
KRAFT:
Nurse!
- I want my sweater fixed.
- Hey, Sabrina.
- Oh.
Look who it is.
Farm boy.
Isn't this your aunts' friend that I met last year?
If that's who I said he was.
Wanna make something of it, farm boy?
Not really.
I just wanted to tell Sabrina something about the dance on Friday.
Ooh.
Are we going to the dance together?
Mind if I throw up?
What I wanted to tell you was that--
I can't go to the dance.
I have to accompany my dad to a termite convention.
I can't believe I forgot about it.
I don't even remember hearing about it.
Okay, we're up to the Z's, and so far, every man we know is either married, busy or disgusting.
Several were all three.
What's wrong with you?
You've got a date for Valentine's Day.
Not anymore.
I'm being equalised.
[GASPS]
Oh, please say you didn't take anyone's pet.
So I wasn't stealing, per se.
I was just trying to help Valerie.
We understand, but it was still wrong.
I took Belgium once to help Napoleon.
Big trouble.
What do I do?
I have to get rid of Roland.
He still wants to marry me.
You have to give back the things you took.
Okay, I'll just zap the dress into the store and some money into the pinball machine.
- Goodbye love-smitten equaliser.
- No, it's not that easy.
When you're equalising, you have to put forth more effort.
Basically, you have to give things back by hand.
Which is how I came to participate in a little thing called Waterloo.
Let me get this straight.
You felt so bad about the other night that you came all the way down here to give me money to give to the pinball-machine man.
- If you don't mind.
- No, of course not.
The pinball man is always running himself ragged bringing you kids extra napkins or refilling your free drinks.
No one works harder than the pinball-machine man.
Great.
So you don't mind.
ZELDA:
Well, I think we should.
I'm against it.
That guy gives me the willies.
Fine, you're the one who wants a date.
You're right.
Okay, let's do it.
Love is special, love is alive Send me Cupid for 5.95
- You look awful.
- Hilda, it's his busy time of year.
Oh, that's not it.
I was just left at the altar.
My fiancée ran off with a policeman.
She never could resist a man in clothes.
- You wore that to get married?
- It was a formal wedding.
That's enough.
I'm getting out of the love business.
I think it's time to resign ourselves to the obvious.
We're not meant to have dates for this dance.
Maybe you can, but I can't, not with Willard Kraft and his Binaca breath.
I'll bet I can get him to snap out of it.
Come on, Cupie.
How much did you really like her?
[SOBBING]
Why?
There you go.
One debt erased.
Great, but I can't ask Valerie to return the dress.
She loves it too much.
- You could sew a duplicate.
- Sew?
I can't even staple correctly.
Sewing's easy.
I just sewed a bed skirt last weekend.
Do your aunts have a sewing room?
In the dungeon, next to the bomb shelter.
A spinning wheel?
What, a loom is too high tech?
I can't do this.
All witches can spin.
Just sit down and give it a whirl, so to speak.
Why do I have the feeling you're gonna tell me your real name is Rumpelstiltskin?
This will make you believe in love again.
"What can you say about a 25-year-old girl who died?"
Good riddance.
[PHONE RINGS]
Hello?
Hi, Valerie.
I'll call Sabrina.
Sabrina.
SALEM:
She's in the dungeon with Roland.
ZELDA:
In the dungeon?
SALEM:
Yeah.
- Is there any leftover pie?
- Valerie, she'll call you back.
- Hey.
- Yes, there's pie.
This is great.
I think I may have found my old-age hobby.
Wow, I never noticed how inviting this spinning-wheel spindle is.
- Do you think it would prick me?
- No.
Give it a try.
And this is my lovely bride.
CROWD:
Ooh.
[SNORING]
Touch it.
Touch it.
Roland.
Stop.
How dare you try to prick Sabrina's finger on that spindle so you could run off with her?
What?
I was only gonna keep her for a century or two.
- What?
- You know very well that Sleeping Beauty spells are illegal ever since, well, Sleeping Beauty.
Hold it.
Roland, I thought we settled this last time.
- I'm not interested in marrying you.
- Dating?
Fine.
But we're still not square.
See, how she lays her hand upon her cheek!
Ken just found out he got the part of Romeo in the school play.
- How can you tell?
- He's so much fun.
- I wish he'd ask me to the dance.
- Why don't you ask him?
Because if he doesn't ask me,
I can always assume that it slipped his mind.
But if I ask him and he says no, no amount of delusion will fix it.
Tell you what.
Why don't I feel him out for you?
As long as you're willing to lie about anything negative.
Absolutely.
- Hi, Ken.
- Sabrina.
What light through yonder window breaks?
Explosion in the chem. lab?
I was just wondering if you were taking anyone to the dance on Friday.
Why, Sabrina, I'd lovest to go.
- Thou hast stolen my heart.
- No--
Valerie.
Valerie.
- Stole a mortal's heart, eh?
- No, he was just goofing.
Sabrina, you took his heart, I'm taking yours.
Still need that hall pass, mister.
And now your heart belongs to me.
Sabrina.
Are you going to the dance with Ken?
Wait for me, my darling.
Okay.
You can look.
I love it.
Well, it's not as big as a castle, but I just feel more at home under a bridge.
[RUMBLING]
What's that sound?
Oh, that's just the billy goats crossing.
You'll get used to it.
It's like living near an airport.
Who's this?
That's just my old girlfriend, Thumbelina.
Well, the picture has to go.
- You're all mine now.
- Yes, ma'am.
So, what do you wanna do?
- Gaze lovingly into your eyes.
- Okay.
Oh, come on.
You've gotta cheer up.
I mean, I need a date, and...
I need a date.
So how goes it with diaper dan?
Well, it's more challenging than building the Panama Canal, but then, less malaria.
Look.
- What?
You're fighting a yawn?
- A smile.
You told a joke and it made me smile.
I've seen bigger on a Lutheran.
I can't believe it.
I thought I'd never smile again.
You're cured.
Hallelujah.
Now, there's the most adorable fireman down the street.
And I owe it all to you, Hilda.
- My Hilda.
- Uh-oh.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
I'll get it.
- Hello, Hilda.
- Oh, great.
One more gentleman caller, and we can put on The Glass Menagerie.
- Who's he?
- Who's he?
I am someone who has the decency not to wear a diaper in front of a lady.
- What?
Why, you--
- Come on, just--
ZELDA:
What on Earth?
KRAFT:
Get your hands off her.
Willard, what do you want?
Well, I came to speak to you about your niece's strange behaviour in school with her cousin.
- Cousin?
Roland.
- Cousin?
Roland.
I have a bad feeling about this.
I'm gonna call Valerie.
I'll help her.
- Afraid to show your legs?
- Nice perm.
She's not at Valerie's.
- The Other Realm.
- Let's go.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
- You, go.
- You, come.
But why does he get to...?
Oh, man.
- Why did you bring him along?
- So we could use the car-pool lane.
I made you a personal pan pizza.
Is there anything else I could do to make you ecstatically happy?
Pepper flakes?
CUPID:
Wait up, Hildie.
HILDA:
Go away.
ZELDA:
Maybe we should have ditched him at Stuckey's.
That sounds like my aunts.
Aunt Zelda.
Aunt Hilda.
- Cupid?
- He's in love with me.
Ignore him.
- We're here to rescue you.
- Rescue me?
But I love it here.
I love this mouldy home.
I love Roland.
Okay, what have you done to her?
I think I know, sweetie.
I am in the love biz.
He's taken her heart.
It was a fair deal.
She stole a boy's heart, I took hers.
You are not allowed to equalise for your own benefit.
- Give it back now.
- No, I don't want it back.
I want my Roly to keep it forever and ever.
Did you also give her a saccharine pill?
Sabrina has spoken.
Now, if you'll excuse us, the ogre and his lady friend are coming over for dinner.
And there's not enough entrails for everyone.
ROLAND:
That's right.
- Hilda, love of my life.
- Oh, no, not another one.
- Roland.
- Sabrina, the other love of my life.
Help me.
I love you.
But I still love you.
Why did you hit me with that arrow?
So that you would see that it's wrong to mess with people's hearts.
Unless you're a licensed professional.
Give Sabrina's heart back.
Now.
I will if you'll grant me one favour.
It better not involve me and a trip to Make-Out Point.
I will grant you one request within reason.
- But first, the heart.
- No, I don't care if he does love Hilda.
I still want Roland-
- Away from me.
Yuck.
I can't believe I was eating soup out of a sheep's stomach.
- Are you sure you don't wanna stay?
- Very sure.
But if I change my mind about living in hell with a man I can't stand, I'll let you know.
I'm out of here.
How about you?
Not if you were the last troll living under a bridge on Earth.
Don't worry.
It was only a cheapo infatuation arrow.
- It will wear off by sundown.
- Good.
My feelings, however, are the real thing.
[GROANS]
Now, Roland, what is your request?
Granted.
[DANCE MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
Can't believe Aunt Zelda granted your wish to come to one dance with me.
- You want me to spin you again?
- No.
I'm still mad at you for taking Harvey away.
Boy, you really know how to hold a grudge.
I'm gonna go request another disco song so we can bump.
- So how's your date working out?
- Okay.
He's not so bad once you put pants on him.
Yeah.
But maybe he should have taken the diaper off first.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Listen, Val, I didn't--
- Sabrina, I'm not mad at you.
It's not your fault Ken doesn't like me.
And believe it or not, I don't think it's my fault.
Good for you.
Hey, if you wanna dance, I'll share Roland.
In fact, I'll give you 5 bucks to take him off my hands.
- Great.
There's Ken.
- How did you spot him?
Miss Birkhead, this is a social event.
It is not a place for conversation.
Will you stop that?
I know these are practical, but, darn it, fashion means something to me.
Mind if I borrow your date?
Okay, but bring him back if there's a slow song.
I don't wanna look like a loser.
- Okay, see that girl over there?
- Yeah.
Okay, I want you to work your magic to make him attracted to her.
Oh, shoot, you didn't bring your arrows.
Hilda wouldn't let me.
Never fear.
I brought a peashooter and love peas.
Can't do it.
It would be a waste of a pea.
You mean there's no hope for those two?
No, there's no need.
That boy is already crazy about that girl.
- He's just shy.
- Ken, shy?
Well, some people cover up shyness with bravado.
Well, the job requires a certain amount of psychology.
Well, if it's true that Ken likes Val, then maybe there's a little something I can do.
Wanna dance?
I'd love to.
I've been wishing you'd ask.
Miss Birkhead, that punch will not serve itself.
Thanks.
Excuse us.
Would you give Zelda a little evening's affection?
Look, I don't wanna be working all night.
But for you, okay.
- Oh, dear Lord.
- Two birds with one stone.
Zelda's happy, and that goob is no longer fishing in my creek.
Gross to what you just said, and gross to what you just did.
- May I have this dance?
- Oh, yes.
- The deal was one dance.
- I know.
I want to apologise.
I was wrong to try and steal your heart through magic.
I just wanted you to like me.
That was nice.
Roland, I like it when you're nice.
- So we're engaged?
- No.
Look, I wanna equalise what I did to you.
You're gonna set up a large trust fund?
No.
SABRINA:
Harvey.
I can't believe I thought I had to go to a father-son termite convention.
According to my dad, there is no such thing.
Well, now that you're here, you wanna dance?
You bet.
[SLOW DANCE MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
Thumby?
[MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
[PEOPLE CHEERING]
[SALEM LAUGHING]
It's not funny, Salem.
Morning.
[SCREAMS]
Why did Salem startle me?
It's Friday the 13th, the day that black witch-cats have the power to scare the living daylights out of people.
SALEM:
You should've seen your face.
I gotta stop laughing or milk's gonna come out of my nose.
Here comes Hilda.
Act normal.
Good morning, Hilda.
[HILDA SCREAMS]
[LAUGHING]
Oh, happy Friday the 13th, Salem.
Aunt Hilda, a bat just flew out of your mouth.
Oh, how embarrassing.
I have bat breath again.
Have you been eating pomegranates?
I know they don't agree with me, but I had a craving for crimson pulp.
Is it bad?
[BATS SQUEAKING]
Look, a tour group.
I have to update my wardrobe.
[THUNDER CRASHES]
Great.
Can we get this quiz over with?
I have to get to school.
There's no quiz.
I just came by to tell you it's Friday the 13th.
I already told her.
[GASPS]
I might not even take a nap today.
There's more to Friday the 13th than black cats with a sorry sense of humour.
To learn more, read about it.
Like I have time for this.
"Eleventh hour, 12th of never, 13th, Friday the."
What?
I can do that?
Why didn't you guys tell me that on Friday the 13th I can tell a mortal I'm a witch?
Oh.
The one where you can tell anyone and they can know for 24 hours?
- Yes.
- We didn't want you to know.
Well, I learned it on the streets.
- Who should I tell, Harvey or Valerie?
HILDA:
Oh, Sabrina.
Telling mortals is a very bad idea.
But I wanna come out of the linen closet.
We felt the same way when we were your age, but you think you know someone...
This is a secret that's hard for mortals to accept.
When I was younger, I was dating a doctor.
You've probably heard of him.
My little apple strudel.
Oh, Sigmund.
Are you ready for the opera, my dear?
Yes.
But first, there's something that I must tell you.
Ah.
Something about your childhood?
You hate your mother, don't you?
- No.
- Really?
I hate your mother.
Today is Friday the 13th, and there's something that I get to share with you.
Sigmund, my darling, I'm a witch.
Oh, well, you can be a little testy.
No, no.
I have real magical powers.
Uh-huh.
Can you show me these magical powers?
Well, you remember that pocket watch that you admired?
For you, Siggy.
Get out of here.
Witch.
Witch.
Take her out of here.
We can make it work.
This didn't happen.
It was bad knackwurst.
Ja, that's right.
Once I got loose, I tripped him.
You might say it was the first Freudian slip.
Guys overreact.
You should've told a girlfriend.
I did.
I told my good friend Gwendolyn.
We were out shopping, and everything was going well...
GWENDOLYN:
This is some joy.
- Why didn't thou tell me sooner?
- Well.
Make yon man's breeches rip.
Gwendolyn was a lot of fun, but what a blabbermouth.
She told everyone she knew, and then some.
Forsooth, 'tis true.
Zelda's a witch.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
ZELDA:
They didn't take it very well.
MAN:
She made the crops fail.
It's her.
ZELDA:
And then things really got ugly.
ALL [SHOUTING]:
Dunk the witch!
Dunk the witch!
To this day I don't care for swimming.
Yeah, but by midnight, mortals don't remember.
So even if they hate you, the next day it's over.
They don't remember, but you remember.
Think long and hard about this, Sabrina.
If you tell someone, you may never feel the same way about that person again.
Well, this was uplifting.
Thanks.
I'll think about it.
[TYRES SCREECHING AND HORN HONKING]
SALEM:
Just spooked a bread truck.
The street is full of buns.
- Hi, Libby.
- Ew.
Why doesn't she like me?
I'm thinking it's a thyroid problem.
- Why do you care?
- Because I'd love to be popular.
You know, to have everyone respect me.
- Bye, Libby.
- I just ate.
- Any plans for your free period?
- Just my usual doodlefest.
You think you can help me study for my Spanish test?
I have it after Study Hall, and if I don't get at least a B, I'm toast.
Sure.
[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
- What?
- I will help you.
I could live with a C.
Excuse me.
Somebody didn't eat their vegetables.
What are you doing?
You look ridiculous.
State law says I have to wear a hairnet.
Come on.
It's time for a test of your endurance.
We're off to Alaska for the Iditarod.
Oh, but what about Valerie?
Sabrina?
Sabrina?
Where did she go?
A nerd ditched by a freak.
It's like a movie of the week.
Now, say goodbye to bat breath.
Oh, I hope it works.
[COUGHING]
Oh, great.
Now I have bass breath.
Still think I'm on the right track.
[THUNDER CRASHES]
You passed.
Now get to class.
Mush.
Oh, I missed Social Studies.
You had a substitute.
He spent the entire day trying to open his desk drawer.
But here's your homework.
Great.
I had an easy class, and I smell like blubber.
Valerie.
Valerie.
Valerie, I'm so sorry I took off like that.
I failed my Spanish test.
At least I think F means the same thing in both languages.
- I'm so incredibly sorry.
- I thought you were my friend.
- Just forget it.
- Valerie, wait.
There's something I need to tell you.
You're my best friend and I've been lying to you.
I wanted to tell you the biggest secret, and then maybe you'll understand why I've disappeared in the cafeteria and been acting strange pretty much all the time.
I'm a witch.
I knew you could be a little grumpy sometimes, but--
No.
I have magical powers.
Right.
Well, can you show me some magic?
You know that sweater you've always wanted?
Get out of here.
This is so cool.
Well, it's so cool that you think it's so cool.
And you have no desire whatsoever to have me committed?
No.
But I do have a few questions.
[BELL RINGS]
That whole pointed-hat, wart-on-the-nose thing?
Pure Hollywood.
You don't cook potions in a cauldron?
- Now that one we do.
- This is amazing.
So you just point at stuff, and stuff happens?
That's the technical definition of it.
- Well, can we point at stuff now?
- You bet.
Shh.
Isn't he that weird lunch lady?
Valerie, I'd like you to meet my quizmaster.
Isn't this great?
I can show her all my magic.
Well, not all your magic.
You need a ticket for each time you use magic with a mortal.
This one's for the sweater.
Why do I need tickets?
Mortals don't have a lot of restraint when it comes to magic or firearms.
Quiz you later.
Hey.
Pop out the way you popped in, with all that lightning-and-smoke stuff.
See what I mean?
I blame television.
It's pointing time.
[SCREAMING]
I've discovered the cure.
Eureka.
It's all in this little tablet.
Just give it to me.
Testing, one, two, three.
Yes.
It worked.
- Thanks, sister.
- I'm not just your sister.
I'm a genius.
I can end hunger.
I can save the world.
Oh, for crying out loud, it's a breath mint.
Oh, no.
Señora Martinez.
I'd almost forgotten about my F.
Hola, Valerie.
That means "hello."
Hola.
Señora Martinez?
[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]
Of course I'll give you a second exam.
You've obviously been studying.
I love magic.
There's Harvey.
You've gotta tell him about this.
No, no, wait.
Valerie.
Sabrina's a witch.
[PEOPLE SHOUTING]
Valerie told me your secret.
Yeah.
It's true.
Not really.
Yeah.
Here.
Have some baseball cleats.
HARVEY:
Whoa!
I'm a witch.
- Can we talk about this?
- Sure.
A witch?
So "freak" was an understatement.
So, what is this Other Realm?
Little place we call the witchy city.
[SCREAMS]
Salem talks?
And I have a pretty good singing voice.
And he stops.
Okay.
We're off to the Other Realm.
Sabrina, you're walking into a closet.
After all you've seen today, this seems weird?
Come on.
VALERIE:
It's still a closet.
SABRINA:
Will you wait?
[THUNDER CRASHING]
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING]
- Wow.
- So, what do we do here?
Same thing we do in the mortal realm:
hang out.
MAN:
Balloon.
Buy your mortal a balloon.
I'll take two.
MAN:
I know.
I have tomato sauce on my tie.
So, what magic does the balloon do?
MAN:
Nothing.
Sucker.
Carney workers.
Hey, I could use some sunglasses.
Wow.
These are awesome.
You should get some.
I have a whole drawer full of virtual-reality sunglasses.
Wow, that's amazing.
You can look dorky in this realm too.
LIBBY:
Of course it's true.
I heard it with my own ears and have seen it with my own eyes.
Sabrina's a witch.
[ALL CHATTERING]
Okay, okay.
The next step is to decide how to use this piece of information.
How can this help me?
Thanks for the cure, Zeldy.
Now I can enjoy pomegranate pudding, pomegranate compote, pomegranate pie.
I like pomegranates.
This is what it's all about for me.
Enabling you to eat too much fruit.
[BELL RINGS]
A message from the Other Realm.
I hope it didn't ruin my pomegranate toast.
It's from Elixir Pharmaceuticals.
They heard about my discovery.
They want me to come do a demonstration with my subject.
SALEM:
Me.
Take me.
A whole other realm of people to scare?
Yeah, take him.
There's no way I'm going to humiliate myself in front of a bunch of eggheads.
Fine.
Then no more cure.
And that means no more pomegranates.
Egghead.
Okay.
We only have two tickets left.
So for the grand finale, you each get to make a last wish.
- I wanna meet Mark Langston.
- Who?
Mark Langston.
My favourite pitcher.
Four all-star games, and he can really bring the heat.
Well, I'm assuming since it's your last wish, that's a good thing.
I saw him the day he no-hit the Mariners.
Harvey.
[GASPING]
- Hey, how's it going, man?
- Pretty good.
- How about warming me up?
- Sure.
Please don't let this be a dream.
Oh, this is great.
Mark Langston just broke all my fingers.
I know what I want.
Say Mark Langston, we could save a ticket.
No.
My guy's funny, he can really move and he's so cute.
The Dalai Lama can dance?
Drew Carey.
I wanna dance with Drew Carey.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Thanks for the dance, Valerie.
This is the best moment of my life.
Gee, I wish I had a rose to give you.
Oh, I know.
Here.
Have these.
Hope you're nearsighted.
SABRINA:
Was it fun?
I'm never taking these off.
Man, he's blind.
WOMAN:
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
- And you saw it with your own eyes?
- That's right.
Your children are going to school with a proven witch.
- Oh, we've gotta get her out.
- Exactly.
But first things first.
I get anything good in her locker.
Now that the pomegranate has been administered, observe what happens when Subject A speaks.
Subject A has a name.
Now open your mouth wide, so that they can see the severity of your condition.
SALEM:
Oh, good.
I'm late.
[PEOPLE GASPING]
Hey.
Let's take a look inside your mouths.
Did you see?
Mark Langston signed my bruise.
You're gonna have to describe it to me, because I can't see a...
- ...thing!
- Valerie!
- Aah!
- Harvey!
Oh, no.
Not a swirling vortex.
Take it easy.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Don't panic.
This is bad.
This is very bad.
Hey, help me.
My friends are swirling.
MAN:
Why don't you just zap them out?
- I'm out of tickets.
I guess you lost your head.
My findings suggested that if I took two parts boric acid and combined it with the shells of dung beetles...
You said those were raisins.
[SALEM YAWNS]
What a snore.
I need a little fresh air and a latte.
MAN:
Come see the mortals in a vortex.
Only two tickets.
Reach for my hand!
Why didn't I listen?
Harvey and Valerie are gonna be sucked into oblivion, and if they come out alive, they're gonna think I'm a monster.
MAN:
Come on, oblivion.
- You've got tickets.
Give me tickets.
MAN:
No.
They're mine.
- Come on, you headless goon.
SALEM:
Yo, Sabrina.
- I just had 20 lattes.
MAN:
Black cat.
Stop the vortex.
Are you guys okay?
MAN:
I'm fine!
Yeah, yeah, thanks for the tickets.
You guys hate me?
No.
And I'm beginning to understand why Scotsmen wear kilts.
Nice and breezy.
We've gotta get a picture of this.
Do one nice thing today?
MAN:
Oh, all right.
But I have to warn you, I tend to cut people's heads off.
Oh, I forgot.
Here's your sleeve.
Wow, you guys were near death and you still managed to save my sleeve.
- Near death?
- Anyway, thanks for everything.
Being a witch is so much more fun when you can tell your friends.
You're so lucky.
The only secret I have is that I'm allergic to watermelon.
Well, that's out.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
There's the witch.
Is it true you have magical powers?
Don't ask her.
She won't admit to anything.
Ask them.
They'll corroborate my story.
What's this all about?
Come on, Harvey.
I've got a book deal in the works and a piece of it could be yours.
Libby, are you having another episode?
Forget him.
He's been under her spell since she first flew in.
- Tell them, Valerie.
- No.
You know it's the truth.
If you back me up on this, I won't forget about it.
None of the popular girls will.
I hate to do this, but...
I have no idea what you're talking about.
You freaks are so infuriating.
Looks like another high-school prank.
She is a witch.
And an extraterrestrial.
Look, do an alien autopsy.
You guys.
Wow, it's after midnight.
My parents are gonna wonder where I've been.
Where have I been?
Just hanging out.
Oh, man.
My hand is throbbing.
I've got a little motion sickness.
Did we break any laws?
Not really.
See you.
What are you hiding?
Sneaky.
What is it?
Nothing.
It's just a package of Bat-breath Savers.
How could you?
Look at my hair.
Well, at least you can eat all the pomegranates you want.
I'm sick of pomegranates.
Hey, you still up?
Yeah.
So how was your day?
Well, I told Valerie, and Valerie told Harvey that I'm a witch.
Oh, how did it go?
Honey, are you okay?
You were right.
I'll never feel the same way about Valerie or Harvey again.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I like them so much more.
HILDA:
How come you have better friends than we did?
So no matter how many people Libby told, they've all forgotten by now.
- That's the way it works.
- Good.
I wanted to make sure I wasn't gonna be burned at the stake Monday.
[SALEM SNORING]
Oh, he had some Friday the 13th.
Poor little guy wore himself out.
Oh, he looks so peaceful.
Should we?
[AIR HORN BLARING]
[SALEM GASPS]
That's okay.
I have another eight lives.
Seven after I fall down from here.
Hilda's still not back from her audition?
No.
That's Spanish for "no."
Well, I hope she got the job.
It's so hard for her to find a place to play around here.
Yeah, her musical talent is a wonderful gift.
And she needs to bore other people with it.
Let's face it.
Classical music isn't the gravy train it used to be.
It's not like the golden age.
Vienna in the 1700s.
In those days there were more orchestras than consumption wards.
And you were never ostracized for eating a dead rat in public.
Aunt Hilda's so talented, I'm sure she got this job.
And she has a very strange way of celebrating.
Should I get my ears pierced?
Hey, guess what.
The school's having a battle of the bands.
- And I signed us up.
- I didn't know we were a band.
Every group had to start somewhere.
Usually in a garage.
We can leapfrog that and start in the gym.
What do you say?
We could have cool outfits.
- We could work on dance moves.
- Put together a light show.
- I always wanted to be in a band.
- Me too.
We're in.
- Great.
- So does anyone here actually know how to play an instrument?
- I'm so close.
- Why don't you drop cold fusion and work on an ink that doesn't stain your fingers?
All I need is a formula patented by Dr. Terdlington.
Which means I would have to call him and ask for permission.
Oh, no.
Isn't he that guy you had to compete with for the Other Realm research grant?
Exactly.
Zelda Spellman made a strong impression with her paper
"Polymers:
More Uses Than You Think."
But the winner is Dr. Clark Terdlington.
It's been an unbearably long evening of dull speeches, so I'll make this brief.
I'm better than you.
It was so unlike me, but I just couldn't stand his arrogance.
And now it turns out I need that sanctimonious blowhard.
Oh, just call him.
Tell him that you changed your medication and that you're feeling better.
That always works for me.
- Wish me luck.
- Another classical audition?
Sort of.
Okay, you got the job.
You're our new strolling fiddler.
Was it my Beethoven?
It's just that you fit into the costume.
Sabrina!
Oh, thank goodness.
No one was injured.
- How do we sound?
- Stay in school.
Well, if it isn't the Electric Freak Orchestra.
And by the way, the cheerleaders have a band, and we're gonna win.
- She doesn't know that.
- Yes, I do.
Cheerleaders always win.
And geeks always lose.
I believe they call that the natural order.
I do not want to lose to Libby.
We have to get good, and we have to get good soon.
We're not good?
Dr. Terdlington, that is so kind of you.
Of course you're aware that it's kind.
I'll see you soon.
That pompous swine might let me use his formula.
I'm gonna be able to give the world cold fusion.
Super.
What does it mean?
May I play something for you gentlemen?
Perhaps some Chopin, Mozart?
If one of them wrote "Turkey in the Straw."
It was kind of hard to hear, but we suck, right?
And that was with gym echo.
I hope someone brought some baking soda, because something stinks in here.
Oh.
Look.
It's Sabrina's band.
I'd think of a snappy comeback, but it's true.
Okay.
Hit it.
There's a little bit of me in you
A little bit in everything you do
You still stuck on that whole "us winning" thing?
Come on.
It's not so bad.
I mean, the only difference between us and them is they're talented.
Makes you wonder if Hitler was actually a good painter.
Libby insults you because she's jealous.
I don't think so.
Is there a spell that can make dogs howl every time she opens her mouth?
You have to be careful how you treat people.
Even rotten people.
You might regret it one day.
Dr. Terdlington.
I believe this whoopee cushion is yours.
For instance, today.
And I thought giving Henry VIII a sponge bath was the low point of my life.
I had no idea you could bottle talent.
Where do you think that expression comes from?
A six-pack of refreshing talent, now with the handy twist-top.
Cool.
But I won't use it unless it's absolutely necessary.
Hey, I don't care how you justify it.
Promise you won't tell Aunt Hilda or Zelda?
Mum's the word.
Howdy, y'all.
Hi.
So how'd the gig go?
Lousy.
I tried to merge the worlds of art and prime rib, but I failed.
Well, the important part is that you tried.
Gotta go.
I'm glad Zelda left the labtop open.
Think I'll whip up some seasonings to make those Philistines at the steak house appreciate good music.
Not a peep out of you.
Mum's the word.
Ooh.
Déjà vu.
Excuse me!
Excuse m-- Put a sock in it!
Thank you.
Now, I understand that everyone has been informed that I am judging the band contest tonight.
- Yes.
- Okay, so no talent isn't the only thing against us.
Well, that information is incorrect.
For me to judge the contest would be unfair.
Now you've lost me.
The contest will be judged by the producer of Rock and a Hard Place...
Westbridge's only cable TV showcase for local bands.
- ...
Dwayne Kraft.
- Kraft?
Yes, Dwayne Kraft.
My nephew.
Thank you so much for reconsidering and giving me a chance to plead my case, Dr. Terdlington.
And apologise.
Mostly I just want you to apologise.
Fits together perfectly
The Libby Chessler Generation!
Maybe we should've taken lessons.
Come on, you guys, we can do it.
Follow that, Freaka McEntire.
It's necessary.
Well, I'm thirsty.
How about you guys?
Want a drink?
- No, thanks.
I'm full.
- And I'm prone to gastritis.
Come on.
I need the money on the empties.
Okay, it's only fair that I let the final band compete,
Although the expression "just a formality" certainly comes to mind.
Please welcome
Entry Number 5.
- We forgot to come up with a name.
- Just play.
Two, three, four...
One way
One way or another
I'm gonna find you
I'm gonna getcha, getcha Getcha, getcha
One way or another
I'm gonna win you
I'm gonna getcha, getcha Getcha, getcha
One way or another
I'm gonna see you
I wanna meetcha, meetcha Meetcha, meetcha
One day maybe next week
I'm gonna meetcha
I'm gonna meetcha, I'll meetcha
I will
Drive past your house
And if
The lights are all down
I'll see who's around
One way or another
I'm gonna getcha, I'll getcha
I'll getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
One way or another
Okay, fine.
Fine.
Do we have a winner here, judge?
The best band in this battle is Entry Number 5!
Hello, Westbridge.
Are you ready to rock 'n' roll?
Listen.
I'd love to send a crew over here, tape you guys for my show.
Yeah!
Well, let me talk it over with my band.
- Okay, we'll do it.
- All right.
Aunt Zelda, we won.
You should've seen the look on Libby's face.
Shock and disbelief really become her.
I hope you remembered what I said about being mean to people.
Zelda.
Have you decided to forgive me yet?
Not yet.
Another one might help.
So close.
It's a great--
Sabrina, I wrote a song for our TV debut, but the drummer has a problem with it.
Take a look at it.
Valerie, you wrote a song called "My Valerie"?
Wait till you see what he wants to do.
I drew up some ideas for a complete new look for the band.
That's you and Val.
Why are we dressed like worms?
They're brown unitards.
It's a comment on an asexual society.
And I'm the universal love being, signified by the goat ears and the sleeveless spandex vestments.
- "Love being"?
- Yeah, but we can't sing about me.
- I'm trying to change America.
- Oh, yeah?
Hold it.
Why are we fighting?
We're friends.
Because he has a stupid idea.
Oh, yeah.
I am not gonna perform dressed like a bug.
- This is my band.
- Your band?
Lady, we don't need no pepper.
Oh, no, this is classical seasoning.
It adds taste.
How come you ain't playing that "Turkey in the Straw" I asked for?
You know what would be simply marvellous?
Yes, some incredibly obscure Wagner.
If you insist.
"Valerie, my Valerie, foxy little junior walking down the street.
Valerie, my Valerie--"
Would you be terribly upset if I threw up in one of your shoes?
Salem, what am I gonna do?
Well, you've always been able to talk things out with Harvey.
- Hello.
- Hey, Harvey, it's Sabrina.
Hey.
So you gonna wear the brown suit?
- Uh, no.
Listen--
- Hold on.
He put me on hold.
Since when does Harvey have Muzak?
Hey.
Sorry about that.
I didn't know so many chicks had my home number.
- You're listed.
- Hold on.
Hey, sweetness.
Let me dump Sabrina, and I'll be right back--
That's okay, goat boy, I'll dump you.
I wish I'd never given them a swig of talent.
It's ruining our friendship, and I can't even enjoy winning.
Perhaps you're feeling bad because Libby sang with genuine talent and deserved to win.
Don't hit me.
Great, now I feel annoyed and guilty.
If you want your friendships back, maybe you should take the fizz out of the egos you inflated.
- I wish I could.
- You can.
They take a sip of flat talent, they go flat too.
Great.
So I'll just let these go flat, and when I see Harvey and Valerie tonight, they'll drink, and we'll go back to being talentless friends.
Did you pop one for yourself?
Me?
I haven't been affected by having things go my way.
Oh, please.
Little Miss "I'm Too Cool To Do My History Homework."
I had an autograph signing.
Okay.
Libby, are you here for the show?
Please.
I have a date tonight, and I left my sweater here.
I go to the carnival when I want to see sideshow oddities.
Maybe these won't be necessary.
Maybe Harvey and Val will show up and be their old selves.
Please.
Don't they have roadies to do that?
- Drink?
- No, thanks.
I asked for clear soda.
And I don't see the blackened-tuna papaya hummus we demanded.
Don't they know who we are?
Come on.
Let's split one.
They're good.
We'll grab some eats, and I'll tell the others about you joining the band.
- What?
- What?
Hi.
Sabrina, Valerie,
I'd like you to meet Sunset.
You can't just bring someone into the band.
Especially someone named Sunset.
You said.
Listen, I'm the rhythm section, and I say--
- Oh, excuse me, drummer boy.
- Guys, let's just have a drink.
- Here's your four-alarm hummus.
- Finally!
Sorry.
Sunset says I should only have water before a performance.
Hey.
Sabrina.
I just want to tell you
I think you guys have what it takes to go statewide.
- Really?
- Oh.
Big bucks to be made.
Wow.
With a lot of money, we could help a lot of people.
You could buy a lot of stuff.
Yeah.
They could always lose their talent later.
- Beg your pardon.
- Nothing.
Let me just talk it over with Harvey and Val.
That's funny.
I can't remember how to hold a guitar.
So long, lot of stuff.
Beg your pardon?
A woman of my standing enjoys caviar and fine wines.
I could not have ordered
"rootin' tootin' beans."
You did, Lorlene.
And you threw in a, "Hee-haw!"
Beans, caviar, it all goes well with Rimski-Korsakov.
All right, let's get some sound levels.
All right, whenever you're ready.
Well, I see you guys took that bad-rehearsal, great-show thing to heart, huh?
I'm sorry, Mr. Kraft.
I guess the other day was just a fluke.
- We'll just go.
- No.
You just listen up, young lady.
Dwayne put his butt on the line for this remote.
Well, remind me to thank him.
And when Dwayne puts his butt on the line, his mother gets testy.
His mother, who is my sister and the owner of the house where I am currently a guest.
Where I am intent on staying a guest.
Got it?
When did we get bad again?
I can't suck on TV.
You'd think I'd be good at humiliation.
It's just another thing I failed to master.
Harvey, you go help Valerie remember how to hold a guitar, and I'll try to figure something out.
Could you get rid of Sunset?
She scares me.
If only I could really sing.
If only someone could really sing.
Libby can sing.
Wait, is that really better than embarrassing myself all over TV?
Let's go with yes.
I was just in the girls' bathroom.
What am I doing here?
Isn't it weird, you're doing something, you're mind is somewhere else, and bam, you're in a gym and you're asking, "How did I get here?"
- How did I get here?
- My point exactly.
But since you stopped by, I need a little favour.
Hello.
You don't know me, but I just wanted to say,
Dr. Terdlington is a hero, Zelda Spellman is a zero.
Now on to the B's.
That's it.
I am through apologising.
Either you give me the formula, or you go.
You know, Zelda, I've always liked you.
You-
- What?
Well, the science biz is so full of phoneys, but I like your fire.
Well, actually, I've always admired you.
Not your personality, but your mind.
Dinner?
Love to.
And you want me to sing for you?
In exchange for eternal gratitude, endless flattery, and a piece of the merchandising.
- I'll do it.
- You will?
But let's get one thing straight.
It's only because I love to sing.
And we love to hear you sing, because you sing so very, very well.
And you're pretty too.
Let's change "endless flattery" to cash.
Send this ghastly smear back to the galley and give the chef 30 lashes for his crimes against eating!
I'll never dine in this establishment again!
I'm appalled!
Perhaps a little Vivaldi?
You know, it's funny.
Without customers, we don't need a fiddler.
You're fired, Hilda.
Fine.
I'm keeping the dress.
There's a little bit of me in you
A little bit in everything you do
There's a little bit in you It goes a long way deep into you
There's a little bit of you in me
A little bit of you in everything I feel
Makes us fit together
Perfectly
Cut.
Hey, Libby, you were great.
Well, good save.
Suspicious, but good.
Amazing how things worked out.
Yep.
The winner won as the freaks looked on in amazement.
All's right with the world.
Well, I happen to believe that if a waiter wants that 9 percent tip, everything has to be perfect.
- You are terrible.
- Yes.
Well, it's late.
I suppose I'd better go.
Right.
Oh, by the way, can I have that formula now?
Nope.
Never.
Then why did you put me through such misery?
Revenge.
How about dinner next Tuesday?
How about you kiss my cold fusion?
Give me back my pants!
So are we still speaking to each other?
Yes.
If we never talk about how bad we played today.
I can't figure out what went wrong.
Was there something in that hummus?
Let's remember not to let anything like this get in the way of friendship.
You mean success?
I don't think that will be a problem.
I blame Sunset.
Salem, There are five bottles here.
That's very good, Sabrina.
Now, what colour is the tablecloth?
No.
I brewed six.
Where's the last bottle of talent?
Every little thing That you have said and done
- Feels like it's deep within me
- Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter If you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be
I don't care who you are
Hey, guys.
Come on.
Where you're from
The game's still tied.
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
I've tried to hide it So that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did And where you're coming from
I don't care
As long as you love me, baby
What are you doing here?
How come they didn't win?
- I don't care who you are
- Who you are
Where you're from
Hilda's still not back from her audition?
No.
That's Spanish for "no."
Well, I hope she got the job.
It's so hard for her to find a place to play around here.
Yeah, her musical talent is a wonderful gift.
And she needs to bore other people with it.

[FARTS]
And now it turns out I need that sanctimonious blowhard.
Oh, just call him.
Tell him that you changed your medication and that you're feeling better.
That always works for me.
- Wish me luck.
- Another classical audition?
Sort of.
Okay, you got the job.
You're our new strolling fiddler.
Was it my Beethoven?
It's just that you fit into the costume.
Sabrina!
Oh, thank goodness.
No one was injured.

- Stay in school.
Well, if it isn't the Electric Freak Orchestra.
And by the way, the cheerleaders have a band, and we're gonna win.
- She doesn't know that.
LIBBY:
Yes, I do.
Cheerleaders always win.
And geeks always lose.
I believe they call that the natural order.
I do not want to lose to Libby.
We have to get good, and we have to get good soon.
We're not good?
Dr. Terdlington, that is so kind of you.
Of course you're aware that it's kind.
I'll see you soon.
That pompous swine might let me use his formula.
I'm gonna be able to give the world cold fusion.
Super.
What does it mean?
May I play something for you gentlemen?
Perhaps some Chopin, Mozart?
If one of them wrote "Turkey in the Straw."
[PLAYING "TURKEY IN THE STRAW"]
[PLAYING DISCORDANT ROCK MUSIC]
It was kind of hard to hear, but we suck, right?
And that was with gym echo.
LIBBY:
I hope someone brought some baking soda, because something stinks in here.
Oh.
Look.
It's Sabrina's band.
I'd think of a snappy comeback, but it's true.
Okay.
Hit it.
[DANCE MUSIC PLAYS ON STEREO]
[SINGING] There's a little bit of me in you
A little bit in everything you do
You still stuck on that whole "us winning" thing?
SABRINA:
Come on.
It's not so bad.
I mean, the only difference between us and them is they're talented.
Makes you wonder if Hitler was actually a good painter.
ZELDA:
Libby insults you because she's jealous.
I don't think so.
Is there a spell that can make dogs howl every time she opens her mouth?
[DOORBELL RINGS]
You have to be careful how you treat people.
Even rotten people.
You might regret it one day.
Dr. Terdlington.
I believe this whoopee cushion is yours.
For instance, today.
[PLAYING COUNTRY MUSIC]
And I thought giving Henry VIII a sponge bath was the low point of my life.
I had no idea you could bottle talent.
Where do you think that expression comes from?
A six-pack of refreshing talent, now with the handy twist-top.
Cool.
But I won't use it unless it's absolutely necessary.
Hey, I don't care how you justify it.
Promise you won't tell Aunt Hilda or Zelda?
Mum's the word.
Howdy, y'all.
Hi.
So how'd the gig go?
Lousy.
I tried to merge the worlds of art and prime rib, but I failed.
Well, the important part is that you tried.
Gotta go.
I'm glad Zelda left the labtop open.
Think I'll whip up some seasonings to make those Philistines at the steak house appreciate good music.
Not a peep out of you.
Mum's the word.
Ooh.
Déjà vu.
Excuse me!
Excuse m-- Put a sock in it!
Thank you.
Now, I understand that everyone has been informed that I am judging the band contest tonight.
- Yes.
- Okay, so no talent isn't the only thing against us.
Well, that information is incorrect.
For me to judge the contest would be unfair.
Now you've lost me.
The contest will be judged by the producer of Rock and a Hard Place...
Westbridge's only cable TV showcase for local bands.
- ...
Dwayne Kraft.
- Kraft?
Yes, Dwayne Kraft.
My nephew.
Thank you so much for reconsidering and giving me a chance to plead my case, Dr. Terdlington.
And apologise.
Mostly I just want you to apologise.
LIBBY [SINGING]:
Fits together perfectly
[DANCE MUSIC PLAYING]
The Libby Chessler Generation!
Maybe we should've taken lessons.
Come on, you guys, we can do it.
Follow that, Freaka McEntire.
It's necessary.
Well, I'm thirsty.
How about you guys?
Want a drink?
- No, thanks.
I'm full.
- And I'm prone to gastritis.
Come on.
I need the money on the empties.
[MAGIC ZINGS]
[MAGIC ZINGS]
Okay, it's only fair that I let the final band compete,
Although the expression "just a formality" certainly comes to mind.
Please welcome
Entry Number 5.
- We forgot to come up with a name.
- Just play.
Two, three, four...
[PLAYING ROCK MUSIC]
[SINGING] One way
One way or another
I'm gonna find you
I'm gonna getcha, getcha Getcha, getcha
One way or another
I'm gonna win you
I'm gonna getcha, getcha Getcha, getcha

I'm gonna see you
I wanna meetcha, meetcha Meetcha, meetcha
One day maybe next week

The lights are all down
I'll see who's around

I'm gonna getcha, I'll getcha
I'll getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
One way or another
Okay, fine.
Fine.
Do we have a winner here, judge?
The best band in this battle is Entry Number 5!
Hello, Westbridge.
Are you ready to rock 'n' roll?
[CROWD CHEERS]
Listen.
I'd love to send a crew over here, tape you guys for my show.
Yeah!
Well, let me talk it over with my band.
- Okay, we'll do it.
- All right.
Aunt Zelda, we won.
You should've seen the look on Libby's face.
Shock and disbelief really become her.
I hope you remembered what I said about being mean to people.
Zelda.
Have you decided to forgive me yet?
Not yet.
Another one might help.
[FARTS]
So close.
[SCREAMS]
It's a great--
Sabrina, I wrote a song for our TV debut, but the drummer has a problem with it.
Take a look at it.
Valerie, you wrote a song called "My Valerie"?
Wait till you see what he wants to do.
I drew up some ideas for a complete new look for the band.
That's you and Val.
Why are we dressed like worms?
They're brown unitards.
It's a comment on an asexual society.
And I'm the universal love being, signified by the goat ears and the sleeveless spandex vestments.
- "Love being"?
- Yeah, but we can't sing about me.
- I'm trying to change America.
- Oh, yeah?
Hold it.
Why are we fighting?
We're friends.
Because he has a stupid idea.
Oh, yeah.
I am not gonna perform dressed like a bug.
- This is my band.
- Your band?
Lady, we don't need no pepper.
Oh, no, this is classical seasoning.
It adds taste.
How come you ain't playing that "Turkey in the Straw" I asked for?
[MAGIC ZINGS]
You know what would be simply marvellous?
Yes, some incredibly obscure Wagner.
If you insist.
[PLAYS CLASSICAL MUSIC]
"Valerie, my Valerie, foxy little junior walking down the street.
Valerie, my Valerie--"
Would you be terribly upset if I threw up in one of your shoes?
Salem, what am I gonna do?
Well, you've always been able to talk things out with Harvey.
[PHONE RINGS]
- Hello.
- Hey, Harvey, it's Sabrina.
Hey.
So you gonna wear the brown suit?
[PHONE BEEPS]
- Uh, no.
Listen--
- Hold on.
He put me on hold.
[ELEVATOR MUSIC PLAYS]
Since when does Harvey have Muzak?
Hey.
Sorry about that.
I didn't know so many chicks had my home number.
[PHONE BEEPS]
- You're listed.
- Hold on.
Hey, sweetness.
Let me dump Sabrina, and I'll be right back--
That's okay, goat boy, I'll dump you.
I wish I'd never given them a swig of talent.
It's ruining our friendship, and I can't even enjoy winning.
Perhaps you're feeling bad because Libby sang with genuine talent and deserved to win.
Don't hit me.
Great, now I feel annoyed and guilty.
If you want your friendships back, maybe you should take the fizz out of the egos you inflated.
- I wish I could.
- You can.
They take a sip of flat talent, they go flat too.
Great.
So I'll just let these go flat, and when I see Harvey and Valerie tonight, they'll drink, and we'll go back to being talentless friends.
Did you pop one for yourself?
Me?
I haven't been affected by having things go my way.
Oh, please.
Little Miss "I'm Too Cool To Do My History Homework."
I had an autograph signing.
Okay.
Libby, are you here for the show?
Please.
I have a date tonight, and I left my sweater here.
I go to the carnival when I want to see sideshow oddities.
Maybe these won't be necessary.
Maybe Harvey and Val will show up and be their old selves.
Please.
Don't they have roadies to do that?
- Drink?
- No, thanks.
I asked for clear soda.
And I don't see the blackened-tuna papaya hummus we demanded.
Don't they know who we are?
Come on.
Let's split one.
[MAGIC ZINGS]
[SINGS OFF-KEY]
They're good.
We'll grab some eats, and I'll tell the others about you joining the band.
- What?
- What?
Hi.
Sabrina, Valerie,
I'd like you to meet Sunset.
You can't just bring someone into the band.
Especially someone named Sunset.
You said.
Listen, I'm the rhythm section, and I say--
- Oh, excuse me, drummer boy.
- Guys, let's just have a drink.
- Here's your four-alarm hummus.
- Finally!
Sorry.
Sunset says I should only have water before a performance.
Hey.
Sabrina.
I just want to tell you
I think you guys have what it takes to go statewide.
- Really?
- Oh.
Big bucks to be made.
Wow.
With a lot of money, we could help a lot of people.
You could buy a lot of stuff.
Yeah.
They could always lose their talent later.
- Beg your pardon.
- Nothing.
Let me just talk it over with Harvey and Val.
[MAGIC ZINGS]
That's funny.
I can't remember how to hold a guitar.
So long, lot of stuff.
[LAUGHS]
Beg your pardon?
A woman of my standing enjoys caviar and fine wines.
I could not have ordered
"rootin' tootin' beans."
You did, Lorlene.
And you threw in a, "Hee-haw!"
Beans, caviar, it all goes well with Rimski-Korsakov.
[PLAYS CLASSICAL MUSIC]
All right, let's get some sound levels.
All right, whenever you're ready.
[PLAYING DISCORDANT ROCK MUSIC]
Well, I see you guys took that bad-rehearsal, great-show thing to heart, huh?
I'm sorry, Mr. Kraft.
I guess the other day was just a fluke.
- We'll just go.
- No.
You just listen up, young lady.
Dwayne put his butt on the line for this remote.
Well, remind me to thank him.
And when Dwayne puts his butt on the line, his mother gets testy.
His mother, who is my sister and the owner of the house where I am currently a guest.
Where I am intent on staying a guest.
Got it?
When did we get bad again?
I can't suck on TV.
You'd think I'd be good at humiliation.
It's just another thing I failed to master.
Harvey, you go help Valerie remember how to hold a guitar, and I'll try to figure something out.
Could you get rid of Sunset?
She scares me.
If only I could really sing.
If only someone could really sing.
Libby can sing.
Wait, is that really better than embarrassing myself all over TV?
Let's go with yes.
I was just in the girls' bathroom.
What am I doing here?
Isn't it weird, you're doing something, you're mind is somewhere else, and bam, you're in a gym and you're asking, "How did I get here?"
- How did I get here?
- My point exactly.
But since you stopped by, I need a little favour.
Hello.
You don't know me, but I just wanted to say,
Dr. Terdlington is a hero, Zelda Spellman is a zero.
Now on to the B's.
That's it.
I am through apologising.
Either you give me the formula, or you go.
You know, Zelda, I've always liked you.
You-
- What?
Well, the science biz is so full of phoneys, but I like your fire.
Well, actually, I've always admired you.
Not your personality, but your mind.
Dinner?
Love to.
And you want me to sing for you?
In exchange for eternal gratitude, endless flattery, and a piece of the merchandising.
- I'll do it.
- You will?
But let's get one thing straight.
It's only because I love to sing.
And we love to hear you sing, because you sing so very, very well.
And you're pretty too.
Let's change "endless flattery" to cash.
Send this ghastly smear back to the galley and give the chef 30 lashes for his crimes against eating!
I'll never dine in this establishment again!
WOMAN:
I'm appalled!
Perhaps a little Vivaldi?
You know, it's funny.
Without customers, we don't need a fiddler.
You're fired, Hilda.
Fine.
I'm keeping the dress.
[DANCE MUSIC PLAYS]
[SINGING] There's a little bit of me in you
A little bit in everything you do
There's a little bit in you It goes a long way deep into you
There's a little bit of you in me
A little bit of you in everything I feel
Makes us fit together
Perfectly
Cut.
Hey, Libby, you were great.
Well, good save.
Suspicious, but good.
Amazing how things worked out.
Yep.
The winner won as the freaks looked on in amazement.
All's right with the world.
Well, I happen to believe that if a waiter wants that 9 percent tip, everything has to be perfect.
- You are terrible.
- Yes.
Well, it's late.
I suppose I'd better go.
Right.
Oh, by the way, can I have that formula now?
Nope.
Never.
Then why did you put me through such misery?
Revenge.
How about dinner next Tuesday?
How about you kiss my cold fusion?
TERDLINGTON:
Give me back my pants!
So are we still speaking to each other?
Yes.
If we never talk about how bad we played today.
I can't figure out what went wrong.
Was there something in that hummus?
Let's remember not to let anything like this get in the way of friendship.
You mean success?
I don't think that will be a problem.
I blame Sunset.
Salem, There are five bottles here.
That's very good, Sabrina.
Now, what colour is the tablecloth?
No.
I brewed six.
Where's the last bottle of talent?

Doesn't really matter If you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

The game's still tied.
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did

As long as you love me
I've tried to hide it So that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did And where you're coming from
I don't care
As long as you love me, baby
What are you doing here?
How come they didn't win?
- I don't care who you are
- Who you are

THE HOUSE IN THE WOODS
See, men are going back.
We have it easy here.
How did you dodge it?
They need good mechanics for their planes.
- And you?
- Thanks to my mum.
She works at the War Ministry.
- What does she do?
- Cleaning lady.
Well, well, guys.
12 points in 3 hours.
After a game like this, these should quench your thirst.
You serve the small shops behind the frontline though.
What are you doing here, Pierrot?
Finishing everybody's drinks as ever?
Go and see your mother over there.
It's quite funny.
Put it on top if you've caught a cold.
- Yes, in metal.
- That's funny now.
- Makes you cry.
- Makes you warm too.
Gotta be done.
- Did you listen carefully?
- Yes, mum, don't worry.
I'll think of you over there.
And it won't last forever.
Please, don't worry, don't cry.
I'll be back.
Don't cry, mum.
I'll be back.
We don't all meet our end there.
And it will be over one day.
You should not worry like this.
- Please, Mum.
- I need courage.
Be brave!
Finish your coffee, you're just worrying for nowt.
Don't move.
Come on.
Mum, Goodbye.
See you next time.
Serge, you filthy dog.
Call that a clean glass?
Want me to kick your butt?
Don't see how.
- With your iron?
- Yeah, I'll show you.
And how do you like that?
Consider yourself paid then, my friend.
Clean this, you.
Clean this, I've said.
Clean this.
And quick.
L'Action Française?
For the Marquis, right?
- I'll leave it here.
- No, No.
What did you put in my pocket?
Give me the money.
- I left it here.
- No, give it to me.
- It's here.
- You liar.
- I gave you 5 cents.
- And the rest?
And the rest?
Here's 20 cents.
The paper is 25 cents.
You'll let the Marquis know it's 30 cents from now on.
- Bye
- Yes, Bye.
You're a real young minion!
Hurry up!
- Mr le Marquis?
- Yes?
By the gap on the far end wall, I saw a litter.
Judging by the footprints, young boars, 40 to 50 kilos.
7 or 8 of them fell in a black thorn bush.
They'll be stuck for a while.
For the Marquis?
- Thank you.
What is your name?
- Hervé.
You came with your friend
- to the castle the other day?
- Yes.
- Which one is the leader?
- The two of us.
Michel is older but as foolish.
As bad as one another.
Go home and say goodbye.
Goodbye Hervé.
Goodbye Michel.
We can't rest easily with those two, never know what they're gonna do next.
How did this Hervé came about?
His mother dropped him one Sunday.
She left and was never seen again.
His dad is at the front.
She probably ran away.
He's been here 3 years and he's well taken care of.
Every Sunday, he waits for his mum at the station.
So let's go and check this litter.
Good timing, I have a letter for the woods.
I'm not gonna go there with...
I'm not lazy but...
I'm not going there on this thing.
I'm gonna get...
all bogged down.
I'm not gonna...
Here.
Here, for the woods.
They're not yours but you should not crumple them.
I'm the one working for the post office.
I'm gonna get told off because of this.
That's not nice to me.
Nasty!
A little fag will do me good.
Poor kid.
Why doesn't he get letters?
Between two shots, his dad could write to him.
That would make him happy.
"It seemed all the blood had withdrawn from his face.
"No words
"came out from his bloodless
"and clenched lips.
Satanas..."
- What's wrong, Hervé?
- These are letters I haven't read.
Did you mess them up like this?
Michel, Albert, come here!
There are letters.
Here.
- You crumpled them.
- You want a punch in the face?
Look, Albert.
It's from your mum.
Mummy will bring me a birthday present.
Good for you, now go and play.
I wanna go on reading.
I will buy you a birthday present, promise.
Yes, we'll have a nice party.
- What does she say?
- I'll tell you with my fists.
Look, the Tommy's postcard.
"I believe in immortal France,
"in our all-mighty Joffre, creator of victory."
What you looking at?
What's up, Marcel?
- What's up, kids?
- You seen the Tommy's postcard?
Leave me alone.
Come, let's go and see the magpie.
"He said with his voice..."
Mum sent me the Tommy's postcard.
"Tommy's prayer, trench prayer.
"I believe in the God of guns and ammo,
"In our Lady of the trenches,
"in Saint Rosie, our bayonet,
"our guardian angels, our Lebel rifle and our saintly 75."
See, I taught it to tap twice.
I've got it.
It's big.
It almost fly away
It won't fly way, we cut her wings.
- Let me see.
- What you gonna do?
- Pacha, good dog.
- That kid is crazy.
You're sick!
- Get in there, Birdie.
- Jojo, tap twice.
Leave it, I'll take her.
Jojo, tap twice.
- Are you asleep?
- No.
- You've left your sentry box?
- Can't you hear the ruckus?
It's the young lieutenant celebrating his first victory.
- He beat a Kraut.
- A sour Kraut?
I hope they remember us, I could do with a drink.
Yes, to digest the Kraut.
I'm going to bed.
- Lucky you.
- To each its turn.
Good night.
- You're gonna get caught.
- Why?
Hypocrite, give me a light.
Did you hear this?
- Stop!
- Who's there?
Stop or I will shoot.
You got him.
That moron shot my ass!
- It's Albert.
- You're in pain?
- Where does it hurt.
- Here for fuck sake.
You should not have shot.
- You did this?
- This was him.
- Good shot!
- He did not mean to.
Did not mean to?
You did not get it!
- Come with us, we'll take you.
- Easy!
- It hurts.
- It's not serious, nothing bad.
- Grab him slowly.
- I've got you, Cottin.
- Bring him home.
- Go and get a doctor.
- What happened, Cottin?
- We heard some noise and...
- We... warmed...
- You warned him.
Then I shot.
With some 8.
- It just hit a nerve, that's it.
- Yes, nothing serious.
All this mess for tin cans.
- You know what it's like.
- Unbelievable.
Goodbye.
Good luck.
His helmet.
The gun.
Here, take it.
What's wrong?
Albert?
It hurts like you would not believe.
- What's wrong?
- Here, my backside.
- What happened?
- I won't be able to sit down again.
- What happened?
- Don't push me!
Easy.
What happened?
He was on his round and took a shot in the butt.
But how could this happen?
The Captain has asked for an inquiry, don't worry.
- Good night, Ma'am.
- Goodbye and thank you.
Come in, Doctor.
Look.
Pants off and bring me a frying pan.
The police is here early.
We'd have come earlier, but we can't investigate at night.
- Can we talk to Albert?
- He's still asleep.
You can't wake him up, he needs a good rest.
He's not the only one we have to speak to.
- Fancy a cup of coffee?
- Never on duty.
- Just a drop?
- Come on, sit down.
Old Albert,
I've heard he strayed out the path.
He's an officer of the law like we are.
- I can't believe it.
- You must not believe hearsay.
Here.
- Milk?
- No, thank you.
Don't move, I'm only passing through.
- Come in, Albert is expecting you.
- I though he was asleep.
- Have you been here long?
- For an hour.
Allow me to go first, I'm in a rush.
I'll wait.
- Mr le Marquis...
- Hurry up, Police is waiting.
- Maréchal explained?
- So you're Father Christmas now?
No, but lil' Hervé, he's a poor kid.
He never gets any parcel.
You did not admit to anything?
- I thought I'd wait for you.
- You did right.
- Tell me everything quick.
- So...
A little salty water and it will pass.
So, I was in the officer's mess, and I took some biscuits.
Because...
Officer's biscuits are better than soldier's ones.
Hey, you did not only pick up biscuits.
Well, no, as they were dry biscuits...
I also took jam.
Listen carefully, whatever they ask, answer no.
- Got it, Mr le Marquis.
- Understand?
Well, gentlemen,
I must admit I am very moved by what I just heard
I am pleased to say that I am proud of my gamekeeper.
- Proud?
- But of course.
Here's a man too old to go to the front and who still risks his life to chase a thief.
What?
So, he's not the thief?
Of course not.
First impression can be deceitful.
If we found stolen goods on him, it's because he got them back.
And if he did not catch the thief, it's because some fool shot at him in the dark.
- Cottin is such an idiot.
- Your words, my thoughts.
You should get his version of the facts right now.
Take it easy, do not tire him.
You can count on us.
Good bye.
May Justice be done, Jeanne.
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Be brave, Jeanne.
Come in.
Mrs Latour.
Are you in, Mrs Latour?
He's going to look for us everywhere.
You know, trains...
How are you doing?
First class is too expensive.
I just received a sweet letter from Bébert.
- How is he?
- Very well, thank you.
And your boy?
Anyway, we'll see them right now.
Mummy!
Mummy!
Wait, I'll come round.
Come here quick!
How are you?
- Here.
- Thanks, mum.
Take this, It's heavy.
One.
And two.
How was your week?
- Let's go, Marcel.
- How is your kid?
Hello.
You're off to the coffee shop?
You're looking good.
Ah, here's Hervé.
Hello, Mr Mahu.
No horses for our soldiers, but some for the city ladies.
And using the Marquis cart, whilst I'm walking back to the station to pick up drinks for all those bloody fancy people!
Yes, my little man, I've got news from Daddy.
He's well.
He will be on leave soon.
There's a little note for you in the letter.
Look.
"Son, your mum wrote
"that you are keeping well with those nice people.
"I hope you behave
"and that you go easy on your little friends.
"I love you very very much.
Daddy."
Yes, that's it.
Come on, greedy, share with your friends or you'll be sick.
- Hervé, want some?
- No, I don't.
- Here.
- No, I don't want any.
Come on, take it.
Not this all over again.
No fighting again.
Pick up these chocolates.
You're sick.
- And what if they were yours?
- Me, I don't get on my high horse.
- Hello!
- Hello.
Oh, you should not have.
- How was the trip?
- I nearly missed my train.
Tell me, lil' Hervé is as crazy as before.
Sunday is a hard day for him, especially when you are here.
Always the same.
I usually like kids, but I don't like him.
I wonder what will become of this little rascal.
- Come over here.
- What's wrong with you?
Nothing, just a bad back.
Hello, Ma'am.
What a lovely hat!
It would really suit you.
A real city girl.
You should come to Paris.
I don't like the city, it's suffocating.
Always looking fresh, Marguerite.
Me and my bad complexion...
- Dinner is ready.
- Good, I am starving.
Michel, come and sit next to your mum.
Come on, next to mummy.
- Really, you would not come?
- No, I couldn't beathe!
Hervé!
Don't eat too much chocolate or you'll be sick like last time.
Hervé!
Come here!
I'm not hungry.
- We're having stew, you like it?
- I'm starving.
How do you keep yourself so thin?
My nerves.
Real exercise.
- Hervé, we are eating.
- I'm not hungry.
I'm not sitting down, I really can't.
Poor Albert.
- Pass me your plate.
- Your plate, Mr Albert.
What do you want?
Bébert, recognise him?
That's your rabbit Kiki we're eating.
You should be ashamed to tell him such things.
Don't say this, he'll cry again.
Michel.
Then, I don't know the words.
Someone is coming.
- Albert, are these your friends?
- Yes, from the garrison.
They pollute our woods with these cars.
It scares all the animals, Ma'am.
- But you don't stop progress.
- Progress?
In Paris, no more wildlife, no birds, nothing.
You can't have everything.
Not a good time, they have guests.
- Who's that?
- The Parisian ladies, I guess.
They'd run all over us!
You've got guests, we don't wanna disturb.
You're always welcome.
These are the children's mothers:
Mrs Latour and Mrs Pouilly.
We came to get news from our wounded.
- Someone got wounded?
- You haven't heard?
You're having diner with a hero.
He saved the airfield from an attack.
OK, it's no laughing matter.
Can't we know?
One of these idiots mistook him for a prowler and shot him.
That kind of people are given guns?
You'll see what happens if given a gun.
I hope it will never happen.
Bierrot, when my brother goes hunting, he doesn't shoot his dog.
He's a real hunter, only shoots his friends.
Here are a few presents from the captain.
How sweet of him!
Chocolate and some Champagne.
Let's drink to myself!
- Have a seat.
- Thank you, very kind.
I can't sit down.
Charming.
Mr Albert, open it.
Careful!
Mr Albert!
What are you doing here?
Nicolas would like a word with Mr le Marquis.
Let him in.
What is it, Nicolas?
I came here to tell you I've caught the gamekeeper's son.
He was prowling in the park.
Go and get him.
What are you doing here?
Don't you know these are wild areas?
If you go back there, you could break a leg.
Come with me to Mr le Marquis.
It's you, what are you doing out at this time on a Sunday?
Just wandering about.
- Albert knows you're here?
- No.
Haven't you lunched?
Why?
I don't like Albert and Michel's mums.
- You're going to get told off.
- No.
Would you care to have lunch with me?
Yes.
Limousin, set a plate for our guest.
Go and sit down.
Don't be shy.
Go on, sit.
It's so big.
I'd be scared to live here.
Yes, it's large.
And recently, mostly empty.
Take your napkin.
Serve him, Limousin.
He's too shy.
You'll tell me about this.
My cook's special.
- What is it?
- Veal fillet Marengo.
You like it?
Not at my mum's.
She doesn't eat these.
Too expensive.
Have a taste then!
- Good?
- Yes.
Limousin, pour some wine for our guest.
You can also have some bread.
Easy, Limousin.
Cheers.
Are you full?
- No.
- You have to eat.
Thank you.
- Do you want a cigar?
- No, thank you.
Why didn't we stay there?
Why did we come here?
Because this is where I read.
Nothing more relaxing as...
- You think it's weird?
- Yes.
- Who's that over there?
- It was my dad.
And my mum.
My father was a very brave man.
She was only poison to him.
- He was very much in love.
- Do you have kids?
No.
Let's talk about you, how do you spend your days?
I wander in the countryside.
I play.
And I fish.
I go and find birds nests.
- Do you like the countryside?
- Yes.
- And Paris?
- I don't remember.
Don't you think Mother Jeanne is going to worry?
- Maybe you should go home.
- No.
Well, I am sending you home.
Goodbye, Mr le Marquis.
Hervé.
You can come back when you want.
- End of my day and...
- You're flat?
Yep, I am tired and have a flat tyre.
If roads were fixed, there wouldn't be any problem.
And with these wheels.
Tell me about progress.
Look at mine.
Chartier doesn't have this problem, his wheels are in steel.
I finish my day with a flat tyre.
And who gets the problems?
Me.
I have letters for you by the way.
Mrs Picard, Mrs Picard and Mrs Picard.
Chartier, steel wheels, no problem.
He rides and he destroys roads.
I get a flat tyre and have to fix my wheels.
- As always.
What are you doing?
- I'm reading it.
You're not allowed, it's forbidden.
Did you open the mail?
It's forbidden, not your name on there!
This is a mail violation.
In the postal rulebook, it says it's forbidden to open mail that is not addressed to you.
What's wrong with you?
Do you realise what you did?
I am going to get punished.
Forbidden to read mail not addressed to you.
"Dear Jeanne and dear Albert,
"I am writing from the rear, where our company is at rest.
"I got your letter,
"I hope the new turnover of leaves will allow me
"to soon see my people and kiss my little Hervé..."
You see, this is for me!
"who must have grown so much." Have you grown?
Really?
"I bumped into Hélene, a girl I loved when I was 20
"and who married another fellow.
"Today, she's a war widow and I..."
OK, that's not for me.
That's for you, take it.
"Today, she's a war widow.
"And I have not heard from Hervé's mother for 4 years.
"So I will marry Hélene, when the was is over.
"I am asking you to prepare Hervé for the news."
Who made Heaven and Earth?
God made Heaven and Earth.
Very good.
- Can one see God?
- No.
- Why is that?
- Because He is invisible.
One can't see Him on earth, so where will one see Him?
In Heaven!
- Does God take care of us?
- Yes!
As God is... good.
You all know this.
What is real happiness?
Nobody knows?
No one did his homework?
Real happiness is to be God's friend.
Repeat: "Real happiness is to be God's friend".
- When does one have to pray?
- In the morning, afternoon...
Morning, evening and also during the day.
- What is to sin?
- It means to offend God.
Very Good.
What have you got to say, you over there?
Behave please, behave.
- Why did Jesus come to Earth?
- To save us.
- And lead us?
- To Heaven.
When do we celebrate the birth of Jesus?
At Christmas.
- Who is the mother of Jesus?
- The Holy Virgin.
Holy Mary.
Who is Jesus?
The Son of God.
- Who was he?
- A man.
Good.
Where was Jesus born?
In Bethleem.
- In a stable.
- That's very good.
So Chandon, late for Sunday school?
Our Grace won't' be happy with you.
- When did Jesus rise from the dead?
- On Ascension Day.
Your Grace, Ambulances are outside.
Children, calm down.
- You did not go to Sunday School?
- No.
- What did you do?
- I was watching the ambulances.
- What was there?
- Wounded soldiers.
Class is dismissed for today.
Still smoking yourself out?
Mondeau, where are you running like this?
- I'm going to see the ambulances.
- How Sad!
Come on, kids, scram!
- Come on, kids.
- Marcel, take them away.
Translation:
Colonel Gatito Timing:
Corvusalbus, Besmel
We've moved a yard.
Blast the sodden wind!
We'll make no headway against a sou'easter, sir.
Well, Mr Baines.
Wear ship.
Bring her round again.
Aye aye, sir.
Stand by to wear ship!
Bend your braces!
Bend your braces!
Come on.
Look lively, lads.
Look lively.
On your feet, scum.
Get up.
Come on, look lively there!
Boatswain!
Liven 'em up, liven 'em up!
Come on!
Move your pox-ridden lungs!
Move!
Ease her off, Quartermaster.
Ease her off.
- Morning, Mr Wakefield.
- Good morning.
Wind shifting, Mr Onedin?
I thought it was too good to last.
You mark my words, Mr Simpson, it'll bring rain, it'll bring rain, you know.
Aye and lay the dust, Mr Onedin.
But bad for business, Mr Simpson, bad for business.
True.
Excuse me.
Morning, Mrs Furlong.
- Good day to you, Mr Onedin.
- Good day, Mrs Furlong.
- Mrs Onedin.
- Mrs Furlong.
- Dinner, Robert.
- I'll close for the half-hour.
Your father always remained open.
I know.
I shall start as I intend to finish.
I'll spoil neither me stomach nor your cooking for the want of a few minutes.
We thank thee, oh Lord, for all thy gracious bounty.
Amen.
A ship's been spoke off the Point.
I heard the gun.
It could be James.
We've a lot to be thankful for - a little shop, comfortable business.
Seafaring is no life, I've always said so.
It was James' own choosing.
Ah, well, it's too late for him to change his mind now.
Father left the shop to me.
I can't imagine James serving behind a counter.
Exactly.
No sense of business, that brother of mine.
No sense of business.
Captain Onedin.
- Mr Callon.
- Your servant, sir.
- Have a fee of passage?
- Yeah, in my papers, sir.
Mm-hm.
We left Lisbon 27 days ago, but we've been kept beating to winward of the Point for the last three.
Three days' extra pay for every man, hey?
Those rascals know what they're about, don't they, eh?
If that's a reflection upon my ability and character, sir...
Of course not, Onedin, of course not.
I've every confidence in you.
One day, mark me well, one day, we'll have you master of a western ocean packet.
That'll suit your better than this Portuguese wine trade, I'll warrant.
- Señor Braganza sends his compliments.
- Oh, aye.
Begs to remind you that his contract will be due for renewal in seven weeks' time.
We must take good care of Señor Braganza.
That Portuguese wine shipper is our bread and butter, eh?
- You'll take a glass of Jamaica, sir?
- Oh, thank you, Captain.
You got a full cargo, I see.
Aye.
Wine, hides, sheepskins and oranges from Seville.
Good, good, good.
Well, then you'll have earned your bonus.
- Oh, I think not.
- Hm?
Couldn't you smell it?
- What?
- Rotting fruit.
She sprung for'ard.
We've been double manning the pump since five days out.
You mean you sprung her?
You've driven her too hard, man?
In your service, sir.
Gee, more expense.
An owner's hand is never out of his pocket these days.
Well, below the water line, she's riddled with worm.
I did draw the matter to your attention in my last report.
And knowing this, you still drove her hard?
We required a fast passage.
What use is a fast passage if you waste time and money hanging... hanging around the Point for three days.
A ship that will drive into the wind is yet to be built.
Don't try and teach me my business.
I'll be aboard first thing tomorrow morning.
To find out what other damage you've wreaked.
Good night to you, Captain.
Good night, Mr Callon.
One day, I'll give you a lesson in business, Mr Callon.
Oh, James, thank you, it's lovely.
Thank you, James.
- Sarah's looking very well.
- Aye.
- Five months gone, big as a house.
- Congratulations.
Keep still.
There!
- Is it well?
- Very well, lovely.
Well, when did Father die?
- A week past.
- A stroke.
The third.
It took him in the night.
It's a pity you couldn't have arrived sooner.
I doubt I could clip a week off a voyage even to oblige Father.
And in the event, I dare say, my presence would have hastened rather than hindered matters.
Oh, James.
Well...did he leave much?
Well, the...the shop...
To Robert.
And a word of advice for you.
Oh?
He said, "A man who walks a twisty lane may travel far
"but arrive at the same destination in the end."
Well, there spoke a man with little sense of direction.
Robert's worked very hard in the shop, James.
Without Father holding you back, you should be able to expand the business now.
Oh, I'm well satisfied with things as they are.
Well, you shouldn't be.
Building ships 200 or more feet in length and clad in iron.
- Iron ships?
- Aye, 60 men to crew 'em, and every man jack to be fed.
Acres of sail cloth, miles of cordage.
Now's your chance, Robert, take it.
Ah, the owners'd never buy from a little man like me.
And how could I afford fancy kickbacks to the masters, hey?
Look, the owners will buy where they can show best profit.
Look, there's a sight more to business than just plain buying and selling.
Take my word for it.
Look, I buy, I sell.
Now wherein lies the profit?
- In between.
- No, Robert.
Profit lies with the man who possesses.
The owner makes the profit, not the employee, however well paid.
Aye, and he stands to lose most.
Aye, and the man who has nothing loses nothing, lies in a poor man's grave, at the poor man's funeral.
Oh, James.
Will you be the better for lying in a rich man's grave, James?
Aye, well, I'll have worked for it.
200 cases of oranges destroyed, near 20 casks of wine despoiled.
There'll be no bonus for you this trip, Captain Onedin.
Not a penny piece.
You take your leave and report back next week.
Very well, Mr Callon.
Captain Onedin, sir.
Captain Onedin?
22 pounds, 12 shillings and sixpence.
If you sign here, sir.
Pay attention to your work there.
Old Josh Webster's ship.
What do you think of it?
A poor bargain.
Well, that depends upon the price.
Should fetch about 500...
or more with an ounce of luck.
The Websters must be close to penury.
The old man's taken to the bottle.
While that vinegar-faced daughter of his tries to keep up the fiction that he has the fever.
He has the Barbados fever.
She'd still be unwed then, I dare say.
Well, who'd have her?
Tart as a crab apple and wrong side of 30.
Asking price should be low.
Bound to be.
I doubt if that ship has tasted saltwater for two years past.
The Charlotte Rhodes is the jest of the waterfront.
Frazer's yards built her, Frazer's build sound ships.
She's not sound now.
She's fit only for stripping and turning into a coal oak.
Under 500 you reckon, eh?
Aye.
Robert...
I've 175 saved.
Will you lend me the balance?
What, for that wreck?
!
You cannot be serious, James.
I'll give you a note of hand.
You shan't lose by it.
- On what security?
- A partnership.
A partnership.
In what?
A trade adventure.
You...you propose to put to sea in that?
Aye.
I'll sail in a skiff, if need be.
Ah, the sea routes are spoken for.
The owners'd crush you, and they've no taste for competition.
Look, £325, that's all I need, and I'll make your fortune for you.
I doubt if I could put me hands on 325 shillings, much less pounds.
Well, you've the shop and the stock.
Shop and the stock?
You...you're asking me to mortgage wife and family against a foolhardy venture that...that's doomed to failure before it even begins?
!
You speak so grandly of the world as your oyster, but that shell has long been prised open.
Cor, shop and a stock!
Well, where do you intend to sail that wreck?
And with what cargo?
You're summat careless with your casks, Robert.
Not I.
Fool of a drayman dropped it and lost me its contents.
- But I'll claim, never fear, I'll claim.
- Somebody'll be out of pocket.
- Not I.
- Who?
Manufacturer?
Well, the carrier.
It's his responsibility.
- A carrier, eh?
- Mm-hm.
Robert, which has greater value?
Cask or content?
Well, the cask, naturally, it's made of seasoned oak.
But it's of little value now.
Vinegar?
Aye, nine gallons of it straight down the drain.
Why, are you...are you thinking of carrying vinegar on that oak?
!
At least it might pickle its timbers.
Not vinegar, Robert.
Wine.
The wine trade.
Oh, for God's sake, James, you're not thinking of competing with Callon?
Why not?
He's had a good run for his money.
Look, the Braganza contract has but seven weeks to run.
I think I see a way of snapping it from under Callon's nose.
James, even if you had a ship, Callon would undercut any price you could offer.
- He can afford to.
- Damn.
And he'd neither forget nor forgive.
He's a hard man, James.
- He'll run you off the seas.
- No, I know Callon and I know Braganza.
And between them, they'll play you like a fish.
It's not I who'll take the bait, but I must have a ship.
Now.
Robert, will you lend me the money?
Then keep your purse strings tight, chandler.
Sustain your family on vinegar.
Captain Onedin?
Good evening, Miss Webster.
I apologise for the lateness of the call and any inconvenience, but might I have a few moments' conversation with your father?
- To what purpose?
- A matter of business.
I'm sorry, sir, but Captain Webster is indisposed.
It is a matter of some consequence.
To you or to us?
Well, I had hoped to make an offer for the ship.
Might save the bother of public auction.
Private sale?
Do you represent yourself alone, or others?
Er, with respect, Miss Webster, but my business must lie with your father.
Very well.
If you'll step inside, I'll inquire if my father will receive you.
Thank you.
If you would wait in here, Captain Onedin.
Thank you, Miss Webster.
You will not object to the presence of a woman during your discussion?
My father is a sick man and I will not have him taken advantage of.
I understand.
You may smoke if you wish.
Thank you.
It's time, daughter, it's time for my tot.
Oh, Father, do try and pull yourself together.
I need my tot.
We have a visitor.
I can't see no one, without I have my evening tot.
A gentleman neighbour enquiring about the ship.
I'm entitled!
Couldn't you have shaved, just for once?
You'll need a clean stock and neckband.
And shoes.
I'll wear the ones with a buckle.
Me buckle shoes and my uniform.
You've nowt other, all else is in t'pawn.
Gentleman of some importance, is he?
We're already acquainted with Captain Onedin, Father.
Onedin?
That young pup.
Tradesman's son.
Young upstart.
Pious, parsimonious family, the Onedins.
His father refused to extend my credit.
And as a result, me ship's rotting away.
World's coming to a pretty pass when a twopenny shopkeeper can refuse a gentleman.
But I outlived that mean-minded old devil for all his sharp ways.
Now his son wants to bargain for my ship, does he?
I'll bargain, by God!
You will leave the negotiations to me, Father.
I'll fancy that Captain Onedin has it in mind to name a sharp price.
But if you do not disgrace me, we shall meet him.
I believe you're acquainted with my father, sir.
Your servant, sir.
- Merchantman, aren't you?
- Aye, sir.
And a true Onedin by the cut of your jib.
Well, take at ease, man, take at ease.
A glass or two of wine, daughter.
Thank you, sir, but I prefer to keep a clear head when discussing matters of business.
My father is not yet fully recovered from the fever, sir.
I know the symptoms well.
A fever contracted on the slave coast in the service of his country.
Retired me on half pay, they did, Vice Lords of the Admiralty.
There's little gratitude in this world, young man, little gratitude.
But I beat to windward and outgunned them.
I bought the schooner Charlotte Rhodes.
As sound a ship as ever spread canvas.
And if it hadn't been for that penny-pinching father of yours...
Father.
We understand, Captain Onedin, that you wish to make an offer for the ship.
A lovely vessel, worth a fortune in gold.
As seaworthy a vessel as you'll find in a year's search.
Made of good British oak...
I know all there is to know about the Charlotte Rhodes, sir.
How much are you asking?
650 guineas.
I must tell you, Miss Webster, that I've spent the entire morning going over that ship from stem to stern and from chock to keel.
And your offer, sir?
I must also tell you that I have made diligent inquiries as to your circumstances.
- You are impertinent, sir.
- You insolent jackanapes!
Business is a matter of negotiation.
Before one can negotiate with certainty it is necessary to fully comprehend the strengths and weaknesses of the other side.
Tradesman's trickery!
I'll not have it!
Damn you, I'll burn the ship first!
You have an offer in mind?
- I have.
- And what is it?
175 pounds.
175 pounds?
!
You scoundrel!
If you were under my command... 175 pounds in gold and a partnership, we'll make out a proper form of agreement and I'll undertake to refit the ship.
Yes, and bleed us dry, you rogue, like your father did before you!
I'll have none of it!
Show this creature the door.
Partnership?
Aye.
We would make a profit, Miss Webster.
A steady and increasing income to set against small capital, which Captain Webster's fever would suck dry within a year or two.
You young scallywag!
If I had half my strength...
You'd not be in the straits you find yourself in now!
Well, Miss Webster?
You're a villain, sir, a smooth-tongued thieving villain!
Oh, do be quiet, Father.
We should require proof of more than good intent.
The ship is mine!
I will not sell!
Don't listen to him, Anne.
Get him out, out of my sight.
If you please, Captain Onedin.
My father desires to consider the matter closed.
This way, if you please.
I think we may speak more privily here.
- Are you a fool or a charlatan?
- Neither.
- Prove it.
- On a deed of contract.
Which would last the lifetime of my father, and thereafter?
Another contract'd be made out between you and I.
- No.
- Why not?
You, the surviving partner, would own the business.
That is not my intent.
But that would be the effect.
A poor bargain, sir.
You need the ship with some urgency, I take it.
- Aye, to make a beginning.
- Then your need must be great indeed.
As great as yours, perhaps.
Have a little taste for penury.
One day my father's weakness will assuredly drive him to the grave and I shall be left penniless.
At best I shall be constrained to live off the charity of friends.
At worst it will mean the poor house.
I can assure you I have little fancy for either.
You understand the problem?
- Security?
- In return for the ship.
I'll not hide it from you, Miss Webster.
I cannot put up surety.
And there is my father to be considered.
He's a weak and foolish old man, but I will not see him destitute.
There is only one form of partnership that would ensure the sort of security I require.
And the ship would not cost you one penny piece.
What?
As a dowry.
A what?
There is only one way a woman may escape poverty, Captain Onedin.
- Marriage?
- A not uncommon arrangement.
You strike a hard bargain, Miss Webster.
Am I so unbecoming?
Well, I'm no great romantic, but a matter such as this requires a deal of thought.
And I took you for a man quick to decision.
Well, you might not find me so great a catch either.
I should have the protection of your name and a share in your success.
Yeah, or failure.
I think you and failure to be poor bedfellows, Captain Onedin.
- It is a grave risk.
- Then we will say no more of it.
Well, I mean for you.
Oh?
Well, I ask you to consider carefully, Miss Webster.
You might be exchanging one form of poverty for another.
I have but 175 pounds in the world.
And ambition.
Oh, yeah, I've ambition enough for an army of Napoleons, but ambition won't feed us, clothe us, pay creditors.
You would be hard put to find a better housekeeper and a less complaining.
I'm well-trained on that score, I can assure you.
'Tis no easy road.
One I would prefer to walk alone.
A few minutes ago you were speaking of partnership.
I could buy myself out of that kind of partnership, but the one that you have in mind, that's for life.
For better, for worse.
For richer, or poorer.
I therefore plight thee my troth.
The ship will need cordage and canvas and her timbers corked, and a...
It is a bargain then?
I wonder which of us will have the better of it.
- Married?
- To Anne Webster?
- Aye.
Banns are to be read on Sunday.
- Oh, but, James, so soon?
Surely you should have waited.
You sly dog.
Oh, James, I'm delighted for you.
But you've not yet made us acquainted with the lady.
- Ah, well, you know her well enough, Sarah.
- But not socially, James.
Not socially.
You're a dark horse.
- A trifle of moonlight courting.
- Robert!
Well, why else would a man marry in such haste, eh?
Robert, your tongue may the more readily stop clacking when I tell you that it is simply a marriage of convenience.
Miss Webster is sensible to the fact that I must sail with all haste
- the moment the ship has been refitted.
- Convenience?
A marriage of convenience?
I don't understand.
It's clear enough.
There was simply no other way of obtaining the ship.
Robert, I'd like a word with you.
You're marrying her for the ship?
You cannot be serious, James.
Oh, oh, he's mad.
He's quite mad.
- He's taken leave of his senses.
- Oh, James, you simpleton.
I see no humour in the situation.
It's as valid a reason as any for contracting an alliance.
Contracting an alliance?
!
You speak as if you were marrying into property.
Well, that plain Jane's nowt but the daughter of a penniless wastrel.
Her ship is as much property as any bricks and mortar.
And a far more profitable investment.
There's a sight more to marriage than just plain investment, James.
People marry for mutual regard, not for profit.
For love, James, for love.
Well, then the more fool they.
I cannot see how any man can keep cool judgment when in the grip of such a humour.
- Oh, now, James, list...
- Look, I'm content with the bargain.
No more to be said.
Robert, I wish to discuss a matter of business with you.
James, I-I would advance you that money, James, but I...
Aye, to save me from a fate worse than death.
No, Robert, you can do me better service than that.
Read this.
She's so many years his senior.
Aye, and such a fright as never was.
I-I don't understand.
Well, it's simple enough.
It's a deed of partnership between you and I.
Oh, no, James, we've been through all this before.
- and I will not be a part of it.
- I will own the ship!
This makes you equal partners.
You take half the profits.
In return for what?
Well, as I shall be sailing the ship myself,
I must have somebody ashore to look after my interests.
That man must be a partner.
Who else could I trust but my own brother?
And my liabilities?
If the ship goes, I go with her.
You lose the prospect of a profit.
Ah.
Ha, ha-ha, I have you, James.
You think to refit the ship at my expense.
Well, I'm too smart a dog to be caught like that.
I'll have none of it...
I...
I... 150 pounds, Robert.
More than enough, would you not say?
Let us call it an earnest of good faith.
That log will do us.
Captain!
All the casks ready for inspection, sir.
Read that out, will you?
Take that line.
Make fast for the lift.
James, I want a word with you, please.
James, what is the meaning of this?
It is made out clear enough, my dear.
Do not my dear me, you scoundrel!
Anne, I'll not be berated either before or after marriage.
There will be no marriage, sir, and no dowry!
You may whistle for your ship.
You're a rogue, sir, a rogue!
You're allowing sensibility to cloud your sense of judgment.
This piece of paper is merely a deed of partnership.
No more, no less.
Exactly!
A deed of partnership in which you undertake to share half our profits - our profits, mark you - with that other rogue, your brother.
I'll have none of it, sir, none of it!
You suffer from the same thing as Robert.
Blindness.
You're so overcome by apprehension and Robert by avarice that neither of you can see that which is manifestly clear.
The one thing manifestly clear to me is that Robert takes half our profits!
That is also the one thing manifestly clear to Robert, fortunately for us.
You dare speak of fortune?
Anne, I take it you have no wish to be besieged by debtors while I am away.
Of course not.
In this form of agreement, each partner is responsible for the other's debts.
Now, as I shall be away at sea, that responsibility falls upon Robert.
I assure you there'll be little change from the 150 sovereigns that I gave him.
And come allotment day, somebody must needs to be at hand to pay those seamen's wives.
I see, but it still entitles him to half the profits, does it not?
Not quite.
Entitles him to half the profits of the voyage.
Not quite the same thing.
Now, if things go how I intend they shall,
I fear the voyage will show no profit at all.
No profit?
!
But for the agency of the goods I bring back, there should be handsome profit enough.
In which Robert has no share?
You must learn, Anne, that in matters of business, I give nothing away.
- Agnew?
- Yes, Mr Callon?
- The Braganza contract.
- Immediately, Mr Callon.
Sharp practice, Agnew.
Sharp practice.
I can smell it.
- Yes, that's his game, I'll be bound.
- Sir?
That young upstart, Onedin.
He's familiar with all the details of this contract, isn't he?
Indeed yes, sir.
Bound to be.
As shipmaster, he would have been fully empowered...
I know all that and also seen that he's refitting in some haste, and I'd give a golden guinea to know her date of sailing and her ret...destination.
I'll attend to it right away, Mr Callon.
Yes.
Send that young fellow Drummond.
He's a smart lad.
- A right smart lad.
- Yes, Mr Callon.
You know, I don't think Onedin would dare try a trick like that but if he does, by God, I'll run him off the high seas.
- Morning, lads.
- Morning, sir.
We're being honoured today.
Pretty creature, isn't he?
- Who?
- The gallant Mr Frazer.
- He has a dreadful reputation.
- Oh?
Quite the ladies' man, it is said.
I don't doubt that he's come to see James on a matter of business, but he mustn't glimpse me like this.
Oh, I'm sure Mr Frazer is too polite a man to notice.
He has noticed you, I think.
He really is quite the flirt.
I think you're too bold, Elizabeth.
I'm perfectly safe with you as chaperone, Anne.
Permission to come aboard, sir?
Aye, if you must.
He is coming aboard.
You're not my responsibility.
But I'll not endure Mr Frazer seeing me like this.
- Mr Frazer?
- Just passing.
Thought I'd pop aboard to offer me congratulations.
- Thank you.
- You took us all quite by surprise.
Oh?
For your betrothed.
A small token of regard.
Thank you.
You've made a splendid match, I would say.
Peas from the same pod, eh?
- I would appreciate an invitation.
- What?
To the wedding.
Oh, it is to be no grand affair.
Quite right.
Far too much pomp these days.
I take it Miss Elizabeth will grace the occasion with her presence.
Oh, so that's the way the wind blows.
You've little chance there, Frazer.
- My sister is already promised.
- Oh.
Yes, she is engaged to marry Mr Fogarty.
- Now, Mr Fogarty is mate of a brigantine.
- Ah.
Be returning soon, no doubt to claim his betrothed.
Ladies are notoriously fickle creatures.
Not Elizabeth.
You're wasting your time there, Frazer.
I thought you might care to put in a word for me.
Influence of a brother, you know?
- Why should I?
- Self-interest.
You're a sharp chap, Onedin, very sharp.
Er, no offence.
And you're confident.
Well, come to the point.
Putting it as delicately as I can.
You marry into shipping, eh?
Thought you might care to consider another alliance.
Ship building.
We have the yards, you know.
Just a thought.
- Are you serious?
- But of course.
Wouldn't have broached the matter otherwise.
You might find my sister to have strong views on that score.
I'd be more than disappointed if she did not.
But obstacles, by their very nature, are ours to overcome.
Do you not agree?
Given a free hand, that is.
No cargo, sir.
He will be sailing in ballast.
It must be the Braganza contract he's after.
Due for renewal on the 31st.
That's ten days.
Heh.
The rogue's cutting it fine.
He's sailing immediately after the wedding, sir.
The devil he is.
Ships, Agnew, ships.
Now, what have we got available?
There's the brig Firefly.
She should clear for Lisbon on the...
Firefly.
That scow could never catch Onedin.
I tell you, I've seen the Charlotte Rhodes.
He's got a rig for a quick crossing.
Yes, the devil will know what he's about.
Oh, a fast ship, Agnew, a fast ship, that's what I need.
There's only the Maude, sir, but she's a packet...
A clipper?
Get that ship cleared for Lisbon no later than first tide tomorrow.
- Yes, but...
- See to it, man.
But she's already taking cargo for Boston and Phila...delpia.
Good luck, James!
Good luck!
- Elizabeth!
- Anne!
Good luck, James!
Ooh!
Bon voyage!
Watch that child of mine.
Help her off, Jim.
I'm sailing with you, James.
Ship's no place for a woman.
A wife's place is beside her husband.
- This is no western ocean-going packet.
- We'll make t'shift.
It'll be dangerous.
I shall drive her hard, I intend to take the inshore passage.
Then my best place is surely here.
For I've no more fancy for widowhood than spinsterhood, James.
We sink or swim together.
Very well then.
Clear the gangway.
Let her go for'ard.
Man the braces.
Bye-bye!
Well, we've stolen the march on Callon.
- James?
- What?
Your sister Elizabeth, she's beautiful.
Oh, a bit pinched about the nose, but I dare say she's got her fair share of beauty.
At least Frazer and Fogarty seem to think so.
- I wish I were.
- What?
Beautiful.
But I'm not.
I'm...plain and ugly, and my skin is sallow.
Anne?
Anne.
If men married for beauty alone, there'd be a power of lonely women in the world.
Sail ho!
- Well?
- It's the Charlotte Rhodes.
No doubt about it, sir.
- Can we catch her?
- She has neither a hope nor a prayer, sir.
We have her by the heels.
And even under half our canvas, we leave her standing.
Good.
Good, I'll teach that young bastard.
What ship is she?
The Maude - one of Callon's crack western ocean-going clippers with a bone in her teeth.
I've finished your house flag, James.
What do you think?
Here, his dander must be up to detach such a ship from so profitable a trade.
- Will she catch us?
- We'll show him our colours.
He stopped soon as below the horizon.
We've beaten him, Davies.
We've beaten him!
Now I'll crush him.
The new contract will reduce your freight charges by seven and a half per cent, señor.
I'm overwhelmed at such generosity, señor.
Yes, it's in your favour, but you won't get better terms anywhere else, I'll warrant that.
You're more than generous, señor.
So if you'd kindly read these documents, please, er...
But of course.
I don't understand you, James.
Callon has arrived first.
You still take me for fool?
- What?
- I've been racing time not a ship.
I wrote to Braganza asking for an appointment, and requesting that he delays meeting with Callon until I've had an opportunity of discussing my proposals.
- But will he?
- Well, he'd be a fool not to.
And he's no fool.
More than satisfactory, señor.
So I shall have to answer to my shareholders, but I thought it was the least I could do in return for the long and profitable association between our two houses, señor.
You will sign?
- Why not?
- Ah.
And you were in such haste to bring me the good news that you came by packet?
I'm honoured, señor.
It's one of my maxims that when it comes to a question of business, principle should deal with principle.
An admirable sentiment, señor.
So if you'd kindly sign these contracts, señor.
I see another British ship has come to anchor.
A schooner, I think.
Yes.
The house flag is not familiar.
A white letter O against a blue background.
- Do you know of such a company, señor?
- No, it's new to me.
- Come.
Ah, Captain Onedin.
I have been expecting you.
I received your letter three days ago.
I believe you are acquainted with Señor Callon.
Yes.
Señor Onedin has a matter of business he wishes to discuss.
So, señor, if you would be kind enough to sign these two contracts, sir,
I'll leave you two gentlemen to your discussions.
Unfortunately, Señor Callon, that is not possible.
Señor Onedin's proposals, I understand, will cover the very situation that we have been discussing.
With your permission, gentlemen.
Seven and one half per cent, señor?
Well, I'm not the man to stint when business is at stake.
I'll make it ten per cent and add another ship.
That gives you six ships to call on, and ten per cent reduction in your freightage charge.
You have no comment, señor?
Then you put me in some difficulty.
Without knowledge of your proposals, I must drive with the devil, huh?
I can better anything that Callon can offer.
I'll put an end to this lottery.
15 per cent.
Now, beyond that no man can show a profit.
- I can.
- He's got but one ship.
- Well, I shall have more.
- How?
That's my affair.
I'll offset my losses against my inventory.
20 per cent for the first six months, 15 per cent for the next six, and thereafter an option to renew.
Now if he tries to better that, he'll bankrupt himself and you.
I'll carry you on free of all charges.
What?
You'll find small profit there, I think, señor.
He's mad.
I shall find profit enough if I'm made your sole agent for the United Kingdom.
I see.
No, it's impossible to sail a ship on commission alone.
I shall also want a contract guaranteeing that my ships, and my ships alone, have the concession of returning your empty wine casks.
I begin to understand.
Please continue, señor.
Your proposal interests me.
Well, a matured wine cask is of greater value than its contents, you'd agree?
Indeed, yes.
Well, in future, instead of paying 15 or 20 different shipping agents, you pay only one - me.
And I undertake to collect and deliver, at agreed intervals, your wine casks in good condition.
We'll discuss the matter of their freight charges later.
- It is a clever scheme.
- But too clever by half.
- If it's your empty barrels, I can...
- Señor Callon, please.
Where does a man in my position place his trust?
That is the question I must ask.
- In you, señor?
- Well...
In all the years of our business, your rates have gone up, and never once come down.
- But...
- Until now.
Certainly you will serve me at any price.
But is it to serve me?
- Well...
- I think not.
To drive competition with new ideas of service off the seas.
That, I think, is your intention.
You'd have no English trade at all if it weren't for me.
By God, Braganza...
And when the competition is no more, Señor Callon, what will happen to your charges then?
They'll remain where I quoted them.
Captain Onedin has made a better offer.
Good day to you, señor.
You've not heard the last of this, Braganza.
Nor you, Onedin.
I'll drive you off the seas.
You'll learn, by God.
You'll learn.
And now to business.
First, you will require a note of authorisation.
Then there is the matter of your commission.
And you will explain to me in detail.
Well, your empty wine casks are stored in warehouses and transit sheds throughout the length and breadth of the Untied Kingdom.
I undertake to collect all your casks in my warehouse.
Oh?
You have a warehouse, señor?
I will have.
Sincro: wyxchari
You are sure the Master knows?
The report on the Doomsday weapon is missing from our files.
Only he could have taken it.
Then we can use the Doctor to deal with this problem.
The Doctor resents his exile bitterly.
Do you think he'll co-operate with us?
I doubt it.
We immobilized his TARDIS, took away his freedom to move in space and time.
Then we must restore his freedom as long as it serves our purpose.
Doctor, why don't you give up?
You've been working on that thing for simply ages.
You know I can't give up, Jo.
It's far too important.
Still at it, Doctor?
Now don't you start!
The latest field reports are in.
Still no trace of the Master.
Well, I didn't expect there would be.
No, his TARDIS is working again now.
He could be anywhere in space and time.
Yes, that's as maybe, Doctor, but I've got to keep on looking.
You're wasting your time, Brigadier.
Hello, Laboratory?
Yes, he's here.
Brigadier?
Oh, thank you.
Lethbridge Stewart?
Right.
Send him into my office.
One of my agents thinks he's picked up a trace of the Master.
Your agents are always picking up traces of the Master!
This agent happens to be particularly reliable, Doctor.
I'll let you what he says if you're interested.
Ah, now you've offended him!
Well!
Well, look what happened last time.
The man they arrested turned out to be the Spanish ambassador!
Well, there you are.
That's done it.
Done what?
I've made myself a completely new dematerialization circuit.
One that'll bypass the Time Lords homing control
- I hope.
You don't seriously think you'll get that thing working again, do you?
Oh no!
No, I've been doing all this work for fun!
I mean it's just a sort of hobby isn't it?
A kind of game?
A game?
Well, what have you got in there anyway - a policeman?
Why not step inside and see for yourself?
I don't believe it!
It's bigger inside than out!
Yes, that's because the TARDIS is dimensionally transcendental.
What does that mean?
It means that it's bigger inside than out!
Now then...
That's impossible!
The doors have closed.
What?
Doctor;
let me out of here.
Well, I can't, Jo!
I think we're taking off!
Well, stop it!
Well, I'm trying to.
Something's operating it by remote control!
The Time Lords!
I'm afraid you were right, Doctor.
Another dead end and we...
Doctor... come back at once!
All right, Doctor.
The joke's over.
Open the doors and let me out?
I can't, Jo.
We've taken off.
All right then, where are we?
At the moment we're nowhere.
Oh, don't be silly - we can't be nowhere.
We're outside the space-time continuum.
What?
Look.
What's happening?
Where are we going?
I've no idea.
We'll just have to wait until we emerge.
The planet Uxarieus!
So that's our destination...
Very impressive... but can we go back to Earth now, please?
I don't know, Jo.
I just don't know.
Is that supposed to be where we are?
That is where we are.
All right then, if we've landed on another planet, why don't you open the doors.
Because the atmosphere out there might be poisonous, that's why.
I'll just check.
And is it?
Is it what?
Is the atmosphere poisonous?
No, no, it's quite healthy.
Similar to Earth before the invention of the motor car.
Look Doctor, are you going to open the doors or not?
Well, I can but try.
Thank you.
Doctor!
That's an alien world out there, Jo.
Think of it.
I don't want to think of it!
I want to go back to Earth!
Look, do you realize how long I've been confined to one planet?
All that talk of yours about traveling in time and space - it was true!
Well, of course it was true!
Before I was stranded on Earth, I spent all my time exploring new worlds and seeking the wonders of the universe.
But you don't know what's out there!
Then let's find out!
Don't you want to set foot in another world?
Well, yes, I do but I...
Good!
Come on.
We'll just take a quick look around... and then I'll try and get you back to Earth, all right?
All right.
Look...
It's got different colored petals.
What are they?
Well, tracks made by some sort of machine.
This planet must be inhabited after all.
I think we'd get a better view from up there.
Come on, what are you waiting for?
I feel a bit scared.
Come on, Jo.
Nothing to worry about.
Those things up there?
Like some sort of prefabricated dwellings.
Well look, there's another one - a small one, up there.
Let's go and take a look at them.
Oh no, you don't!
Let's get back to the TARDIS.
Yes, all right.
But, erm...
Do you mind if I take a look at that rock first?
It's rather unusual.
Doctor?
Doctor?
Listen, Ashe, I saw those creatures.
We both did.
I surveyed this planet myself before the colony was set up.
Well, you didn't do much of a job.
And all the time we've been here, there's been no trace of any hostile animal life.
Well, there is now!
We heard this roaring in the middle of the night.
When we looked out, there it was.
What did it look like?
It was enormous - some kind of giant lizard.
You must have been having nightmares!
Did it do any damage?
No, I fired a few shots and frightened it off.
Well, exactly.
All right, Martin.
David, how many men have you got to spare?
About six.
Well, go over to Martin's dome and have a look - just in case.
Very well.
What the...?
Leeson, who's this?
How do you do?
Well, I must say this is most impressive.
We found these two in sector twenty-seven.
They say they're explorers.
Where do they come from?
Err, we come from Earth.
They were examining rock samples.
They're mineralogists.
It was bound to happen!
Look, we are not mineralogists.
And even if we were, why all the hostility?
It's a respectable profession.
Because we don't want our planet gutted!
This is our world!
You've no right to be here!
Look, we've as much right to be here as anybody else.
This planet has been classified as suitable for colonization.
Once your big mining combines move in, you'll reduce it to a galactic slagheap!
Haven't you got laws to deal with this kind of thing?
Yes, there are laws.
We complain to Earth's government just like all the others.
By the time you get a final decision, the planet's useless.
I see.
Yes well, I can sympathize with you gentlemen but I can assure you that I'm not working for anybody.
Then just why have you come here?
Pure chance.
My spaceship developed a fault.
We had to land somewhere.
Can you show me your papers?
Err, papers?
Err, no, err, th... erm, they're back in my spaceship, if you'd like to come back there with me...
I think it would be better if you spent the night here.
We'll go to your spaceship in the morning.
Oh, we don't want to put you to any trouble.
I'd rather you did as I say.
Jane?
Yes, John?
Show our two... "guests" to the dining area.
We'll fix up your sleeping accommodation later.
Yes, go with them.
It's all right, Jo.
I'll join you later.
All right.
This way.
What do you think you're up to!
These are your crop records, I take it?
That's right, but I... really don't see what it has to do with you.
It's a very poor showing, isn't it?
Are you operating above subsistence level?
We're surviving!
Come on!
No, no, just a minute.
I'd like to hear what he has to say.
Unless I'm very much mistaken, you've got far more to worry about that mineralogist.
Just what do you mean by that?
Unless things improve radically, you're in grave danger of starving to death...
I don't care what Ashe says, we say it, didn't we?
I'm sure Ashe believes you.
You can sit where you like.
Ah, he thinks we're seeing things.
You two had better watch out.
It could be you next.
Ashe will take care of things.
Is that the first course?
It's the only course.
Supplies are getting a bit low.
_ bound to be difficult.
It's very nice.
Thank you.
I'd better get back to my husband.
At least it's better than being back on Earth.
Oh, I don't know - things weren't so bad there.
Weren't they.
No room to move?
Polluted air?
Not a blade of grass left on the planet, and a government that locks you up if you think for yourself.
At least they fed you - this isn't exactly the Garden of Eden.
And Ashe said we could make it further.
Are you ready, Martin?
We're going to look for your monsters.
Let's hope we find something.
You may be sorry if you do.
Oh, we can skin it and you can use it for a rug.
Hello!
Hello.
I'm Mary Ashe.
My father told me about you.
Jo Grant, how do you do?
Is that what they're wearing on Earth now?
More or less...
It was all quite different when we left back in '71.
You left in 1971?
No, 2471!
I've been checking the northern sector.
How's it going?
It isn't.
These cover crops won't even start to grow.
What about the other sectors?
Huh!
It's even worse.
Never mind, my dear.
We should never have come here.
We didn't even have a room of our own on Earth.
Now, we've got land.
What's the point of owning land if it won't grow a decent crop?
Ashe is working on it.
Ashe knows we're beaten.
He just won't admit it.
Anyway, probably doesn't matter anymore.
What do you mean?
Those people that I found this morning - suppose they are spies for one of the big mining combines.
You seemed to believe what they say.
What was that?
I don't know.
Must have been the wind.
Even if the mining combines do come, they can't drive us out.
We were here first.
Oh, can't they?
It's happened before.
Get on the radio!
Don't go out there!
Maybe I can drive it off.
Hello?
Main dome - can you hear me?
!
Can you hear me?
!
This is main dome.
Please identify.
This is Jane Leeson.
Our dome is being attacked.
Some kind of giant reptile!
Please, you must send help!
Who are you?
What do you want?
Go away!
Go away!
See if I've got this right - you brought your colonists to this planet just over a year ago?
Yes.
You set up your main dome here... with all your subsidiary domes around it.
That's right.
I made a preliminary survey before I sent for the others.
And you were convinced that this planet was suitable for habitation, despite the exhaustion of the soil?
Well, worn out soil can be reclaimed, Doctor, as you well know.
We should have had subsidence crops within the year.
Exactly - should have.
The cover crop refuses to grow!
We plant it; it shoots up and then withers - again and again.
There seems to be no reason for it.
Well, in theory, you should have a bumper crop by now.
I can't feed my people on theories, Doctor.
No, no, of course not.
Well, in practical terms, what you must do is this...
Jane Leeson's just radioed in!
Well, can't it wait?
I'm very busy.
She say's their dome's being attacked!
Attacked?
By some kind of giant reptile!
I heard it too - she sounded terrified!
The radio cut out while she was still talking.
But didn't you say you'd sent some men down there?
Yes, but to Martin's dome at the other end of the colony.
Look; get in touch with Winton.
Tell him to get over to Leeson's dome as fast as he can.
I'll join you there.
I'll come with you, if I may.
Well, there's no need for you to get involved, Doctor.
Scientific curiosity, my dear chap.
I find your planet most intriguing.
Very well, thank you.
Doctor, I don't think you should go.
It might be dangerous.
Jo, don't worry about me.
I'll be careful.
Now go and get some sleep.
Sleep!
How do you expect me to s..?
Doctor!
_at Leeson's dome.
I repeat
- Leeson's dome.
Do you read me?
I read you.
We're on our way.
Be careful.
How long did you say you'd been on this planet?
Just over a year.
And you found no sign of these creatures then?
There's no animal life.
Just a few birds and insects.
Well, there is now.
Robert, there's nothing you could have done.
They were both dead when we got here.
Did you see the creatures?
We caught a glimpse of one as we arrived.
Everyone blazed away like mad.
And what happened?
Nothing.
It didn't even seem to notice.
You must have missed!
What - all of us?
We tried to get in closer but it just... disappeared.
Vanished into the darkness.
It'll be daylight soon.
Perhaps we shall be able to pick up tracks or bloodstains.
I doubt it.
Come and take a look at these claw marks, gentlemen.
Well, what about them?
Are you trying to tell me these were made by a giant lizard, Winton?
Yes, it must have been a least twenty-foot high.
Twenty foot high?
Yes.
Well, will you kindly tell me how a creature twenty feet high came through that door?
Why can't you admit defeat, Ashe?
We've got to get back to Earth.
If we go back to Earth, we'll be worse off than we were before.
All our savings have gone into this.
Then we must move on to another planet.
If we stay here, we'll be dead!
I'm not sure that we can move on.
Our spaceship was old when we bought it - it may not survive another trip.
Oh, Robert, why won't you admit your mistakes?
We've invested a year of our lives in this place.
We've got the beginnings of a colony.
Our food stocks are getting lower all the time.
We can't even support ourselves.
All right, we've got problems, but they can be overcome!
Ashe is perfectly right.
There is no reason why this planet should not support a thriving colony.
I suppose you're an expert in agriculture?
Yes, yes, as a matter of fact, I am.
Then why won't my crops grow?
Because they are being inhibited by some unnatural force!
We must track it down and overcome it.
But two people have been killed, or have you forgotten that?
Killed by creatures that vanish without trace?
Look, we saw something!
Whatever it was you saw can be destroyed!
This colony is our only hope.
If we leave it, we'll have nothing.
If we stay, we may have a future.
Why won't you...
He's right!
We've put too much work into this place to leave.
What if these animals attack again?
We fight back.
Good!
Now what about the rest of you?
Are you willing to give it another try?
Well, if there really is a chance...
There is if we stick together!
Now, what we've got to do is to organize patrols for the domes.
The Doctor here will help us with...
Robert, wait!
One of the patrols found him wandering in the south sector.
Get some water, somebody - quickly!
Where are you from?
Can you understand what I say?
It's all right, old chap, You're amongst friends now.
Who are you?
Where have you come from?
Colony... come from colony...
What colony?
Long way... from here.
Do you mean there's another colony on this planet?
I've been wandering...
long time... nine months.
These other colonists - well where are they?
Dead... they're all dead... giant lizards!
Lizards?
Came from nowhere... killed... everything.
I'm the only one...
left.
I hope you find what you're looking for, Doctor.
I only hope you're right.
No!
No, he is our friend.
Err, these are ours.
You must leave them.
Do they have a language of their own?
I've never heard them speak but they seem to understand what I say.
Extraordinary.
Must be some rudimentary telepathic ability.
Are they friendly?
Depends on how you treat them.
We had two colonists killed when we first moved here.
You... must go... now.
Just what are you looking for Doctor?
I've no idea.
Possibly some evidence to convince your colonists to stay.
Yes, I thought I'd won them over until that man turned up.
Now I don't know how long I can hold them.
Just play for time.
Yes.
Well, I'd better get back there to see what's happening.
Can you find your own way back?
Yes, oh yes, of course.
Right, I'll leave you to it then and... be careful.
Sincro: wyxchari
What's that beeping noise?
Someone's trying to rescue Miss Grant.
You can't!
I warned you, Doctor!
No!
Ah, it's no use, I can't see...
Just a minute!
Where is the Adjudicator?
He's not the Adjudicator, he's a fake!
We know that!
Where is he!
Calm down - take it easy!
Where could he have got to?
Do you know?
He went with the Doctor.
Where!
To the Primitive city.
Are you the leader of these people?
I've come to help you.
Why doesn't he answer?
They don't speak.
They're telepathic.
No, wait!
What is this place?
Well, it looks like some sort of lumber-room.
But err, take a look at this frieze here.
I think it might interest you.
Yes...
It's a sort of chronicle of their history, showing that their science has deteriorated into a somewhat primitive religion.
The Master's a sort of... super-criminal.
He can travel in time and space.
He...
I'm afraid I can't help you.
I understand you've been to this Primitive City?
Yes, and we only just got out alive.
She has told me how to get there.
I could take some men and hunt them down.
No, you're needed here.
I'll send a squad after them once we've got rid of these people.
Things are going too slowly - get them moving!
What about this girl?
She goes with the colonists.
Look, I'm not a colonist!
I've got to find the Doctor.
Put her with the rest!
You must help me - please!
You heard what Captain Dent said - get on that ship.
You've... got to find the Master and stop him - for everyone's sake!
There's nothing I can do.
Let me go.
If we can find the Doctor, we may be able to stop him.
Caldwell, you were told to put her on the ship.
All right, Morgan, all right.
Caldwell, you're still under my discipline, even if you are an engineer - now you remember that!
Who could forget it!
Come on you.
Oh, please, you've got to...
You've given me enough trouble, now get on that ship when you're told!
Please listen to me!
Get under there.
Move, quick before I change my mind!
That's absolutely fascinating!
The whole story is here!
Is it?
Well, perhaps you'd be kind enough to explain it to me?
Well, this city was once the center of a great civilization.
Yes, I had rather gathered that.
By genetic engineering, they developed a super-race.
Now that priest we saw must be a remnant of it.
You deduced all that from these pictures?
Well, not exactly, I...
I knew it already.
The files of the Time Lords are very comprehensive.
Ah, so that's more like it.
You mean that you stole the information?
Well, it seemed an awful pity not to make use of it, you know?
Well of course, that's typical of the High Council of the Time Lords - know everything, do nothing!
Tell me, why are you so interested in the history of this planet?
Well, this super-race developed a Doomsday Weapon - it was never used.
Why not?
Super-weapons usually are eventually.
Who knows?
Maybe it was due to a... a degeneration of the life strain.
I see.
And so the super race became... priests of a lunatic religion worshipping machines instead of gods.
So it would seem.
Well, may I remind you that their religion embraces sacrifice... and that we are the destined victims?
You're going to use this weapon?
Not unless it's absolutely necessary.
Well, don't you see, Doctor?
The very threat of its use could hold the galaxy to ransom.
I think you've left it a trifle late.
Doctor, you underrate me.
What about me?
Try holding your breath!
Is that the last of them?
Yes, they're all on board now.
That troublemaker
- Winton.
Well?
You've checked him off.
I didn't see him.
He's been on board some time.
He's trying to get the engines working properly.
Morgan.
Where's Caldwell?
Well, he's keeping out of the way in case he has to see anything unpleasant.
He'll be all right once we've got rid of these people.
Mary?
Ready to go?
You're sending us to our deaths.
Oh, nonsense.
My engineer checked your spaceship - it's sound enough.
How are you going to explain to Earth government if something happens to us?
There will be no explanation.
Once you're off this planet, you're no longer my concern.
I think you're forgetting one thing, Captain Dent.
Really?
I'm the only qualified space pilot left in this colony.
Suppose I refuse to blast off?
Then you can sit in your ship till you rot.
Try to get out and you'll be shot on the spot.
Suppose they do try to get out.
Put a man with a communicator on that hill overlooking the dome.
If they do try to leave the ship, he can call up a security squad.
Very well.
Which way do we go now?
Wait, Doctor!
Yes, we're very near to our goal now.
You will soon see the most powerful weapon ever created.
Is everyone aboard?
Yes.
Very well.
Start your final checkout.
Take the buggy back to the ship.
They've just started final check-up.
Have the guards been posted?
Yes - and the other guards have returned to the ship.
We'd better get back - just in case.
Captain Dent to Security Guard Rogers.
Captain Dent to Security Guard Rogers.
Receiving you, sir?
What's happening there?
Not a thing, sir.
No attempts to leave the ship, mm?
No sir.
If anything happens, anything at all, I want to know at once.
Captain Dent out.
Shall I call up the guard again?
Yes.
No.
Can you get the colonist's ship on video-link?
I can try.
The best I can do I'm afraid.
Mmm.
Their equipment's pretty ropy.
Ashe?
Are you receiving me?
Captain Dent speaking.
Yes, I'm receiving you.
What's the delay?
An electrical fault in our life support system.
We're repairing it now.
How much longer?
Nearly fixed.
We'll start countdown in a few moments.
Excellent.
Goodbye Ashe.
Do you think he means it?
What else can he do?
Do you think they were hurt?
They must have been thrown clear.
Or else they've gone ahead on foot.
It's the colonist's spaceship!
They've made it!
All those people...
And I told them the motors were all right.
Wait, Doctor.
This is it.
Is it?
Well where is this super weapon of yours.
We're in the heart of it.
It stretches for miles all round us.
Look, let me try and explain how it works.
Yes.
Look!
That, Doctor, is the sun that gives life to the planet Earth that you hold in such affection.
I do know a little basic astronomy.
Then you will know that, one day, that sun will burn through to its core and explode.
In about ten thousand million years time, yes.
Well, with this weapon, I could make that happen now!
That's unbelievable!
You know the Crab Nebula?
The cloud of cosmic matter that was once a sun, of course.
That was the result of the super race testing this weapon!
Well, this it.
How do we get in?
I don't know.
The Doctor and I were taken in.
There must be some way of opening it?
Beats me.
We'll have to find another entrance.
Look!
I think it's this way, let's try.
So, you intend to hold the universe to ransom?
Doctor, why don't you come in with me?
We're both Time Lords, we're both renegades.
We could be masters of the galaxy!
Think of it, Doctor.
Absolute power!
Power for good.
Why, you could reign benevolently, you could end wars, suffering, disease.
We could save the universe.
No, absolute power is evil.
Consider carefully, Doctor.
I'm offering you a half-share in the universe.
Well?
I don't know.
We're lost.
Yes.
Morgan, where's Caldwell?
None of the other miners have seen him.
One of the guards saw him leaving the dome in a space buggy.
He was heading for the Primitive City.
Take a squad and get after him.
Is he worth the trouble?
Caldwell's our mining expert and don't you forget it.
We can't do without him.
What about that Doctor and the fake Adjudicator?
The only one we need is Caldwell.
There will be trouble about those colonists, you know.
We offered to check their ship to make sure it was safe.
They refused our help.
It's all in my report.
Of course.
You must see reason, Doctor.
No, I will not join you in your absurd dreams of a galactic conquest.
Why?
Why?
!
Look at this...
Look at all those planetary systems, Doctor.
We could rule them all!
What for?
What is the point?
The point is that one must rule or serve - that's a basic law of life!
Why do you hesitate, Doctor?
Surely it's not loyalty to the Time Lords, who exiled you on one insignificant planet?
You'll never understand, will you?
I want to see the universe - not rule it!
Then I'm very sorry, Doctor!
What's happening?
Wait and see!
What is it?
The ultimate development of life on this planet.
Why have you returned?
What do you want here?
I want to restore this city and this planet to their former glory.
Don't listen to him, sir.
You have here a wonderful weapon!
Why with it you could bring good and peace to every world in the galaxy!
On the contrary, he'll bring only death and destruction.
This planet of yours could be the center of a mighty empire!
The greatest that the cosmos has ever known!
Tell me, sir, has this weapon of yours ever brought good to your planet?
Once the weapon was built, our race began to decay.
The radiation from the weapon's power source poisoned the soil of our planet.
Exactly.
The weapon has only brought death - and yet he wants to spread that death throughout the galaxy!
Unless you destroy this weapon, sir, he will use it for evil.
No!
You must be mad!
Why with this, we could control every galaxy in the cosmos!
We could be gods!
You are not fit to be a god.
I sense... that if you have control of this weapon, you will bring only unhappiness and destruction to the entire universe.
Then die!
There is a self-destructor mechanism.
You will please operate it.
Not only does justice prevail on your planet, sir, but also infinite compassion.
You must leave at once, or you will be destroyed with the city!
Thank you, sir.
Come back, you'll all be killed!
Come on!
Do you want to die with them?
!
Jo, what are you doing here?
!
Looking for you!
We've got to get out of here at once!
The whole place is going up!
You had a map - give it to me.
You fend for yourself!
Help that man!
I think this is it, come on.
Get up!
All of you, get up!
Caldwell, come over here.
You've arrived just in time.
Put these people under arrest.
Get back to your friends.
You don't understand.
I am the Adjudicator.
You're an imposter.
We don't need you.
You've got to do something, Doctor.
They're going to kill you!
Morgan, you can't!
Shut up, Caldwell.
If we didn't need you, you'd be over with them!
You're insane.
Drop those guns!
Take cover!
Surrender the rest of you - you won't be killed.
The Master - he's gone!
Look!
Now look, stop worrying.
It was the radiation from that weapon that was poisoning the soil.
Your cover crops will grow now.
Yes, well...
let's hope you're right.
You know, I still don't understand why you weren't in that ship when it blew up?
Well, we knew the IMC would have to get clear before we blasted off.
I hid in the dome;
I... knocked out the guard and let the others out.
Yes, but it took off and blew up
- I saw it.
Ashe?
He took it up alone.
But he must have known!
The rocket had to take off!
It was the only way that we could get IMC out of the way.
And Ashe insisted on staying on board?
Yes, yes, he would, of course.
Doctor, there's something here for you!
The TARDIS!
My dear chap, this is absolutely splendid!
Where did you find it?
In one of the dwellings a few miles from the dome.
There was a lot of stuff there that the Primitives have stolen.
Well I cannot tell you how grateful I am.
Doctor, what is it?
What is it?
Well, erm, it's, err... it's a sort of antique really.
Err, but err, it does have great sentimental value.
Will you excuse us?
Yes, of course.
Mary?
We've had a reply from Earth.
They're sending an Adjudicator.
A genuine one, I hope?
This time, yes.
What about you, Caldwell?
You're finished with IMC.
You can never go back to Earth.
I don't think I want to.
You want to stay here?
Well, if you've a place for an out-of-work miner, yes.
All right.
We'd be glad to have you.
Well, for a start, I can help you with your power...
Doctor... come back at once!
Come on out, Doctor.
Well, that was a short trip.
You'll never get that thing working properly.
Oh, you were right about that report, I'm afraid.
It wasn't the Master after all.
He's talking as if we'd never been away.
As far as he's concerned, we haven't.
The TARDIS returned to Earth just a few seconds after it left.
What are you two talking about?
Don't try and explain Jo.
He'd never understand.

Doctor Who Season 8 Terror of the Autons 4 of 4
Original air date: 1971/01/23
Hello Doctor, is that you?
Who is this?
What do you want?
Simply to say goodbye, Doctor.
Help Brigadier.
Help.
Cable.
Pull it out.
Pull it out.
You all right, Doctor?
Yes, more or less.
I'm afraid I cut your connection.
Very amusing.
What happened?
Well, remember what I told you, Brigadier?
The Nestenes can put life into anything made of plastic.
Anything at all.
I see, and there's a lot of plastic around.
Doctor?
Doctor?
Well I was wrong, it isn't heat.
- Well?
- Message from the Brigadier.
What is it this time?
- It's about these daffodils.
- What about them?
You remember we had a report of a plastics promotion tour.
Well, they're handing out daffodils.
Who are?
Well, chaps in weird carnival masks, touring round in a coach.
Did they say how many they'd given out?
No they didn't.
We've got no idea at all I'm afraid.
We don't even know how long they've been doing it.
The thing is that the Brigadier wants to know if the daffs are dangerous.
That, Captain Yates, is what I'm trying to find out.
Excellent, where was it?
Well, give me the grid reference.
Yeah.
No, just maintain contact.
I want to tackle them in open country.
Good, keep me informed.
Lethbridge Stewart here, I want a call to the RAF please.
Priority red-one strike command.
'Scuse me, Jo.
What are you doing?
Well, this is a section of that daffodil.
I'm trying to find out its molecular structure.
No.
Hello, what's this?
A programme pattern.
A programme pattern?
Yes.
These daffodils have their instructions imprinted on every cell.
It's a weapon of some sort.
But what sort?
Well, will those signs help you find out?
They will if I can translate them.
My word!
You look very fierce.
We've located that coach load of Nestene Autons...
- ...distributing those daffodils, Doctor.
- Good.
They're hiding in that same quarry where they took you.
Well that's curious.
Was the Master with them?
I couldn't say.
You might be able to identify him afterwards.
Afterwards?
I've got the R.A.F. to lay on a rocket strike.
In a few hours time, that coach will be a pile of scrap iron.
The military mind at its most scintillating.
Faced with a problem they blast it off the face of the earth.
- What do you think we should do?
- Nothing.
Keep them under observation for a while... and give me a chance to find out the purpose of these flowers.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I can't afford to take that risk.
If that coach moves to a populated area, it'll be impossible to destroy it.
The strike will go ahead as planned.
- Captain Yates?
- Yes, Doctor?
- How long have we got?
- About an hour and a half.
The RAF boys are setting things up now... and we have established an observation point at the quarry.
Mike, can we reach you there?
Sure we'll be in radio contact with HQ and with the RAF.
You can get us on one of these.
See you, Doc.
Bye Jo.
An hour and a half.
- Everything seems quiet.
- The humans are watching us.
How do you know?
We were followed to this place.
But won't that profile pattern be a Nestene?
Yes, well done.
That's why I'm converting it to visual symbols.
Ah, here it comes.
That's a face.
A part of one.
Yes, yes, a nose and a mouth.
What does that mean?
- I've no idea.
- So what next?
Well, if it is a weapon, we must find out what triggers it off.
Jo, get in touch with the Brigadier, will you?
See if he can hold up that air strike.
I must have more time.
Hello Greyhound, this is trap one.
Do you read me?
Over.
There seems to be something wrong.
Hello Greyhound, this is trap one.
Do you read me?
Over.
Jo, look.
It's alive.
Short wave radio.
You must have triggered it off with that walkie-talkie.
Of course, they must be planning to set them all off with a gigantic radio signal.
If I could only find out directional.
It seems to be looking for something.
Jo, be careful.
Jo.
It's all over.
You all right?
Just a bit short of breath.
What happened?
Well, your nose and mouth were sealed off with this.
What's that?
Plastic film, you would have been unconscious in two minutes, dead in under ten.
So all those people were killed by the daffodils?
Yes.
Yes, they must have triggered them off accidentally - just as you did.
- Jo, do something for me will you?
- Yes, of course.
Get in touch with that idiot Brownrose.
See if plastic daffodils were found at the scenes of any of those deaths.
And ask him if anybody was using short wave radios, will you?
- Okay.
- You all right?
Fine Doctor, and thank you.
Thank you, Eagle, message confirmed.
Over and out.
That's it then sir.
Air strike confirmed.
Right.
No word from the Doctor then sir?
No.
The air strikes due to begin in 37 minutes.
If the Doctor's coming up with anything, he'd better be quick.
Now, why wasn't this stuff found on the bodies?
Yes of course.
Dissolved by carbon dioxide from the lungs.
Good afternoon, Doctor.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything important?
No, no, indeed not.
You've come here to kill me, of course.
- But not without considerable regret.
- How very comforting!
You see Doctor, you're my intellectual equal.
Almost.
I have so few worth opponents.
When they've gone, I always miss them.
- How did you get in here?
- Don't be trivial, Doctor.
I see you've been working on the Nestene Autojet.
My own small contribution to their invasion plan.
Viscous, complicated and inefficient.
Typical of your way of thinking.
Now, come, come Doctor.
Death is always more frightening when it strikes invisibly.
Tell me, how do you intend to activate these flowers?
By a radio impulse which the Nestenes will send.
I shall open the channel for them.
We've distributed four hundred and fifty thousand of these daffodils, so when 450 thousand people fall dead, the country will be disrupted.
And in the confusion the Nestenes will land their invasion force?
Exactly.
It's a shame that you can't be here... to enjoy the chaos and destruction with me.
Goodbye Doctor.
- You were quite right.
- Wait, don't shoot.
Doctor, you do disappoint me.
We Time Lords are expected to face death with dignity.
- Oh no!
- Don't worry, he's not going to kill me.
That is your last mistake.
If you fire that thing, you will never be able to leave this planet.
You're bluffing on an empty hand, Doctor.
I'm not bluffing and my hand, as you can see, is not empty.
If you kill me, you will destroy the dematerialisation circuit from your own TARDIS.
You recognise it, I feel sure.
- Where did you get that?
- The circus.
You underestimate me, Doctor.
Let me be quite plain, either you hand that unit over to me now or I kill Miss Grant.
Touché.
Don't.
He's beaten already.
They're going to bomb the quarry.
Jo!
There's been a slight change of plan, Doctor.
I've decided to let you live for a little while.
Not long now, sir.
- What's happening out there?
- The human's are planning to attack us.
We should try and leave.
We shall leave soon.
Our task is not yet completed.
He's left us.
He's deserted.
How did I get here?
I'm not part of this.
29... 28...
Look sir.
- Benton, stop that air strike.
- It's too late, sir.
Well try man, try.
Eagle, eagle, eagle.
Abort, abort, abort.
Now tie these two up.
Not a sign of life down there.
What do we do if they try to move out?
I don't know.
Farrel?
Farrel became undependable.
Did he?
His father would have been proud of him.
Yes Miss Grant, they are a little heavy handed.
I apologise for your last moments on earth being so uncomfortable, Doctor.
Thank you.
Right, you come with me.
Now, because of the change in circumstances, we're going to have to bring our schedule forward.
What we're going to do is this:
- It's absolutely essential that we...
- Jo,
- ...you know where we are, don't you.
- Roughly, why?
We're just three or four miles from the radio telescope.
So?
The Master will activate the daffodils from there.
What are you doing.
I'm going to warn UNIT.
If I can just reach these brake pedals.
Doctor, if you're going to drive, I want to get off.
No, only hope the Brigadier's keeping his eyes open.
Got it.
Sir, sir.
The brake lights are flashing.
Yes, you're right.
- Somebody's signalling.
- The Doctor.
- Benton.
- Yes, sir.
Get this down.
E...
S...
T...
- Do you think they're getting it?
- If I can just keep trying.
...I...
O...
N.
That's it.
Read that back, Benton.
Daffodils are lethal.
Activated soon.
Destroy immediately.
Guard radio research station.
Benton, send an alert to the civil police.
I want radio and TV warnings, loudspeaker vans house to house, the lot.
- Right away, sir.
- Captain Yates, rustle up every available man and put a guard on that radio research station.
- Hello, bluebottle 3, this is greyhound.
- I'll stay here with the coach.
Do you read me?
Over.
You know, Jo, it's a pity escapeology wasn't part of your curriculum.
Funny you should say that, look.
- Well done.
- Careful.
Well, I hope that you two have enjoyed your little rest.
Right, the time has come for our final move.
They're on the move.
Come on, Benton.
Right, sir.
That's it, I'm free.
If he slows down, we might be able to jump for it.
Right.
Get back, Farrel.
- Are you all right?
- It's my ankle.
The two humans have escaped.
Never mind about them.
I must get to the radio telescope.
The Autojets are being destroyed.
It's too late.
No.
Get out there all of you.
Keep those soldiers back.
Brigadier, those daffodils...
Doctor, look.
The radio telescope.
We must stop him reaching the control he'll open the channel for the Nestenes.
Benton, get a stretcher party and get some more men.
Right, sir.
- It's locked.
- Stand back, Doctor.
Too late, Doctor.
The Nestenes are here.
Amateur landing of course, not the way I planned it.
- If only we can shut off the power.
- Impossible, they've taken control.
No one can stop them now.
Your precious little planet is finished.
If we're finished, then you're finished too.
Nonsense.
I helped them to come here.
Do you really think that that thing will distinguish between you and us?
It's no good, sir, we just can't hold them.
Can't you do anything, Doctor?
Not, unless we change the polarity.
Whilst the transfer shift is still open?
- It will fling them right out into space.
- You're right.
Well, you'd better try it and quick.
Get onto the transfer bank, I'll switch the power through.
Are you ready?
- Yes.
- Right, now.
Well, Doctor, it worked.
Yes, but only just.
Another minute and we'd have been too late.
He's gone.
After him, quick.
Look.
Sir.
He's in the coach, sir.
We've got him now.
Don't be too sure.
Don't trust him, Brigadier, it's a trick.
Well, that's the end of him.
I told you not to be too sure.
Look out.
Well, we found the abandoned coach but the Master disappeared completely.
He's probably left Earth by now.
- Oh no.
- What makes you so sure?
Well, his TARDIS can't go anywhere, not without this.
And what the dickens is that?
Well that's a dematerialisation circuit.
It's very complicated.
¿So the one he took from you?
Belonged to my TARDIS, yes.
I've been trying to repair it for months.
And now he's stuck here on Earth.
Yes, I'm afraid so.
Think he'll turn up again, Doctor?
Bound to.
Well, you don't seem very worried about it.
I'm not.
As a matter of fact, Jo, I'm quite looking forward to it.
Sincro: wyxchari
Right!
You can get up now.
Thank you very much.
You know, you really ought to keep this thing of yours under better control.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
He's only a mark three servo-robot.
He's not very bright.
What happened in here?
Well, I only wish I knew.
Something attacked this place late last night.
Is it your place?
No.
No, it belonged to two colonists.
Colonists?
According to Earth control, this planet hasn't been colonized.
It appears they we wrong, doesn't it?
Mmm.
May I ask what you're doing here?
IMC
- Interplanetary Mining Corporation.
We're doing a mineral survey.
How long have you been here?
We've just arrived.
Colonists, eh?
Well now we've got trouble.
Why?
Presumably you'll be moving to another planet?
Well, it isn't up to me.
They'll have to sort that out at Earth control.
Erm, what are you up to?
Erm, I, err, I'm, just making a few tests.
Are you some kind of scientist?
I'm every kind of scientist.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Look, I'm... on my way back to my spaceship.
How about you coming back with me?
Well, I'd like to, but erm...
I haven't really got the time.
In any case, I ought to get back and tell the colonists that you've arrived.
You have got plenty of time, you know.
Yes, well, I suppose I could spare you a few moments.
You know, it's lucky no one was hurt.
What gave you that impression?
Well, surely, didn't you say...?
No, I didn't say anything of the sort.
The two colonists that were living here have been killed!
Two people killed?
That's right.
Erm, we'd better get moving.
What are you doing?
Programming Charlie to go back to the spaceship.
Well, how far is your ship?
Only a few kilometers.
So no one from your colony survived?
The lizards killed most of them.
The primitives finished off the rest.
The primitives attacked you as well?
Well, after the lizards there were only a few survivors.
When the primitives saw how weak we were, they... they turned on us.
They killed my family, m... my friends - everyone!
Your primitives don't seem too hostile?
They were when we first got here.
Some of my friends were killed.
You get on all right with them now.
Mmm so did we - till we were defenseless.
Maybe now Robert Ashe will listen to me!
We must move on to another planet.
You're not just gonna give up, are you?
After all the work you've done here?
Well, there's a time to cut your losses!
We can't even grow our own food.
I'm sure the Doctor will be able to help you.
What Doctor?
They turned up out of nowhere - this girl and a man.
Who are they?
Where do they come from?
Well?
We don't really know much about you, you know?
We told you!
We're explorers!
But just the two of you?
With a spaceship all to yourselves?
That's right.
You work for the government?
No, we don't work for anybody, we just...
What are you doing?
They killed the survivors!
All of them!
Get out of the way!
He'll kill you.
All right.
Put that gun down!
Y... y... you don't understand!
You... you can't trust them!
I said put that gun down!
We have a truce with the primitives!
We mustn't be the first to break it!
We have a truce all right, Robert.
But only because you give them our food.
You need rest.
Show him where he can lie down, somebody.
One day you'll wish you'd listened to me.
Wait outside
- I will bring you food.
Robert, we can't keep feeding these savages!
We've got to keep on good terms with them - for our own safety!
While I'm leader of this colony, we'll treat the primitives in my way.
Even if we starve?
Get out of my way, David.
He's right, you know.
You ought to listen to him - he is your leader, isn't he?
Maybe that's been my mistake.
The TARDIS - it's gone!
I've just got the first survey results.
Well?
The computer predicts there's enough duralinium here to build one million living units on Earth.
Excellent.
The thing I can't understand is why this planet was assigned for colonization!
Does it matter?
Look
- Caldwell's found us a colonist.
Huh, I wonder why he's wearing fancy dress?
All colonists are eccentric, Morgan, otherwise they wouldn't be colonists.
Hmm, and what are you going to say to this "eccentric"?
The usual story - that we've just arrived and we're surprised and shocked that the place has been colonized.
Suppose they don't believe us?
It doesn't matter what they believe - they won't be here for long.
Please?
Thank you.
And would you mind staying in here, please, while I let my colleagues know?
Yes, of course.
Erm, look make yourself at home.
That's the entertainment console.
I shan't be long.
Right.
I've just brought a man in here.
So I saw.
He was at the wrecked dome and he tells me that two people have been killed!
Now, he's only supposed to scare people off - not slaughter them!
Do you know about this, Morgan?
Yes - it was an accident.
What do you mean - "accident"?
!
They found me!
They started shooting!
What was I supposed to do - let myself get killed?
You acted very foolishly, Morgan.
You should never have let yourself be seen.
Foolishly?
Dent, is that all you've got to say?
Believe me, Caldwell, I regret this just as much as you do.
Oh, he...
Look, there's no point in arguing about it!
Besides, once these colonists have left this planet, there will be no more "regrettable incidents".
Look, two people are dead and I want to know...
You may care to look at this report...
I want to know for certain...
Look at it!
It's going to make you rich.
This planet has enough duralinium to double the company's profits next year.
Your bonus will be big enough to retire on.
If we get rid of the colonists.
Yes, well all right, we can go ahead.
But there's no need for anyone else to be killed.
I think I'll have a chat with this colonist of yours.
Be interesting to know the state of morale.
Scientists have turned to new means for providing accommodation for our ever-increasing population.
These floating islands, rising to three hundred stories, will make living space for five hundred million people.
I'm Captain Dent - in charge of this survey team.
A great pleasure to meet you, Mister?
Not Mister
- Doctor.
How do you do?
Well Doctor, it seems a most unfortunate mistake has been made.
I'm glad you admit it.
I take it you're preparing to leave at once.
It's not necessarily out mistake.
As things have turned out, this planet doesn't seem very suitable for colonization.
Oh, why?
I understand it's still infested with hostile animal life?
The hostile animals - if they exist - can be found and destroyed, sir.
I admire your optimism.
Is it shared by the other colonists?
Hmm!
I'm not a colonist.
I'm a visitor.
I see, then you're not really concerned?
I'm very much concerned!
The colonists shouldn't be here.
My corporation has been assigned the mineral rights on this planet.
Our preliminary survey indicates a... very rich concentration of duralinium.
You know how the Earth needs that mineral.
Earth - or your corporation's profits?
What's good for IMC is good for Earth.
There are... one hundred thousand million people back on Earth and they desperately need all the minerals we can find.
What those people need my dear sir, are new worlds to live in like this one!
Worlds where they can live like human beings - not battery hens!
That's not my concern.
Minerals are needed - it's my job to find them.
Even if it means turning this planet into a slagheap?
I can see we're on opposite sides, Doctor.
Perhaps.
Your health, sir.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I've lost some very valuable equipment.
Perhaps one of your colleagues told you about it - a tall blue box.
He's probably enquiring about it now.
I'll go and check.
If you wouldn't mind waiting here, Doctor?
I'll detail someone to escort you back to your friends.
Air-sey prediction on section four-eight.
Where's Caldwell?
Oh, he's chasing up some lost equipment for your colonist friend.
He isn't a colonist... or at least, so he said.
Then what's he doing here?
I don't know, but I think he's dangerous.
Do you think he's been sent by Earth government, checking up on us?
Perhaps.
What do you propose to do about it?
You're going to take him back to his colonist friends.
You're not serious?
When Caldwell found him, he was investigating the wrecked dome.
Well?
If he were found in the ruins, it would be obvious the monsters had returned and killed him.
Leave it to me.
Oh by the way, you, erm... you will send the necessary machine?
It'll be waiting when you arrive.
Whatever that Doctor's lost, no one seems to have found it.
You'd better break the sad news, Morgan.
Who the blazes are you?
!
My name's Morgan.
Well, why was this door locked?
!
Was it?
Must have jammed.
I've been sent to take you back to your friends.
Well, where is the man who brought me here - and what happened to Captain Dent?
I'm sorry, the Captain's busy.
You've been handed over to me.
Oh, I see.
Well I take it that your Captain is coming to see Ashe?
Ashe?
The leader of the colonists!
Oh, yes, yes!
I'm to arrange the meeting.
How very formal.
Well shall we go?
After you... sir.
By the way Captain Dent wanted you to show me the dome that was wrecked.
Why?
Well, we're just as interested in these creatures as you are.
Who knows - they might attack us too?
Yes, that's a point.
Get out of the way!
No!
Let's drive slowly, shall we?
Can you get these ready, please Jo?
Yes, of course.
What do I do with them?
Just add water and serve... but be careful.
What do they taste like?
All exactly the same!
Hello, Mary, my dear.
How's it going?
She's getting on very well.
Have you seen the Doctor yet?
No, I haven't.
He's been gone a long time.
Now, don't worry.
If he's not back soon, I'll go and look for him.
Have you seen Winton?
Mmm, he's showing Norton round the dome.
Well, when you see him, tell him I want him.
I'll be in my quarters.
Norton's made a remarkable recovery.
This is our power supply junction box.
What's he doing?
Don't worry about him.
He's my assistant.
See what I mean?
He gets the right one every time.
Seems to know what's in my mind.
Weren't your primitives like that?
No.
We weren't so friendly with ours.
Where do you get your power from?
Well we tap the ships nuclear generator and then beam the power through to the domes, as they need it.
More trouble?
Naturally.
This stuff should have been junked years ago.
Don't worry, you'll manage.
You always do!
Must be that sunny nature of yours.
Thanks very much.
Well, shall we go back to the dining area?
Thanks!
Got you working, I see?
And what time's dinner?
Not long now.
How are you feeling?
Oh, much better.
Still hungry.
What do you think of our colony?
I think you're managing very well.
You mean considering how old the equipment is?
Well, some of it is getting on a bit.
Yes...
Was your colony better equipped?
Yes.
Didn't do us much good.
Err, that junction box of yours - it, err, looks dangerous.
That's what Jim Holden says.
But he manages to keep it going.
Is he your only electrician engineer?
He's the only one we could get to come with us.
We'd be lost without him.
Oh, my father was looking for you.
He said he'd be in his quarters.
Oh.
Err, look, can you look after yourself.
Well, yes, I...
I feel a bit tired.
I'll just go and lie down until dinner.
All right.
See you then.
I'm looking forward to this.
After a year of living off roots, you don't know how good that looks.
There.
That should hold it for another few days.
Put the tools away, will you?
I just want to check the circuit relay.
Are you crazy?
What do you think you're doing?
No!
Dinner's ready, father.
Oh.
Oh, here we go again.
Don't worry, Jim'll fix it.
You've got to come with me!
Don't worry.
It was only a power failure.
No, you don't understand.
Please, come with me!
What?
What happened?
I was just coming by.
I saw it all!
He didn't have a chance.
The primitive killed him?
He... he went for me too.
I grabbed a spanner and hit him.
It was self-defense
- I had to.
I don't understand it.
They were such friends.
They're all the same - treacherous.
They get your confidence and then they turn on you.
The relay circuits have been destroyed!
Your man must have caught him messing about with the controls.
But unless we get this repaired, the whole colony will come to a standstill!
He was the only one who could fix it!
Warp this message direct to IMC headquarters, Earth.
Put it on scramble.
Code two-nine-three.
Survey ship four-three to IMC headquarters, Earth.
Captain Dent speaking.
Preliminary survey confirms rich deposits of duralinium on this planet.
Complications occasioned by previously arrived colonists can be dealt with.
I've been checking out the survey results.
Well?
Well, you were right.
This is a big strike.
This biggest we've ever had... and I want you to radio Earth your requirements for radio equipment.
Right.
What about the colonists?
Oh, they'll have left by the time it gets here.
You can't be sure.
That Doctor seemed pretty determined, didn't he?
He can be dealt with.
How do you mean?
Where is he?
On his way back to his friends - with Morgan.
You're the Captain, why didn't you go?
He isn't going to get back to his friends, is he?
Morgan's completely reliable.
Yes, that's what I mean.
Where do you think you're going?
Look, scaring people is one thing and I don't my lying to Earth government but murder...
Stay where you are.
Now, get out of my way!
May I remind you that I am Captain of this ship and we are on an alien planet.
If you strike me, I can have you executed without trial.
We can persuade these people to go.
We've done it before.
That man you brought here was some kind of government spy.
He was suspicious.
Well, it's still murder!
Back on Earth, tens of thousands of people die every day - traffic accidents, suicides, pollution, epidemics...
They are not the same thing and you know it!
Caldwell!
The exploitation of this planet can make us both rich.
You can enjoy luxury for the rest of your life if you go along with the corporation.
I could exist without IMC.
You get on our blacklist, you'll never work again - for anyone.
You're up to your ears in debt
- I checked.
Don't worry about the colonists, Caldwell.
Just get on with your work - and let Morgan get on with his.
Well, here are are.
Though I must say I still don't quite understand why you wanted to come here.
I wanted to see how much damage these creatures can cause.
Well, you'll find some claw marks over there and some more over there.
And you say these same marks were found on the two colonists?
That's right.
Oh yes, it was all very efficiently done.
What do you mean?
Well, I think the whole thing was faked by somebody who wanted to frighten the colonists away.
These claw marks, I mean, something made them.
Yes, they could have been faked by some sort of mechanical device.
You mean with something like this?
Yes, yes - exactly like this!
By the time they've found you, the monster will have claimed another victim.
Keep back!
Purely business, you understand.
Nothing personal...
"The very fact that the commandment says "do not kill"
makes us aware and convinced that we are descended from an unbroken chain of generations of assassins for whom the love of murder was in their blood, as it is perhaps in ours too"
Welcome!
- Hello!
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Hi Neil!
How's it going Neil?
You've forgotten your old friends since living in New York.
Obviously I'd like to come home more often.
No Julie?
Yes, especially ifWall Street were here.
But I don't have time to play the tourist.
Talking of which, the meeting with Muller is set for eight.
Seems he's willing to buy that lot of stocks which you told me about yesterday.
I'm sorry dear, but I don't have time to go home with you.
You know, it's very important.
I'll call you a taxi.
Don't worry, I can get one myself.
Excuse me if we steal your husband just a few metres into Austria.
I'm not a boring wife.
The extremely important things first.
Kramorstrasse 25.
What's going on?
Good evening.
- Documents, please.
- Here, take it.
I'm sorry, madam.
It's just a formality.
What's this about?
Awoman was killed half an hour ago, near the airport.
Another woman killed?
Yes, and razor-slashed again.
You can go.
This story is becoming an obsession with the publicity in the papers and on tv about that crazy maniac.
Yes, they mentioned it in the States too.
They should bring back the death, they should do it!
Then that people would meet the end they deserve.
130 schillings.
- Please keep the change.
- Thank you.
- Welcome back Mrs Wardh.
- Antonio, it's you.
A pleasure to see you again, madam.
Everything's in order with the apartment.
Has anyone come in within the last few minutes?
No, madam.
Were you expecting someone?
The maid comes tomorrow.
I'll take care of the bags.
Thank you.
- Mrs Wardh?
- Yes?
For you.
The porter asked me to deliver the luggage.
Leave them here.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
The worst part of you is the best thing you have and will always be mine.
Jean.
Yes I understand, Neil.
At least try to pick me up not too late though.
No!
I'm not angry even though Carroll calls me 'Widow Wardh'.
You've only stayed with me one night in the three days we've been here.
Come quickly, alright?
Bye.
Julie, you can finally stop whining about the old man.
Look what I've brought you:
It's fantastic news fresh from Australia.
You wouldn't believe it.
George!
Tell him something about uncle.
To be honest, I was fond of old uncle.
Uncle croaked in the end and left a nice nest-egg for me and him.
We're the sole heirs.
You're family?
Yes.
At least that's the way it is for the notary in Sydney.
Uncle's dead without a will and the young lady and I are the sole heirs.
What should I say?
Condolences or congratulations?
Just say:
Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.
Very good.
Shall we drink something to celebrate?
- Our meeting?
- No, to uncle's death.
Without which I'd never have met you.
Oh, right.
Julie, please don't cheat the most handsome cousin I have, alright?
A Martini rosso for me.
- Are your clothes really made of paper?
- Underneathas well?
They're real, you innocent.
- What would you say about having a look?
- Lets give them a tug.
It's true, they're made of paper.
Carroll!
Why didn't you say Jean was here as well?
He really pestered me about when you'd be back.
I told him to leave you alone but he came anyway.
Why does it matter to you?
- I'm going.
- Why, Julie?
- Because I am.
- Julie!
Wait.
- Leave me alone.
- I'll take you home in my car.
No, go away.
Why?
Nothing brings us closer than having a vice in common.
I'm out of it, and now you make me sick.
Leave me alone!
Julie!
No, please.
Let him go.
You don't know Jean.
He likes hurting people.
What's up?
Aterrible nightmare but it's over so don't worry.
Julie tell me the truth.
What's wrong?
Is it that man?
- Bye.
- Bye!
Next time don't wear paper, come in your birthday suit.
- Funny!
Goodbye.
...Bye!
Goodbye!
Wait a minute!
Give it to me.
No parking zone, obstructing traffic.
You'll pay now?
No, for god's sake, we collect them.
Thanks.
Here it is.
There are more than a thousand policemen in this town!
I want all their autographs!
It's not that easy, you know.
You're completely mad!
Why?
Seem strange to you?
I once went to bed with someone who collected ladies underwear.
I realised he only wanted to be with me to steal my knickers.
Hey!
Give me the paper, will you?
- Here.
- Take it.
Thanks.
Let me have a look.
Another woman murdered.
We should be grateful to this maniac for eliminating our competition.
They always write the same stuff and I don't read it, but if I don't buy a paper I miss it.
How I envy you, Carroll you're always so relaxed and cheerful.
No Julie you just take the best wherever you find it.
A little here, a little there and avoid thinking the worst.
I married Neil to finish with Jean.
Neil seemed so wise and calm.
But now I'm not so sure.
Neil's your husband, dear.
You can't expect to have everything from one man.
Carroll!
Please...
The fact that you put someone between you and Jean is already really important
Yes I know, but maybe
I've got to escape from myself.
Jean would never accept not seeing me again because he can't stand losing.
Excuse me, madam.
There's a gentleman waiting for you
I put him in the living room.
I don't want to see anyone.
He asked for your husband.
I told him he was out but he wanted to wait to speak to you.
Come on!
Who are you scared of?
If it's Jean we'll throw him out.
Come on, it'll be fun for me
Hello.
Look who it is, the handsome cousin.
My husband's not at home.
I'm sorry, Julie.
But Carroll told me your husband is an expert in money problems.
I'd like to get his advice.
Yes, I see.
But I'm sorry, my husband's not here.
I'm glad, really...
To be honest it was just an excuse to see you again.
One definitely can't deny your quality of sincerity.
We interrupted our celebratory drink so I don't want to miss the chance to get to know you as well as I can.
Listen, my handsome cousin.
Given the time, if you want to court her
I recommend continuing over a steak.
Mr...
Call me George.
Don't worry you'll get a chance to speak to my husband alright?
Yes but it's you who should be worrying.
I like bothering women even when their husbands are around.
Shall we go, Julie?
In any case thanks, handsome cousin, for the lunch invitation.
For god's sake, I'd never invite anyone to Birri's.
They serve mustard which swells your tongue.
Why did you treat him like that?
Because I wanted to!
People who are too sure of themselves get on my nerves.
If I were you, I'd do it cousin or not.
Lets go and eat.
I am truly sorry, Miss Baxter.
I had three tables left but a gentleman has just booked them.
So we'll have to starve.
Why?
The mustard's excellent here doesn't burn the tongue at all.
Want some?
What a shame it's full.
But it isn't, I've booked three tables.
We can choose:
Here, here, or down there.
- Did I make a mistake?
- If it's that important to you.
Yes, it is.
I was worried I'd have to give up my mustard.
Well, cancel the other two tables.
- Here alright?
- No, the other one's be tter.
The usual for me.
What Carroll's having is fine for me.
So, that's three of what Carroll's having.
This way you'll occasionally think of me when eating an apple.
The forbidden fruit.
For you I'll do nothing at all!
You've got it all wrong, dear.
It's always been Eve who should offer the apple.
Excuse me, Miss Baxter.
You're wanted on the telephone.
I'll be right back.
Maybe Carroll's right.
What's this?
Does it mean you want to eat me?
No it means I've already eaten you.
You'll discover I'm hard to digest.
I'm sorry, but I've got to rush off.
In any case you're happier alone with your apples.
Oh, Carroll!
I'll phone you.
Bye!
I can take you wherever you want.
To a taxi, thank you.
So you're used to having your own way, aren't you?
You've finally got it.
Where are we going?
!
It's a surprise.
Take me home at once!
Later, Julie, later!
- I told you to take me...
- Relax.
I'm just going to make you feel ecstasy and fear!
Take me home now!
Ecstasy, fear and a pounding heart!
I kept my promises, didn't I?
I'll say you did!
I think I should apologise.
Ljudged you wrongly.
No, no!
You were right about me.
But it's hard to resist so much.
Thanks anyway... it's been a nice afternoon.
I really needed it.
Bye!
Hello?
Julie?
Would you be amazed if I told you I loved you?
Oh please, George, don't be ridiculous.
Some words aren't used any more.
I thanked you for the nice afternoon and that's it.
I couldn't possibly want anything else from you.
Please leave me alone.
George?
!
Don't be offended but I don't want to see you again because today... because I like you.
You mustn't phone me again.
Never again.
Alright, Julie.
I won't phone again if that's what you want.
How did you get in?
!
By the door, it was open.
Why are you...
I wanted to tell you again, Julie:
I really like you and I'm not used to hiding my intentions.
George I beg you don't complicate my life.
Don't you understand?
!
I'm not the woman you met today.
I know nothing about you, nor do I want to.
For me you're fine as you are.
Come on, lets go into my place.
No, not now.
Let me go.
If you want if you want.
I'll take you home.
What's wrong?
I'm scared!
Scared of what?
!
Take me away, George.
- Where?
- Wherever you want!
It's not a palace, is it?
But it's good enough for me.
I practically only come here to sleep.
They are for Mrs Wardh.
Thank you.
I know you're trying to escape me... but your vice is a room locked from the inside and only I have the key.
Who's the admirer?
!
Anonymous.
I'd like to think it was you, but... they don't deal in these items on the stock exchange, do they?
Julie, what's the matter?
Nothing
You've been treating me as if I'd done something wrong.
If you feel uncared for or you need something we should talk.
No, I don't need anything.
Hello?
Mrs Julie Wardh?
Yes.
Who is it?
I have had occasion to see that you are a delightful lover with very interesting perversions which I'm sure go unsuspected even by your honest husband.
Isn't that true?
Stop talking nonsense.
Who is this?
That's not important, whereas I think you should know what I want, Mrs Wardh.
I want twenty thousand schillings to not tell your husband about your affection for George Corot.
It's Jean.
It's you, I know it!
It's Jean isn't it?
!
Mrs Wardh, I will expect you at sunset at the
South entrance to Palmenhaus.
Remember:
Alone, and with twenty thousand schillings.
But...
I didn't know what to do.
When I saw that black car I was scared it would be Jean, and that's why I went into George's.
Naturally.
You wanted to go to bed with him and your fear of Jean gave you the excuse.
Please, Carroll.
Well, maybe it was as you said.
Anyway there's still the problem of the phone call.
It was Jean?
Who knows?
Have you watched the tv?
They talked about that maniac.
The last of his victims was that stupid bitch who stripped at the party...
Could it be Jean?
He's got a black car too.
Carroll please stop it.
I was joking.
He goes to prostitutes, and Jean doesn't.
What was his voice like on the phone?
Well...
I've already told you.
It was a disguised, unrecognisable voice.
Which means if he'd spoken with his normal voice you'd have recognized him.
It must be Jean.
He's the type.
I'm sorry but I don't see the problem.
If you like
George you can forget about both Jean and Neil.
So what if Neil finds out?
I think he's a modern intelligent man.
Everything's simple for you.
While I don't know what George is for me,
I know what I was for him.
I wanted to call him this morning but I don't even have his number, and I haven't heard from him.
And I don't want Neil to find out this way.
He really doesn't deserve it.
Listen, dear, don't have too many scruples.
If you want his number I'll give it to you.
Neil's had you in his bed for a year.
Don't you think that's enough to make up for the heartache?
When you talk like that I want to slap you.
But what do you expect?
It's the way of the world.
Don't even bother about it,
I keep them in the oven because I hate cold underwear.
In any case you mustn't go to that appointment.
Where did he say?
At the Palmenhaus in Shembrun at sunset alone and with twenty thousand schillings.
I'll go.
You?
No it could be dangerous.
And I don't want you involved anymore.
Don't worry
I'll enjoy it.
And you'll see it's definitely Jean and then I'll laugh in his face.
But if it's not Jean.
If it's someone else?
Who?
Maybe the sadist in the papers?
Then that means I'm in grave danger because I am a bit of a whore.
You joke about everything.
Had breakfast yet?
Well come on... there's a bar downstairs which will make you forget all about diets.
Come on, and stop making that face!
There's the start!
The competitors immediately engage in a fight and it's number 36 first, followed by number 122.
...at the third bend, the final battle is about to begin.
We're closing!
We're closing at sunset!
We're closing!
Excuse me
I had an appointment at the South entrance to the Palmenhaus but I've lost my bearings.
Over there but if you don't hurry you'll be locked inside.
They're about to close the gates now, so be quick.
- Thank you.
- Good eveni ng.
Help!
Help!
No!
What's going on?
!
- Who was screaming!
?
- There...
Look over there!
Can you tell us anything?
No, I didn't see anything.
Ljust heard that poor girl shouting.
She'd asked me where the Palmenhaus South entrance was.
She had an appointment.
I don't know anything else.
These little animals are my only friends, inspector.
Much less repugnant than certain people I know.
Listen... it's been said that you've been
Carroll Baxter's friend for a long time.
It's very important for us to know everything there is to know about her and the people she associated with.
Please follow me to the police station
I need to continue to interrogate you.
Don't worry, I'm used to being around cages.
So... shall we go?
Lets go.
Is all this really necessary?
So, madam... is this the man you spoke to us about?
Yes.
Why do you think he's the killer we're looking for?
You flatter me Julie.
Do you really think I'm capable of cutting a lot of women's throats?
Yes, you could be.
And though it might seem silly, he has a black car like the one described in the papers.
You're incredibly amusing.
But it was you who sent me those notes.
What notes?
The lady and I were joined in an "intimate" friendship.
That's why I sent her flowers along with my thoughts, hoping she'd remember the good times, and perhaps decide on a nostalgic encounter.
I hate you.
The only thing I can't stand is indifference.
Hate is a good feeling, it's fiery and violent like love, only more so.
Mrs Wardh, you received a threatening phone call and that Carroll went to the appointment in your place thinking that you were dealing with your friend...
Was it that man's voice on the phone?
It was disguised, it could have been anyone.
But Carroll told me it must have been Jean.
A stranger wouldn't have had to mask the voice.
Yes... but he was in a bowling alley on the other side of town while someone was cutting your friend's throat.
That's the way it is, I'm afraid.
Listen... why don't you check Mrs Wardh's alibi?
You're a dirty coward.
You see, Mrs Wardh doesn't have a black car, but she's always had a weakness for blood.
Nobody's said the murderer you're looking for is a man.
You're a person you were keen on for over two years.
That's enough!
I'm not interested in your theories.
Fine.
Can I go?
- I've got something to do.
- Of course.
You can both go.
Bring the other one in.
What's his name?
George Corot.
They called you as well?
Now I understand why my roses no longer affect you.
George Corot!
I've got to see you.
See you at my place at five.
Julie, at last!
I'm really tired Neil...
Let me speak to your husband now then we'll go away.
Away from this city, from everything.
No, George, not now.
Maybe when they've found Carroll's murderer.
It was foolish to meet today.
I could be being watched.
You've told me there's already someone who knows... but do you realise that it should have been you instead of Carroll?
You can't hide forever.
So what?
Does living mean so little to you?
I don't know, George.
If you weren't around I'd almost be happy to end it all.
Please, they can see us here!
I'll take you home.
I'd rather you didn't.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Neil!
Neil!
Julie!
The elevator was always busy so I had to take the stairs.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Julie... where have you been?
What happened?
Someone in the garage tried to kill me with a razor.
Was it Jean?
Did you see him?
Was it him?
I don't know.
He was dressed in black, it was dark...
I don't know!
Don't be influenced by the stories in the papers.
Besides, we'll soon know if it was Jean.
Neil!
What do you want to do?
Lets call the police.
Where does he live?
There's only one thing to do with people like that.
You mustn't take any risks for me.
You're my wife now, and that's all that matters.
Tell me where he is.
I'll go with you.
Alright, come with me.
Wait for me here.
I told you to stay in the car!
No, I'm coming with you.
Neil!
There are no lights on.
Nobody's there lets go.
There's a camera on the ground over there... a photo's been taken.
Julie!
Julie, relax Julie!
Neil
Jean's car has gone!
Adam and Eve lost paradise because they wanted to know too much.
Julie, wake up Julie!
I've developed that photo.
Look!
It's the man in the garage.
Recognise him?
Yes, it's him!
Who?
Don't know.
He was dressed like that, with those glasses.
Now we know it wasn't Jean.
Which means... he could be the murderer of the women and Carroll?
I mean I suspected Jean because he was your lover.
Obviously there's someone else.
Oh, Neil!
Where are you going?
I'm scared.
I'm going to the police.
This photo could be useful to the inspector.
Hello?
George, is that you?
Why did you take so long to call me?
I'll tell you when I see you.
Come and get me, I can't carry on.
Come and get me, and we'll leave.
We'll go to some quiet place as far away as possible.
Anywhere.
Okay.
Give me time to pack a case and I'll be with you.
I'll take you to Spain.
I know a little place that'll make you forget everything.
For Neil.
When did she leave?
Just before noon.
Bye, dear.
I'll call you when I get back from Sydney.
Okay.
Bye!
Hello?
Hello.
How are you?
No, I'm sorry.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I'll be back in a week.
Then I'll get the A122 toTokyo.
No.
I'm not tired.
You don't sleep with the time zone changes.
The light's gone out... it'll come back on.
Alright!
Yes, I'll bring you a souvenir.
Will a kangaroo do?
Why, what do you want?
I promise we'll meet again when I get back.
Bye!
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Has something happened?
No, no.
Nothing.
Why did you run away?
I wanted to get some sun.
Carry on thinking about your prey if you want.
I've seen one who's more attractive.
Viennese homicidal maniac dead.
Viennese homicidal maniac dead.
George!
Yes?
Look, they've found the maniac.
He was killed by the girl he was attacking.
So it's all over, for good.
So it's all over, for good.
Lets think about us.
I'm hungry.
I'll go on to the villa to prepare some food while you go and change some money.
We've almost run out.
You take my car and I'll get a taxi.
Bye!
Bye!
Bye.
- Take them.
- Thanks.
These are for you.
For me?
!
Yes, that gentleman gave them to me... he was there just now.
He was there just now.
He must have left.
Since the living don't give flowers to the dead, the dead give them to the living.
Jean.
George.
George.
What's going on?
What's wrong?
Do you feel sick, madam?
What's wrong?
Do you feel sick, madam?
No, no!
Madam...
Julie!
Julie.
Julie answer me.
It's George.
Julie, what happened?
Julie!
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes?
- Where can I find a doctor?
- Down there, at the pha rmacy.
Thanks.
This will make you sleep for a few hours.
She's in shock, it's a powerful emotion.
She's in shock, it's a powerful emotion.
What's wrong with her?
When I left her down in the village she was fine.
Well something happened maybe she got a fright.
Know what you can do?
I'll give you a number!
Here it is.
Doctor Arbe.
He's my friend, a good neurologist.
Barcelona's not far- by car you'd be there in half an hour.
Thank you.
Can I leave her here while I go down into the village to call?
Don't worry.
She'll sleep peacefully until this evening.
- I'll come with you.
- Not necessary.
I know the road.
- I'll come with you.
- Not necessary.
I know the road.
No, it's impossible.
I've still got two appointments and I don't have a car.
Tomorrow.
And I don't have a car.
Tomorrow.
Please, doctor.
I'll pick you up.
Alright, in an hour.
Thank you, doctor, thank you.
- How much?
- 80 pesetas.
George...
George!
George!
So I brought her here hoping she'd feel better far away from it all.
Then...
I don't know what happened today.
You mentioned blood earlier.
She didn't say anything to me but I understood something straight away.
She was with that man I told you about for a while.
He dominated her.
Blood definitely has a strange effect on her
Blood definitely has a strange effect on her it both attracts and repels her.
Listen it would be better not to tell her I'm a doctor.
It'll be easier.
Julie!
There's a smell of gas.
Quick, in the kitchen!
The door's locked.
Help me!
Julie...
Turn the gas off and try not to breathe!
Open the window!
Lets take her there.
No pulse any more.
Call to quickly send an equipped ambulance.
- Is there any hope?
- I told you to go and call the hospital.
Get on with it!
Inspector
Doctor Arbe is here
Very well, you can go.
Mr Wardh, this is Doctor?
He did everything to try and save your wife but it was already too late.
And I'm telling you it isn't suicide.
My wife was scared of dying.
The room was locked and sealed from the inside!
It wouldn't have happened if she'd been with me.
Anyway, this man's guilty.
I want to go now.
Of course, Mr Wardh.
The funeral?
The body needs to be available to the authorities for a few days then you can send someone to collect it.
George!
You're late.
It's too hot for me here.
I'll pay now.
A plane is leaving for Rio!
I don't want to miss it.
Who are you scared of?
Nobody's expecting you to be in Vienna, and nobody saw you here.
If the police discover one day that the maniac didn't kill Carroll your alibi's already been checked out.
Like yours, and you're the only one with a motive.
Even if some cop unveils our tricks... you're out of it.
Your passport says you're called John McDonald, and Julie never met you.
But you've got a cast iron alibi too.
If they don't get me you're fine.
They won't get you.
Julie Wardh committed suicide.
The money, now!
Okay.
Now you really are dead.
A first-rate suicide for love.
Have they paid up?
Not yet.
They want the death certificate, it's a matter of days.
I spoke to New York.
Hope I can manage to keep the creditors sweet and avoid bankruptcy.
And you?
No problems.
Carroll's death means I'm the sole heir.
We've got to be careful.
If someone sees us together...
Why?
We're husband and lover united in memories.
There's no risk.
And there never was.
I told you, didn't I?
The best time to eliminate someone is when the police are hunting a homicidal maniac.
We can help each other.
You eliminate the cousin and I eliminate the wife.
They're blaming it all on him... even though that idiot was caught before we finished the job.
The suicide idea worked perfectly.
Talking of which, our black suits?
Burned completely destroyed.
There's no evidence any more.
Maybe it would be better to throw these gloves out.
I burnt mine.
Why?
They're almost new.
Did you like my line at the police station?
"Anyway, this man's guilty!"
And how did poor old Jean take it?
Like a kick in the guts!
He was so stupid he still didn't believe he'd had it.
And if the Spanish police find him?
They'll found the motive for Mr McDonald's suicide.
It's crucial that the insurance claim is above suspicion or they'll drag it out forever.
What do you think they could suspect?
Your wife dies well after she'd left you, and you were miles away.
And it was a clear-cut case of suicide.
That woman!
Julie!
It's her, I'm sure!
What are you talking about?
I only saw her briefly... it was her, Julie!
If you're starting to hallucinate already we'll end up badly.
No, it was her
I clearly saw her.
Lets go back.
You're crazy.
There was just a resemblance.
...no!
- I've never heard of th e dead hitch-hiking.
Alright just a resemblance.
So what?
Lets have a look.
We're shafted!
Careful!
It's over, Julie.
Call and get them to send a breakdown crane
I'd never have reopened this investigation if our doctor hadn't given us about the different technique used by Carroll Baxter's murderer.
And there would have been three more criminals.
I'm sorry, but I had no other way to unmask them.
In thinking you were dead they felt safe and they betrayed themselves.
But most of the credit goes to Dr Arbe's who save you.
I'm leaving you in good hands.
You saved my life but I feel dead anyway.
You'll be able to forget everything.
Time is the best healer, Julie.
Good luck!
"The very fact that the commandment says "do not kill"
makes us aware and convinced that we are descended from an unbroken chain of generations of assassins for whom the love of murder was in their blood, as it is perhaps in ours too"
Welcome!
- Hello!
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Hi Neil!
How's it going Neil?
You've forgotten your old friends since living in New York.
Obviously I'd like to come home more often.
No Julie?
Yes, especially ifWall Street were here.
But I don't have time to play the tourist.
Talking of which, the meeting with Muller is set for eight.
Seems he's willing to buy that lot of stocks which you told me about yesterday.
I'm sorry dear, but I don't have time to go home with you.
You know, it's very important.
I'll call you a taxi.
Don't worry, I can get one myself.
Excuse me if we steal your husband just a few metres into Austria.
I'm not a boring wife.
The extremely important things first.
Kramorstrasse 25.
What's going on?
Good evening.
- Documents, please.
- Here, take it.
I'm sorry, madam.
It's just a formality.
What's this about?
Awoman was killed half an hour ago, near the airport.
Another woman killed?
Yes, and razor-slashed again.
You can go.
This story is becoming an obsession with the publicity in the papers and on tv about that crazy maniac.
Yes, they mentioned it in the States too.
They should bring back the death, they should do it!
Then that people would meet the end they deserve.
130 schillings.
- Please keep the change.
- Thank you.
- Welcome back Mrs Wardh.
- Antonio, it's you.
A pleasure to see you again, madam.
Everything's in order with the apartment.
Has anyone come in within the last few minutes?
No, madam.
Were you expecting someone?
The maid comes tomorrow.
I'll take care of the bags.
Thank you.
- Mrs Wardh?
- Yes?
For you.
The porter asked me to deliver the luggage.
Leave them here.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
The worst part of you is the best thing you have and will always be mine.
Jean.
Yes I understand, Neil.
At least try to pick me up not too late though.
No!
I'm not angry even though Carroll calls me 'Widow Wardh'.
You've only stayed with me one night in the three days we've been here.
Come quickly, alright?
Bye.
Julie, you can finally stop whining about the old man.
Look what I've brought you:
It's fantastic news fresh from Australia.
You wouldn't believe it.
George!
Tell him something about uncle.
To be honest, I was fond of old uncle.
Uncle croaked in the end and left a nice nest-egg for me and him.
We're the sole heirs.
You're family?
Yes.
At least that's the way it is for the notary in Sydney.
Uncle's dead without a will and the young lady and I are the sole heirs.
What should I say?
Condolences or congratulations?
Just say:
Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.
Very good.
Shall we drink something to celebrate?
- Our meeting?
- No, to uncle's death.
Without which I'd never have met you.
Oh, right.
Julie, please don't cheat the most handsome cousin I have, alright?
A Martini rosso for me.
- Are your clothes really made of paper?
- Underneathas well?
They're real, you innocent.
- What would you say about having a look?
- Lets give them a tug.
It's true, they're made of paper.
Carroll!
Why didn't you say Jean was here as well?
He really pestered me about when you'd be back.
I told him to leave you alone but he came anyway.
Why does it matter to you?
- I'm going.
- Why, Julie?
- Because I am.
- Julie!
Wait.
- Leave me alone.
- I'll take you home in my car.
No, go away.
Why?
Nothing brings us closer than having a vice in common.
I'm out of it, and now you make me sick.
Leave me alone!
Julie!
No, please.
Let him go.
You don't know Jean.
He likes hurting people.
What's up?
Aterrible nightmare but it's over so don't worry.
Julie tell me the truth.
What's wrong?
Is it that man?
- Bye.
- Bye!
Next time don't wear paper, come in your birthday suit.
- Funny!
Goodbye.
...Bye!
Goodbye!
Wait a minute!
Give it to me.
No parking zone, obstructing traffic.
You'll pay now?
No, for god's sake, we collect them.
Thanks.
Here it is.
There are more than a thousand policemen in this town!
I want all their autographs!
It's not that easy, you know.
You're completely mad!
Why?
Seem strange to you?
I once went to bed with someone who collected ladies underwear.
I realised he only wanted to be with me to steal my knickers.
Hey!
Give me the paper, will you?
- Here.
- Take it.
Thanks.
Let me have a look.
Another woman murdered.
We should be grateful to this maniac for eliminating our competition.
They always write the same stuff and I don't read it, but if I don't buy a paper I miss it.
How I envy you, Carroll you're always so relaxed and cheerful.
No Julie you just take the best wherever you find it.
A little here, a little there and avoid thinking the worst.
I married Neil to finish with Jean.
Neil seemed so wise and calm.
But now I'm not so sure.
Neil's your husband, dear.
You can't expect to have everything from one man.
Carroll!
Please...
The fact that you put someone between you and Jean is already really important
Yes I know, but maybe
I've got to escape from myself.
Jean would never accept not seeing me again because he can't stand losing.
Excuse me, madam.
There's a gentleman waiting for you
I put him in the living room.
I don't want to see anyone.
He asked for your husband.
I told him he was out but he wanted to wait to speak to you.
Come on!
Who are you scared of?
If it's Jean we'll throw him out.
Come on, it'll be fun for me
Hello.
Look who it is, the handsome cousin.
My husband's not at home.
I'm sorry, Julie.
But Carroll told me your husband is an expert in money problems.
I'd like to get his advice.
Yes, I see.
But I'm sorry, my husband's not here.
I'm glad, really...
To be honest it was just an excuse to see you again.
One definitely can't deny your quality of sincerity.
We interrupted our celebratory drink so I don't want to miss the chance to get to know you as well as I can.
Listen, my handsome cousin.
Given the time, if you want to court her
I recommend continuing over a steak.
Mr...
Call me George.
Don't worry you'll get a chance to speak to my husband alright?
Yes but it's you who should be worrying.
I like bothering women even when their husbands are around.
Shall we go, Julie?
In any case thanks, handsome cousin, for the lunch invitation.
For god's sake, I'd never invite anyone to Birri's.
They serve mustard which swells your tongue.
Why did you treat him like that?
Because I wanted to!
People who are too sure of themselves get on my nerves.
If I were you, I'd do it cousin or not.
Lets go and eat.
I am truly sorry, Miss Baxter.
I had three tables left but a gentleman has just booked them.
So we'll have to starve.
Why?
The mustard's excellent here doesn't burn the tongue at all.
Want some?
What a shame it's full.
But it isn't, I've booked three tables.
We can choose:
Here, here, or down there.
- Did I make a mistake?
- If it's that important to you.
Yes, it is.
I was worried I'd have to give up my mustard.
Well, cancel the other two tables.
- Here alright?
- No, the other one's be tter.
The usual for me.
What Carroll's having is fine for me.
So, that's three of what Carroll's having.
This way you'll occasionally think of me when eating an apple.
The forbidden fruit.
For you I'll do nothing at all!
You've got it all wrong, dear.
It's always been Eve who should offer the apple.
Excuse me, Miss Baxter.
You're wanted on the telephone.
I'll be right back.
Maybe Carroll's right.
What's this?
Does it mean you want to eat me?
No it means I've already eaten you.
You'll discover I'm hard to digest.
I'm sorry, but I've got to rush off.
In any case you're happier alone with your apples.
Oh, Carroll!
I'll phone you.
Bye!
I can take you wherever you want.
To a taxi, thank you.
So you're used to having your own way, aren't you?
You've finally got it.
Where are we going?
!
It's a surprise.
Take me home at once!
Later, Julie, later!
- I told you to take me...
- Relax.
I'm just going to make you feel ecstasy and fear!
Take me home now!
Ecstasy, fear and a pounding heart!
I kept my promises, didn't I?
I'll say you did!
I think I should apologise.
Ljudged you wrongly.
No, no!
You were right about me.
But it's hard to resist so much.
Thanks anyway... it's been a nice afternoon.
I really needed it.
Bye!
Hello?
Julie?
Would you be amazed if I told you I loved you?
Oh please, George, don't be ridiculous.
Some words aren't used any more.
I thanked you for the nice afternoon and that's it.
I couldn't possibly want anything else from you.
Please leave me alone.
George?
!
Don't be offended but I don't want to see you again because today... because I like you.
You mustn't phone me again.
Never again.
Alright, Julie.
I won't phone again if that's what you want.
How did you get in?
!
By the door, it was open.
Why are you...
I wanted to tell you again, Julie:
I really like you and I'm not used to hiding my intentions.
George I beg you don't complicate my life.
Don't you understand?
!
I'm not the woman you met today.
I know nothing about you, nor do I want to.
For me you're fine as you are.
Come on, lets go into my place.
No, not now.
Let me go.
If you want if you want.
I'll take you home.
What's wrong?
I'm scared!
Scared of what?
!
Take me away, George.
- Where?
- Wherever you want!
It's not a palace, is it?
But it's good enough for me.
I practically only come here to sleep.
They are for Mrs Wardh.
Thank you.
I know you're trying to escape me... but your vice is a room locked from the inside and only I have the key.
Who's the admirer?
!
Anonymous.
I'd like to think it was you, but... they don't deal in these items on the stock exchange, do they?
Julie, what's the matter?
Nothing
You've been treating me as if I'd done something wrong.
If you feel uncared for or you need something we should talk.
No, I don't need anything.
Hello?
Mrs Julie Wardh?
Yes.
Who is it?
I have had occasion to see that you are a delightful lover with very interesting perversions which I'm sure go unsuspected even by your honest husband.
Isn't that true?
Stop talking nonsense.
Who is this?
That's not important, whereas I think you should know what I want, Mrs Wardh.
I want twenty thousand schillings to not tell your husband about your affection for George Corot.
It's Jean.
It's you, I know it!
It's Jean isn't it?
!
Mrs Wardh, I will expect you at sunset at the
South entrance to Palmenhaus.
Remember:
Alone, and with twenty thousand schillings.
But...
I didn't know what to do.
When I saw that black car I was scared it would be Jean, and that's why I went into George's.
Naturally.
You wanted to go to bed with him and your fear of Jean gave you the excuse.
Please, Carroll.
Well, maybe it was as you said.
Anyway there's still the problem of the phone call.
It was Jean?
Who knows?
Have you watched the tv?
They talked about that maniac.
The last of his victims was that stupid bitch who stripped at the party...
Could it be Jean?
He's got a black car too.
Carroll please stop it.
I was joking.
He goes to prostitutes, and Jean doesn't.
What was his voice like on the phone?
Well...
I've already told you.
It was a disguised, unrecognisable voice.
Which means if he'd spoken with his normal voice you'd have recognized him.
It must be Jean.
He's the type.
I'm sorry but I don't see the problem.
If you like
George you can forget about both Jean and Neil.
So what if Neil finds out?
I think he's a modern intelligent man.
Everything's simple for you.
While I don't know what George is for me,
I know what I was for him.
I wanted to call him this morning but I don't even have his number, and I haven't heard from him.
And I don't want Neil to find out this way.
He really doesn't deserve it.
Listen, dear, don't have too many scruples.
If you want his number I'll give it to you.
Neil's had you in his bed for a year.
Don't you think that's enough to make up for the heartache?
When you talk like that I want to slap you.
But what do you expect?
It's the way of the world.
Don't even bother about it,
I keep them in the oven because I hate cold underwear.
In any case you mustn't go to that appointment.
Where did he say?
At the Palmenhaus in Shembrun at sunset alone and with twenty thousand schillings.
I'll go.
You?
No it could be dangerous.
And I don't want you involved anymore.
Don't worry
I'll enjoy it.
And you'll see it's definitely Jean and then I'll laugh in his face.
But if it's not Jean.
If it's someone else?
Who?
Maybe the sadist in the papers?
Then that means I'm in grave danger because I am a bit of a whore.
You joke about everything.
Had breakfast yet?
Well come on... there's a bar downstairs which will make you forget all about diets.
Come on, and stop making that face!
There's the start!
The competitors immediately engage in a fight and it's number 36 first, followed by number 122.
...at the third bend, the final battle is about to begin.
We're closing!
We're closing at sunset!
We're closing!
Excuse me
I had an appointment at the South entrance to the Palmenhaus but I've lost my bearings.
Over there but if you don't hurry you'll be locked inside.
They're about to close the gates now, so be quick.
- Thank you.
- Good eveni ng.
Help!
Help!
No!
What's going on?
!
- Who was screaming!
?
- There...
Look over there!
Can you tell us anything?
No, I didn't see anything.
Ljust heard that poor girl shouting.
She'd asked me where the Palmenhaus South entrance was.
She had an appointment.
I don't know anything else.
These little animals are my only friends, inspector.
Much less repugnant than certain people I know.
Listen... it's been said that you've been
Carroll Baxter's friend for a long time.
It's very important for us to know everything there is to know about her and the people she associated with.
Please follow me to the police station
I need to continue to interrogate you.
Don't worry, I'm used to being around cages.
So... shall we go?
Lets go.
Is all this really necessary?
So, madam... is this the man you spoke to us about?
Yes.
Why do you think he's the killer we're looking for?
You flatter me Julie.
Do you really think I'm capable of cutting a lot of women's throats?
Yes, you could be.
And though it might seem silly, he has a black car like the one described in the papers.
You're incredibly amusing.
But it was you who sent me those notes.
What notes?
The lady and I were joined in an "intimate" friendship.
That's why I sent her flowers along with my thoughts, hoping she'd remember the good times, and perhaps decide on a nostalgic encounter.
I hate you.
The only thing I can't stand is indifference.
Hate is a good feeling, it's fiery and violent like love, only more so.
Mrs Wardh, you received a threatening phone call and that Carroll went to the appointment in your place thinking that you were dealing with your friend...
Was it that man's voice on the phone?
It was disguised, it could have been anyone.
But Carroll told me it must have been Jean.
A stranger wouldn't have had to mask the voice.
Yes... but he was in a bowling alley on the other side of town while someone was cutting your friend's throat.
That's the way it is, I'm afraid.
Listen... why don't you check Mrs Wardh's alibi?
You're a dirty coward.
You see, Mrs Wardh doesn't have a black car, but she's always had a weakness for blood.
Nobody's said the murderer you're looking for is a man.
You're a person you were keen on for over two years.
That's enough!
I'm not interested in your theories.
Fine.
Can I go?
- I've got something to do.
- Of course.
You can both go.
Bring the other one in.
What's his name?
George Corot.
They called you as well?
Now I understand why my roses no longer affect you.
George Corot!
I've got to see you.
See you at my place at five.
Julie, at last!
I'm really tired Neil...
Let me speak to your husband now then we'll go away.
Away from this city, from everything.
No, George, not now.
Maybe when they've found Carroll's murderer.
It was foolish to meet today.
I could be being watched.
You've told me there's already someone who knows... but do you realise that it should have been you instead of Carroll?
So what?
You can't hide forever.
Does living mean so little to you?
I don't know, George.
If you weren't around I'd almost be happy to end it all.
Please, they can see us here!
I'll take you home.
I'd rather you didn't.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Neil!
Neil!
Julie!
The elevator was always busy so I had to take the stairs.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Julie... where have you been?
What happened?
Someone in the garage tried to kill me with a razor.
Was it Jean?
Did you see him?
Was it him?
I don't know.
He was dressed in black, it was dark...
I don't know!
Don't be influenced by the stories in the papers.
Besides, we'll soon know if it was Jean.
Neil!
What do you want to do?
Lets call the police.
Where does he live?
There's only one thing to do with people like that.
You mustn't take any risks for me.
You're my wife now, and that's all that matters.
Tell me where he is.
I'll go with you.
Alright, come with me.
Wait for me here.
Neil!
I told you to stay in the car!
No, I'm coming with you.
There are no lights on.
Nobody's there lets go.
There's a camera on the ground over there... a photo's been taken.
Julie!
Julie, relax Julie!
Neil
Jean's car has gone!
Adam and Eve lost paradise because they wanted to know too much.
Julie, wake up Julie!
I've developed that photo.
Look!
Recognise him?
It's the man in the garage.
Yes, it's him!
Who?
Don't know.
He was dressed like that, with those glasses.
Now we know it wasn't Jean.
Which means... he could be the murderer of the women and Carroll?
I mean I suspected Jean because he was your lover.
Obviously there's someone else.
Oh, Neil!
Where are you going?
I'm scared.
I'm going to the police.
This photo could be useful to the inspector.
Hello?
George, is that you?
Why did you take so long to call me?
I'll tell you when I see you.
Come and get me, I can't carry on.
Come and get me, and we'll leave.
We'll go to some quiet place as far away as possible.
Anywhere.
Okay.
Give me time to pack a case and I'll be with you.
I'll take you to Spain.
I know a little place that'll make you forget everything.
For Neil.
When did she leave?
Just before noon.
Bye, dear.
I'll call you when I get back from Sydney.
Okay.
Bye!
Hello?
Hello.
How are you?
No, I'm sorry.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I'll be back in a week.
Then I'll get the A122 toTokyo.
No.
I'm not tired.
You don't sleep with the time zone changes.
The light's gone out... it'll come back on.
Alright!
Yes, I'll bring you a souvenir.
Will a kangaroo do?
Why, what do you want?
I promise we'll meet again when I get back.
Bye!
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Has something happened?
No, no.
Nothing.
Why did you run away?
I wanted to get some sun.
Carry on thinking about your prey if you want.
I've seen one who's more attractive.
Viennese homicidal maniac dead.
Viennese homicidal maniac dead.
George!
Yes?
Look, they've found the maniac.
He was killed by the girl he was attacking.
So it's all over, for good.
So it's all over, for good.
Lets think about us.
I'm hungry.
I'll go on to the villa to prepare some food while you go and change some money.
We've almost run out.
You take my car and I'll get a taxi.
Bye!
Bye!
Bye.
- Take them.
- Thanks.
These are for you.
For me?
!
Yes, that gentleman gave them to me... he was there just now.
He was there just now.
He must have left.
Since the living don't give flowers to the dead, the dead give them to the living.
Jean.
George.
George.
What's going on?
What's wrong?
Do you feel sick, madam?
What's wrong?
Do you feel sick, madam?
No, no!
Madam...
Julie!
Julie.
Julie answer me.
It's George.
Julie, what happened?
Julie!
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes?
- Where can I find a doctor?
- Down there, at the pha rmacy.
Thanks.
This will make you sleep for a few hours.
What's wrong with her?
She's in shock, it's a powerful emotion.
She's in shock, it's a powerful emotion.
When I left her down in the village she was fine.
Well something happened maybe she got a fright.
Know what you can do?
I'll give you a number!
Here it is.
Doctor Arbe.
He's my friend, a good neurologist.
Barcelona's not far- by car you'd be there in half an hour.
Thank you.
Can I leave her here while I go down into the village to call?
Don't worry.
She'll sleep peacefully until this evening.
- I'll come with you.
- Not necessary.
I know the road.
- I'll come with you.
- Not necessary.
I know the road.
No, it's impossible.
I've still got two appointments and I don't have a car.
Tomorrow.
And I don't have a car.
Tomorrow.
Please, doctor.
I'll pick you up.
Alright, in an hour.
Thank you, doctor, thank you.
- How much?
- 80 pesetas.
George...
George!
George!
So I brought her here hoping she'd feel better far away from it all.
Then...
I don't know what happened today.
You mentioned blood earlier.
She didn't say anything to me but I understood something straight away.
She was with that man I told you about for a while.
He dominated her.
Blood definitely has a strange effect on her
Blood definitely has a strange effect on her it both attracts and repels her.
Listen it would be better not to tell her I'm a doctor.
It'll be easier.
Julie!
There's a smell of gas.
Quick, in the kitchen!
The door's locked.
Help me!
Julie...
Turn the gas off and try not to breathe!
Open the window!
Lets take her there.
No pulse any more.
Call to quickly send an equipped ambulance.
- Is there any hope?
- I told you to go and call the hospital.
Get on with it!
Inspector
Doctor Arbe is here
Very well, you can go.
Mr Wardh, this is Doctor?
He did everything to try and save your wife but it was already too late.
And I'm telling you it isn't suicide.
My wife was scared of dying.
The room was locked and sealed from the inside!
It wouldn't have happened if she'd been with me.
Anyway, this man's guilty.
I want to go now.
Of course, Mr Wardh.
The funeral?
The body needs to be available to the authorities for a few days then you can send someone to collect it.
George!
You're late.
I'll pay now.
It's too hot for me here.
A plane is leaving for Rio!
I don't want to miss it.
Who are you scared of?
Nobody's expecting you to be in Vienna, and nobody saw you here.
If the police discover one day that the maniac didn't kill Carroll your alibi's already been checked out.
Like yours, and you're the only one with a motive.
Even if some cop unveils our tricks... you're out of it.
Your passport says you're called John McDonald, and Julie never met you.
But you've got a cast iron alibi too.
If they don't get me you're fine.
They won't get you.
Julie Wardh committed suicide.
The money, now!
Okay.
Now you really are dead.
A first-rate suicide for love.
Have they paid up?
Not yet.
They want the death certificate, it's a matter of days.
I spoke to New York.
Hope I can manage to keep the creditors sweet and avoid bankruptcy.
And you?
No problems.
Carroll's death means I'm the sole heir.
We've got to be careful.
If someone sees us together...
Why?
We're husband and lover united in memories.
There's no risk.
And there never was.
I told you, didn't I?
The best time to eliminate someone is when the police are hunting a homicidal maniac.
We can help each other.
You eliminate the cousin and I eliminate the wife.
They're blaming it all on him... even though that idiot was caught before we finished the job.
The suicide idea worked perfectly.
Talking of which, our black suits?
Burned completely destroyed.
There's no evidence any more.
Maybe it would be better to throw these gloves out.
I burnt mine.
Why?
They're almost new.
Did you like my line at the police station?
"Anyway, this man's guilty!"
And how did poor old Jean take it?
Like a kick in the guts!
He was so stupid he still didn't believe he'd had it.
And if the Spanish police find him?
They'll found the motive for Mr McDonald's suicide.
It's crucial that the insurance claim is above suspicion or they'll drag it out forever.
What do you think they could suspect?
Your wife dies well after she'd left you, and you were miles away.
And it was a clear-cut case of suicide.
Julie!
That woman!
It's her, I'm sure!
What are you talking about?
I only saw her briefly... it was her, Julie!
If you're starting to hallucinate already we'll end up badly.
No, it was her
I clearly saw her.
Lets go back.
You're crazy.
There was just a resemblance.
...no!
- I've never heard of th e dead hitch-hiking.
Alright just a resemblance.
So what?
Lets have a look.
We're shafted!
Careful!
It's over, Julie.
Call and get them to send a breakdown crane
I'd never have reopened this investigation if our doctor hadn't given us about the different technique used by Carroll Baxter's murderer.
And there would have been three more criminals.
I'm sorry, but I had no other way to unmask them.
In thinking you were dead they felt safe and they betrayed themselves.
But most of the credit goes to Dr Arbe's who save you.
I'm leaving you in good hands.
You saved my life but I feel dead anyway.
You'll be able to forget everything.
Time is the best healer, Julie.
Good luck!
"The very fact that the commandment says "do not kill"
makes us aware and convinced that we are descended from an unbroken chain of generations of assassins for whom the love of murder was in their blood, as it is perhaps in ours too"
Welcome!
- Hello!
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Hi Neil!
How's it going Neil?
You've forgotten your old friends since living in New York.
Obviously I'd like to come home more often.
No Julie?
Yes, especially ifWall Street were here.
But I don't have time to play the tourist.
Talking of which, the meeting with Muller is set for eight.
Seems he's willing to buy that lot of stocks which you told me about yesterday.
I'm sorry dear, but I don't have time to go home with you.
You know, it's very important.
I'll call you a taxi.
Don't worry, I can get one myself.
Excuse me if we steal your husband just a few metres into Austria.
I'm not a boring wife.
The extremely important things first.
Kramorstrasse 25.
What's going on?
Good evening.
- Documents, please.
- Here, take it.
I'm sorry, madam.
It's just a formality.
What's this about?
Awoman was killed half an hour ago, near the airport.
Another woman killed?
Yes, and razor-slashed again.
You can go.
This story is becoming an obsession with the publicity in the papers and on tv about that crazy maniac.
Yes, they mentioned it in the States too.
They should bring back the death, they should do it!
Then that people would meet the end they deserve.
130 schillings.
- Please keep the change.
- Thank you.
- Welcome back Mrs Wardh.
- Antonio, it's you.
A pleasure to see you again, madam.
Everything's in order with the apartment.
Has anyone come in within the last few minutes?
No, madam.
Were you expecting someone?
The maid comes tomorrow.
I'll take care of the bags.
Thank you.
- Mrs Wardh?
- Yes?
For you.
The porter asked me to deliver the luggage.
Leave them here.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
The worst part of you is the best thing you have and will always be mine.
Jean.
Yes I understand, Neil.
At least try to pick me up not too late though.
No!
I'm not angry even though Carroll calls me 'Widow Wardh'.
You've only stayed with me one night in the three days we've been here.
Come quickly, alright?
Bye.
Julie, you can finally stop whining about the old man.
Look what I've brought you:
It's fantastic news fresh from Australia.
You wouldn't believe it.
George!
Tell him something about uncle.
To be honest, I was fond of old uncle.
Uncle croaked in the end and left a nice nest-egg for me and him.
We're the sole heirs.
You're family?
Yes.
At least that's the way it is for the notary in Sydney.
Uncle's dead without a will and the young lady and I are the sole heirs.
What should I say?
Condolences or congratulations?
Just say:
Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.
Very good.
Shall we drink something to celebrate?
- Our meeting?
- No, to uncle's death.
Without which I'd never have met you.
Oh, right.
Julie, please don't cheat the most handsome cousin I have, alright?
A Martini rosso for me.
- Are your clothes really made of paper?
- Underneathas well?
They're real, you innocent.
- What would you say about having a look?
- Lets give them a tug.
It's true, they're made of paper.
Carroll!
Why didn't you say Jean was here as well?
He really pestered me about when you'd be back.
I told him to leave you alone but he came anyway.
Why does it matter to you?
- I'm going.
- Why, Julie?
- Because I am.
- Julie!
Wait.
- Leave me alone.
- I'll take you home in my car.
No, go away.
Why?
Nothing brings us closer than having a vice in common.
I'm out of it, and now you make me sick.
Leave me alone!
Julie!
No, please.
Let him go.
You don't know Jean.
He likes hurting people.
What's up?
Aterrible nightmare but it's over so don't worry.
Julie tell me the truth.
What's wrong?
Is it that man?
- Bye.
- Bye!
Next time don't wear paper, come in your birthday suit.
- Funny!
Goodbye.
...Bye!
Goodbye!
Wait a minute!
Give it to me.
No parking zone, obstructing traffic.
You'll pay now?
No, for god's sake, we collect them.
Thanks.
Here it is.
There are more than a thousand policemen in this town!
I want all their autographs!
It's not that easy, you know.
You're completely mad!
Why?
Seem strange to you?
I once went to bed with someone who collected ladies underwear.
I realised he only wanted to be with me to steal my knickers.
Hey!
Give me the paper, will you?
- Here.
- Take it.
Thanks.
Let me have a look.
Another woman murdered.
We should be grateful to this maniac for eliminating our competition.
They always write the same stuff and I don't read it, but if I don't buy a paper I miss it.
How I envy you, Carroll you're always so relaxed and cheerful.
No Julie you just take the best wherever you find it.
A little here, a little there and avoid thinking the worst.
I married Neil to finish with Jean.
Neil seemed so wise and calm.
But now I'm not so sure.
Neil's your husband, dear.
You can't expect to have everything from one man.
Carroll!
Please...
The fact that you put someone between you and Jean is already really important
Yes I know, but maybe
I've got to escape from myself.
Jean would never accept not seeing me again because he can't stand losing.
Excuse me, madam.
There's a gentleman waiting for you
I put him in the living room.
I don't want to see anyone.
He asked for your husband.
I told him he was out but he wanted to wait to speak to you.
Come on!
Who are you scared of?
If it's Jean we'll throw him out.
Come on, it'll be fun for me
Hello.
Look who it is, the handsome cousin.
My husband's not at home.
I'm sorry, Julie.
But Carroll told me your husband is an expert in money problems.
I'd like to get his advice.
Yes, I see.
But I'm sorry, my husband's not here.
I'm glad, really...
To be honest it was just an excuse to see you again.
One definitely can't deny your quality of sincerity.
We interrupted our celebratory drink so I don't want to miss the chance to get to know you as well as I can.
Listen, my handsome cousin.
Given the time, if you want to court her
I recommend continuing over a steak.
Mr...
Call me George.
Don't worry you'll get a chance to speak to my husband alright?
Yes but it's you who should be worrying.
I like bothering women even when their husbands are around.
Shall we go, Julie?
In any case thanks, handsome cousin, for the lunch invitation.
For god's sake, I'd never invite anyone to Birri's.
They serve mustard which swells your tongue.
Why did you treat him like that?
Because I wanted to!
People who are too sure of themselves get on my nerves.
If I were you, I'd do it cousin or not.
Lets go and eat.
I am truly sorry, Miss Baxter.
I had three tables left but a gentleman has just booked them.
So we'll have to starve.
Why?
The mustard's excellent here doesn't burn the tongue at all.
Want some?
What a shame it's full.
But it isn't, I've booked three tables.
We can choose:
Here, here, or down there.
- Did I make a mistake?
- If it's that important to you.
Yes, it is.
I was worried I'd have to give up my mustard.
Well, cancel the other two tables.
- Here alright?
- No, the other one's be tter.
The usual for me.
What Carroll's having is fine for me.
So, that's three of what Carroll's having.
This way you'll occasionally think of me when eating an apple.
The forbidden fruit.
For you I'll do nothing at all!
You've got it all wrong, dear.
It's always been Eve who should offer the apple.
Excuse me, Miss Baxter.
You're wanted on the telephone.
I'll be right back.
Maybe Carroll's right.
What's this?
Does it mean you want to eat me?
No it means I've already eaten you.
You'll discover I'm hard to digest.
I'm sorry, but I've got to rush off.
In any case you're happier alone with your apples.
Oh, Carroll!
I'll phone you.
Bye!
I can take you wherever you want.
To a taxi, thank you.
So you're used to having your own way, aren't you?
You've finally got it.
Where are we going?
!
It's a surprise.
Take me home at once!
Later, Julie, later!
- I told you to take me...
- Relax.
I'm just going to make you feel ecstasy and fear!
Take me home now!
Ecstasy, fear and a pounding heart!
I kept my promises, didn't I?
I'll say you did!
I think I should apologise.
Ljudged you wrongly.
No, no!
You were right about me.
But it's hard to resist so much.
Thanks anyway... it's been a nice afternoon.
I really needed it.
Bye!
Hello?
Julie?
Would you be amazed if I told you I loved you?
Oh please, George, don't be ridiculous.
Some words aren't used any more.
I thanked you for the nice afternoon and that's it.
I couldn't possibly want anything else from you.
Please leave me alone.
George?
!
Don't be offended but I don't want to see you again because today... because I like you.
You mustn't phone me again.
Never again.
Alright, Julie.
I won't phone again if that's what you want.
How did you get in?
!
By the door, it was open.
Why are you...
I wanted to tell you again, Julie:
I really like you and I'm not used to hiding my intentions.
George I beg you don't complicate my life.
Don't you understand?
!
I'm not the woman you met today.
I know nothing about you, nor do I want to.
For me you're fine as you are.
Come on, lets go into my place.
No, not now.
Let me go.
If you want if you want.
I'll take you home.
What's wrong?
I'm scared!
Scared of what?
!
Take me away, George.
- Where?
- Wherever you want!
It's not a palace, is it?
But it's good enough for me.
I practically only come here to sleep.
They are for Mrs Wardh.
Thank you.
I know you're trying to escape me... but your vice is a room locked from the inside and only I have the key.
Who's the admirer?
!
Anonymous.
I'd like to think it was you, but... they don't deal in these items on the stock exchange, do they?
Julie, what's the matter?
Nothing
You've been treating me as if I'd done something wrong.
If you feel uncared for or you need something we should talk.
No, I don't need anything.
Hello?
Mrs Julie Wardh?
Yes.
Who is it?
I have had occasion to see that you are a delightful lover with very interesting perversions which I'm sure go unsuspected even by your honest husband.
Isn't that true?
Stop talking nonsense.
Who is this?
That's not important, whereas I think you should know what I want, Mrs Wardh.
I want twenty thousand schillings to not tell your husband about your affection for George Corot.
It's Jean.
It's you, I know it!
It's Jean isn't it?
!
Mrs Wardh, I will expect you at sunset at the
South entrance to Palmenhaus.
Remember:
Alone, and with twenty thousand schillings.
But...
I didn't know what to do.
When I saw that black car I was scared it would be Jean, and that's why I went into George's.
Naturally.
You wanted to go to bed with him and your fear of Jean gave you the excuse.
Please, Carroll.
Well, maybe it was as you said.
Anyway there's still the problem of the phone call.
It was Jean?
Who knows?
Have you watched the tv?
They talked about that maniac.
The last of his victims was that stupid bitch who stripped at the party...
Could it be Jean?
He's got a black car too.
Carroll please stop it.
I was joking.
He goes to prostitutes, and Jean doesn't.
What was his voice like on the phone?
Well...
I've already told you.
It was a disguised, unrecognisable voice.
Which means if he'd spoken with his normal voice you'd have recognized him.
It must be Jean.
He's the type.
I'm sorry but I don't see the problem.
If you like
George you can forget about both Jean and Neil.
So what if Neil finds out?
I think he's a modern intelligent man.
Everything's simple for you.
While I don't know what George is for me,
I know what I was for him.
I wanted to call him this morning but I don't even have his number, and I haven't heard from him.
And I don't want Neil to find out this way.
He really doesn't deserve it.
Listen, dear, don't have too many scruples.
If you want his number I'll give it to you.
Neil's had you in his bed for a year.
Don't you think that's enough to make up for the heartache?
When you talk like that I want to slap you.
But what do you expect?
It's the way of the world.
Don't even bother about it,
I keep them in the oven because I hate cold underwear.
In any case you mustn't go to that appointment.
Where did he say?
At the Palmenhaus in Shembrun at sunset alone and with twenty thousand schillings.
I'll go.
You?
No it could be dangerous.
And I don't want you involved anymore.
Don't worry
I'll enjoy it.
And you'll see it's definitely Jean and then I'll laugh in his face.
But if it's not Jean.
If it's someone else?
Who?
Maybe the sadist in the papers?
Then that means I'm in grave danger because I am a bit of a whore.
You joke about everything.
Had breakfast yet?
Well come on... there's a bar downstairs which will make you forget all about diets.
Come on, and stop making that face!
There's the start!
The competitors immediately engage in a fight and it's number 36 first, followed by number 122.
...at the third bend, the final battle is about to begin.
We're closing!
We're closing at sunset!
We're closing!
Excuse me
I had an appointment at the South entrance to the Palmenhaus but I've lost my bearings.
Over there but if you don't hurry you'll be locked inside.
They're about to close the gates now, so be quick.
- Thank you.
- Good eveni ng.
Help!
Help!
No!
What's going on?
!
- Who was screaming!
?
- There...
Look over there!
Can you tell us anything?
No, I didn't see anything.
Ljust heard that poor girl shouting.
She'd asked me where the Palmenhaus South entrance was.
She had an appointment.
I don't know anything else.
These little animals are my only friends, inspector.
Much less repugnant than certain people I know.
Listen... it's been said that you've been
Carroll Baxter's friend for a long time.
It's very important for us to know everything there is to know about her and the people she associated with.
Please follow me to the police station
I need to continue to interrogate you.
Don't worry, I'm used to being around cages.
So... shall we go?
Lets go.
Is all this really necessary?
So, madam... is this the man you spoke to us about?
Yes.
Why do you think he's the killer we're looking for?
You flatter me Julie.
Do you really think I'm capable of cutting a lot of women's throats?
Yes, you could be.
And though it might seem silly, he has a black car like the one described in the papers.
You're incredibly amusing.
But it was you who sent me those notes.
What notes?
The lady and I were joined in an "intimate" friendship.
That's why I sent her flowers along with my thoughts, hoping she'd remember the good times, and perhaps decide on a nostalgic encounter.
I hate you.
The only thing I can't stand is indifference.
Hate is a good feeling, it's fiery and violent like love, only more so.
Mrs Wardh, you received a threatening phone call and that Carroll went to the appointment in your place thinking that you were dealing with your friend...
Was it that man's voice on the phone?
It was disguised, it could have been anyone.
But Carroll told me it must have been Jean.
A stranger wouldn't have had to mask the voice.
Yes... but he was in a bowling alley on the other side of town while someone was cutting your friend's throat.
That's the way it is, I'm afraid.
Listen... why don't you check Mrs Wardh's alibi?
You're a dirty coward.
You see, Mrs Wardh doesn't have a black car, but she's always had a weakness for blood.
Nobody's said the murderer you're looking for is a man.
You're a person you were keen on for over two years.
That's enough!
I'm not interested in your theories.
Fine.
Can I go?
- I've got something to do.
- Of course.
You can both go.
Bring the other one in.
What's his name?
George Corot.
They called you as well?
Now I understand why my roses no longer affect you.
George Corot!
I've got to see you.
See you at my place at five.
Julie, at last!
I'm really tired Neil...
Let me speak to your husband now then we'll go away.
Away from this city, from everything.
No, George, not now.
Maybe when they've found Carroll's murderer.
It was foolish to meet today.
I could be being watched.
You've told me there's already someone who knows... but do you realise that it should have been you instead of Carroll?
So what?
You can't hide forever.
Does living mean so little to you?
I don't know, George.
If you weren't around I'd almost be happy to end it all.
Please, they can see us here!
I'll take you home.
I'd rather you didn't.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Neil!
Neil!
Julie!
The elevator was always busy so I had to take the stairs.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Julie... where have you been?
What happened?
Someone in the garage tried to kill me with a razor.
Was it Jean?
Did you see him?
Was it him?
I don't know.
He was dressed in black, it was dark...
I don't know!
Don't be influenced by the stories in the papers.
Besides, we'll soon know if it was Jean.
Neil!
What do you want to do?
Lets call the police.
Where does he live?
There's only one thing to do with people like that.
You mustn't take any risks for me.
You're my wife now, and that's all that matters.
Tell me where he is.
I'll go with you.
Alright, come with me.
Wait for me here.
Neil!
I told you to stay in the car!
No, I'm coming with you.
There are no lights on.
Nobody's there lets go.
There's a camera on the ground over there... a photo's been taken.
Julie!
Julie, relax Julie!
Neil
Jean's car has gone!
Adam and Eve lost paradise because they wanted to know too much.
Julie, wake up Julie!
I've developed that photo.
Look!
Recognise him?
It's the man in the garage.
Yes, it's him!
Who?
Don't know.
He was dressed like that, with those glasses.
Now we know it wasn't Jean.
Which means... he could be the murderer of the women and Carroll?
I mean I suspected Jean because he was your lover.
Obviously there's someone else.
Oh, Neil!
Where are you going?
I'm scared.
I'm going to the police.
This photo could be useful to the inspector.
Hello?
George, is that you?
Why did you take so long to call me?
I'll tell you when I see you.
Come and get me, I can't carry on.
Come and get me, and we'll leave.
We'll go to some quiet place as far away as possible.
Anywhere.
Okay.
Give me time to pack a case and I'll be with you.
I'll take you to Spain.
I know a little place that'll make you forget everything.
For Neil.
When did she leave?
Just before noon.
Bye, dear.
I'll call you when I get back from Sydney.
Okay.
Bye!
Hello?
Hello.
How are you?
No, I'm sorry.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I'll be back in a week.
Then I'll get the A122 toTokyo.
No.
I'm not tired.
You don't sleep with the time zone changes.
The light's gone out... it'll come back on.
Alright!
Yes, I'll bring you a souvenir.
Will a kangaroo do?
Why, what do you want?
I promise we'll meet again when I get back.
Bye!
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Has something happened?
No, no.
Nothing.
Why did you run away?
I wanted to get some sun.
Carry on thinking about your prey if you want.
I've seen one who's more attractive.
Viennese homicidal maniac dead.
Viennese homicidal maniac dead.
George!
Yes?
Look, they've found the maniac.
He was killed by the girl he was attacking.
So it's all over, for good.
So it's all over, for good.
Lets think about us.
I'm hungry.
I'll go on to the villa to prepare some food while you go and change some money.
We've almost run out.
You take my car and I'll get a taxi.
Bye!
Bye!
Bye.
- Take them.
- Thanks.
These are for you.
For me?
!
Yes, that gentleman gave them to me... he was there just now.
He was there just now.
He must have left.
Since the living don't give flowers to the dead, the dead give them to the living.
Jean.
George.
George.
What's going on?
What's wrong?
Do you feel sick, madam?
What's wrong?
Do you feel sick, madam?
No, no!
Madam...
Julie!
Julie.
Julie answer me.
It's George.
Julie, what happened?
Julie!
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes?
- Where can I find a doctor?
- Down there, at the pha rmacy.
Thanks.
This will make you sleep for a few hours.
What's wrong with her?
She's in shock, it's a powerful emotion.
She's in shock, it's a powerful emotion.
When I left her down in the village she was fine.
Well something happened maybe she got a fright.
Know what you can do?
I'll give you a number!
Here it is.
Doctor Arbe.
He's my friend, a good neurologist.
Barcelona's not far- by car you'd be there in half an hour.
Thank you.
Can I leave her here while I go down into the village to call?
Don't worry.
She'll sleep peacefully until this evening.
- I'll come with you.
- Not necessary.
I know the road.
- I'll come with you.
- Not necessary.
I know the road.
No, it's impossible.
I've still got two appointments and I don't have a car.
Tomorrow.
And I don't have a car.
Tomorrow.
Please, doctor.
I'll pick you up.
Alright, in an hour.
Thank you, doctor, thank you.
- How much?
- 80 pesetas.
George...
George!
George!
So I brought her here hoping she'd feel better far away from it all.
Then...
I don't know what happened today.
You mentioned blood earlier.
She didn't say anything to me but I understood something straight away.
She was with that man I told you about for a while.
He dominated her.
Blood definitely has a strange effect on her
Blood definitely has a strange effect on her it both attracts and repels her.
Listen it would be better not to tell her I'm a doctor.
It'll be easier.
Julie!
There's a smell of gas.
Quick, in the kitchen!
The door's locked.
Help me!
Julie...
Turn the gas off and try not to breathe!
Open the window!
Lets take her there.
No pulse any more.
Call to quickly send an equipped ambulance.
- Is there any hope?
- I told you to go and call the hospital.
Get on with it!
Inspector
Doctor Arbe is here
Very well, you can go.
Mr Wardh, this is Doctor?
He did everything to try and save your wife but it was already too late.
And I'm telling you it isn't suicide.
My wife was scared of dying.
The room was locked and sealed from the inside!
It wouldn't have happened if she'd been with me.
Anyway, this man's guilty.
I want to go now.
Of course, Mr Wardh.
The funeral?
The body needs to be available to the authorities for a few days then you can send someone to collect it.
George!
You're late.
I'll pay now.
It's too hot for me here.
A plane is leaving for Rio!
I don't want to miss it.
Who are you scared of?
Nobody's expecting you to be in Vienna, and nobody saw you here.
If the police discover one day that the maniac didn't kill Carroll your alibi's already been checked out.
Like yours, and you're the only one with a motive.
Even if some cop unveils our tricks... you're out of it.
Your passport says you're called John McDonald, and Julie never met you.
But you've got a cast iron alibi too.
If they don't get me you're fine.
They won't get you.
Julie Wardh committed suicide.
The money, now!
Okay.
Now you really are dead.
A first-rate suicide for love.
Have they paid up?
Not yet.
They want the death certificate, it's a matter of days.
I spoke to New York.
Hope I can manage to keep the creditors sweet and avoid bankruptcy.
And you?
No problems.
Carroll's death means I'm the sole heir.
We've got to be careful.
If someone sees us together...
Why?
We're husband and lover united in memories.
There's no risk.
And there never was.
I told you, didn't I?
The best time to eliminate someone is when the police are hunting a homicidal maniac.
We can help each other.
You eliminate the cousin and I eliminate the wife.
They're blaming it all on him... even though that idiot was caught before we finished the job.
The suicide idea worked perfectly.
Talking of which, our black suits?
Burned completely destroyed.
There's no evidence any more.
Maybe it would be better to throw these gloves out.
I burnt mine.
Why?
They're almost new.
Did you like my line at the police station?
"Anyway, this man's guilty!"
And how did poor old Jean take it?
Like a kick in the guts!
He was so stupid he still didn't believe he'd had it.
And if the Spanish police find him?
They'll found the motive for Mr McDonald's suicide.
It's crucial that the insurance claim is above suspicion or they'll drag it out forever.
What do you think they could suspect?
Your wife dies well after she'd left you, and you were miles away.
And it was a clear-cut case of suicide.
Julie!
That woman!
It's her, I'm sure!
What are you talking about?
I only saw her briefly... it was her, Julie!
If you're starting to hallucinate already we'll end up badly.
No, it was her
I clearly saw her.
Lets go back.
You're crazy.
There was just a resemblance.
...no!
- I've never heard of th e dead hitch-hiking.
Alright just a resemblance.
So what?
Lets have a look.
We're shafted!
Careful!
It's over, Julie.
Call and get them to send a breakdown crane
I'd never have reopened this investigation if our doctor hadn't given us about the different technique used by Carroll Baxter's murderer.
And there would have been three more criminals.
I'm sorry, but I had no other way to unmask them.
In thinking you were dead they felt safe and they betrayed themselves.
But most of the credit goes to Dr Arbe's who save you.
I'm leaving you in good hands.
You saved my life but I feel dead anyway.
You'll be able to forget everything.
Time is the best healer, Julie.
Good luck!
The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh
Welcome!
- Hello!
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Hi Neil!
How's it going Neil?
Now that you live in New York you've forgotten your old friends
Obviously I'd like to come home more often.
Isn't that true Julie?
Yes, especially if Wall Street was here.
But I don't have time to play the tourist.
Talking of which, the meeting with Muller is set for eight.
Seems he's willing to buy those share which you told me about yesterday on the phone
I'm sorry dear, but I don't have time to take you home.
It's very important you know.
I'll call you a taxi.
Don't worry, I can get one myself.
We apologise if we steal your husband just a few metres into Austria.
I'm not an annoying wife.
The extremely important things first.
Kramorstrasse 25.
What's going on?
Good evening.
- Papers, please.
- Here.
I'm sorry, madam.
It's just a formality.
BUt Why?
A woman was killed half an hour ago, near the airport.
Another woman killed?
Yes, and cut with a razor again.
You can go.
This story is becoming an obsession
It's everywhere in the papers and on TV about that crazy maniac.
Yes, they mentioned it in the US as well.
They should bring back death penalty, that's what they should do it!
Then those sick people would get the end they deserve.
130 schillings.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.
- Welcome back Mrs Wardh.
- Antonio, it's you.
A pleasure to see you again, madam.
Everything's in order in the apartment.
Has anyone come in the last minutes?
No, madam.
Were you expecting someone?
The maid comes tomorrow.
I'll take care of the bags.
Don't you worry.
Thank you.
- Mrs Wardh?
- Yes?
These are for you.
The porter asked
T he porter also told me to deliver your suitcases
Leave them here.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Yes I understand, Neil.
At least try to pick me up not too late though.
No!
I'm not angry even though Carroll calls me 'the Widow Wardh'.
You've only stayed with me one night in the three days we've been here.
Don't be too late.
Bye.
Julie, you've finally stopped bothering the old man.
Look what I've brought you
He's just arrived, fresh from Australia.
With fantastic news!
You wouldn't believe it.
George!
Tell her about our uncle.
To be honest, I was fond of old uncle.
Of course you were!
Anyway, our uncle croaked and left a nice nest-egg for me and him.
We're the sole heirs.
You're family?
Yes.
At least that's the way it is for the notary in Sydney.
Uncle's dead without a will and the young lady and I are the sole heirs.
What should I say?
Condolences or congratulations?
Just say:
Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.
Very good.
Shall we drink something to celebrate?
- Our meeting?
- No, to uncle's death.
Without which I'd never have met you.
Oh, right.
Julie, please don't steal the most handsome cousin I have, alright?
A Martini rosso for me.
- Are your clothes really made of paper?
- Underneath as well?
They're real, how naive.
- What would you say about having a look?
- Lets give them a tug.
It's true, they're made of paper.
Carroll!
Why didn't you say Jean was here as well?
He really pestered me about when you'd be back.
I told him to leave you alone but he came anyway.
Why does it matter to you?
- I'm going.
- Why, Julie?
- Because I am.
- Julie!
Wait.
- Leave me alone.
- I'll take you home in my car.
No, go away.
Why?
Nothing brings us closer than having a vice in common.
I'm out of it, and now you make me sick.
Leave me alone!
Julie!
No, please.
Let him go.
You don't know Jean.
He likes hurting people.
What's up?
A terrible nightmare but it's over so don't worry.
Julie tell me the truth.
What's wrong?
Is it that man?
- Bye.
- Bye!
Next time don't wear paper, come already naked.
- Funny!
Goodbye.
...Bye!
Good bye!
Wait a minute!
Give it to me.
No parking zone, obstructing traffic.
You'll pay now?
No, for god's sake, we collect them.
Thanks.
Done!
There are more than a thousand policemen in this town!
I want all their autographs!
It's not that easy, you know.
You're completely mad!
Why?
Seem strange to you?
I once went to bed with someone who collected ladies underwear.
I realised he only wanted to be with me to steal my knickers.
Hey!
Give me the paper, will you?
- Here.
- Thank you.
Thanks.
Let me have a look.
Another woman murdered.
We should be grateful to this maniac for eliminating our competition.
They always write the same stuff and I don't read it, but if I don't buy a paper I miss it.
How I envy you, Carroll you're always so relaxed and cheerful.
No Julie you just take the best wherever you find it.
A little here, a little there and avoid thinking the worst.
I married Neil to finish with Jean.
Neil seemed so wise and calm.
But now I'm not so sure.
Neil's your husband, clear.
You can't expect to have everything from one man.
Carroll!
Please...
The fact that you put someone between you and Jean is already really important
Yes I know, but maybe
I need to escape from myself.
Jean would never accept not seeing me again because he can't stand losing.
Excuse me, madam.
There's a gentleman waiting for you
I put him in the living room.
I don't want to see anyone.
He asked for your husband.
I told him he was out but he wanted to wait to speak to you.
Come on!
Who are you scared of?
If it's Jean we'll throw him out.
Come on, it'll be fun for me
Hello.
Look who it is, the handsome cousin.
My husband's not at home.
I'm sorry, Julie.
But Carroll told me your husband is an expert in financial matters.
I'd like to get his advice.
Yes, I see.
But I'm sorry, my husband's not here.
I'm glad instead, because... to be honest it was just an excuse to see you again.
One definitely can't deny your sincerity.
We interrupted our celebratory drink the other night, and I didn't want to miss the chance to get to know you as well as I can.
Listen, my handsome cousin.
If you intend to woo her
I recommend you continue over a steak.
Mr...
Call me George.
Don't worry you'll get a chance to speak to my husband alright?
Yes but it's you who should be worrying.
I like bothering women even when their husbands are around.
Shall we go, Julie?
In any case thanks for the lunch invitation, beautiful cousin.
For goodness sake, I'd never invite anyone to Birri's.
They serve mustard which swells your tongue.
Why did you treat him like that?
Because I wanted to!
People who are too sure of themselves get on my nerves.
If I were you, I'd do it cousin or not.
Lets go and eat.
I am truly sorry, Miss Baxter.
I had three tables left but a gentleman has just booked them.
So we'll have to starve.
Why?
The mustard's excellent here doesn't burn the tongue at all.
Want some?
What a shame it's full.
But it isn't, I've booked three tables.
We can choose:
Here, here, or down there.
- Did I do wrong?
- If it's that important to you.
Yes, it is.
I was worried I'd have to give up my mustard.
Well, cancel the other two tables.
- Here alright?
- No, the other one's better.
The usual for me.
What Carroll's having is fine for me.
So, that's three of what Carroll's having.
Here.
This way you'll think of me when eating an apple.
The forbidden fruit.
For you I'll do nothing at all!
You've got it all wrong, dear.
It's always been Eve who should offer the apple.
Excuse me, Miss Baxter.
You're wanted on the telephone.
I'll be right back.
Here.
Maybe Carroll's right.
What's this?
Does it mean you want to eat me?
No it means I've already eaten you.
You'll discover I'm hard to digest.
I'm sorry, but I've got to rush off.
In any case you're happier alone with your apples.
Oh, Carroll!
I'll phone you.
Bye!
I can take you wherever you want.
To a taxi, thank you.
So you're used to having your own way, aren't you?
You've finally got it.
Where are we going?
!
It's a surprise.
Take me home at once'.!
Later, Julie, later!
- I told you to take me...
- Relax.
I'm just going to make you feel ecstasy and fear!
Take me home now!
Ecstasy, fear and a pounding heart!
I kept my promises, didn't I?
I'll say you did!
I think I should apologise.
I had misjudged you.
No, no!
You were right about me.
But it's hard to resist so much.
Thanks anyway... it's been a nice afternoon.
I really needed it.
Bye!
Hello?
Julie?
Would you be amazed if I told you I loved you?
Oh please, George, don't be ridiculous.
Some words aren't used any more.
I thanked you for the nice afternoon and that's it.
I couldn't possibly want anything else from you.
Please leave rne alone.
George?
!
Don't be offended but I don't want to see you again because today...
because I like you.
You mustn't phone me again.
Never again.
Alright, Julie.
I won't phone again if that's what you want.
How did you get in?
!
By the door, it was open.
Why are you...
I wanted to tell you again, Julie:
I really like you and I'm not used to hiding my intentions.
George I beg you don't complicate my life.
Don't you understand?
!
I'm not the woman you met today.
I know nothing about you, nor do I want to.
For me you're fine as you are.
Come on, lets go into my place.
No, not now.
Let me go.
As you wish.
As you wish.
I'll take you home.
What's wrong?
I'm scared!
Scared of what?
!
Take me away, George.
- Where?
- Wherever you want!
It's not a palace, is it?
But it's good enough for me.
I practically only come here to sleep.
They are for Mrs Wardh.
Thank you.
Who's the admirer?
!
Anonymous.
I'd like to think it was you, but...
they don't deal in these items on the stock exchange, do they?
Julie, what's the matter?
Nothing
You've been treating me as if I'd done something wrong.
If you feel uncared for or you need something we should talk.
No, I don't need anything.
Hello?
Mrs Julie Wardh?
Yes.
Who is it?
I have had occasion to see that you are a delightful lover with very interesting perversions and I am sure that your honest husband doesn't suspect it
Isn't that true?
Stop talking nonsense.
Who are you?
That's not important, whereas I think that you should know what I want, Mrs Wardh.
I want twenty thousand schillings to not tell your husband about your affection for George Corot.
It's Jean.
It's you, I know it!
It's Jean isn't it?
!
Mrs Wardh, I will expect you at sunset at the South entrance to Palmenhaus.
Remember:
Alone, and with twenty thousand schillings.
But...
I didn't know what to do.
When I saw that black car I was scared it would be Jean, and that's why I went into George's.
Naturally.
You wanted to go to bed with him and your fear of Jean gave you the excuse.
Please, Carroll.
Well, maybe it was as you said.
Anyway there's still the problem of the phone call.
It was Jean?
Who knows?
Have you watched the TV?
They talked about that maniac.
The last of his victims was that stupid bitch who stripped at the party...
Could it be Jean?
He's got a black car too.
Carroll please stop it.
I was joking.
He goes to prostitutes, and Jean doesn't.
What was his voice like on the phone?
Well...
I've already told you.
It was a disguised, unrecognisable voice.
Which means if he'd spoken with his normal voice you'd have recognised him.
It must be Jean.
He's the type.
I'm sorry but I don't see the problem.
If you like
George you can forget about both Jean and Neil.
So what if Neil finds out?
I think he's a modern intelligent man.
Everything's simple for you.
While I don't know what George is for me,
I know what I was for him.
I wanted to call him this morning but I don't even have his number, and I haven't heard from him.
And I don't want Neil to find out this way.
He really doesn't deserve it.
Listen, dear, don't have too many scruples.
If you want his number I'll give it to you.
Neil's had you in his bed for a year.
Don't you think that's enough to make up for the heartache?
When you talk like that I want to slap you.
But what do you expect?
It's the way of the world.
Don't take any notice.
I keep them in the oven because I hate cold underwear.
In any case you mustn't go to that appointment.
Where did he say?
At the Palmenhaus in Shembrun at sunset alone and with twenty thousand schillings.
I'll go.
You?
No it could be dangerous.
And I don't want you involved anymore.
Don't worry
I'll enjoy it.
And you'll see it's definitely Jean and then I'll laugh in his face.
And if it isn't Jean?
If it's someone else?
Who?
Maybe the sadist in the papers?
Then that means I'm in grave danger because I am a bit of a whore.
You joke about everything.
Had breakfast yet?
Well come on, there's a coffee place downstairs which will make you forget all about diets.
Come on, and stop making that face!
There's the start!
The riders are already in fierce battle for the front
...and it's number 36 first, followed by number 122.
...at the third bend, the final battle is about to begin.
We're closing!
We're closing at sunset!
We're closing!
Excuse me
I had an appointment at the South entrance to the Palmenhaus but I've lost my bearings.
Over there but if you don't hurry you'll be locked inside.
They're about to close the gates now, so be quick.
- Thank you.
- Good evening.
Help!
Help!
No!
What's going on?
!
- Who was screamingl?
- There...
Look over there!
Can you tell us anything?
No, I didn't see anything.
I just heard that poor girl shouting.
She'd asked me where the Palmenhaus South entrance was.
She had an appointment.
I don't know anything else.
These little animals are my only friends, inspector.
Much less repugnant than certain people I know.
Listen... it's been said that you've been
Carroll Baxter's friend for a long time.
It's very important for us to know everything there is to know about her and her friends.
Please follow me to the police station
I need to continue to interrogate you.
Don't worry, I'm used to being around cages.
So... shall we go?
Lets go.
Is all this really necessary?
So, madam... is this the man you spoke to us about?
Yes.
Why do you think he's the killer we're looking for?
You flatter me Julie.
Do you really think I'm capable of cutting a lot of women's throats?
Yes, you could be.
And though it might seem silly, he has a black car like the one described in the papers.
You're incredibly amusing.
But it was you who sent me those notes.
What notes?
The lady and I were joined in an "intimate" friendship.
That's why I sent her flowers along with my thoughts, hoping she'd remember the good times, and perhaps decide on a nostalgic encounter.
I hate you.
The only thing I can't stand is indifference.
Hate is a good feeling, it's fiery and violent like love, only more so.
Mrs Wardh, you received a threatening phone call and that Carroll went to the appointment in your place thinking that you were dealing with your friend...
Correct?
Was it that man's voice on the phone?
It was disguised, it could have been anyone.
But Carroll told me it must have been Jean.
A stranger wouldn't have had to mask the voice.
YES... but he was in a bowling alley on the other side of town while someone was cutting your friend's throat.
That's the way it is, I'm afraid.
Listen... why don't you check Mrs Wardh's alibi?
You're a dirty coward.
You see, Mrs Wardh doesn't have a black car, but she's always had a weakness for blood.
Nobody's said the murderer you're looking for is a man.
You're a person you were keen on for over two years.
That's enough!
I'm not interested in your theories.
That's fine.
Can I go?
- I've got something to do.
- Of course.
You can both go.
Bring the other one in.
What's his name?
George Corot.
They called you as well?
Now I understand why my roses no longer affect you.
George Corot!
I've got to see you.
See you at my place at five.
Julie, at last!
I'm really tired Neil...
Let me speak to your husband now then we'll go away.
Away from this city, from everything.
No, George, not now.
Maybe when they've found Carroll's murderer.
It was foolish to meet today.
I could be watched.
You've told me there's already someone who knows... but do you realise that it should have been you instead of Carroll?
So what?
You can't hide forever.
Does living mean so little to you?
I don't know, George.
If you weren't around I'd almost be happy to end it all.
Please, someone could see us.
I'll take you home.
I'd rather you didn't.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Neil!
Neil!
Julie!
The elevator was always busy so I had to take the stairs.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Julie... where have you been?
What happened?
There was someone in the garage who attacked me with a razor
Was it Jean?
Did you see him?
Was it him?
I don't know.
He was dressed in black, it was dark...
I don't know!
Don't be influenced by the stories in the papers.
Besides, we'll soon know if it was Jean.
Neil!
What do you want to do?
Lets call the police.
Where does he live?
There's only one thing to do with people like that.
You mustn't take any risks for me.
You're my wife now, and that's all that matters.
Tell me where he is.
I'll go with you.
Alright, come with me.
Wait for me here.
Neil!
I told you to stay in the car!
No, I'm coming with you.
There's no light.
Nobody's there lets go.
There's a camera on the ground over there...
A photo's been taken.
Julie!
Julie, calm down Julie!
Neil
Jean's car has gone!
Julie, wake up Julie!
I've developed that photo.
Look!
Do you recognise him?
It's the man in the garage.
Yes, it's him!
Who is he?
Don't know.
He was dressed like that, with those glasses.
Now we know it wasn't Jean.
Which means... he could be the murderer of the women and Carroll?
I mean I suspected Jean because he was your lover.
Obviously there's someone else.
Oh, Neil!
Where are you going?
I'm scared.
I'm going to the police.
This photo could be useful to the inspector.
Hello?
George, is that you?
Why did you take so long to call me?
I'll tell you when I see you.
Come and get me, I can't carry on.
Come and get me, and we'll leave.
We'll go to some quiet place as far away as possible.
Anywhere.
Okay.
Give me time to pack a case and I'll be with you.
I'll take you to Spain.
I know a little place that'll make you forget everything.
FOR NEILI.
When did sheleave?
Just before noon.
Bye, dear.
I'll call you when I get back from Sydney.
Okay.
Bye!
Hello?
Hi, how are you?
No, I'm sorry.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I'll be back in a week.
Then I'll get the A122 to Tokyo.
No.
I'm not tired.
You don't sleep with the time zone changes.
The light's gone out... it'll come back on.
Alright!
Yes, I'll bring you a souvenir.
Will a kangaroo do?
Why, what do you want?
I promise we'll meet again when I get back.
Bye!
No!
Help!
Help!
Has something happened?
No, no.
Nothing.
Why did you run away?
I wanted to get some sun.
Carry on going after your prey if you want.
I've seen one who's more attractive.
VIENNESE HOMICIDAL MANIAC DEAD
George!
Yes?
Look, they've found the maniac.
He was killed by the girl he was attacking.
So it's all over, for good.
Lets think about us.
Tm hung"!
-
I'll go on to the villa to prepare some food while you go and change some money.
We've almost run out.
You take my car and I'll get a taxi.
Bye.
Bye!
- Take them.
- Thanks.
These are for you.
For me?
!
Yes, that gentleman gave them to me...
He was there just now.
He must have left.
George.
George.
What's going on?
What's wrong?
Do you feel sick, madam?
No!
Madam...
Julie!
Julie.
Julie answer me.
It's George.
Julie, what happened?
Julie!
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes?
- Where can I find a doctor?
- Down there, at the pharmacy.
Thanks.
This will make you sleep for a few hours.
What's wrong with her?
She's in shock, it's a powerful emotion.
When I left her down in the village she was fine.
Well something must have happened maybe she got a fright.
Know what you can do?
I'll give you a number!
Here it is.
Doctor Arbe.
He's my friend, a good neurologist.
Barcelona's not far- by car you'd be there in half an hour.
Thank you.
Can I leave her here while I go down into the village to call?
Don't worry.
She'll sleep peacefully until this evening.
- I'll come with you.
- Not necessary.
I know the way.
No, it's impossible.
I've still got two appointments and I don't have a car.
I can come tomorrow.
Please, doctor.
I'll pick you up.
Alright, in an hour.
Thank you, doctor, thank you.
- How much?
- 80 pesetas.
George...
George!
George!
So I brought her here hoping she'd feel better far away from it all.
Then...
I don't know what happened today.
You mentioned blood earlier.
She didn't say anything to me but I understood something straight away.
She was with that man I told you about for a while.
He dominated her.
Blood definitely has a strange effect on her it both attracts and repels her.
Listen it would be better not to tell her I'm a doctor.
It'll be easier.
Julie!
It's smells of gas!
Quick, in the kitchen!
The door's locked.
Help me!
Julie...
Turn the gas off and try not to breathe!
Open the window!
Lets take her there.
No pulse any more.
Go call, quickly, get them to send an equipped ambulance.
- Is there any hope?
- I told you to go and call the hospital.
Get on with it!
Inspector
Doctor Arbe is here
Very well, you can go.
Mr Wardh, this is Doctor?
He did everything to try and save your wife but it was already too late.
And I'm telling you it isn't suicide.
My wife was scared of dying.
The room was locked and sealed from the inside!
It wouldn't have happened if she'd been with me.
Anyway, this man's guilty.
I want to go now.
Of course, Mr Wardh.
The funeral?
The body needs to be available to the authorities for a few days then you can send someone to collect it.
George!
You're late.
The money now!
It's too hot for me here.
A plane is leaving for Rio!
I don't want to miss it.
Who are you scared of?
Nobody's expecting you to be in Vienna, and nobody saw you here.
If the police discover one day that the maniac didn't kill Carroll your alibi would still be valid.
Like yours, and you're the only one with a motive.
Even if some cop unveils our tricks... you're out of it.
Your passport says you're called John McDonald, and Julie never met you.
But you've got a cast iron alibi too.
If they don't get me you're fine.
They won't get you.
Julie Wardh committed suicide.
The money, now!
Okay.
Now you really are dead.
A first-rate suicide for love.
Have they paid up?
Not yet.
They want the death certificate, it's a matter of clays.
I spoke to New York.
Hope I can manage to keep the creditors sweet and avoid bankruptcy.
And you?
No problems.
Carroll's death means I'm the sole heir.
We've got to be careful.
If someone sees us together...
Why?
We're husband and lover united in memories.
There's no risk.
And there never was.
I told you, didn't I?
The best time to eliminate someone is when the police are hunting a homicidal maniac.
We can help each other.
You eliminate the cousin and I eliminate the wife.
They're blaming it all on him... even though that idiot was caught before we finished the job.
The suicide idea worked perfectly.
Talking of which, our black suits?
I burned them.
They are completely destroyed.
There's no evidence any more.
Maybe it would be better to throw these gloves out.
I burnt mine.
Why?
They're almost new.
Did you like my line at the police station?
"Anyway, this man's guilty!"
And how did poor old Jean take it?
Like a kick in the guts!
He was so stupid he still didn't believe he'd had it.
And if the Spanish police find him?
They'll found the motive for Mr McDonald's suicide.
It's crucial that the insurance doesn't suspect anything or they'll drag it out forever.
What do you think they could suspect?
Your wife dies well after she'd left you, and you were miles away.
And it was a clear-cut case of suicide.
Julie!
That woman!
It's her, I'm sure!
What are you talking about?
I only saw her briefly... it was her, Julie!
If you're already hallucinating we'll end up badly.
No, it was her
I clearly saw her.
Lets go back.
You're crazy.
There was just a resemblance.
...no!
- I've never heard of the dead hitch-hiking.
Alright just a resemblance.
So why not?
Lets go have a look.
We are screwed!
Careful!
It's over, Julie.
Call and get them to send a breakdown truck
if our police doctor hadn't noticed that Carroll Baxter had been killed in a different manner than the vicitms of the serial killer.
I would have never reopened this investigation
And there would have been three more criminals.
I'm sorry, but I had no other way to unmask them.
In thinking you were dead they felt safe and they betrayed themselves.
But most of the credit goes to Dr Arbe's who saved you.
I'm leaving you in good hands.
You saved my life but I feel dead all the same.
You'll be able to forget everything.
Time is the best healer, Julie.
Good luck!
"The very fact that the commandment says "do not kill"
makes us aware and convinced that we are descended from an unbroken chain of generations of assassins for whom the love of murder was in their blood, as it is perhaps in ours too"
Welcome!
- Hello!
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Hi Neil!
How's it going Neil?
You've forgotten your old friends since living in New York.
Obviously I'd like to come home more often.
No Julie?
Yes, especially if Wall Street were here.
But I don't have time to play the tourist.
Talking of which, the meeting with Muller is set for eight.
Seems he's willing to buy that lot of stocks which you told me about yesterday.
I'm sorry dear, but I don't have time to go home with you.
You know, it's very important.
I'll call you a taxi.
Don't worry, I can get one myself.
Excuse me if we steal your husband just a few metres into Austria.
I'm not a boring wife.
The extremely important things first.
Kramorstrasse 25.
What's going on?
Good evening.
- Documents, please.
- Here, take it.
I'm sorry, madam.
It's just a formality.
What's this about?
A woman was killed half an hour ago, near the airport.
Another woman killed?
Yes, and razor-slashed again.
You can go.
This story is becoming an obsession with the publicity in the papers and on tv about that crazy maniac.
Yes, they mentioned it in the States too.
They should bring back the death penalty, they should do it!
Then those people would meet the end they deserve.
130 schillings.
- Please keep the change.
- Thank you.
- Welcome back Mrs Wardh.
- Antonio, it's you.
A pleasure to see you again, madam.
Everything's in order with the apartment.
Has anyone come in within the last few minutes?
No, madam.
Were you expecting someone?
The maid comes tomorrow.
I'll take care of the bags.
Thank you.
- Mrs Wardh?
- Yes?
For you.
The porter asked me to deliver the luggage.
Leave them here.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
The worst part of you is the best thing you have and will always be mine.
Jean.
Yes I understand, Neil.
At least try to pick me up not too late though.
No!
I'm not angry even though Carroll calls me 'Widow Wardh'.
You've only stayed with me one night in the three days we've been here.
Come quickly, alright?
Bye.
Julie, you can finally stop whining about the old man.
Look what I've brought you:
it's fantastic news fresh from Australia.
You wouldn't believe it.
George!
Tell him something about uncle.
To be honest, I was fond of old uncle.
Uncle croaked in the end and left a nice nest-egg for me and him.
We're the sole heirs.
You're family?
Yes.
At least that's the way it is for the notary in Sydney.
Uncle's dead without a will and the young lady and I are the sole heirs.
What should I say?
Condolences or congratulations?
Just say: pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.
Very good.
Shall we drink something to celebrate?
- Our meeting?
- No, to uncle's death.
Without which I'd never have met you.
Oh, right.
Julie, please don't cheat the most handsome cousin I have, alright?
A Martini rosso for me.
- Are your clothes really made of paper?
- Underneath as well?
They're real, you innocent.
- What would you say about having a look?
- Lets give them a tug.
It's true, they're made of paper.
Carroll!
Why didn't you say Jean was here as well?
He really pestered me about when you'd be back.
I told him to leave you alone but he came anyway.
Why does it matter to you?
- I'm going.
- Why, Julie?
- Because I am.
- Julie!
Wait.
- Leave me alone.
- I'll take you home in my car.
No, go away.
Why?
Nothing brings us closer than having a vice in common.
I'm out of it, and now you make me sick.
Leave me alone!
Julie!
No, please.
Let him go.
You don't know Jean.
He likes hurting people.
What's up?
A terrible nightmare but it's over so don't worry.
Julie tell me the truth.
What's wrong?
Is it that man?
- Bye.
- Bye!
Next time don't wear paper, come in your birthday suit.
- Funny!
Goodbye.
- ...
Bye!
Goodbye!
Wait a minute!
Give it to me.
No parking zone, obstructing traffic.
You'll pay now?
No, for god's sake, we collect them.
Thanks.
Here it is.
There are more than a thousand policemen in this town!
I want all their autographs!
It's not that easy, you know.
You're completely mad!
Why?
Seem strange to you?
I once went to bed with someone who collected
ladies underwear.
I realised he only wanted to be with me to steal my knickers.
Hey!
Give me the paper, will you?
- Here.
- Take it.
Thanks.
Let me have a look.
Another woman murdered.
We should be grateful to this maniac for eliminating our competition.
They always write the same stuff and I don't read it, but if I don't buy a paper I miss it.
How I envy you, Carroll you're always so relaxed and cheerful.
No Julie you just take the best wherever you find it.
A little here, a little there and avoid thinking the worst.
I married Neil to finish with Jean.
Neil seemed so wise and calm.
But now I'm not so sure.
Neil's your husband, dear.
You can't expect to have everything from one man.
Carroll!
Please...
The fact that you put someone between you and Jean is already really important
Yes I know, but maybe
I've got to escape from myself.
Jean would never accept not seeing me again because he can't stand losing.
Excuse me, madam.
There's a gentleman waiting for you
I put him in the living room.
I don't want to see anyone.
He asked for your husband.
I told him he was out but he wanted to wait to speak to you.
Come on!
Who are you scared of?
If it's Jean we'll throw him out.
Come on, it'll be fun for me
Hello.
Look who it is, the handsome cousin.
My husband's not at home.
I'm sorry, Julie.
But Carroll told me your husband is an expert in money problems.
I'd like to get his advice.
Yes, I see.
But I'm sorry, my husband's not here.
I'm glad, really...
To be honest it was just an excuse to see you again.
One definitely can't deny your quality of sincerity.
We interrupted our celebratory drink so I don't want to miss the chance to get to know you as well as I can.
Listen, my handsome cousin.
Given the time, if you want to court her
I recommend continuing over a steak.
Mr...
Call me George.
Don't worry you'll get a chance to speak to my husband alright?
Yes but it's you who should be worrying.
I like bothering women even when their husbands are around.
Shall we go, Julie?
In any case thanks, handsome cousin, for the lunch invitation.
For god's sake, I'd never invite anyone to Birri's.
They serve mustard which swells your tongue.
Why did you treat him like that?
Because I wanted to!
People who are too sure of themselves get on my nerves.
If I were you, I'd do it cousin or not.
Lets go and eat.
I am truly sorry, Miss Baxter.
I had three tables left but a gentleman has just booked them.
So we'll have to starve.
Why?
The mustard's excellent here doesn't burn the tongue at all.
Want some?
What a shame it's full.
But it isn't, I've booked three tables.
We can choose:
here, here, or down there.
- Did I make a mistake?
- If it's that important to you.
Yes, it is.
I was worried I'd have to give up my mustard.
Well, cancel the other two tables.
- Here alright?
- No, the other one's better.
The usual for me.
What Carroll's having is fine for me.
So, that's three of what Carroll's having.
This way you'll occasionally think of me when eating an apple.
The forbidden fruit.
For you I'll do nothing at all!
You've got it all wrong, dear.
It's always been Eve who should offer the apple.
Excuse me, Miss Baxter.
You're wanted on the telephone.
I'll be right back.
Maybe Carroll's right.
What's this?
Does it mean you want to eat me?
No it means I've already eaten you.
You'll discover I'm hard to digest.
I'm sorry, but I've got to rush off.
In any case you're happier alone with your apples.
Oh, Carroll!
I'll phone you.
Bye!
I can take you wherever you want.
To a taxi, thank you.
So you're used to having your own way, aren't you?
You've finally got it.
Where are we going?
!
It's a surprise.
Take me home at once!
Later, Julie, later!
- I told you to take me...
- Relax.
I'm just going to make you feel ecstasy and fear!
Take me home now!
Ecstasy, fear and a pounding heart!
I kept my promises, didn't I?
I'll say you did!
I think I should apologise.
I judged you wrongly.
No, no!
You were right about me.
But it's hard to resist so much.
Thanks anyway... it's been a nice afternoon.
I really needed it.
Bye!
Hello?
Julie?
Would you be amazed if I told you I loved you?
Oh please, George, don't be ridiculous.
Some words aren't used any more.
I thanked you for the nice afternoon and that's it.
I couldn't possibly want anything else from you.
Please leave me alone.
George?
!
Don't be offended but I don't want to see you again because today...
because I like you.
You mustn't phone me again.
Never again.
Alright, Julie.
I won't phone again if that's what you want.
How did you get in?
!
By the door, it was open.
Why are you...
I wanted to tell you again, Julie:
I really like you and I'm not used to hiding my intentions.
George I beg you don't complicate my life.
Don't you understand?
!
I'm not the woman you met today.
I know nothing about you, nor do I want to.
For me you're fine as you are.
Come on, lets go into my place.
No, not now.
Let me go.
If you want if you want.
I'll take you home.
What's wrong?
I'm scared!
Scared ofwhat?
!
Take me away, George.
- Where?
- Wherever you want!
It's not a palace, is it?
But it's good enough for me.
I practically only come here to sleep.
They are for Mrs Wardh.
Thank you.
I know you're trying to escape me...
but your vice is a room locked from the inside and only I have the key.
Who's the admirer?
!
Anonymous.
I'd like to think it was you, but...they don't deal in these items on the stock exchange, do they?
Julie, what's the matter?
Nothing
You've been treating me as if I'd done something wrong.
If you feel uncared for or you need something we should talk.
No, I don't need anything.
Hello?
Mrs Julie Wardh?
Yes.
Who is it?
I have had occasion to see that you are a delightful
Iover with very interesting perversions which I'm sure go unsuspected even by your honest husband.
Isn't that true?
Stop talking nonsense.
Who is this?
That's not important, where as I think you should know what I want, Mrs Wardh.
I want twenty thousand schillings to not tell your husband about your affection for George Corot.
It's Jean.
It's you, I know it!
It's Jean isn't it?
!
Mrs Wardh, I will expect you at sunset at the
South entrance to Palmenhaus.
Remember:
alone, and with twenty thousand schillings.
But...
I didn't know what to do.
When I saw that black car I was scared it would be Jean, and that's why I went into George's.
Naturally.
You wanted to go to bed with him and your fear of Jean gave you the excuse.
Please, Carroll.
Well, maybe it was as you said.
Anyway there's still the problem of the phone call.
It was Jean?
Who knows?
Have you watched the tv?
They talked about that maniac.
The last of his victims was that stupid bitch who stripped at the party...
Could it be Jean?
He's got a black car too.
Carroll please stop it.
I was joking.
He goes to prostitutes, and Jean doesn't.
What was his voice like on the phone?
Well...
I've already told you.
It was a disguised, unrecognisable voice.
Which means if he'd spoken with his normal voice you'd have recognized him.
It must be Jean.
He's the type.
I'm sorry but I don't see the problem.
If you like
George you can forget about both Jean and Neil.
So what if Neil finds out?
I think he's a modern, intelligent man.
Everything's simple for you.
While I don't know what George is for me,
I know what I was for him.
I wanted to call him this morning but I don't even have his number, and I haven't heard from him.
And I don't want Neil to find out this way.
He really doesn't deserve it.
Listen, dear, don't have too many scruples.
If you want his number I'll give it to you.
Neil's had you in his bed for a year.
Don't you think that's enough to make up for the heartache?
When you talk like that I want to slap you.
But what do you expect?
It's the way of the world.
Don't even bother about it,
I keep them in the oven because I hate cold underwear.
In any case you mustn't go to that appointment.
Where did he say?
At the Palmenhaus in Shembrun at sunset alone and with twenty thousand schillings.
I'll go.
You?
No it could be dangerous.
And I don't want you involved anymore.
Don't worry
I'll enjoy it.
And you'll see it's definitely Jean and then I'll laugh in his face.
But if it's not Jean.
If it's someone else?
Who?
Maybe the sadist in the papers?
Then that means I'm in grave danger because I am a bit of a whore.
You joke about everything.
Had breakfast yet?
Well come on... there's a bar downstairs which will make you forget all about diets.
Come on, and stop making that face!
There's the start!
The competitors immediately engage in a fight and it's number 36 first, followed by number 122.
...at the third bend, the final battle is about to begin.
We're closing!
We're closing at sunset!
We're closing!
Excuse me
I had an appointment at the South entrance to the Palmenhaus but I've lost my bearings.
Over there but if you don't hurry you'll be locked inside.
They're about to close the gates now, so be quick.
- Thank you.
- Good evening.
Help!
Help!
No!
What's going on?
!
-Who was screaming!
?
-There...
Look over there!
Can you tell us anything?
No, I didn't see anything.
I just heard that poor girl shouting.
She'd asked me where the Palmenhaus South entrance was.
She had an appointment.
I don't know anything else.
These little animals are my only friends, inspector.
Much less repugnant than certain people I know.
Listen... it's been said that you've been
Carroll Baxter's friend for a long time.
It's very important for us to know everything there is to know about her and the people she associated with.
Please follow me to the police station
I need to continue to interrogate you.
Don't worry, I'm used to being around cages.
So... shall we go?
Lets go.
Is all this really necessary?
So, madam... is this the man you spoke to us about?
Yes.
Why do you think he's the killer we're looking for?
You flatter me Julie.
Do you really think I'm capable of cutting a lot of women's throats?
Yes, you could be.
And though it might seem silly, he has a black car
like the one described in the papers.
You're incredibly amusing.
But it was you who sent me those notes.
What notes?
The lady and I were joined in an "intimate" friendship.
That's why I sent her flowers along with my thoughts, hoping she'd remember the good times, and perhaps decide on a nostalgic encounter.
I hate you.
The only thing I can't stand is indifference.
Hate is a good feeling, it's fiery and violent
like love, only more so.
Mrs Wardh, you received a threatening phone call and that Carroll went to the appointment in your place thinking that you were dealing with your friend...
Was it that man's voice on the phone?
It was disguised, it could have been anyone.
But Carroll told me it must have been Jean.
A stranger wouldn't have had to mask the voice.
Yes... but he was in a bowling alley on the other side of town while someone was cutting your friend's throat.
That's the way it is, I'm afraid.
Listen... why don't you check Mrs Wardh's alibi?
You're a dirty coward.
You see, Mrs Wardh doesn't have a black car, but she's always had a weakness for blood.
Nobody's said the murderer you're looking for is a man.
You're a person you were keen on for over two years.
That's enough!
I'm not interested in your theories.
Fine.
Can I go?
- I've got something to do.
- Of course.
You can both go.
Bring the other one in.
What's his name?
George Corot.
They called you as well?
Now I understand why my roses no longer affect you.
George Corot!
I've got to see you.
See you at my place at five.
Julie, at last!
I'm really tired Neil...
Let me speak to your husband now then we'll go away.
Away from this city, from everything.
No, George, not now.
Maybe when they've found Carroll's murderer.
It was foolish to meet today.
I could be being watched.
You've told me there's already someone who knows... but do you realise that it should have been you instead of Carroll?
So what?
You can't hide forever.
Does living mean so little to you?
I don't know, George.
If you weren't around I'd almost be happy to end it all.
Please, they can see us here!
I'll take you home.
I'd rather you didn't.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Neil!
Neil!
Julie!
The elevator was always busy so I had to take the stairs.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Julie... where have you been?
What happened?
Someone in the garage tried to kill me with a razor.
Was it Jean?
Did you see him?
Was it him?
I don't know.
He was dressed in black, it was dark...
I don't know!
Don't be influenced by the stories in the papers.
Besides, we'll soon know if it was Jean.
Neil!
What do you want to do?
Lets call the police.
Where does he live?
There's only one thing to do with people like that.
You mustn't take any risks for me.
You're my wife now, and that's all that matters.
Tell me where he is.
I'll go with you.
Alright, come with me.
Wait for me here.
Neil!
I told you to stay in the car!
No, I'm coming with you.
There are no lights on.
Nobody's there
Iets go.
There's a camera on the ground over there... a photo's been taken.
Julie!
Julie, relax Julie!
Neil
Jean's car has gone!
Adam and Eve lost paradise because they wanted to know too much.
Julie, wake up Julie!
I've developed that photo.
Look!
Recognise him?
It's the man in the garage.
Yes, it's him!
Who?
Don't know.
He was dressed
like that, with those glasses.
Now we know it wasn't Jean.
Which means... he could be the murderer of the women and Carroll?
I mean I suspected Jean because he was your lover.
Obviously there's someone else.
Oh, Neil!
Where are you going?
I'm scared.
I'm going to the police.
This photo could be useful to the inspector.
Hello?
George, is that you?
Why did you take so long to call me?
I'll tell you when I see you.
Come and get me, I can't carry on.
Come and get me, and we'll leave.
We'll go to some quiet place as far away as possible.
Anywhere.
Okay.
Give me time to pack a case and I'll be with you.
I'll take you to Spain.
I know a little place that'll make you forget everything.
for Neil.
When did she leave?
Just before noon.
Bye, dear.
I'll call you when I get back from Sydney.
Okay.
Bye!
Hello?
Hello.
How are you?
No, I'm sorry.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I'll be back in a week.
Then I'll get the A122 to Tokyo.
No.
I'm not tired.
You don't sleep with the time zone changes.
The light's gone out... it'll come back on.
Alright!
Yes, I'll bring you a souvenir.
Will a kangaroo do?
Why, what do you want?
I promise we'll meet again when I get back.
Bye!
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Has something happened?
No, no.
Nothing.
Why did you run away?
I wanted to get some sun.
Carry on thinking about your prey if you want.
I've seen one who's more attractive.
Viennese homicidal maniac dead.
Viennese homicidal maniac dead.
George!
Yes?
Look, they've found the maniac.
He was killed by the girl he was attacking.
So it's all over, for good.
So it's all over, for good.
Lets think about us.
I'm hungry.
I'll go on to the villa to prepare some food while you go and change some money.
We've almost run out.
You take my car and I'll get a taxi.
Bye!
Bye!
Bye.
- Take them.
- Thanks.
These are for you.
For me?
!
Yes, that gentleman gave them to me... he was there just now.
he was there just now.
He must have left.
Since the living don't give flowers to the dead, the dead give them to the living.
Jean.
George.
George.
What's going on?
What's wrong?
Do you feel sick, madam?
What's wrong?
Do you feel sick, madam?
No, no!
Madam...
Julie!
Julie.
Julie answer me.
It's George.
Julie, what happened?
Julie!
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes?
- Where can I find a doctor?
- Down there, at the pharmacy.
Thanks.
This will make you sleep for a few hours.
What's wrong with her?
She's in shock, it's a powerful emotion.
She's in shock, it's a powerful emotion.
When I left her down in the village she was fine.
Well something happened maybe she got a fright.
Know what you can do?
I'll give you a number!
Here it is.
Here it is.
Doctor Arbe.
He's my friend, a good neurologist.
Barcelona's not far - by car you'd be there in half an hour.
Thank you.
Can I leave her here while I go down into the village to call?
Don't worry.
She'll sleep peacefully until this evening.
- I'll come with you.
- Not necessary.
I know the road.
- I'll come with you.
- Not necessary.
I know the road.
No, it's impossible.
I've still got two appointments and I don't have a car.
Tomorrow.
and I don't have a car.
Tomorrow.
Please, doctor.
I'll pick you up.
Alright, in an hour.
Thank you, doctor, thank you.
- How much?
- 80 pesetas.
George...
George!
George!
So I brought her here hoping she'd feel better far away from it all.
Then...
I don't know what happened today.
You mentioned blood earlier.
She didn't say anything to me but I understood something straight away.
She was with that man I told you about for a while.
He dominated her.
Blood definitely has a strange effect on her
Blood definitely has a strange effect on her it both attracts and repels her.
Listen it would be better not to tell her I'm a doctor.
It'll be easier.
Julie!
There's a smell of gas.
Quick, in the kitchen!
The door's locked.
Help me!
Julie...
Turn the gas off and try not to breathe!
Open the window!
Lets take her there.
No pulse any more.
Call to quickly send an equipped ambulance.
- Is there any hope?
- I told you to go and call the hospital.
Get on with it!
Inspector
Doctor Arbe is here
Very well, you can go.
Mr Wardh, this is Doctor Arbe.
He did everything to try and save your wife but it was already too late.
And I'm telling you it isn't suicide.
My wife was scared of dying.
The room was locked and sealed from the inside!
It wouldn't have happened if she'd been with me.
Anyway, this man's guilty.
I want to go now.
Of course, Mr Wardh.
The funeral?
The body needs to be available to the authorities for a few days then you can send someone to collect it.
George!
You're late.
I'll pay now.
It's too hot for me here.
A plane is leaving for Rio!
I don't want to miss it.
Who are you scared of?
Nobody's expecting you to be in Vienna, and nobody saw you here.
If the police discover one day that the maniac didn't kill Carroll your alibi's already been checked out.
Like yours, and you're the only one with a motive.
Even if some cop unveils our tricks... you're out of it.
Your passport says you're called John McDonald, and Julie never met you.
But you've got a cast iron alibi too.
If they don't get me you're fine.
They won't get you.
Julie Wardh committed suicide.
The money, now!
Okay.
Now you really are dead.
A first-rate suicide for love.
Have they paid up?
Not yet.
They want the death certificate, it's a matter of days.
I spoke to New York.
Hope I can manage to keep the creditors sweet and avoid bankruptcy.
And you?
No problems.
Carroll's death means I'm the sole heir.
We've got to be careful.
If someone sees us together...
Why?
We're husband and lover united in memories.
There's no risk.
And there never was.
I told you, didn't I?
The best time to eliminate someone is when the police are hunting a homicidal maniac.
We can help each other.
You eliminate the cousin and I eliminate the wife.
They're blaming it all on him... even though that idiot was caught before we finished the job.
The suicide idea worked perfectly.
Talking of which, our black suits?
Burned completely destroyed.
There's no evidence any more.
Maybe it would be better to throw these gloves out.
I burnt mine.
Why?
They're almost new.
Did you like my line at the police station?
"Anyway, this man's guilty!"
And how did poor old Jean take it?
Like a kick in the guts!
He was so stupid he still didn't believe he'd had it.
And if the Spanish police find him?
They'll find the motive for Mr McDonald's suicide.
It's crucial that the insurance claim is above suspicion or they'll drag it out forever.
What do you think they could suspect?
Your wife dies well after she'd left you, and you were miles away.
And it was a clear-cut case of suicide.
Julie!
That woman!
It's her, I'm sure!
What are you talking about?
I only saw her briefly... it was her, Julie!
If you're starting to hallucinate already we'll end up badly.
No, it was her
I clearly saw her.
Lets go back.
You're crazy.
There was just a resemblance.
- ... no!
- I've never heard of the dead hitch-hiking.
Alright just a resemblance.
So what?
Lets have a look.
We're shafted!
Careful!
It's over, Julie.
Call and get them to send a breakdown crane
I'd never have reopened this investigation if our doctor hadn't told us about the different technique used by Carroll Baxter's murderer.
And there would have been three more criminals.
I'm sorry, but I had no other way to unmask them.
In thinking you were dead they felt safe and they betrayed themselves.
But most of the credit goes to Dr Arbe, who saved you.
I'm leaving you in good hands.
You saved my life but I feel dead anyway.
You'll be able to forget everything.
Time is the best healer, Julie.
Good luck!
Who are you?
Mr. Binford, don't you recognize your own descriptions?
I'm Hannibal Heyes and he's Kid Curry.
And we don't rob banks anymore.
And when we were robbing banks, we didn't kill people.
Now you've put us into terrible trouble, Mr. Binford.
We were trying our best to get an amnesty and you tore it all apart.
And we wanted that amnesty real bad.
NARRA TOR:
Hannibal Heyes and Kid Curry, the two most successful outlaws in the history of the West.
And in all the trains and banks they robbed, they never shot anyone.
This made our two Iatter-day Robin Hoods very popular with everyone but the railroads and the banks.
CURRY:
There's one thing we gotta get, Heyes.
HEYES.' What's that?
CURRY:
Out of this business.
LOM:
The governor can't come flat out and give you amnesty now.
First, you gotta prove you deserve it.
Ah, so all we have to do is just stay out of trouble till the governor figures we deserve amnesty.
But in the meantime, we'll still be wanted.
LOM:
Well, that's true.
Till then, only you, me and the governor will know about it.
It'II be our secret.
CURRY:
I sure wish the governor would let a few more people in on our secret.
NARRATOR:
Alias Smith and Jones, starring Pete Duel and Ben Murphy.
BINFORD:
You can't be serious!
CHARLIE:
Over $80,000 is missing.
Now, that is serious.
You think I'd steal money from my own bank.
Well, it may be your bank, Mr. Binford, but it's the depositors' money.
Well, then we'll have a complete audit ofthe books and ifthere are any withdrawals unaccounted for, we can...
Mr. Binford, that money must be returned immediately.
You really are serious.
You're accusing me of stealing.
I'm afraid so.
It's nothing against you, Mr. Binford.
I even look up to you for some things, but speculating with other people's money is not one ofthem.
Those people trusted us with their money.
Don't that mean anything to you?
Mr. Binford, ifthat money is not returned to the safe Monday morning,
I shall be forced to telegraph the State Bank Examiner.
You know, Charlie, you're right.
I did take that money and I was wrong.
It must be returned as soon as possible.
(GROANS)
You're an honest man, Charlie, and that's what the world needs more of.
But not right at this moment.
SOAPY:
Smith and Jones?
They mentioned the Gentlemen's Jockey Club and a young lady named Grace.
Grace Turner?
Yes, sir.
HEYES:
Soapy!
Well, well, well.
How are you?
How are you?
And the Kid.
Soapy.
Come in, come in.
What a pleasure.
This house!
I thought I'd seen the last of you two.
Gentlemen.
Thank you.
Boys, I got brandy here that's older than both of you and this calls for the best.
You know, we didn't come just to visit, Soapy.
We're here to ask a favor.
I just did you a favor.
Yeah, I know, I know, but this time we're in real trouble.
Don't tell me I have to go back to work again.
I told you last month, I'm a gentleman in retirement.
Look around.
And I'm gonna stay that way.
What's your problem?
Well, it's nothing you have to work at, Soapy.
Good, but I didn't really mean that.
After all, if it wasn't for you two,
I'd be spending my old age in a Nevada penitentiary.
Mmm.
What can I do for you that isn't too expensive or too dangerous?
Well, it's about our amnesty deal again.
Don't tell me the governor welshed on you?
No.
But he will if we don't straighten this out.
"Outlaws Hannibal Heyes and Kid Curry rob Kingsburg Bank.
"Bank manager killed.
Bank president injured."
I can see how the governor might have a twinge of doubt about you.
Did you do it?
You know we didn't do it.
Well, look how he describes us.
He's got those descriptions straight off a wanted poster.
He's even got the mark on my neck on the wrong side like the posters.
Look how who describes you?
"Authorities had high praise for bank president, August Binford,
"who was extremely accurate in his descriptions
"ofthe assailants despite his own considerable injuries."
I've never met a banker yet I could trust.
Hmm.
What's he got against you two?
We finally figured that out.
We think.
We figured he faked the robbery.
Else, why the descriptions?
That's gonna be a wee bit hard to prove.
Isn't it?
Mmm-hmm.
That's where you come in.
We've gotta get Binford so deep into trouble he'II do anything to get out.
Even admit he lied about Heyes and Curry.
We want you to teach us one of your swindles, Soapy.
Boys, you're joking?
That's like asking da Vinci to teach you how to paint.
And anyway, all my cons have been imitated to death.
Run to the ground by a lot of second-raters with no imagination oftheir own.
And you can't con a banker.
He's got his own game going and that makes him naturally suspicious of everyone else.
But you gotta help us, Soapy.
There's no other way to get at a man like that.
Sorry, Kid.
Marks are a special breed and a banker is never a mark.
Don't you understand, Soapy?
We're not just talking about losing our chances for amnesty.
A man was killed in that robbery.
Unless we can get Binford to admit he didn't see us, we're wanted for murder.
Well, I'II give it some thought, boys, but I'm afraid I can't help.
Meantime, you're both gonna have dinner with me right here.
Wait a minute.
Maybe I can help.
Thank you.
My cashier tells me you want to rent a lockbox.
Yes, sir.
That's right.
He also tells me you're reluctant to comply with bank rules about that rental.
If reluctant means we're not gonna tell you what we're putting in that Iockbox, yes, sir, then we're reluctant.
Well, that's too bad. 'Cause we have to know what we're responsible for and that's all there is to it.
Good day, gentlemen.
If we were to tell you what we're gonna put in that box, it wouldn't have to go no further, would it?
Well, I could make a confidential rental record, yes.
HEYES:
You know what those are?
Rocks.
Diamonds, that's what they are.
Never saw diamonds like those before.
HEYES:
That's 'cause you never seen them fresh out of the ground before.
Is that so?
Where'd you get them?
You gotta know that, too, before you rent us the lockbox?
No, of course not.
Just curious, that's all.
Well, are you gonna rent us that box or not?
Yes, certainly, certainly.
Oh, there's one other thing.
We've been out prospecting for quite a while.
We're a little short of cash.
Seeing as how this is a bank and all, could you Ioan us $100?
Just so you know, nice hotel room, some clean clothes, a few decent meals.
Well, that's a Iot of money to be handing out.
You got any security?
Security?
Those diamonds we're putting in your bank are worth a quarter of a million dollars.
Quarter of a million?
Give or take a few thousand.
And ifthat's not good enough for you,
I got a horse and a saddle that's worth a hundred.
Well, let's just say I'm a good judge of human nature and I figure you two boys are good for a hundred.
If you don't mind, we'd Iike a receipt for those.
Yes, of course.
But not for a quarter of a million.
Just say, "For 10 little stones that sparkle and glitter a lot."
CURRY:
Well, he hasn't disappointed us yet.
Betsy!
Betsy!
You could knock sometimes.
I couldn't wait.
I've just hit on the biggest thing that's ever happened to us!
Another hot mining stock?
Oh, I've missed a fewtimes, but...
But this is really it!
It's all we've ever dreamed of.
Look!
Look!
Look!
What is it?
It's our ticket to Europe, that's what it is!
Didn't I promise you everything would work out?
You promised me a lot ofthings, but here I am still stuck out in the middle of nowhere.
But look!
What is that?
A raw, uncut diamond.
Dug right out ofthe ground!
Is it, really?
Ijust took these down to the jewelry shop and Fred, when he looked through that glass of his, his eyes just bugged right out of his head.
Evening, Mr. Binford.
Well, good evening, gentlemen.
Lovely evening, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Have a cigar?
No, thank you.
Oh, yes!
I've been thinking about you boys and of my responsibility to you as your banker.
Now, we don't recall hiring you as our banker.
Then, allow me to volunteer.
This world is full of scoundrels, my boys, who'd think nothing of taking advantage of honest men like yourselves.
But, with August Binford as your financial advisor,
I assure you, they'll find very slim pickings indeed.
Well, I know you volunteered, but I don't hear us accepting.
We're not sure you're a man we can trust.
You took our stones down to the jeweler's and had them evaluated.
After you gave us your word you weren't gonna say anything to anybody.
Well, yes, but there was a very good reason for that.
You see, I had to have an evaluation made ofthose stones in order to decide on a course of action to properly utilize your assets.
What'd he have to say?
He said they were real diamonds of the very highest quality.
The man's a credit to his profession.
Of course, ifthere were more like these, this could be even bigger than you gentlemen realize.
You know those stones you got in your safe?
It took us less than a week to find those.
A few more days out and we'd have come back with twice as many.
You mean you just picked them up offthe ground?
Well, now, we did have to dig down a couple of inches for some ofthem.
Gentlemen, if we market this properly, there could be millions in it for you!
I don't think it would do any harm to listen to what he has to say.
You won't be sorry, I assure you.
Shall we go somewhere where we can talk privately.
You're right, Mr. Binford, this is a Iittle better for talking.
I thought you'd appreciate it, being men ofthe world.
Is there anything else I can get you?
No, thank you, my dear.
I think we're quite comfortable.
And I know you men ofthe world understand that whatever relationship we enter into will be strictly financial.
Oh, we understand.
Yes.
You heard Mr. Binford, didn't you?
Yes, I guess I did.
Good.
As long as we know the situation.
HEYES:
We do, we do.
Now, if you gentlemen have really discovered a diamond field, and it will take an expert opinion on that one,
no one man can really afford to pay you what it's worth.
The thing to do is incorporate.
Sell stock to the public.
We don't know anything about stock.
We just know about prospecting.
Do I understand you'd rather sell out completely?
Yeah.
Well, I'm not a rich man, but I think I could afford to let you have
$20,000, hard cash, once I check out that field.
That's real brotherly of you, but we had a higher price in mind.
Well, I might go a little higher.
How much were you thinking about?
$100,000 for me.
And $100,000 for me.
Two hundred thousand?
No, that's impossible.
Well, no, it wouldn't be, though, after you got that corporation you're talking about started and sold some ofthat stock, would it?
I don't know.
I suppose not.
AII right, heck, we could wait for the $200,000.
We don't need that right off.
You could see the field and start selling your stock and...
Oh, we'd need some good faith money first, though.
Well, I could let you have a few thousand while we're working things out.
Well, we had more in mind.
$25,000.
Apiece.
$50,000!
Nobody has that kind of money lying around!
Not even bankers!
Mr. Binford, we are talking about diamonds.
A whole diamond field!
Now, we have just made the richest strike we're ever gonna make and we're not gonna deal with pikers on it.
AII right.
AII right.
But you won't get a penny until I inspect that diamond field and have the area surveyed by a mining engineer.
We figured that.
And I'II have to have those stones evaluated.
You already did that.
I'm talking about an expert opinion from the best there is.
You're gonna have to let me send those stones to T.F. Ayers Co. in New York.
You don't have any objections, do you?
No!
No.
HEYES:
T.F. Ayers Co.
Real good.
Yeah.
Best in the world.
Ifthey're worth what you say they are, we've got a deal.
Sure is a pretty girl, isn't it?
HEYES:
Too pretty for Binford.
Just what Iwas thinking.
It'Il be at least a week before Binford gets an answer back from New York.
Sure would be nice spending some ofthat time with her.
Nice and dangerous,
Binford wouldn't like that.
If he knew about it.
You could keep it nice and quiet, couldn't you?
Well, now, you know, you usually save something like that for yourself.
How come you're being so good to me?
I'm just thinking about what's best for us.
I saw the way she looked at you.
You could almost hear the violins.
I did hear violins.
Yeah?
Something like that could work for us.
See, she'II know when that telegram comes in, as soon as it gets here.
And she'II also know whether it's good news or bad news.
Sure would be nice having her on our side.
You know, Heyes, you're right.
It's time I pitched in and helped.
Good morning, ma'am.
I wonder if I might walk along with you.
VVhy?
Well, it's such a beautiful day and all, and I can't think of anyone else I'd rather walk with.
I can.
Well, now, maybe if wejust walk a little while and we talk a little bit, you might get to like it.
I don't think so.
Well, now, that's a real puzzle, ma'am, 'cause last night I got the distinct impression you kind of liked me.
Well, whatever gave you that idea?
I was just being pleasant.
I'm always pleasant to my fiancé's business associates.
Fiancé?
That is correct.
Mr. Binford and I are going to be married.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
You sure that was violins we heard?
I said it'd be nice romancing her.
I didn't say it'd be easy.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Binford?
No, it couldn't be.
Why not?
Because he's home with his wife.
Evening.
I hope you don't mind me calling on you unexpected like this.
Well, I'm afraid I do.
What do you think you're doing here?
You get out of here right this minute.
What I'm doing is trying to help you, Betsy.
VVhy?
Well, maybe sometime you can help me.
No, I meant what makes you think I need any help?
Well, for one thing, you're not too careful, because if I know you've got a man hiding in here, maybe somebody else does, too.
What do you want here?
Oh, just to have a little talk in private.
Well, you've got about 10 seconds to get out of here.
Well, now, I know how you feel, but you see, Betsy and I really do have something to talk over, and I was just hoping that you'd kind of see your way clear to come calling another night.
You want some advice, friend?
You'll head back through that door and forget you ever saw anyone in here.
Well, that's pretty good advice.
I hope you don't mind if I don't follow it.
Ben, I think you better go.
Yeah, I think I'd better go, too.
You think you'll be all right?
I'II be all right.
Now, what is it that we have to talk about that's so all-fired important?
You and me.
Well, that's a short conversation.
You know, we could do a lot of good for each other, Betsy.
Binford tell you about the deal we're in with him?
He mentioned it.
Well, then you know it involves a lot of money.
Millions of dollars.
Millions of dollars.
Everybody's always talking about millions and when it gets right down to it, it's $8.20.
Well, this time there really is millions.
But my friend and I need some help from you.
Why should I help you?
Because, Betsy dear, we're gonna make it worth your while.
You see, we don't understand too much about high finance and we think your friend Binford's going to try to chump us.
Now, what we need is somebody that knows every move Binford's gonna make.
We need you and we're willing to pay for the service.
No sale.
You got the wrong idea finding another man in here.
Augie and I are still gonna be married.
Soon as he gets enough money to divorce his wife, we're going to Europe and I'm gonna be Mrs. August Binford.
Wouldn't you rather make that trip a free woman?
If you had money enough?
What's enough?
$10,000.
What could I possibly do for you that's worth $10,000?
You can keep Binford from chumping us.
You see, if he plays it straight, in about a week or so, we're gonna have $50,000 and then, when the deal is set, we're each gonna have $100,000 more.
Now, with that money, we're gonna go to Europe or South America somewhere and live a mighty fine life.
And if you play your cards right, you can come along, too, with $10,000 in your own little old bank account.
Now, don't you even want to think about that?
Well, I guess I could think about it.
Oh, Mr. Binford.
Good morning, Thaddeus, Joshua.
I sent for you because we've just received a telegram from T.F. Ayers Co. in New York.
They've evaluated those stones and they're sending them back by rail.
Come in.
What kind of an evaluation did they make?
You boys exaggerated a bit, but they're diamonds, of course.
Not top grade, but still diamonds.
However, I'm still gambler enough to go through with that deal we talked about, provided there is a diamond field and I see it with my own eyes.
There is and you will.
Gentlemen, this is Oliver Bristow, the best mining engineer between here and Virginia City.
I believe in experts.
T.F. Ayers certified those stones were diamonds.
Now, Bristow here is going to determine whether you have a field or not.
Is it a bort diamond field or a carbonado?
That's right.
When would you Iike to leave, Mr. Binford?
Well, whenever you're ready.
Do you mind ifl bring Betsy along?
I don't like to leave her here alone in town.
No, sure, why not?
Good.
Then, let's start out first thing in the morning.
Tell me something, Heyes.
Have you given any thought to what we're gonna do when that mining engineer finds out we salted that field with diamonds?
No.
We're just gonna have to hope he doesn't.
We'll have to gamble on that.
I don't mind gambling, it's the stakes I don't like, our necks.
Yeah.
Hold it.
What are we stopping for?
You're going to go the rest ofthe way blindfolded.
Blindfolded?
What are you talking about?
Faith, Mr. Binford.
Faith.
Before we left town, we found out, once again, that we can't trust you.
You lied to us again, Mr. Binford.
That's twice now.
It's not too hard to find out what's inside a telegram, especially if the telegrapher is underpaid and unhappy.
T.F. Ayers Company didn't say those stones were okay.
They said they were diamonds ofthe highest quality, worth over $100,000.
AII right, so I didn't put all my cards on the table, that doesn't mean you can't trust me.
Now I've made a deal with you and I'm ready to go through with my part, as soon as I see that field.
Well, you'll see the diamond field, all right, but you're not gonna see how to get there until we've got our first $50,000.
AII right, we'll do it your way.
AII right, folks, welcome to our diamond field.
It could be carbonado.
That kind of a field might Iookjust something like this.
Aren't you gonna look around?
I can see what I want to see a lot better from up here.
Hey, I think I've found one!
You did!
BINFORD:
Is it possible, Iying just under the surface like that?
Yes, sir.
That's the way they're found in Africa, sometimes laying right on the surface.
I found one!
(EXCLAIMS)
I wonder where Binford got his expert from?
Oh, he's an expert.
Gold mines, silver, probably even tungsten and copper.
Trouble is, this is the first time he's ever come face to face with a genuine salted diamond field.
Oh!
I found one.
I found one!
I found another one!
BETSY:
I found another one!
...fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen.
Nineteen.
Nineteen.
What happened...
I thought we planted 21?
What do you expect from a banker?
We'll show them where to find the other two before we break camp tomorrow.
Didn't I tell you it was gonna be like this?
They're beautiful, absolutely beautiful!
Now, gentlemen, I think we should conclude our business.
$50,000.
Yes, $5o,ooo.
Now, that's an awful lot of money.
Are you sure you don't want to leave it here for safekeeping?
We've got a safe place to keep it, thank you.
Here's the claim and there's where we found it.
Now I have this contract drawn up, turning over this claim to my Corporation.
You both have to sign it to make it legal.
And after we sell the stock, you'll get the rest of your money.
Mr. Binford, I would Iike to say that it's a real pleasure doing business with you.
You know something, Kid?
We sure picked a fine time to go straight, didn't we?
Heyes, you're reading my mind again, it makes me nervous.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Well, Binford just paid us the money.
$50,000.
Yes, I know.
I thought you and your friend would be out tearing up the town spending it by now.
No, there's a couple ofthings we'd Iike to know first.
Like where Binford got the money.
Oh, what difference does that make?
It makes a big difference.
Where'd he get it?
You know, I have a hunch he embezzled it from his own bank, but I got to know that for sure.
I thought you were joining our side, Betsy.
Well, now, I didn't say that.
I said I'd think about it, and I have thought about it, and I've decided I'm staying with August.
That's a bad decision.
Is it?
Now that you all have signed those papers,
Augie is looking pretty good to me again.
Lot better than a piddling $10,000.
You know, he might trade you for nothing if he finds out about your cowboy friend.
Well, what do you care anyway, where he got the money?
He'Il keep his deal with you, the whole $100,000.
If you don't tell me where he got that $50,000, there isn't gonna be any deal.
I mean that.
Oh, you know where he got it, out of his own bank!
Anyway, it'Il all be put back in a few weeks and nobody'II be the wiser.
There, are you satisfied?
Yes, Betsy.
I'm satisfied.
Aren't they beautiful?
Engraved and printed in three different colors.
American Diamond Company, Incorporated.
Oh, by the way, these just came back from T.F. Ayers in New York.
I'm afraid we have bad news for you, Mr. Binford, real bad news.
You've been had.
There is no diamond field.
What are you talking about?
We were there ourselves with an expert.
We picked up diamonds with our own hands.
Diamonds we planted there for you to pick up.
Oh, and about your expert, don't take him with you next time you go shopping for a diamond field.
Are you out of your mind?
Those diamonds alone are worth four times what I paid you.
These diamonds are worth exactly $25,000.
But myjeweler here in town and T.F. Ayers in New York says different.
Friend of ours once told us there was no one in this country who could evaluate rough, unpolished diamonds.
And bless him, he was right.
Now see here.
Ifthis is a confidence game, why are you telling me this?
Because we know how you got that money you gave us.
And we're gonna give it all back to you, make you an honest man again.
VVhy?
Because you're going to the sheriff and you're going to tell him your conscience is bothering you.
Those two men who robbed your bank and killed your manager?
You're going to tell the sheriff you got their descriptions all wrong.
What for?
Never mind what for, just get used to the idea 'cause you're gonna do it.
I can't do that!
Sure you can.
I can't!
The sheriff would get suspicious.
He might even think I had something to do with that robbery.
No, you tell him all about your conscience.
Or that you got scared that people might think you robbed your own bank, so you lied a little.
Now you want to straighten the record out.
You can give a new description.
Tell him one ofthe men was five feet tall and the other one weighed 300 pounds.
Who knows, he might even believe you.
I don't understand all this.
Who are you?
Mr. Binford, don't you recognize your own descriptions?
I'm Hannibal Heyes and he's Kid Curry.
And we don't rob banks anymore.
And when we were robbing banks, we didn't kill people.
Now you've put us into terrible trouble, Mr. Binford.
We were trying our best to get an amnesty and you tore it all apart.
And we wanted that amnesty real bad.
Yeah.
So, now you're gonna go to the sheriff and you can tell him any story you like, so long as it's real strong about not being Hannibal Heyes and Kid Curry who robbed your bank.
And then we'll bring back your money.
You'll do that?
That's right.
Yeah.
As long as we see a story in the local newspaper telling them that you've changed your mind about your descriptions, you'll get your money back.
That is, you'll get your depositors' money back.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Have you got a choice?
You don't get that story right, we're just gonna up and disappear, money and all, leaving you to face 20 years in prison.
Well, if it isn't my old friends, Smith and Jones!
Lom Trevors!
This is a...
A surprise?
Yeah, a big one.
What brings you to Kingsburg?
You two.
Heard about that bank robbery, came down to investigate on my own.
Just going in to see this Binford fella.
That's real nice of you, Lom, but things are gonna straighten out all by themselves.
Real soon.
Yeah, how?
You'll read about it in the local newspaper tomorrow morning.
Big story, completely clearing us.
Yeah, well, if you fellas don't mind,
I'd rather not wait till tomorrow, all right?
Look, Lom, it's a real long story, but if you got the time, we'll tell it to you.
You boys will have my undivided attention.
CURRY:
Who's there?
It's Betsy.
Let me in!
Just a moment.
Have you seen this paper?
Yep.
You two had something to do with it, didn't you?
What, us?
There is something all wrong here and it's driving me crazy trying to figure it out.
First, you forced me to tell you that Augie embezzled that money from the bank and now out of nowhere, he up and does something like this.
VVhy?
Why don't you ask your friend Binford?
I can't!
He's home with his wife, as if he's afraid to come near me!
And you forced him into this, didn't you?
Betsy, I'm afraid I've got bad news for you.
Your friend Binford isn't gonna make millions on that diamond field.
That's 'cause there isn't any diamond field.
Why, you're aliar!
I was there, remember?
No, that was just a piece of meadow salted with uncut stones that we borrowed from a nice, rich old friend.
So, I'm afraid that Binford just isn't gonna be able to take you to Europe.
You mean it was a fraud?
From the very beginning?
But why?
If it was only the money you were after, you two would have left town the minute you got your hands on that $50,000!
Oh, now you're right there, Betsy.
Well, then, I don't under...
I think you just got it.
You mean, you're...
Kid Curry.
And your friend...
Hannibal Heyes.
(SIGHS)
Well, you see, when your friend Binford tried to tack that murder charge onto our records, we decided we had to do something about that.
You know, there's a lot of people that are gonna still think it was you two that killed the bank manager.
Yeah, I know.
But we've done all we can.
Well, what ifthere was something more?
Something I could do?
Like what?
Well, you once promised me $10,000.
If I could clear you completely, would you keep your promise?
Well, now that sounds like a pretty fair price, if you can really do it.
Well, I can.
The night ofthe bank robbery, Augie came to my place after midnight, which is something he never does.
And he wanted a drink.
At first he wouldn't tell me what was wrong, and his hand shook so bad, he could hardly hold his drink.
He got a little drunk, and he broke down and he started to cry.
Then he told me what happened.
His bank manager found out that he was using the depositors' money to speculate on mining stocks.
So, Augie killed him.
And he staged the bank robbery to cover it up.
Don't you think that that's a bargain for $10,000?
Betsy, that's a steal.
That's more than I expected.
There's only one trouble.
We don't have any money to give you.
Augie gave you $50,000, I know!
Yeah, but we don't have it.
We turned it over to a friend of ours.
Lom.
CURRY:
Did you hear it all?
Every word.
Oh, I'm Sheriff Lom Trevors, ma'am.
I'm gonna need you later to make a statement.
Keep an eye on her while I pay a call on Mr. Binford.
I'm not gonna make any statement for you!
Or for anyone else!
AII right.
I doubt if we'll need a statement from you, anyway.
Ma'am.
Betsy, what do you think was in that carpetbag?
Who are you?
He told you.
I'm Hannibal Heyes and he's Kid Curry.
Oh, no, you're not!
If you were Hannibal Heyes and you were Kid Curry, you would not turn $50,000 over to a sheriff.
We should have known you were too smart to fool.
He's Hotchkiss and I'm Rembacker, agents ofthe United States Treasury Department.
And we've been on this case right from the start, night and day.
But we're telling you this in confidence.
It's a government secret and you must never, never repeat it.
Do you understand?
SOAPY: "August Binford today confessed to the murder on March 7th last
"of Charles Wells, his bank manager.
"Binford stated that conscience alone led to his confession.
"It is felt that making a clean breast ofthe shocking affair,
"without any pressure, except from his own conscience,
"will probably save him from hanging."
Boys, I either overestimated bankers or underestimated you.
And the girl!
She really believed that story?
(CHUCKLING) You two?
Government agents?
She was so confused by then, she didn't know what to believe.
You won't change your minds, have supper with me?
Sorry, Soapy, we'll miss atrain.
AII right, but keep in touch with me.
I still owe you a few more favors.
And besides, I always enjoy doing them.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Oh.
Thank you, Soapy.
Bye.
Soapy, it's been a pleasure.
Hope to see you soon.
Anytime, boys.
Anytime.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten...
killing another human being... it's easy to say...
I feel like a criminal...
Been thinking for weeks...
And now I've decided to achieve my evil plan...
I feel comfortable and relaxed...
Maybe it will be an anti climax...
But I don't think so...
I can imagine the pleasure and excitement when attacking...
How much force is required to strangle someone?
at night could be better...
I want to feel the trembling body while I'm killing... if the victim escapes...
I have to think how to avoid that... there's no room for mistakes.
Hellen, Hellen!
Happy new year.
-This is Isabel.
Good luck!
-Thanks!
and happy new year.
Happy new year!
-Happy new year!
Bye!
Happy new year.
Sicerely.
You've always liked bad jokes.
Isn't?
Didn't mean to offend.
It was a joke.
You're breaking the agreement.
Or did you forget?
I forget a lot of things while drinking.
It makes life easier.
I have not drunk.
it's a shame.
You should do it from time to time.
Good night, bye, Andrea.
Good night.
Are you going out?
Time to say good bye.
-I'll pick you up for dinner.
-Ok.
Let's go, this place gives me the creeps.
Walter!
Walter!
Telephone...
-I know.
Why don't you answer?
-Because you told me so, remember?
It's the third time they're calling.
You should have wake me up.
-Impossible, you was not in this world.
How long have you been here?
-All night.
I waited for hours, and when you showed up, you wasn't in good conditions.
In fact, I took your clothes off.
You have always liked that.
Not when you're drunk.
Make me a coffe.
-Am I your lover or your wife?
you know... one of these days I'll give up.
-Where will you find a job like this?
Don't worry, I'll do.
Are you fed up with me?
Huh?
If that's true, just tell me and...
happy new year.
Ringing again...
Hello?
-Where have you been?
I'm calling the whole day.
Plugged off the phone...
-You're not at your office, come here immediately!
Happy new year, Mr Bild.
To you too.
Be careful, honey.
Today is not your day.
Last night, at the tunnel.
Now he's at the hsopital.
I sent Vogel.
That's like sending the night guard.
And a yong couple found him?
-Yes, go there and try to get an idea.
Ok.
-What?
, happy new year too.
So?
We've got everything, I was about to call the night edition.
This morning, John Lubbock, a substitute teacher... was victim of a brutal attack while...
It's not quite accurate.
-Why?
John Lubbock is not an english, He's australian.
Second:
LaBrook, as every language school... do not have permanent or substitute teachers...
They always come and go from different parts of the world... like an hotel...
see you at the office.
I'm sorry, visitors are forbidden, even journalists.
Wait a moment.
-Impossible, I'm sorry.
May I help you, Mr Bild?
Good morning, doctor.
No one can see Mr Lubbock... by police orders...
How is he?
His spine is fractured and he's also in shock.
What's up, inspector?
For now... agrression and attempted robbery.
May I talk with the couple that saved him?
No, they are important witness.
I won't publish anything against your investigation.
The girl lives not so far from the tunnel.
Her name is Giulia Swell.
And the boy...?
You know him, is Walter Auer... he has a daughter named Lu, isn't she your friend?
By the way...
maybe we've got to talk with you.
Ok, I was one of the last persons to see Lubbock last night... at your disposal.
Giulia?
-I told everything to the police, ask them instead!
Why not to you?
-Because you're a filthy jounalist.
Can we talk in peace?
No, and go to hell!
Get out or I'll call my father.
Lu!
Dear Andrea, will be out till tuesday.
I had no money, so I took some from the usual place.
Lu.
Yes, you can get laid with whoever you want, it doesn't bothers me.
Who is?
-Andrea Bild, do you remember me?
Ask for your pardon, I was so rude at the party.
You did.
Pardon accepted.
Is your fireplace working?
Here's too cold, I'll get ill.
I'm working.
just a moment, I promise.
I won't bother you.
Tony has grown up.
New chairs, huh?
Also this painting.
I never liked this table.
Nor his face...
I just want Tony to remember he has a father.
And you, a very rich ex husband.
Still can't get divorced, haven't seen him for months.
You wear glasses now.
-Just to work.
Too many changes in one year.
Is bad not to make love, you know?
You're a pain in the ass when you're drunk.
Tell me why are you here, please.
Tony dislikes the way you face spikes.
So?
what can I tell you about John Lubbock?
Everything you know.
Hes from Australia, 26 years old... he's a teaches at the school since october, he's very good by the way...
He's quiet, shy, introvert, he likes concerts...
Oh yes, he plays tennis quite good.
A sport's fan... aren't you supposed to take notes about this?
I have the memory of an elephant.
Are you friends?
-No, just "connocenti" as italians say.
Isn't easy to intimate with John.
Poor man, what a way to start the new year...
First Isabel, and now this.
Isabel Lancia?
-The same one.
Don't want you to write it, but...
I think he went crazy about her.
A juvenile and tragic romance.
And now seems that Isabel will marry Edouard Vermont, his best friend.
John knew it at the party, were bad news.
I didn't noticed that.
-I'm not surprised...
You was drunk.
-Don't care about what you say, Hellen...
I'm not offended.
-Well, John will never show his emotions.
He's very proud.
Yes?
-Bring me water.
The crutches.
Please.
Richard!
sleep with me tonight!
-Not tonight, I'm tired.
Please!
Please.
-Tomorrow.
No!
don't pick up.
I must to.
Yes?
Yes.
Where?
Ok, I'm on my way.
Got to go.
Will be back soon.
Richard!
Come back!
Richard?
Is that you, Richard?
Oh God, where is it?
The telephone!
Where's the telephone?
Richard!
Richard!
Richard!
What's the motive?
-Was she sexually attacked?
What weapon was used?
-Inspector, will you give us a report... or will we get it at the police station?
She was strangled and threw downstairs.
Good morning, inspector.
-Already here, Bild, come with me.
Around 11 o'clock, Bini got a phone call... an urgent one, wich was false.
False?
Whoever that called, gave a fake address.
Who found her?
Dr Bini himself, when he came back... was buttler's free night, so she was alone.
Yes, call Haller, he'll be at home.
Talk through the other line, I'll use this one.
Aren't you Dr Bini's patient too?
Yes, indeed.
Is true that they keep the main door opened by night?
Yes, he left prescriptions there after the clinic was closed.
Did you meet his wife?
-Just a little.
I see...
Who's at Bini's side?
Edouard Vermont, teaches french at school.
Well, acording to your testimony...
John Lubbock said he'd go home walking.
Who else may have listened besides you?
Well, I drank a lot that night...
But if I remember...
I'll give you a ride, don't worry.
No, thanks, Hellen, I'd rather to go walking.
Isabel, are we leaving?
Happy new year.
-Stand by new year's promises.
Bye, Andrea.
No one else?
No, I don't think so.
Oh, yes...
Dr Bini was there too.
Please, understand, just formalities.
What did you do after the party?
Sincerely, I don't remember, I don't have an alibi, if you want to know.
As I told you, I drank a lot.
I wonder if Dr Bini invented the phone call thing.
That's a dangerous theory.
Besides, Dr Bini has an alibi.
He was with a friend at crime's time.
Which friend?
Edouard Vermont.
That young lady, Ms Lu Auer, lives with you?
Not always...
What did you do last night, Mr Bild?
Stayed at home watching TV.
Was the young lady with you?
No.
And I don't have anything else to tell.
I must go back to my office.
Don't you want to know more to write about?
Same as Lubbock's case, right, Inspector?
Exactly the same that was found by Sophia Bini's body.
However, there's a subtle variation.
Misses a finger.
Can be a way to tell us... there's four homicides left.
Listen?
Dr Bini, please?
There's no need for condolences, Sophia was a living corpse for years.
I'm not an hypocrite to pretend I'm affected by her death.
However, I'm glad you want to talk with me...
I'd like to tell your information is right.
I know the kind of stories told by newspapers.
To be honest, I will not interview you.
That's an order.
Cut the crap, what do you want to know?
A simple detail...
What you heard by the phone...
Was the voice of a male or a female?
Sounded pretty distorted.
Plain... without a tone.
like laryngitis affected.
So, you can't say if it was a male or female.
What I know is the killer knew how to enter the house.
After all... the main dor is never locked.
Any suspect?
-No.
Nothing's missing at that house?
-No, nothing.
There's always room for a maniac.
What do you think?
There are no sane killers.
Excuse me, I got to go.
Last question... what address did they give you by phone?
Brussels street.
-Number?
Eleventh.
-Doesn't exist.
I guess you thought you wrote it bad.
Right, but there was impossible to check it out.
So, you decided to visit Edouard Vermont who lives near Brussels street.
You're well informed...
Bye, Mr Bini.
Wow!
-Surprise!
I believed you had found another job.
No, here I am, at my regular job.
Are you sure you aren't here for your settling?
I wanted to see you, sometimes happens, you know?
Where have you been?
Don't make questions and I'll tell no lies.
I was studying at home, I have an history test, didn't tell you?
What's wrong?
I called your home, and your mother told me she hasn't see you in a month!
You liar bitch!
From what sewer do you come?
Your mother don't care about you while your dad is rotting in a state's asylum!
And you are a whore, riding other men sport cars!
A red car?
-Exactly!
That's my brother's car, idiot!
Since you play to be a dectective you see everything wrong!
You make me laugh!
You're pathetic!
What your brother do for a living?
He's a pilot.
Speedcar's pilot, didn't you know?
Where are you going?
Lu?
Lu!
I'll teach you how to play!
Catch me if you can.
You'll see.
Don't run!
You'll be sorry!
Got you!
Do you work for the sports section?
Just want to talk with you.
If you have a moment.
Why?
What do you do when you're not racing?
Is important?
Everything is important for a journalist.
In example, what did you do last tuesday?
Went to a race.
I was second... then... to the usual party.
Why are you asking?
Did you left the party too late?
Till next day, I stayed at some friend's house, if you mind.
Although I don't understand why.
Enough, thanks and good luck.
May I talk to Dr Bini?
Yes.
Richard.
I'm Walter.
Come on in.
I knew sooner or later you'll come to finde me.
I read your last article.
Sometimes journalists are more sharp-eyed than police is.
Altought there was a point I...
Excuse me.
This place gives me the creeps.
Do you care if we go out?
What do you have to tell?
Just like the police, you think I was atteacked just for robbery.
I'm not agree, Andrea.
He tried to kill me like he did with Sophia Bini.
You knew her well, right?
-Not much, I felt bad for her... despite she wasn't a nice person.
I only expect that whoever attacked me, will be happy for he've done to me.
But he can always come to give me the final strike.
Now they play pranks on me by telephone.
They call me at unexpected hours, usually at midnight.
but when I pick up, nobody talks.
Did you tell the police?
Why?
I've tried to change number, but that take a while.
I guess the best defence is disconnect it.
Well, here's my house.
Do you like a drink?
Yes?
Are you Mr Bild?
Yes, who's talking?
Let's say... a friend.
Somebody who don't you to be in troubles.
If I were you, I'd stop making questions.
If you don't, you'll be sorry, Mr Bild.
Tuesday, march 29th...
Now I've tasted my first success...
I can say all my expectations were met...
But I expected more atention... there's a conspiracy of silence from the police and the media... sic transit gloria.
you should know I'm someone to take care about...
I'll strike again.
there's something deep... even divine... being able to transform a human into... dead matter... in a second.
Hey, Andrea!
Will you tell me the horoscope?
Says that your boss is looking for you, and your future isn't too bright...
Do I ask stars for an advice?
Too late.
I'm sorry Andrea, but I have no choice.
I'll have to withdraw you from the case
I don't understand.
Haller called me.
He told me that you...
-I was listed as a suspect.
Not exactly.
Yes?
Everything is in order, they're waiting for you.
-Thanks.
I can't see the reason to withdraw me from such a big case.
If I'm not wrong...
-If I AM not wrong...
I'm the one in charge here.
So, I'll repeat it, you're out of this case!
Do you know they just withdraw me from the case?
Good, I was planning to send you to cover the bankers congress.
You make me sick.
All of you!
Vogel stands this shit, but not me!
I know Dr Bini is a shareholder of this newspaper, and received 250.000 when his wife died.
So what?
don't yell.
You've been always an stupid.
Don't you realize yet, that your crazy ideas don't fit in here?
You're not longer the man you used to be, Bild.
I thought you was worthy, but you started drinking... and will end up at the newspaper's sewers!
Do you think so?
Now, listen!
I may be a piece of shit, but you're what you used to be... a bastard who sold his soul.
I'm warning you, you'll pay!
You're late tonight.
There was a meeting at school.
What's wrong?
I want to talk with somebody.
Bye.
I'm fucked up.
Don't you care?
Let's go to the car.
I bet you argue with Troversi again.
I could kill him.
Are things that bad?
Have you asked... why?
Maybe because that dirty maggot reminds me about my father.
Are you afraid to end up like him?
Isn't that, Andrea?
You can't stand me, right?
Why don't you quit the newspaper?
Once you told me you wanted to be free and travel around the world.
And you was supposed to come with me.
Tony is awake, got to go.
I'll call you.
Traversi!
Oh, God, have mercy... we pray for the soul of your servant... that you have called to your side.
don't deliver his soul to the enemy... so your angels take him to paradise.
may he enjoy in heaven.
We ask you for our Lord Jesus Christ.
Amen.
We have to talk, call me.
-Isabel!
I'd believe in the autopsy, but a glove without two fingers was found,
Where was you last night?
I visited Mrs Volta.
Hour?
About 10:30 I think.
How long were you together?
-About half an hour.
Then I went home to sleep.
Miss Auer wasn't there, if that's what you care about.
We have one attempted murder and two murders.
and in every case, you knew all the victims.
A curious coincidence, don't you think?
Specially if you don't have an alibi for none of them.
I know.
However, we won't set charges against you... for now.
Thanks.
May I ask how you know I argued with Traversi?
We got an anonymous phone call this morning.
Male or female's voice?
Male.
What are you thinking?
About your theory that someone could take advantage from this situation.
Killing a person easily, leaving a glove by the corpse... and use someone else as scape goat.
My theory also works for Traversi's case, right?
Why not?
Who could want to get rid of Traversi?
You had a reason.
Now Traversi is gone, you'll be the editor.
I doubt it, I have crazy ideas and...
I'm a drunk, remember?
No, the one who killed Traversi is the same who called the police.
Someone who knows my problems at job and tries to blame me.
Who know your problems at the office?
The whole building, I yelled a lot that day.
Look who's there, Tony.
-Mom!
Andrea!
Tony!
I've been watching those two guys outside.
Obviously they're cops.
They are my guardian angels.
-I know.
They keeped me at the station the whole morning.
They wanted to know since when I met you, how often I see you, if I knew Traversi...
God, it was boring.
And how was that?
I had fun, I told them a story.
You know?
I hate cops.
Why don't you ask me about my return?
Why?
there's no news about that.
I'll never come back.
-I have listened that before.
Andrea, you're maddening, but this time is real.
I have news, I'm getting married.
Who's the lucky one?
You don't know him.
His name's Frank Reid.
What will Frank say if he know about us?
Nothing.
-Won't he be upset?
He have always knew it, but this will change once married.
we will have kids... we want to.
I won't see you again, Andrea.
Don't be angry?
-Why should I?
I see you don't waste your time.
Some Isabel Lancia called a moment ago.
What did she say?
She's waiting for you at the Great Hotel.
9 O'clock.
I wrote the room number.
Iis your car here?
-yes.
Give me the keys, left the lights on.
-I¡ll give you a ride...
I'm leaving anyway.
Let's go.
We're going through the yard.
Wait, be right back.
Miss Lancia?
Miss Lancia.
That was short.
Stay with me tonight.
For the last time.
"Minister said that the main topic will be the financial crisis..."
"Police were called to a famed local hotel tonight..."
"When Isabel Lancia, daughter of Carl Lancia, famed shipowner..."
"was found dead at her suite's bathroom..."
"According to the police, the body was found by Edouard Vermont..."
"Her fiancee, the couple should have beeen married this year..."
"But made no comments about...".
Which hour did you come back to your home, last night?
Why don't you ask those you have settled at my door?
Miss... was you with him?
Yes, since yesterday's 7 o'clock, inspector.
Why did you help me?
A farewell gift.
Won't you ask if I killed her?
That's your business.
What will you do?
-Pack my bags.
I'm getting nervous.
I said it at school, I'm going back to Sidney.
The one who wrote this, is sure you know him.
However, he sends me an anonymous.
Instead of coming to the point.
Like he did with the others.
Curious, huh?
Keep it, you can give publish it, or give it to the police.
There's an interesting detail...
The envelope had no seal.
They put it directly to the school's mailbox.
When will you leaving?
This week.
Now that Isabel is dead...
I have no reason to stay here.
I understand.
Nothing else matters.
Absolutely nothing.
Bye.
Where's Giuulia?
-Too early for Giulia...
But I can do the same she does.
Maybe other day.
-Get lost!
Anybody here?
Anybody there?
What do you want?
I'll call the police!
Who's gonna call the cops?
I'll denounce you for exploiting and corrupting minors!
And everything else that pops up my mind!
What did you tell the police?
I know nothing!
This may help you to remember!
-You will regret!
Who attacked John Lubbock at the tunnel?
You know it!
I know you saw him!
I don't know!
I don't know!
I swear I'll kill you!
Who did it?
Giulia's father.
The old Swell!
Don't be a smart ass, I can check that!
.
It's true, Giulia told me she will left me if I went to the police.
And you prefer to keep with the girl, huh?
Was like having money in the bank, huh?
And Dr Bini paid you only for your performances?
Answer!
No, not only for that...
Giulia's father...
Was his idea!
You blackmailed him!
Yes.
And to Vermont too.
But Swell had nothing to do with the murders.
He's a dirty old man, but not a killer!
Why so sure?
Because he works for Hoeffer transportations.
Every tuesday he drives a truck to the north and doesn't come back till wednesday night.
Is that a proof?
Dr Bini's wife and Isabel Lancia were killed on tuesday.
And Swell was arrested early on a wednesday.
Does that fit in the truck story you say?
Last tuesday Hoeffer Transportation was on strike.
He didn't leave, he didn't kill Giulia, but he did spy her.
What do you want?
-I'm ready to publish everything...
What I know and what I've seen at other newspapers.
What kind of relationship did you have with Giulia Swell?
Who's Giulia Swell?
The girl murdered last night, You know it!
Wht should I know?
I've never heard about her!
Not even at your private parties?
What are you talking about?
You must be crazy!
Ok, listen...
If you insist publishing that story... good, go ahead...
It will show that I have nothing to fear, nor the police, neither you!
And now, leave!
I have to see my patients.
Mr Vermont?
Is that you Edouard?
We need to talk.
There's no time to loose.
Are you really going to publish this?
Yes, will be out tomorrow.
I thought Dr Bini was a nice man,
Do you think he is the killer, right?
Don't know yet.
Will be your husband there?
No, I'll talk to my lawyer, talking to Charles is a nonsense...
We always argue.
About Tony, I guess.
Acording to the divorce agreement, I can't start to live my own life... until everything is settled.
You're not listening, right?
There's something in common between these murders, but don't know what...
I think Vermont is guilty.
See you tonight.
-At what time you'll be back?
9 O'clock, but today is Tuesday, I may be late.
Horoscope says today is not my day.
I have prefered the police car!
So the picture will be complete!
What do you want now?
Another alibi?
I don't have one!
-I know, Bild.
Listen, inspector, your men have been following me for a while... so, you know perfectly that I have not killed anyone... if you lock me in, I'd have the perfect alibi when the last finger of that glove will be corded.
If you give me some time to clear my mind, I'll give you the murderer.
What can you lose?
There's 4 murders and your investigation remains blocked.
Tell me what you know and let US continue...
Will be faster if I proceed by myself.
I get it, is this that important for you?
Not to you, inspector?
I understand you want to make a career as a cop.
Dr Bini's wife and Isabel Lancia were killed on tuesday.
But today is Tuesday, I may be late.
Horoscope says today is not my day.
Monday, January the 1st, John Lubock, born March 23th..
Brutally attacked.
Mrs Sophia Bini, Dr Bini's wife...
Found strangled to death on Tuesday, February 13th.
National news editor, found dead... by heart attack in a park...
Tuesday, March 29th.
Murder at the Big Hotel...
Isabel Lancia, daughter of a noted shipowner, was found dead this tuesday, April 12th.
Giulia Swell, young prostitute was found slaughtered...
Tuesday, March 7th.
Tuesday is sacred for Mars, God of violence and war... is the best day for those burn under Aries sign.
Aries...
Hello?
-Tony?
Yes, mom.
-What are you doing there?
I was in bed, when will you come home?
Soon, I'll fly in the next plane.
Did you eat?
Yes, watched TV for a while and went to bed.
Go back to bed, dear.
Put Elsa on the phone.
Elsa is not here, she went to pick you up at the airport as you asked her by phone.
Who called?
-I don't know, mom, someone...
Elsa said the dentist called too, about your appointment tomorrow.
Tony...
-Yes mom?
Listen carefully...
Lock every door and window... including the yard ones... and don't open the door, to no one, did you understand?
To no one, Tony.
Why?
Do what I say, Tony, please, dear...
Wait.
Mom, don't forget the Man in Black bookyou promised me.
Darling, Man in Black doesn't exist.
Is not real.
It's just a tale.
Do you hear me?
Have you done everything I told you?
Yes, mom.
-Now go to bed, I'll give you a nice surprise.
Mom!
-Tony!
The lights went off!
I'm scared.
Mom, are you there?
Tony!
Is that you, Elsa?
Where are you...
Elsa?
Mom!
No!
Mom!
Mom, no!
Go with Tony!
Yes...
John Lubbock.
Born March 23th, under Aries sign.
Most auspicious day:
Tuesday.
Every murder happened on Tuesday.
But he was attacked on monday.
If they check the first glove found... the one that gave him his symbol, was property of Giulia's father.
Motivation?
Jealousy.
He was in love, but not with Isabel Lancia... but with Edouard Vermont.
To Lubbock, Isabel was a vamp who seduced... and took away Varmont from him.
So, she had to be punished.
By commiting 5 murders, he thought he could hide the real motivations...
Last night I called Dr Bini... he told me he could have removed his plaster two months ago...
But Lubbock always found excuses to don't do it.
That little boy could be innocent... but I'll save him from this violent and unfair world...
I hope Hellen will understand.
That's the way he did the phone effect.
Let's say I'm a friend who wants you to save problems...
If I were you, I'd be careful...

Here goes!
It fits if it's unbuttoned.
It's a case of your not fitting the pants.

—No.
Today the entrance is free.
And you can go in.
You've got long pants.
I'm not interested.

Very well.

Ready...
Smile. and for Your infinite goodness and mercy. —Amen.

Who said that?
Sister Aurora.
And she said that we're going to be put to work?
it's a benefit for the poor kids.
That's very good; we do have to help out the needy.
and support us.
do you know whether Paloma is going to be working in the show?
and I'm a shepherdess.
Are you sure?
Yes.

About eight minutes or so.

Are you coming?
What for?
What are you doing?
no one can see you there.
Yesterday we spent the afternoon playing doctor and we got purps [erections].
Was Paloma there?
No.
Heads up; they're coming!
Aiieee!
I'm glad.
I hope you die!
Then I'd get to play St. Joseph's part.
He's dead!
Yeaahhh!
We won!
We win.

Hello!
Goodbye!
Byyye!

Cristina!
What?
Tell her!
Yes.
I didn't tell.
Paloma.
What?
he's asking if he can talk to you.
What do you say?
Fine.
It has to be alone.
Neither of us is going anywhere to eat.
Not as if it's Raphael.
Goodbye!
allow me.
Fine.
I'm out of here.
Bye.
—Hello Arturo.
—Hello Paloma.
Well then.
What did you want?
I don't know; nothing really.
—Then I'll be going.
—Wait.
Can I go with you?
Sure.
It's just that tomorrow is my birthday.
congratulations.
but it's not yet.
It's tomorrow.
How old are you?
Fifteen.
Aren't you adding some on?
No.
It's just that I'm blond and I look younger.
I'm thirteen.
That young!
but with time...
I know.
My father spent three years with my mother and...
And what?
Nothing; he spent three years with my mother.
Your friends are silly!
Leave them be.
What else did you want?
Should we go out dancing tomorrow?
Just the two of us?
Obviously!
Are you afraid?
no...
And where should we go?
To a club.
And will they let us in?
dude.
We're older.
I'll be tipping the doorman.
All right.
right?
All right then.
Bye.
Goodbye.
I love you with all the strength of my being!
pretty much.
I love you!
I love you!
butthead!
So you're going all in with Paloma!
And what do you care?
You've got more questions than the FBI!
Is she your girlfriend?
I don't know yet.
God willing.
So that you can get married and all?
you nincompoop; why else?
I'm fifteen years old already.
Arturo!
When the worms are born I'm going to give away the best pair of worms I've got!
What'll you have?
Paloma?
Some soda.
I...
A whiskey for me.
Got it.
Do you like whiskey?
Sure!
Don't you?
No.
Have you ever tried it?
on Christmas Eve; it tastes like bedbugs.
Heh; that's what my mom says.
Thank you.
It's just that it went to the other place.
it's really good.
You like this?
The song?
everything.
isn't there?
Must be the tobacco.
And it's very dark.
Why is it so dark?
I don't know.
They won't let us have any more light.
What's going on?
With me?
Nothing.
Getting bored?
Who?
Me?
Obviously.
No.
Why?
I don't know.
You seem kind of strange to me.
Paloma.
Want to dance?
Just the two of us?
Of course.
yes.
How silly of me!
You know what?
I dance really badly.
Doesn't matter.
Arturo?
You're crying.
Are you sad?
no.
I'm quite all right with you.
I don't know what's wrong.
Who art in Heaven...
Pssst!
Hssst!
Pass it on.
please.
No talking.
Arturo and Paloma are already Lovers.
please come here a moment.
What do you want?
I wanted to tell you—
Attention!
We are ready to begin the general rehearsal.
I love you.

Here once again comes the nincompoop with the little hand!
to adore the Child that is born.
alleluia!
Hosanna in the highest.
The Messiah is born!
get your hand off my girlfriend and put it behind her where I tell you.
and recite your script; that's your duty.
You're gonna get one so hard in that lettuce-head of yours when I get back down there that you'll be cross-eyed!
All right already.
Where is Arturo?
He's on his way; just washing his hands.
turn on the television.
Dad.
What's wrong with that eye?
Nothing; a punch.
I can see that.
But I'm asking you who gave you that.
It's 'cause he got dropped.
You be quiet.
Dad.
Answer my question.
He has been playing soccer.
That's why you've taken the angel's script in the school play.
nincompoop.
It's because I had a falling out with St. Joseph.
I take it?
Why is that?
Things between us.
What sort of things?
Personal.
Personal...
Then take your "personal" soup and go eat your dinner in the kitchen.
And tomorrow you're staying here because you're grounded from the school play.
I know it by heart.
For the script he had—
Don't talk back to your father!
Arturo!
Today is Christmas Eve.
I don't care!
To the kitchen with you!
He's bound to behave better.
all right?
To the kitchen with you!
to adore the Child that has just been born.
alleluia!
Hosanna in the highest!
The Messiah is born!
Long live our Savior!
there.
St. Joseph; this isn't about you.
Arturo.
Hello.
Where are the others?
They went to lunch at Aunt Molly's.
And your father has told me to tell you if you behave yourself all day tomorrow you'll get to go on the school's field trip through the snow.
Father!
Lina...
Lina...
Why weren't you in the play?
Because my father punished me.
And what for?
For the eye.
your father.
he came around rather quickly.
Although it was my mother who interceded with him to allow me on this trip.
Do you like her a lot?
dude!
She's my mother!
Don't you like yours?
No.
Whaaat?
I have no mother.
Is she dead?
No.
—What then?
—She left when I was one year old.
I don't know why that was.
But... where did she go?
I don't know.
My father never talks about her.
I'd want to go back and see her.
I don't know.
It wouldn't be the same for me.
What a crying shame!
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.
Are you going to teach me how to ski?
That's it!
Be careful not to cross your skis!
I'll push.
Ah!
—Aaahhh!
—Careful!
Are you hurt?
Help me.
Um...
Look out; the ski...
It's going!
It's going!
ha!
Found it yet?
I haven't been able to find it.
What can we do?
What are we going to do?
Nothing.
I'm very tired.
And I'm freezing.
Let's go in here.
Rest a while.
what time is it?
Five o'clock.
The bus doesn't leave until seven.
We've got plenty of time.
It sure is nice here!
Isn't it?
Yeah.
What is it?
Are you mad at me?
No.
Did I do something to you?
No.
Do you like the ring?
it's very pretty.
Is it all right?
I guess so.
—Paloma!
—What?
Are we sweethearts?
I don't know.
aren't we?
I suppose.
I'm so happy.
I'm feeling something strange here but very pleasant.
It's like I'm trying to catch my breath.
Don't you feel something like that happening to you?
Yes.
May I give you a kiss?
Whatever you want.
May I give you many more?
Sure.
Your face is so tender.
It's getting cold.
Are you cold?
No.
I'm getting very hot.
I don't know what might happen.
Don't you like my kissing you?
I'm embarrassed.
Why should you be if we're lovers?
but I'm feeling something I don't understand.
Come here.
What is it?
Now you're shaking.
Are you cold?
No.
It's this heaviness I'm feeling here on my chest.
I need to catch my breath too.
Can I... touch you?
I don't know.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
I'm such an opportunist.
No Arturo.
You're very nice.
Don't worry.
I love you very much.
Paloma!
I love you so much.
I've been wanting to marry you for so long... but we're older now.
I don't know what's happening to me.
I'm feeling the same thing happening to me.
But let go of me.
I'm scared.
Arturo.
I'm scared.
Don't be scared.
I love you so much.
I love you so much.
I love you... please.
Let me go!
Please.
Please.
No.
Let me go!
Let me go!
Don't be scared.
Paloma.
Paloma.
I love you.
—I love you.
—I love you too.
please.
Please...
These things you see in this drawing are the stamens.
These are referred to as the male organs of the flower. it has a wider part called an ovary.
Ovary...
Ova...
Ova...
Ova... the flower pollen from the stamens enters the pistil.
Pistil...
Pist... til... til...
Arturo don't... don't... don't...!
I'm scared...
I'm scared scared which is a hollow tube that descends to the ovary.
The ovary... ovary... ...vary... ...vary...
Arturo.
Let me go... ...me go... ...me go... let me go...!
...me go...!
...me go...! and the rest of the flower dries up.
is the fruit.
Spain... grows a lot of fruit.
What is it?
I don't know.
What's on your mind?
Nothing.
isn't it?
Yes.
We did nothing wrong.
I'm not so sure.
It's just...
God did tell us we're to love one another.
but not so much.
We're not just kids.
I know.
Every day I say as much.
Did you tell anyone?
No.
Did you?
Only Mamen.
She's my friend and I tell her everything.
And what did she say?
that what we did is fatal.
I don't believe that.
Do you?
—I don't know!
—Why are you crying?
Paloma.
and 65 come closer to...
Don't cry.
...the dock please.
honey.
We're not going to that do any more.
Will you promise me that?
if that's what you want.
Thank you.
...the picture of the weekend is the trace of a series of tons...
Hello family!
it's Dad.
Dad!
Why didn't you tell us in advance?
I'm only passing through.
Tomorrow I'm going to Bilbao.
Is there anything to eat?
There'll be something.
Mom.
How are you?
How else would I be?
With one foot here and one in the other world... how's she holding up?
As if I'd know;
I don't see hide or hair all day long.
...spilled over into a long stretch of its pathway...
Paloma!
Run me a bath.
Dad.
and airports...
I'm beat.
...and causing heavy losses in farms and farmland.
Houses that have managed to resist this...
Dad.
—Thank you.
...are evacuated...
You're pulling a face.
Is something wrong?
nothing's going on with me.
I'm just a little tired.
...survivors who have fled these places in tents waiting...
Ah!
Ahhh!
reinforcing protective barriers with sandbags along the rivers for fear of flooding the entire population pitched in.
The area where the disaster reached the highest proportions... dear.
Dad.
Good night.
I'm going to bed.
I'm exhausted.
child.
Don't worry.
I'll help your grandmother gather up her things.
Thank you.
Sleep tight.
The precipitate melting and rainfall have resulted in several broken dams.
The extent of the flooding...
The way of youths!
Good for nothing.
Now pay attention.
I'm going to be giving you a problem to solve in the last trimester.
Hang on to your books.
You have half an hour.
What's with you?
I'm not feeling well.
But where does it hurt?
a lot.
Shhh!
No one is to talk during the exam!
Is this about a present you're going to be getting?
I don't know.
He took up with me on the 5th.
It's long overdue.
Today we're on the 20th.
Why don't you go to the doctor?
There won't be anything.
It's not worth the hassle.
Shhh!
Silence!
Seems to me some of you aren't going to be getting any vacation.
It's like the way Mary and Joseph's sister got things started.
And you know what that was?
No.
It was a child.
But I haven't done anything.
What about that snow day?
But it was only that one day.
It's enough.
You think so?
I don't know.
We'll have to find out.
Shhhh!
Young ladies!
They never seem to be able to cease their idle chatter and pay attention to more important things!
Arturo!
Mamen and Paloma want you to make a run to the park on their behalf.
They're waiting for you.
Curro.
I'll be right back.
—Right.
—Be careful.
Yay!
Take it!
—Hello.
—Hello.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Except for one big fat deal.
What is it?
Do you remember the snow day?
Of course I remember.
Why?
Because it may very well be that you're going to be a father.
Whaaat!
?
you heard me.
But how is that possible?
how else?
Just because of that?
duh!
That's how you have kids; the way all kids are had.
Yeah...
So...
How do you know?
We don't know.
But it may well be so.
we can get some medical advice.
they break the news to our parents.
I could tell my sister who's a nurse about it.
What if she's a gossip?
I say this as another girl.
Paloma?
Mamen.
don't worry.
I'll think of something.
Manolo!
Manolo!
He's asleep.
What do you want?
Hey Curro.
You know how we know for sure when people are going to have children?
How?
How do you tell?
Well... by the hype.
too!
And how else?
Just ask Mom.
That's a foolish move.
I asked once and you know what she told me?
—What?
—That they were brought by the storks.
They think we're fools.
You know what a kid in class said?
That they keep them in the belly and fling them out like chickens.
I know how they have them.
What I don't know is how they find out.
Everybody knows.
why don't you ask Dad about it?
all right?
I'll give you 5 smackers on Sunday.
Why do you want to know?
Out of curiosity.
But I have to have the money from you.
—I promise it to you.
—Deal.
dude; they aren't so heavy.
Dad!
Curro?
and what goes where.
This kid is being silly.
he'll already know.
Mom!
I'm not going to be in a generous mood you can go tomorrow morning to make your confessions to Don Emilio.
Dad.
Blast it!
Yet you're sure that this is how you catch frogs!
so shut your trap and start hunting them.
Why would you want a frog anyway?
I don't know; though it'd be good eating.
I'm going to go find out.
produces a mature ovarian follicle within which a cell commonly referred to as an oocyte matures.
And what is that?
they put it to you in the worst way.
But it doesn't say anything here about frogs.
and she put this on the exam.
And why doesn't it say that in the book?
it's in the science program that it says this.
Maybe the "fillicle" or "gonadotropina" it talks about here is a frog.
don't talk gibberish.
we're ready.
Just leave it to me.
I know what I'm doing.
You have to give the frog an injection.
I know that for sure.
It's the Galli Mainini test.
An injection of calcium?
—From pee-pee.
—From pee-pee?
this.
I'm living it up!
I've got him!
I've got a fish on the line!
I've got the frog!
eh?
Yuck!
Ugh!
That's a toad!
—A toad?
—Yes.
Throw it back; it's poisonous.
The toad crap's on me!
Look at that.
Here goes!
Look at that!
kid.
what a puffed-out belly!
don't you?
do you remember everything?
Yes.
and don't forget to ask how much one has to pay.
Arturo!
ha.
—Let's go.
this is for you to inject into a frog on behalf of my mother how much does it cost?
Under whose name do we put it?
—Paloma's.
—Paloma?
Sorry;
I made a mistake.
It's for Mrs. Sánchez Navas.
little boy.
Tell your mother she can pick it up tomorrow.
So how much does it cost?
—150 Pesetas.
—That's pure robbery!
This being a parent costs you an eye from your face.
I'm never going to be a parent.
Shhh!
It's a secret.
eh?
No.
we swear.
he'll kill us.
Especially me.
let's see.
Here goes!
How much?
A total of 115 pesetas.
That's something.
What a shame for all that money!
And to think of all the worms that could buy...
Although the child may well be a lot prettier.
have you?
—Is that enough for the frog?
—Yes. and then go congratulate your parents.
—Why?
—For your new little sibling.
boy or girl?
but on its way.
A stork will be bringing a very nice one hanging from its beak.
yeah.
A stork.
What kind of fool do you take me for?
you nun!
girlie!
Go away!
Here comes Mamen.
Hey.
What's the matter?
that's what.
How so?
But it's all right; it doesn't have to be a misfortune.
I don't know what we can do.
There's nothing for it.
What else are we going to do?
Have the child.
What if they find out?
Nobody has to find out anything.
This is our business; our secret.
we've sworn as much.
isn't it?
I don't know.
That's what they say...
God wanted it that way.
Because everything that happens is because He wants it.
For sure.
Shut your face!
you'll see.
Very well said!
eh?
As you wish.
It'll be for everyone.
Good.
But the first thing we have to do is get it down pat how people go about having children so we won't get anything wrong.
In my house I'm convinced Cuca is going to have puppies someday soon.
She's got that fat belly.
Vulture.
Can't we be there to see it?
Sure; she's on the roof.
Don't all of you get too close.
Out you go!
Out you go!
nincompoop?
It comes out just the way I was saying.
This is making me a little sick.
idiots.
The idiot would be you.
I can look at it as I please.
Then take a hike.
Don't get started with that again.
You're going to scare the mother.
this is a fool's errand.
And you're an idiot.
pipe down.
That's another one coming out.
What a beauty!
It's white.
Poor Cuca.
What a sad face you have.
That's gotta hurt for a while.
Here goes!
Another one.
How barbaric.
I figure as how we'll also be having three or four...
How many do you suppose we'll be having?
As many as God sends us.
Father?
Come forth.
what's going on with you?
Nothing.
So what brings you here?
We want to get married.
All of you?
all.
Father.
The only ones you have to marry are these two.
Arturo and Paloma.
Arturo and Paloma.
You're going with Arturo and Paloma.
Father.
They're fiancés.
So you're the fiancés.
Father.
We wish to be married.
We wish it very much.
you're still very young!
I'm 15 years old.
And Paloma is 13.
and Paloma 13.
Where are you going to go at that age?
but... you don't know.
Any of you care to tell me?
On anyone's behalf.
That's crazy talk.
What you're supposed to do is study and give yourselves over to childish things.
What you have told your parents about this?
They don't know.
You see?
You're too young for that yet.
You're only beginning to live.
You'll have children of your own in time.
How I wish I were your age!
said that in India one can get married at age 12.
I couldn't do it without the consent of your parents.
and you'll see for yourself what I'm telling you.
[i.e. "Don't go expecting life to be a rose garden."]
Don't go believing that the whole mountain is covered in oregano.
Father.
dude!
So what's happening now?
Dad.
What do you want?
I want to talk to you man to man.
What...?
That's what this is about; that I'm a man.
And what's happening.
I want to get married.
You want what again?
To be married.
yes.
You don't say.
Dad.
I have a fiancée and I need you to give me permission to marry.
All I'm going to give you is a swift kick in the rear; that'll make you a real man.
I need to get married.
you ninny.
Hit the books!
That's what you've got to do.
Begone!
You're about to wear out my patience.
dude.
Tickets for India.
—In the counter in the back.
—Thank you.
—Where did he say?
—In the back.
There it is.
lads?
Hey.
What's it take to get to India?
Motivation.
All India has is cows and hunger.
Who wants to go to India?
We do.
But do you have a passport?
No.
So... there's nothing you can do.
kids.
And where's the outlet for that?
The General Directorate of Security.
And it is very expensive trip.
000 pesetas for a round trip.
Pheeew!
This is a nightmare!
you can go to Albacete.
where is that place where they draw up passports?
In the Puerta del Sol.
Where you eat grapes.
So go run and play.
eh?
thank you very much. —Goodbye. —Goodbye.
Let's go get passports.
This is no good.
no good?
It's lacking parental consent.
And why is that a lack?
Because you're underage.
In India you don't need that.
kid.
But we want to go to India.
For that you'd have to have a passport drawn up in India.
there's no way to have a passport drawn up in India.
There you are.
I just have to follow regulations.
obviously...
Then we might see...
I don't know as how I really have to explain anything.
There's no passport!
Get it?
And for this we go spending 35 pesetas on photographs?
unless you want to spend the night in jail.
Beat it!
Go be Indian to somebody else.
Didn't I tell you!
I did say that if the child is born he'll be born a fool.
The one who was born a fool is you.
That's only what happens when cousins marry.
And how long's the birth gonna take?
Ugh!
That's anybody's guess.
Maybe years.
maybe days.
They take 8 or 9 months.
That's what's usual.
And be quiet for once; you never give me any peace to think.
You're all such wet blankets!
WEDDING ON THE HIGH SEAS
How fortunate the big names are!
What makes you say that?
WEDDING ON THE HIGH SEAS
They get married however they like.
Look.
That's it!
What an idea!
Kneel.
it's taking on water and we're going to be lost at sea.
dude. until death do you part?
Certainly.
I want her.
I already said it.
No you haven't.
You said "Certainly.
isn't it?
it means "I'm zoned.
The one who'll be "zoned" will be you.
What's going on here is that Manolo doesn't know how to ask the questions.
What do you wager that you'd manage no better?
What a fiasco!
Do me the favor of not being such an idiot; our time's wasting on this folly.
I want her.
that was easy.
That was easy.
what's going on?
as already noted.
Finish up. until death do you part?
I want him.
There you are.
Take them; the rings.
What a lucky guy!
Lucky dog!
Hooray for the lovers!
Hooray!
—Hooray!
—Hooray for the lovers!
Hooray for the lovers!
I want to skate.
You're acting crazy.
Pay the closest attention to this. and honey.
What a beast!
If I were the mother...
It's not just for me.
It's also for the child.
for the child.
it wouldn't take anything;
just the smell of food makes me sick.
That's normal.
Says so here.
But the child has to have food.
Mamen.
since he doesn't have any teeth or anything?
silly.
Don't you see that the food's already chewed and eaten?
Don't be silly yourself either.
He doesn't eat through the mouth.
Then where?
Through the navel.
and you're a ham!
I'm not hamming up anything.
It says so very clearly here: it goes through a tube from the mother's gut and it's called the union cord.
umbilical.
Here's the list of foods.
let me see.
But... well.
From where do we get so much food?
That's what I'm saying.
No.
That's what I was talking about. and we'll all have it together.
Get the word out to others to help us out.
And if someone blabs?
We'll bind them by oath.
all right.
Listen to this.
usually between 8 and 12 kilos.
Weight gain usually begins in the first month.
I want to skate.
Mamen
That might give him a mark on the face when he's born.
You'll see.
So what?
I want to skate.
Nothing's going to happen to me.
There aren't any rough spots.
as long as you don't let yourself slip; you might give the child a skate-mark on his face. you'll all be responsible.
let's go!
Nothing's going to happen.
Besides the stuff about cravings is a tall tale too.
Be careful!
right?
boy!
This is a very serious matter.
First month: 45 kilos.
Curro.
Take everything you can find.
—Look.
I've got a lot of stuff.
—Keep going; you can still fit some more.
Second month: 48 kilos.
This is progress.
{\fnTimes New Roman\fs48}...and so the time passed
I can't take it anymore.
I can't stand it anymore.
I'm dying from the heat.
If only I could take off my coat.
There's got to be some solution we can find.
The child's got to make it to birth.
And we aren't going to keep hiding him until you've got a mustache.
—Obviously.
—The worst of it is that my father is coming home on Monday.
And it's going to show.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
Arturo?
Hide out.
Why don't you try telling your grandma that you're taking a trip?
And where am I going?
You can tell your grandma that you're going off to do some Social Service.
but where can we hide her?
I've got it.
In the attic of our house.
You're going around the bend.
Your parents will find her there.
They haven't gone up there in all their lives.
and nobody ever goes there.
—Are you sure?
—I'm sure.
in a little old house there up on the roof.
Come over here.
Keep quiet.
Here it is.
Shhh.
Don't make so much noise; they're going to hear.
What a shack!
Paloma?
but I'm a little scared.
Don't be scared.
I live two floors below and I'll always be with you.
but everything is so broken down and dirty.
Don't worry.
Where are you?
I'm going with you.
Wow!
What a mess.
eh?
Mamen?
of course.
Especially when it rains.
So here we go.
Do you think it'll be safe here?
we can come up here to see her whenever we want.
then we've got to have this dump cleaned up so that it'll be ready for when the child is born.
We're all going to work.
everyone.
I think we've made it just about perfect.
What do you think about this detail?
Stupendous.
It really is a very Christian detail.
But it's still lacking one thing.
Don't you know what it is?
We seem to have it all.
What is it?
The most important thing.
I've got it!
The television.
Of course.
Something even more important than that.
what else is missing?
The crib.
How's it going?
Now the initiates are busy with their rosary in there.
You've got 10 minutes.
Plenty of time.
Class is opening.
but make haste.
I'll stay here and keep watch.
Let's go!
—Pray for us.
—Queen of the Apostles.
—Let's go!
—Pray for us.
—Queen of the Martyrs.
—Pray for us.
—Queen of the Confessors.
—Pray for us.
—Queen of the Virgins.
Curro.
—Queen of all the Saints.
—Pray for us.
—Come on!
—Keep a lookout!
—Queen conceived without original sin.
—Pray for us.
Get a move on.
—Queen assumed into Heaven.
—Pray for us.
—Queen of the Holy Rosary.
—Pray for us.
—Move it!
Move it!
—Queen of Peace.
—Pray for us.
And now a Pater Noster for those of this world who don't know where they're headed.
Who art in Heaven...
That there's a beauty!
Hurry.
What's this?
It's up.
—What're you doing there?
—Seeing what you think.
dude.
But is this supposed to be a crib?
You'll see.
all you've gotta do is close the globe.
—And how's the kid supposed to breathe?
—It's stupendous.
We make little holes in it.
and they breathe easily enough.
That's a very good idea.
it's stupendous.
Paloma?
Are you feeling bad?
it's passed now.
There he goes.
But what's happening to Paloma?
She's got the vapors.
Are you ill?
then.
Is she about to give birth the way Cuca did?
Your forehead's burning up and you're sweating.
Arturo.
Do not worry.
There she goes.
Maybe it's that the child is dead.
How can you be dying if you aren't even born yet?
Mamen?
I don't know exactly.
But it must be near the end.
Paloma.
you'd probably do better to give her some encouragement.
You're such a killjoy.
It's just that all the ladies usually go to the clinic to have their children.
Mamen?
figure out what to do here.
That's what the books are for.
but this is a book no one understands.
Then buy yourself another.
We've got no money.
Then steal it.
which of these books...?
this one looks pretty good.
—Let's see.
And this one too.
take it.
Here it goes.
The life of the spirit has to be cared for and cultivated just as much as or even more than the life of the body during pregnancy.
Here is a roster of the most popular devotionals that may be to the mother's benefit while in this blissful state.
The month of March is dedicated to St. Joseph.
June is dedicated to the Sacred Heart. and the first 5 Saturdays to Our Lady the Virgin of Fatima.
Screw this!
That's not where we're going to find a cure.
The clothes worn during pregnancy should be loose without thereby having to detract from good taste such that they are both very elegant and comfortable.
It is also convenient and practical to wear a back brace which makes walking easier and eliminates potential back pain.
This should be the place.
Here's a whole bunch of girdles.
this one or this one?
I don't know;
let's go inside.
this combination works very well.
not bad.
Do you have it in any other color?
I'll go see if I've got another color.
please.
How's this one look?
what do you want?
You tell her.
you.
It's up to you.
But what's the matter?
You're a wuss.
We want a back brace for pregnant women to make walking easier and eliminate potential back pain.
It's for this guy.
Farewell.
Pilona; my sister who's going to have a child was just taken in to the hospital.
that's why I'm telling you.
At the Rosary Clinic.
ma'am.
Thank you.
What was she trying to say?
Who knows.
it's here!
But right now?
The doctor's not currently with her.
Can she be seen?
but you can come with me.
eh?
Got it.
Are you having long and intermittent pains?
but only from time to time.
Give her the pentathol and a ride to the operating room.
doctor.
Mamen?
but you pay attention too and quit scarfing the bon-bons.
We mustn't miss anything.
We've got to get some of that pentathol.
Got it.
Nutrition is carried to the fetus by way of the placenta just as his metabolic waste products are carried out.
little one.
What a beast!
Have you noticed anything yet?
Nothing yet.
what are you doing here?
child.
and...
Have you gotten anything out of this?
No.
I don't understand any of this.
I start to give birth.
And yet my births are by force using forceps.
—You'll be having very large children...
—What'd she say?
I don't think it's that yours are so very large; what's going on is...
A force of... what?
Eh...
Seems to me what she said was "forces.
And what's that?
We'll ask later; you keep taking notes.
Hi.
Hi.
I didn't think you were coming.
It's just that I had to wait until my parents were asleep.
did you?
No.
Give me some room.
Where were you today? comics...
We've made a few quid.
We have to start saving now.
Having a family costs a lot.
Arturo.
And I love you a lot.
Paloma.
right?
dude.
It's the best in the world.
I'm scared that your father might find out.
we'll be going.
Where?
he'd kill me.
How about yours?
I think mine would too.
I don't know where this is going to end up.
Paloma.
What?
Don't you remember your mother at all?
I don't know.
Paloma.
What is it?
never.
To where?
Anywhere at all.
I won't.
You swear it to me?
I swear.
I love you.
It doesn't hurt?
Not much.
Sometimes.
And does he move?
I think I felt him give me a little kick.
Don't tease.
Why?
I don't know.
You might want to leave.
isn't it?
but I like getting these little kicks.
Maybe he's going to be a soccer player and goalkeeper like me.
it's moving now; place your hand there and feel it.
that's right; what a beastie!
Put your ear to her and listen.
There goes that little tyke.
He just gave me another kick again.
It's true.
and 27. 327 in all.
Crap on it.
We don't have enough to get started with this.
We did what we could. and that's not how you have a child.
Let's see.
bring a table... lots and lots of money.
it's Curro.
How fat they are!
Have you got the 40 chips?
here they are.
look at how they eat!
Bring it.
Can I see them one more time?
Sure.
They're so lovely!
—Sissy!
Look...
—Bye.
I think back a lot about you and about Dad.
and this place is lovely.
Santander is the most beautiful place in the world.
Although it does rain a lot.
I have a lot of friends and we keep going to the beach...
Paloma.
look what I brought.
What is it?
It's a little jersey for the child.
I made it myself.
It's lovely.
What's that?
It's a little jersey for the child.
it's no good.
Why?
and has to be blue.
So what if it is pink?
except it'll come off looking queer.
kid.
Don't be the way you usually are; and mind your own business.
Come over here.
Let's see what you've brought.
Arturo gets what's ours.
but it's better than nothing.
What are we going to do?
And what have you got there?
A telephone we bought.
You can hear from it very well.
we ran the line down through the courtyard and into our room and that way we can call Paloma in a pinch.
Ah.
Good job.
A stroke of pure genius.
Now go install it.
take this.
—I'll take the cable.
—Curro!
—Bring it.
Strip it.
Here.
Shouldn't we think of what we're going to name the child?
He'll be called Arturo.
you say!
isn't he?
No sir.
He belongs to everyone.
We're all working on this and we've all got the right.
This is true.
But I'm the father.
I'll rat on you if you start cheating. and then put it in the basin.
I'm sure it won't pick me.
I get rotten luck more often.
Is Florencio the Dracula also entered into the draw?
Everyone.
But he's new.
Yet I've worked as if I were old.
everyone throw in.
Paloma.
This is in case it's a girl.
Paloma.
How fortunate!
Now the drawing is up to Arturo.
Now it draws Arturo.
This game smacks of being rigged.
Dracula.
Yippeee!
That foal is the man!
That's going to be one crappy godfather he's going to have...
This here should be a sure thing.
it's going to cost us an eye from the face.
It's camouflage.
guys.
Just what we're looking for.
Manolo.
—Here goes.
I'll play the man in black.
Paloma?
—Yeah.
Paloma?
isn't it?
Manolo.
who's going to operate?
Us.
All you have to do is pull the kid out.
So much for that device.
And you're the one who understands medicine.
Bah!
because Paloma eats more than a horse.
The child doesn't eat.
How so?
Because it draws from the mother's breast.
Are you sure?
Quite sure.
the poor kid.
It's true.
I've got nothing.
here we go again.
Another problem.
There has to be someone to give him a breast.
Otherwise he might die.
You'll have to think of something.
Maybe I can serve him myself.
The thing doesn't mean anything if the electricity isn't normalized.
doctor.
Please Arturo.
Be careful.
that thing's shot.
We've got to get a face.
Dr. Gannon here's a gift for you.
Have you noticed?
They throw out a lot more stuff than we do.
because that's how some Americans are.
That's right.
And now for the cologne.
NenucoProducts;thefirstpleasureofthe newborn.
man.
Oww.
Ow.
Aiee!
Arturo!
Curro!
Are you awake?
I can't sleep.
What time is it?
2 o'clock and then some.
Not going up yet?
Dad has only just turned out the lights.
You want me to take a peek?
No.
Let's wait a bit.
I'll go look.
Can I go with you?
Sure.
Yes.
What's going on?
Paloma?
Paloma?
Is that Paloma?
I don't know.
No answer.
Something very serious must have happened.
Let's go!
That's what God wants us to do.
My God!
Paloma!
What happened to you?
Call Mamen.
Curro!
Careful!
Go on!
Give me the light and run.
please.
I think he's already on his way.
Paloma?
What's happening?
please.
He's on his way!
Arturo.
He's coming to be born.
—What?
—The child.
But I can't just leave you by yourself.
I'll go call the others.
Don't worry.
Paloma.
he's about to be born.
Go open the gate.
I'll call Mamen.
It had to happen in these hours...
I'm going to go open the gate.
Good.
Is this Mamen?
Are you there?
—Has he been born?
—Shut up!
—Mamen.
It's on its way.
—What do I do?
But who's on his way?
you nincompoop?
The child!
—Is he born yet?
—Shut up!
Goodbye!
Is he born?
but he's going to be born.
Move it.
Paloma?
Ah.
Aie.
Ow.
Aie.
Ow.
Don't cry.
For pity's sake.
—Aie.
—Please.
Have you called up Mamen?
Yeah.
Paloma.
Who's going to be an imbecile?
The child!
Pilona calls.
Who's going to be an imbecile?
The child!
Lolita calls.
Who's going to be an imbecile?
The child!
Dracula calls.
This is very bad.
Arturo has to call a doctor right away.
he has to be called.
—Yeah.
Let's go.
—It's not worth the trouble.
I'm here.
Don't worry.
It's killing her.
Don't worry.
She's dying.
Get it all ready.
We have to get her on the operating table.
help me.
Careful!
Yes.
You take it from here.
Be careful.
Curro.
Don't worry.
You'll see.
Everything will be all right.
It hurts so much.
Careful.
Don't panic.
Take it easy.
You're going to come out of all this quite all right.
You'll see.
Mamen.
careful!
Now heave her up.
That's it.
We have to get her into the bed.
where does it hurt?
Here.
or continuous?
For short periods.
That's because of the contractions.
Have you got the talcum powder ready?
No.
You go prepare the water and all that stuff.
Move it.
Paloma.
Give me the gown.
Get a move on.
don't worry.
Have you had him already?
No.
He hasn't been born yet.
Is he born yet?
No.
Not yet.
Don't worry.
You'll see how nothing's the matter.
Do you see anything?
No.
I don't see anything.
Is he born yet?
No.
How's this thing going?
I don't know.
Want a cigarette?
I'm not into those.
you gotta have a smoke.
I saw that in a movie.
give me one.
Anything new?
You don't see anything.
That stupid broad keeps standing in the way.
I wish that broad would get out of our way.
Have another cigarette; it'll do you good.
What's happening?
Lolita.
How's the mother?
Have you already had it?
No.
We're pulling it out.
Just a little left to go.
Then...
Why are you crying?
I don't know.
But don't worry.
Mamen says everything's all right.
The head's crowning.
But it's being very stubborn?
it seems.
But she's dilated about 3 pesetas or 75 cents.
eh?
don't let anything happen to either of the two.
We've got it out already.
Can we see it?
No.
And is it alive?
I don't know.
Its eyes are closed and very cruddy.
Like Cuca's puppies?
Something like that.
But...
And Paloma?
Paloma is fine.
And the child?
Is it dead?
I don't know.
I told you already.
Don't lean on me so hard.
Can I see it?
No.
Mamen's going to have it cleaned.
So why aren't you crying?
Put your questions to Him.
—Are they going to take us all to...
—Is it dead?
...prison?
Was it a boy or girl?
I didn't notice.
That girl's got to be the stupidest...!
you nincompoop.
hallowed be Your name...
He doesn't move.
He's dead.
Argh.
I don't know what to do now.
Mamen.
Is he alive?
Paloma.
He isn't moving.
How's the child?
What do you want?
Can't you wait?
No.
Let him be.
You all can come in.
Is he alive?
Mamen?
I don't know.
He isn't moving.
He's dead.
he's dead.
He's dead.
He lives.
He's alive!
—He's alive!
—He lives!
—He's alive!
—He's alive!
and nobody else!
Hooray!
Here he goes!
And it's a Florencio.
goes!
Long live Florencio!
and nobody else!

See you Monday.
Bye-bye, Mrs Swales.
Thanks very much.
Bye-bye, love.

Oh, everything's so dirty.
Your shirt's just about done, all frayed around the collar.
Best if I wash everything.
Be more comfortable.
I'll do them in the morning.
'Won't take long to dry if it's a good day.'
(Flies buzzing)
Our James was just growing hairs.
About the same size, you look.
'Better have his shirt.
'Yours nearly fell apart in the wash.
'Not really worth keeping.
'Wear one of James' shirts.
'Much better and warmer.'
All clean and ironed.
James' shirt's nearly new.
Same one as in that picture.
Well, new when he came home.
Ambrose was keen for it.
He's got that many shirts.
He was very poorly.
Hurt in the stomach and legs.
Just before James came home, a plane crashed.
Ambrose got lots of pieces for his hut.
Wheeled the propeller home on his barrow.
"Present for James when he comes home", he said.
Strange how Ambrose seemed to know that James was coming back and so sick.
Oh, but he was glad to be home.
We took lots of photos, like this one of the propeller and James all dressed up in his uniform.
But he got very weak.
He had to stay in bed nearly all the time.
This was his room, but it was different.
Ambrose brought the propeller up here, so James could look at it.
He slept for a long time before Ambrose took him up the hill.
We didn't wake him.
Better not when he was so poorly.
Eh, that fits you just right.
You'll be a lot more comfortable like that.
I found your glasses.
Very like James' glasses, too.
Not very strong.
This side's all broken.
You could maybe wear James' glasses sometimes.
I could show my books.
They're full of pictures and letters.
Took such a long time to make.
Every piece has to be stuck in very carefully not to mark it, mind.
You can't move marks once you've made 'em.
Don't make books any more now, though.
No more pictures.
James took nearly all the pictures I have.
What would be nice, if I could show you my books from the beginning.
There's three of them.
Read you a piece every day.
I could show you all of them before you go.
(Gramophone record playing)
# Everything's in rhythm with my heart
# The flowers that grow and the breezes that blow
# Seem to go with the flow of my song
# And the song I sing's in rhythm with my heart
# Everything's in rhythm with my heart
# The rhythm is sweet, even crowds in the street
# Move their feet to the beat of my song
(Clock chimes)
# Everything's in rhythm with my heart #
There's his first picture, one James took in Saltburn on the beach.
This is the lift that takes you down to the pier.
Costs a penny to go on the pier and you can look through special glasses out to sea.
Fishermen pay sixpence to fish off the end of it.
On a Sunday, James would take me and Ambrose on the pier to listen to the band.
Lots of little old ladies in deckchairs.
(Brass band plays)
This was James' room.
It was different, though.
I'd bring the books up and he'd tell me about all the pictures, where he was when he took 'em, the people in 'em.
"Always have your back to the sun," was his rule.
He always got good pictures, too.
We'd sit just like this, and he'd tell me a story about each picture.
Well, it was different, because he was lying in bed and the bed was over there in the corner by the window.
The window was always open.
The little table stood right against the bed.
He always had his glasses and a book on it, and a picture of Mother and Father.
Sometimes, at first, he'd sit in this chair.
And he even sat by the front door on a hot day.
But after he'd gone, Ambrose changed everything.
Told me I wasn't to sit in here all day.
It wasn't healthy, he said.
He started to move things in here.
And he put hooks in the ceiling and hung the propeller up.
Made more room for storing things, he said.
'Bit by bit Ambrose took all his shirts.
'Except that one.
'That's my favourite.
'James sold the farm and went to work for Mr Tud.
'We moved up dale to here.
'Not far.
'They'd just closed the railway.
'Sometimes they ran special trains, but they never stopped here.'
Oh, it was different then.
We had some sheep and hens, and grew potatoes and cabbages out back.
You'll get a crick in your neck, sitting like that.
(Flies buzzing)
(Sniffs)
Ah.
# You have been my inspiration
# Love has been my guiding light
# When I close my eyes
# My heart always smiles... #
If I put you in his uniform, you'll be just like him, sitting there,
wearing those same glasses, too.
James took us to Saltburn in his uniform.
It was different then, though.
We go to Saltburn every three months of a Saturday to get special things like coal and wood and nails.
Ambrose gets explosives and things for his mine.
I got some Wellingtons last time.
They still send Christmas cards.
These same ones every year.
Mr Spate, the milkman, always sends one.
Only the vicar comes now.
Funny, though.
I watched him through the curtain in my bedroom last time.
He opened the door, called out and walked around the house.
He's different now, not Mr McGill.
'He were only young.
'Came up the dale on his bike.
'I watch every day.
'Every day, Mr Spate brings milk and groceries.
'I watch for him at nine.
'Sometimes he's a bit late.'
(Engine still running)
(Mr Spate drives off)
'It's a nice field with woods up behind, you know.
'Used to be a cornfield.
'Eh, Mother really liked it that day, sitting on the grass in the sun.
'It was a lovely day.
'Brought Mother down specially.
'She died not long after.
'James said he could tell she was going.
Showed in Father, too.
He was like an old man.
After Mother died, Father never came out of his room.
James would take food in to him, but he'd never eat it.
One morning, James couldn't wake him.
Said he'd passed away in his sleep.
One morning, a letter came for James.
Told us he had to join the army.
There was a war with the Germans.
Before he left, he sold all the sheep and got Ambrose a job in the lead mine with Eddy Clark.
The man's just over the hill at Greenhaugh.
But Eddy didn't last very long after.
Heart attack.
He's looked after the mine on his own since then, you know.
'One night, just before James came home, 'there was this terrible noise, very low.
'Then there was this bang and the whole house shook.
'Oh, the sky was all lit up over the hill.'
They took all the fire engines and the army up to the mine over Greenhaugh.
Ambrose was terribly worried.
Thought the mine had blown up.
'All these people went up and down the dale for two days.
'Some of them knocked on the door, 'but Ambrose told me not to open the door when he wasn't there.
'Lots of them were in army clothes.
'I kept looking for James, 'but he wouldn't have knocked.'
I stuck in all James' photos very carefully.
Hot summer days then.
Always had a window open.
And curtains billowed over the bed.
Then Ambrose made this box for James.
'Same as the one he's making you.
'Wheeled him on his barrow up the hill.
'Buried him in the wood.
'I asked Ambrose not to take him.
'It would be all right.
'Look after him, I would.'
Never listens to me.
I often sit with James on the hill.
His favourite spot.
You can see right down dale to Mr Tud's farm.
Ambrose is going to put you next to James on Sunday.
Silly, though.
You could stay here.
It's nice you being here.
Silly you have to go Sunday.
# Some day when I'm awfully low
# When the world is cold
# I will feel a glow, just thinking of you
# And the way you look tonight #
Haven't drank your tea again.
Ambrose had left before I came down.
He's blasting the mine at ten.
'Should hear it any time now.'
(Cuckoo calls)
(Clock chimes)
(Hissing)
(Muffled explosions)
(Flies buzzing)
What would we do if Ambrose was hurt?
The explosion was very big, you know.
Could have been badly hurt.
(Clock chimes)
He's never been this late before.
(Birds twitter)
(Door opens)
"I keep telling Ambrose about the propeller and how it could fall. "
Two small hooks aren't strong enough.
It's a heavy thing, you know.
It's not safe, you sitting there in line with it.
Only wants door to bang and it'd all fall.
If the mattress were moved...
You'd be better there.
You have to bend right low to get under it.
Eh, these floorboards.
Not safe at all.
Better make them safe before Sunday.
Oh.
(Thud)
Easy to fall like that.
(Clattering)
Oh, these floorboards!
You look much better.
Better than you've looked for a long time.
It's worn well, you know.
But then, you've looked after it.
Can't understand Ambrose.
No need for you to go at all.
Washed and pressed all his best for tomorrow.
Found some of your shirts under a pile in his room.
Turns ever so funny if he knew I'd been in.
He's got a pair of your boots in there, too.
Better to make it safe for tomorrow.
Be all right.
Be all right, James.
Be all right.
(Plane roars overhead)
Be all right.
You'll see.

d Everything's in rhythm with my heart d The flowers that grow and the breezes that blow d Seem to go with the flow of my song d And the song I sing's in rhythm with my heart d Everything's in rhythm with my heart

There's his first picture, one James took in Saltburn on the beach.
This is the lift that takes you down to the pier.
Costs a penny to go on the pier and you can look through special glasses out to sea.
Fishermen pay sixpence to fish off the end of it.
On a Sunday, James would take me and Ambrose on the pier to listen to the band.
Lots of little old ladies in deckchairs.
(Brass band plays)
This was James' room.
It was different, though.
I'd bring the books up and he'd tell me about all the pictures, where he was when he took 'em, the people in 'em.
"Always have your back to the sun," was his rule.
He always got good pictures, too.
We'd sit just like this, and he'd tell me a story about each picture.
Well, it was different, because he was lying in bed and the bed was over there in the corner by the window.
The window was always open.
The little table stood right against the bed.
He always had his glasses and a book on it, and a picture of Mother and Father.
Sometimes, at first, he'd sit in this chair.
And he even sat by the front door on a hot day.
But after he'd gone, Ambrose changed everything.
Told me I wasn't to sit in here all day.
It wasn't healthy, he said.
He started to move things in here.
And he put hooks in the ceiling and hung the propeller up.
Made more room for storing things, he said.
'Bit by bit Ambrose took all his shirts.
'Except that one.
'That's my favourite.
'James sold the farm and went to work for Mr Tud.
'We moved up dale to here.
'Not far.
'They'd just closed the railway.
'Sometimes they ran special trains, but they never stopped here.'
Oh, it was different then.
We had some sheep and hens, and grew potatoes and cabbages out back.
You'll get a crick in your neck, sitting like that.
(Flies buzzing)
(Sniffs)
Ah.
d You have been my inspiration d Love has been my guiding light d When I close my eyes d My heart always smiles... d
If I put you in his uniform, you'll be just like him, sitting there,
wearing those same glasses, too.
James took us to Saltburn in his uniform.
It was different then, though.
We go to Saltburn every three months of a Saturday to get special things like coal and wood and nails.
Ambrose gets explosives and things for his mine.
I got some Wellingtons last time.
They still send Christmas cards.
These same ones every year.
Mr Spate, the milkman, always sends one.
Only the vicar comes now.
Funny, though.
I watched him through the curtain in my bedroom last time.
He opened the door, called out and walked around the house.
He's different now, not Mr McGill.
'He were only young.
'Came up the dale on his bike.
'I watch every day.
'Every day, Mr Spate brings milk and groceries.
'I watch for him at nine.
'Sometimes he's a bit late.'
(Engine still running)
(Mr Spate drives off)
'It's a nice field with woods up behind, you know.
'Used to be a cornfield.
'Eh, Mother really liked it that day, sitting on the grass in the sun.
'It was a lovely day.
'Brought Mother down specially.
'She died not long after.
'James said he could tell she was going.
Showed in Father, too.
He was like an old man.
After Mother died, Father never came out of his room.
James would take food in to him, but he'd never eat it.
One morning, James couldn't wake him.
Said he'd passed away in his sleep.
One morning, a letter came for James.
Told us he had to join the army.
There was a war with the Germans.
Before he left, he sold all the sheep and got Ambrose a job in the lead mine with Eddy Clark.
The man's just over the hill at Greenhaugh.
But Eddy didn't last very long after.
Heart attack.
He's looked after the mine on his own since then, you know.
'One night, just before James came home, 'there was this terrible noise, very low.
'Then there was this bang and the whole house shook.
'Oh, the sky was all lit up over the hill.'
They took all the fire engines and the army up to the mine over Greenhaugh.
Ambrose was terribly worried.
Thought the mine had blown up.
'All these people went up and down the dale for two days.
'Some of them knocked on the door, 'but Ambrose told me not to open the door when he wasn't there.
'Lots of them were in army clothes.
'I kept looking for James, 'but he wouldn't have knocked.'
I stuck in all James' photos very carefully.
Hot summer days then.
Always had a window open.
And curtains billowed over the bed.
Then Ambrose made this box for James.
'Same as the one he's making you.
'Wheeled him on his barrow up the hill.
'Buried him in the wood.
'I asked Ambrose not to take him.
'It would be all right.
'Look after him, I would.'
Never listens to me.
I often sit with James on the hill.
His favourite spot.
You can see right down dale to Mr Tud's farm.
Ambrose is going to put you next to James on Sunday.
Silly, though.
You could stay here.
It's nice you being here.
Silly you have to go Sunday.
d Some day when I'm awfully low d When the world is cold d I will feel a glow, just thinking of you d And the way you look tonight d
Haven't drank your tea again.
Ambrose had left before I came down.
He's blasting the mine at ten.
'Should hear it any time now.'
(Cuckoo calls)
(Clock chimes)
(Hissing)
(Muffled explosions)
(Flies buzzing)
What would we do if Ambrose was hurt?
The explosion was very big, you know.
Could have been badly hurt.
(Clock chimes)
He's never been this late before.
(Birds twitter)
(Door opens)
"I keep telling Ambrose about the propeller and how it could fall."
Two small hooks aren't strong enough.
It's a heavy thing, you know.
It's not safe, you sitting there in line with it.
Only wants door to bang and it'd all fall.
If the mattress were moved...
You'd be better there.
You have to bend right low to get under it.
Eh, these floorboards.
Not safe at all.
Better make them safe before Sunday.
Oh.
(Thud)
Easy to fall like that.
(Clattering)
Oh, these floorboards!
You look much better.
Better than you've looked for a long time.
It's worn well, you know.
But then, you've looked after it.
Can't understand Ambrose.
No need for you to go at all.
Washed and pressed all his best for tomorrow.
Found some of your shirts under a pile in his room.
Turns ever so funny if he knew I'd been in.
He's got a pair of your boots in there, too.
Better to make it safe for tomorrow.
Be all right.
Be all right, James.
Be all right.
(Plane roars overhead)
Be all right.
You'll see.
(Door creaks)
(Footsteps)
(Birdsong)
(Digging)
(Hens cluck)
(Footsteps)
(Thud)
(Vibrating)
(Vibrations stop)
(Clock ticks)
(Kettle hisses)
(Flies buzzing)
(Clatter)
(Clattering)
(Clang)
(Footsteps)
(Squeaking)
(Thud)
(Scraping)
(Crash)
(Ragtime music)

Ta-ra, Mrs Swales.
- Cheerio, George.
- Cheerio, Herb.
See you Monday.
Bye-bye, Mrs Swales.
Thanks very much.
Bye-bye, love.
Bye.
Cheerio.
What a pity, Ambrose.
Oh, everything's so dirty.
Your shirt's just about done, all frayed around the collar.
Best if I wash everything.
Be more comfortable.
I'll do them in the morning.
'Won't take long to dry if it's a good day.'
Our James was just growing hairs.
About the same size, you look.
'Better have his shirt.
'Yours nearly fell apart in the wash.
'Not really worth keeping.
'Wear one of James' shirts.
'Much better and warmer.'
All clean and ironed.
James' shirt's nearly new.
Same one as in that picture.
Well, new when he came home.
Ambrose was keen for it.
He's got that many shirts.
He was very poorly.
Hurt in the stomach and legs.
Just before James came home, a plane crashed.
Ambrose got lots of pieces for his hut.
Wheeled the propeller home on his barrow.
"Present for James when he comes home", he said.
Strange how Ambrose seemed to know that James was coming back and so sick.
Oh, but he was glad to be home.
We took lots of photos, like this one of the propeller and James all dressed up in his uniform.
But he got very weak.
He had to stay in bed nearly all the time.
This was his room, but it was different.
Ambrose brought the propeller up here, so James could look at it.
He slept for a long time before Ambrose took him up the hill.
We didn't wake him.
Better not when he was so poorly.
Eh, that fits you just right.
You'll be a lot more comfortable like that.
I found your glasses.
Very like James' glasses, too.
Not very strong.
This side's all broken.
You could maybe wear James' glasses sometimes.
I could show my books.
They're full of pictures and letters.
Took such a long time to make.
Every piece has to be stuck in very carefully not to mark it, mind.
You can't move marks once you've made 'em.
Don't make books any more now, though.
No more pictures.
James took nearly all the pictures I have.
What would be nice, if I could show you my books from the beginning.
There's three of them.
Read you a piece every day.
I could show you all of them before you go.

Mr Ryker!
If you'd like to rest in my office, we'll get a car to take you home.
Here we are...
Please don't worry, ladies and gentlemen.
Just carry on with the game.
I was right.
Police.
Special Branch.
What time is the contact due?
Midnight, precisely.
That's only a couple of minutes.
Don't panic, we'll make the payment, just as arranged.
- With him around?
- Take him out the back way, find somewhere quiet and lose him.
I'll look after things here.
- Good luck, sir.
- Thanks.
This is what we do.
We play for a half-hour.
- Win, lose, whatever, we quit.
- All right.
But this is only half an hour for me.
You do what you wish, I'm going back to the hotel for some sleep.
You deserve it. £200, please.
Look at this club, really jumping, huh?
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
My friend has an irresistible urge to gamble.
- Roulette?
- Of course.
Ask for anything you want.
Good luck.
I've got a system, I play all the odd red numbers.
- This way, sir.
- Thank you.
- Bon soir.
- Monsieur.
- Sil vous plait.
- 19.
Make it 7.
I mean 19.
Dix-neuf, monsieur.
Dix-neuf, rouge.
- £525.
- I love it, I love it.
Hmm?
Oh!
Double it.
Look at that.
Blackjack.
Bully boys.
- 3,500 francs.
- Thank you.
Daniel, have you found a way of cheating at roulette?
I can't do any wrong.
Watch this.
- Nine!
Bravo, bravo.
- We should leave...
We're not leaving!
- Why don't you end up a winner?
- I am a winner.
You've broken the laws of science, physics, magic and chance.
- Tomorrow you'll thank me.
- Let's play a little longer.
For once I'd like to see someone with a perfect record pick up their money and leave.
- OK, OK, calm down.
- I am calm.
Take these, will you?
We'll just make a little bet for tips.
- Excusez-moi. 25, please.
- 25, sir.
No more bets.
- Say thank you to the croupier.
- I'm gonna marry him.
- Your winnings, sir.
- I beg your pardon?
- 26.
- No, I bet 25.
I misheard, I accepted your bet for 26.
Thank you.
I don't believe it.
- Let me help you, sir.
- Yes, please.
This is for the boys.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
- Er, yeah, thank you very much.
- Cash all these in, please.
Hello?
I have identified the contact.
He'll be leaving in a minute.
- Thank you.
- And 200.
- Everything in order, sir?
- Perfect, thank you.
- Good night.
Good night.
- Good night.
He did warn you.
Cab, gentlemen?
- A good win.
- Hmm.
- Good evening, sir.
- Are you the manager?
- Yes.
Can I help?
- My name is Heather.
- I'm a little late.
- There's plenty of time, sir.
Enjoy yourself, and good luck.
I've got a system, I play all the odd red numbers.
We've all got our own systems.
- Did you say you were late?
- Yes.
I also said I play all the odd red numbers.
- What time were you due?
- Midnight.
- Into my office, quickly.
- You fool!
Do as I say.
- Get after that American!
- Why?
Just get after him!
I think I'm gonna buy a bank.
You could buy Brighton if you wanted.
- You did what?
!
- I paid him out.
I just followed my instructions.
He gave the key phrase.
"I've got a system, I play all the odd red numbers."
But the second phrase!
"19.
Make it 7.
I mean 19."
He used it, word for word.
- You should have checked!
- How?
How?
I don't know anybody.
I don't know you.
We're not even supposed to talk!
Just let me tell you what you've done.
- You were late...
- Shut up!
By collecting a big win here,
I would identify myself as the Network Paymaster.
Somebody was watching for me.
They would then contact me and name the place where I am to meet all our key agents in Britain.
- But you didn't collect.
- But the American did.
They'll tell him.
Can't you get it into your head?
You've not only lost £50,000, you've blown our entire network.
Lordship, we ought to have a party.
You know any girls here in Brighton?
- Give or take 100, about 50.
- 50?
Huh!
It'll be a small party, just you, me and 50 girls.
Why are you sitting down?
What are you gonna do?
- Removing my shoes.
- Are you going to bed?
Exactly.
But... we're supposed to celebrate.
Daniel, it took the Romans 1,000 years of decadence
- to bring about their decline.
- So what?
What took them 1,000 years is taking us three days... and three nights.
- Where's your stiff upper lip?
- Right below my bloodshot eyes.
- What took you so long?
- I had to get this from the car.
- Which is the American's?
- Here.
- But he's still in there.
- Get the door open.
- Did you call Ryker?
- Yes.
He'll be out front in about five minutes.
I'll fix the bug.
You take care of this.
What are you doing?
I am... picking up my pills.
What are you taking a pill for?
- To sleep.
- Sleep?
!
Mm-hm, I am going to have... 12... solid, tranquil hours...
What about the party?
Well, you... you start without me.
- What are you looking for now?
- My pyjamas.
Over there.
How the mighty have fallen.
Whatever happened to you?
Remember the good old days?
You were an eagle, soaring.
- No jim-jams.
- Now you're a chicken.
That should do it.
Why are we going to all this trouble?
Couldn't we just fix him?
It's vital we find the contact.
Vital to the whole network.
Once we know, the American must be eliminated.
What about the money?
That must look like straightforward robbery.
Ryker's outside.
I'll just check this.
All set, just waiting for him.
'lf you're receiving, flash your lights.'
That's OK.
Get ready.
Here you are, my pal.
Take this.
Salut.
Oh, tragic.
Shame.
Oh, well.
You can't win 'em all, I guess.
Good night, sweet prince, Your Lordship.
Rest well.
See you in the morning.
Don't let the bed bugs bite.
Quiet in there, Daniel, I'm trying to go to sleep.
I don't wish to come to your party!
Brett!
Brett!
Brett!
- Danny, I...
- Oof!
Wait a minute, will you please look at me when I'm talking to...
Oh!
There are staff problems everywhere today.
Now is no time to go to sleep.
Hey!
Hey, Your Lordship?
Will you wake up?
Come on.
There's no place to fall asleep.
Come on.
- I don't want to!
- Beddy-byes.
Let's go.
Let me get you to your room.
Mr Wilde?
Uh, y-yes.
Room service must have sent you.
Let me get rid of this bundle and I'll be back.
Just don't leave.
Hello!
Sorry about the mess but that's the way it goes.
- But all this money?
- Easy come, easy go.
Now... what can I do for you?
- You know who I am, don't you?
- Tell me.
I am section seven.
Section seven?
Oh, nice.
Nice to meet you section seven.
- You do understand?
- I understand everything, darling.
- Take off your scarf and stay.
- There is no time for that.
- Oh, I see.
- Here is our schedule.
Schedule?
We're working to a schedule?
Of course.
We're efficient but this is ridiculous.
Tomorrow I will give you instructions.
Er, I don't need instructions.
- Thanks, but...
- How else will you know what to do?
Er, I don't think we're talking about the same thing.
Sit down.
'There is no time.
Read the schedule then destroy it.'
Would you like me to eat it?
Old-fashioned but effective.
That's me, old-fashioned but effective.
Please, we have no time for frivolous bourgeois relationships.
- We don't?
- No.
It is not permitted between your rank and a section seven.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I must go.
Yes...
I'll take you to the elevator.
Will you, er...?
Wait a minute.
Go to the entrance and follow the girl.
He's baffled for the moment.
But it won't take him long to work it out.
- What should we do?
- Eliminate.
It's all we can do.
- Is the explosive in position?
- Yes.
Give me the detonator.
Section seven, please, listen...
I'm section eight!
Hey, come on.
Wake up.
Wake up.
- I'm locked out.
- You can't sleep here.
- Where are we going?
- I'll take you to my room...
No, no, Daniel, there's far too much noise.
What are you talking about?
It's as quiet as a graveyard.
Brett!
You know your problem?
You need a good night's sleep.
I'd get one if someone wasn't trying to kill me.
- I don't think it's personal.
- Oh, good.
It's money.
Someone bombed me out of a room for money?
- Good point.
What about the girl?
- Section seven?
- What did she want?
- It's all crazy.
I don't understand.
Well, next time they try to kill you, we'll ask them.
I'm not gonna wait for anybody to try to kill me again.
- I don't think you'll have to wait.
- No?
Don't look around.
I said don't!
Two men have been following us since we left.
- Look casual.
- Is this casual enough for you?
Not that casual.
Look out to sea.
- Beautiful view.
- Yeah, beautiful.
On second thoughts, I think it might be a good idea if we talked to them.
- I will.
- Not here.
Follow me.
Democrat.
Well done, Daniel.
Hold it!
"Sussex County Constabulary."
Daniel!
Daniel!
- The fuzz!
- Where?
!
Here!
Here!
Oh...
I'm terribly sorry.
I really didn't mean anything by that, it was just...
You were following us.
I was keeping observation until you got to your meeting!
- What meeting?
- The one we're taking you to now.
- Shall we go?
- By all means.
Terribly sorry.
- Lead on.
- By...
Thank you.
- Any further we'll be in France.
- Here we are.
Inside.
Thank you.
Excuse us, won't you?
- Dustin Hoffman.
- Martha Raye.
She's prettier than him.
I'll tell you something...
You look better in the mirror.
- How do you do!
Good of you to come.
- Hello.
- Dean.
Sir Maxwell Dean.
- Wilde.
Sinclair.
Here, have some of these.
Enjoy yourselves.
Did you have us brought here?
Not brought, dear chap, invited.
Try the crane, or the ice hockey machine.
Great fun.
What kind of fuzz are you?
Oh, a bit of everything.
We wanted a chat about your visit to the club.
Any money I win in England gambling is tax-free, buddy.
Lucky chap.
But will you live to enjoy it?
Excuse me, if you know this much, why aren't you arresting people?
No evidence.
Things didn't quite work out last night.
- Somebody goofed, huh?
- Yes.
You, Mr Wilde.
Me?
The money you won should've been paid to a foreign agent, a man known only as the Paymaster.
He would distribute the cash to a network of agents.
Somebody's been mistaking me for this Paymaster?
Yes.
By the time they discovered their mistake it was too late.
A pity.
A great pity.
Forgive me if I jump to conclusions and correct me if I'm wrong, as I'm sure you will, your intention was, or is, to follow the Paymaster and thereby get the whole network?
Something like that.
Unfortunately, our man in the club was found dead this morning.
A carefully staged accident.
Now we have only one possible lead.
Forget it, I'm not leading anyone anywhere anytime.
You don't appreciate your importance in this.
- Oh.
- These men work in cells.
The men who run the club wouldn't know the other agents.
Last night a stranger identified you as the Paymaster because you won.
- They will make contact.
- Has made contact.
Really?
- A girl.
- Hey, whose side are you on anyway?
England's.
Don't listen to him.
You've got the wrong guy.
I could get killed.
Almost certainly.
The real Paymaster will try to eliminate you.
Then why are you standing playing this machine?
Go and arrest him!
We will.
Unfortunately, we won't know who he is until he's killed you.
Oh!
Do you hear this?
Excuse me, but I'm leaving the country.
We do need your help and I can offer protection.
No.
I must warn you, you'll be a target.
The fastest moving target you ever saw.
Adios, amigos!
Not very British.
Understandable.
From the colonies, you know.
- You will let me know where you are?
- Yeah.
You gonna stay?
Of course, you know my curiosity.
Yeah.
When you find out what it's all about let me know.
Drive carefully and remember the left side...
Don't move.
Just keep absolutely still.
Don't turn on your engine.
What is it?
Have you had any work done on this car?
No, why?
Open your bonnet very carefully, I want to see the engine.
It's not a bonnet, it's a hood.
- You're a hood.
Would you open it?
- Yeah, but it's in the back.
Foreign cars...
What is it?
Daniel, er, I have some bad news for you.
- What?
- Be brave and take it like a man.
My living stereo is dead, huh?
You're sitting in an enormous bomb.
Sit still!
I don't know how it's wired in yet.
There may be a trembler.
I'll say there's a trembler.
It's me.
There's lots of electronic equipment.
- Go and get an expert.
- There may not be time.
By turning on the ignition you may have activated the fuse.
It could be any one of a dozen systems.
All I have to do is find the detonator.
Do you know anything about this?
Well, I, er, I took a course once in the army.
- How did you do?
- I failed.
Oh.
Why don't you run for your life?
Get out of here.
Will you beat it?
Daniel, I've got it!
Now, it's just a question of whether I turn it right or left.
What do you think?
Well, er, I think right.
- Turn it left.
- All right.
Brace yourself.
I feel rather faint.
You can get out now.
That's it!
One bomb was all right, but two makes me mad!
I'm staying!
- To work for Sir Maxwell?
- No, for myself!
Here.
Oh!
I should have let him drive off.
That moron of yours should have tailed the girl.
She's smart.
She spotted him right away.
All right.
We'll need to change plans slightly.
Leave Wilde alive a little longer.
Just as well, that cat's got nine lives.
I must know the contact before I move.
- How?
- There is a way.
Leave it to me.
After that, Wilde dies.
And I'll make a proper job of it this time.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
This just is a list of names of towns.
It could be in code.
No, she said it was a schedule.
Maybe you have to visit them.
It'd take a week and a half.
Besides...
- What are you supposed to be?
- A brain surgeon.
- You look like a window cleaner.
- Ha ha!
That's what you're supposed to be?
Well, people who don't know you will recognise you!
That's the point, nobody looks at window cleaners and I have to get into that club.
- I'll come with you.
- You can't!
If that girl wishes to make contact this is the only place she'll come.
I made a copy of this list for you, see if you can make some sense out of it.
Sherlock, take the first letter of each town and maybe you can make a name of it.
Here, let me open that...
See you later, kid.
"Areckershufunt...!"
Heather's taking a stupid chance.
Not really.
Wilde's expecting somebody.
He'll be expecting the girl.
So he'll say there's a change of plan.
I'll tell you something.
Heather's a pro, he'll handle Wilde.
We'll know soon enough.
He should be at the hotel by now.
Where are you going?
Across to the hotel, to see how things are going on.
- You gonna be here?
- Suppose so.
I'll call if anything comes up.
Just one moment.
No, no, no, no, I cannot speak any louder.
I do not have laryngitis.
Sani-Phone.
All your germs is gone when you use Sani-Phone.
Hello?
Yes, yes.
It's for you.
Ryker!
Lose your ladder?
Legend... overleaf...
Southampton...
Blackmoor...
Bridgwater...
Isn't this going a bit too far?
I was going to tip you.
Stand up, Mr Wilde.
Now sit down.
Keep your hands in sight.
Good.
Now we'll wait for your contact to arrive.
And when she does?
Your part in this will come to an abrupt and tragic end.
I'm just gonna put this away.
Gentlemen, you...
you really should stop worrying.
You'll end up with ulcers.
My great uncle, the 17th...
or was it 16th?
Anyway...
I'd appreciate it if you'd stop talking.
You sound like my friend Danny Wilde.
Anyway, the 17th Duke was...
Aah...
You're even beginning act like Danny.
The money?
Oh, it's right here.
Thank you.
It's all there, I didn't spend any.
A couple of tips, that's all.
Are you the guy that was supposed to collect it?
Yes, I was delayed.
Well, no hard feelings, then, let's shake hands and...
That would be nice but I wouldn't know where to go.
That's the beauty of the cell system.
I can't give anyone away.
I'm in the hands of my contact.
What happens if my contact doesn't show?
She just showed.
Right, let's get this clear, you open the door and then stand to one side.
Hurry, we have little time.
Yes, I'll just tidy up.
We'll go right along, absolutely.
That'll teach you to fool around.
- What are you doing?
- I kill him.
- No, why would you kill him?
- To kill him is better.
Where did you learn these kind of things?
Hold this.
Killing and shooting, you're crazy...
There you again.
Didn't you have dolls when you were a kid?
Guns, you're crazy!
And when they opened the old duke up, it wasn't ulcers,
- he was really a duchess!
- Bring the car around.
It was a freak of nature.
Is this what they say is "it"?
I'm afraid so.
I don't have time for a short but passionate plea about man's inhumanity to man?
- I'd rather you didn't.
- Well, in that case...
Awfully bad form, hitting a handcuffed prisoner.
Snap - or hadn't you noticed?
Would you do me the honours?
- How did you know I was here?
- I've known for hours.
I couldn't move until your friend left.
- Is he on his way?
- The car's under surveillance.
They're professionals, the girl won't have a clue she's being followed.
We are being followed.
You think it's that van?
I'll lose them.
I'm very expert.
You certainly are.
She's spotted the tail.
Green Dolphin to Blue Whale.
She's seen you.
Drop out.
Red Mullet, stand by and take over.
You lost them.
Capitalist intelligence services are inferior.
I'll say.
Will you tell me, please, where we're going?
'Red Mullet to Green Dolphin, am trailing subject south.'
Green Dolphin to Red Mullet, stay in position until next intersection.
Golden Carp, stand by to take over.
She can't move without us knowing.
It's odd.
They're staying in the town limits.
- You said they'd have a rendezvous.
- I'm certain.
'Golden Carp to Green Dolphin, subjects have not entered my area.'
All units, anybody in contact?
- 'Negative.' - 'No contact.'
What was your last position?
That's it, they lost your tail here and made for the railway station.
This is Green Dolphin.
Converge on Brighton Central.
Check all trains for suspects - fast!
Now this makes sense, it's a list of railway stations.
Brighton, Chichester, Havant, Fareham...
The Exeter line.
When is the next train?
- Why didn't you give me this before?
- Well, I was a PoW at the time.
A moving train... the perfect rendezvous.
Exeter train left two minutes ago, sir.
Get me Whitehall.
Recall all units!
Cover the Exeter lines.
- Yes, sir.
- Quick as you can!
Now you'll see just how efficient we can be.
Oh, damn it, now we've lost him.
Comrade, or may I call you section seven?
You may call me Lyn, short for Natashalyn.
Natashalyn, am I the senior comrade here?
- Of course.
- Put that down.
Where are we going, and don't do that.
- Very well, we are going nowhere.
- Where?
- I explain.
We are already there.
- There?
Where?
- Here!
- Oh.
You are very curious man, Mr Wilde, for an agent, I mean.
Well, it's, er, part of my cover.
I mean, who would take me for a spy?
True.
But you seem to have such capitalist tastes.
You live in luxury hotel, drink champagne, have expensive clothes...
You think I enjoy it?
Travelling first class, eating in the finest restaurants, driving expensive cars.
I hate it.
It's torture.
Torture!
I do it for the cause.
It must be terrible.
Well, I try to be brave.
Time to go.
Go where?
There.
Oh, a Chinese restaurant!
- Comrade!
- Comrade.
- This is our comrade from the north.
- It is an honour.
Thank you so much.
The others will be here at 30-second intervals.
- Yes, comrade.
- Comrade, wonderful to see you.
Excuse me, madam.
That looks like a lot of chicken feed.
I have a list of amounts for our people.
- I will pay them as they arrive.
- Right, comrade.
Absolutely.
- Then you can begin your briefing.
- My briefing?
We are looking forward to that.
I'm looking forward to my briefing as well.
This is our comrade from the north.
- Comrade.
- Comrade.
About time you visited us.
I try to meet everybody.
Nice to meet you, kid.
Nice to meet you.
What's this?
He's a Yank.
I think you mean our comrade appears to be an American.
Oh, yeah.
Just the same, I don't like breaking cover.
I don't like it myself, to tell you the truth.
Better be worth it.
You're right, it better be worth it.
Comrade!
- Delighted, old boy.
- Delighted.
- This is our comrade from London.
- Well, where else?
Dreadful train.
Food's appalling.
And as for the service.
It's about time we had another rail strike.
You think so, huh?
Not today though.
I mean today we're on the train and we're on time.
Oh, I see!
Five, four, three, two, one...
Punctuality.
I...
I like that.
Will there be changes in our targets this year or will it be the same?
No, they should be the same, give or take a little.
- What, comrade?
- Give or take just a little.
But I thought...
I'm sorry.
- What about our effort?
- Excellent.
- Not bad for a small unit?
- Wonderful for a small unit.
100,000 men on strike for five weeks.
20 million man hours lost.
That's a lot of men lost.
Not to mention the exports.
- The exports?
- Yeah.
- What do you mean?
- The exports versus the imports.
The logistics of the economy, balancing...
- You have a point.
- Absolutely.
Here's another comrade.
Excuse me.
- Comrade!
- Comrade!
- Watch your head.
- Comrade!
He's the last one, you can begin your briefing.
Right.
Why don't you say a few words before my briefing?
And so I give you comrade Brad!
Bravo, comrade.
- Comrades.
- Comrades!
Comrades, comrades...
This is a moving moment for me, believe me.
It's a great honour to be here.
Up till now you've been nothing but numbers, numbers in a file, 603, 907...
Now you're real and live.
Brothers, sisters, comrades!
Comrades!
Comrade, you should begin your briefing now.
We have little time.
What briefing?
Oh, the briefing, yes, of course, the briefing.
Sorry, this is the end of the train, sir.
Oh.
See that?
That's the end of my fist.
Thank you, you've saved me the trouble.
Up slowly.
Now, unlock the door.
Try harder.
Whatever you're doing, try harder.
If you're striking, strike harder...
Don't move!
There is only one Network Paymaster and I am he.
- This is the Paymaster!
- You don't really believe that?
She believes it!
- Leave me alone!
- Get him!
- Need any help?
- No.
What are you doing?
You don't have to thank me for being on the right train at the right time.
You're slowing up a bit.
Don't stand there!
Help me in!
I don't think we'll need that again.
- Put down the axe.
What did I do?
- That's a very good question.
Think of the mess it'll make.
- There, there, feel better?
- They're extraordinary creatures.
We've never met, actually...
This one is as crooked as a dog's hind leg.
Fire it in the vice this afternoon.
- I want yesterday's field reports now.
- Yes, sir.
Three more units added to security at Coastal Aircraft.
No progress on the Fairfax Insurance investigation - we're working with their accountants.
Brooks and Wilcox are in court on the Monzio divorce - should be no problem.
James case looking very positive, no negative signs.
Everyone's checked in but Russell and he's undercover in Santa Barbara.
- Give me the afternoon report at 5:30.
- Yes, sir.
- Our guest has arrived?
- Yes, but Mr Kennicut hasn't.
He's not due for another 30 seconds.
He's just coming in now.
'I want you to listen very carefully, please. '
I'm Arthur Kennicut.
Mr Brimmer's expecting me.
- Oh, yes, sir.
Go right in, please.
- Thank you.
Oh, Mr Kennicut.
You're right on time.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
- Would you care for something to drink?
- Some coffee, black.
From your paper, I see you've taken a stand on this federal judgeship that's giving everybody fits.
I'd rather not talk politics right now, Mr Brimmer.
Yes, of course.
Thank you, Henry.
Well, this is your wife's file, Mr Kennicut, and the fact sheet shows five weeks of intensive surveillance.
'All movement, personal contact, telephone communications. '
- It's really quite extensive.
- And?
You have nothing to worry about.
It's a clean bill of health.
- You sure?
- I'm not in the habit of making mistakes.
Yes.
I'm sorry, of course.
But lately it's been like waiting for a biopsy report - benign or malignant.
Well, in this case, benign.
I don't know which I feel most, relief or anger.
- Anger?
- At myself, my idiotic suspicions.
I suppose when one marries a much younger woman one tends to become a little paranoid.
'There's often good cause.
In this case, not. '
Read it at your leisure.
There's not a hint of another man.
You know, it's funny.
I love her.
I love her very much.
And I think I know her.
But lately I could have sworn that...
Well, it doesn't matter now.
I feel so guilty, I'm going to shower her with gifts.
She won't know what hit her.
Mr Brimmer, I owe you a great deal.
- It's a pleasure to set your mind at rest.
- Thank you.
You'll have my cheque in the morning.
- Very kind of you.
- Thank you again.
Thank you.
- Could you hear everything?
- Yes.
- You seem confused.
- I don't know why you asked me to come.
- I thought it was obvious.
- No, not really.
- You...
- What you're trying to say is that I lied to your husband.
Well, that's correct, Mrs Kennicut.
I even went so far as to falsify the report.
- Would you like a glass of water?
- No.
Nothing, thank you.
In point of fact you were having an affair.
- The man's name was Archer.
- It's over, Mr Brimmer.
But I'm sure you already know that.
It was a mistake.
A stupid mistake.
But I ended it.
And it won't ever happen again.
Why didn't you tell my husband the truth?
Oddly enough, Mrs Kennicut, I am a moralist - a vanishing species, so I'm told.
A thousand broken marriages come across my desk - infidelities, domestic deceit.
In your case, ten years of marriage and one brief indiscretion.
So, why not bend the truth a little bit?
- But...
Then you're not going to tell him?
- I haven't and I won't.
File's closed.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Brimmer.
I am so grateful.
How grateful?
Mrs Kennicut, a detective agency runs on information.
That's our raw material.
Your husband owns three newspapers - two on this coast and one on the East.
Whenever anything happens on the inside of business or politics...
- I still don't understand how I...
- Information, Mrs Kennicut.
It is our only stock in trade.
I'm currently working on a case where it would be very beneficial to have certain information about a federal judge
- that your husband supports.
- Are you saying you want me to be a pipeline to my husband?
No.
Just... a good listener.
Is it really asking so much, Mrs Kennicut?
I can't do this kind of work alone.
I need that kind of help.
Why don't you think about it and we'll talk again?
Your terrace door was unlocked, so I trespassed.
Well, there's no car in the front.
I thought you knew everything, Mr Brimmer.
We're neighbours.
My husband and I have a weekend house about three miles from here.
Ironic, isn't it?
Why are you here?
Well, why else?
To discuss your...
What shall we call it?
Your proposition.
I've been walking on the beach for hours, thinking.
- And you've come to a decision.
- Oh, yes.
Tell me something, Mr Brimmer.
How many other rich men's wives owe you favours?
Do they all capitulate easily?
- I'm waiting for your answer.
- Indulge me.
I should think the blackmailee has some right.
- Mrs Kennicut, I...
- The answer is no.
No deal.
Is that plain enough for you?
If you want a spy, you find someone else.
All right.
I'll have to call your husband and...
And what?
Tell him I had an affair?
Sorry.
It won't work.
I'm going to tell him myself.
I can't believe that you'd want to do that.
Well, what you believe really doesn't matter, does it?
It's what Arthur thinks that's important.
Maybe he'll ask for a divorce or maybe he'll forgive me.
But it's time I was honest with him.
- You're being very foolish.
- Only if I lose.
But you can't threaten me any more, can you?
You just lost your leverage.
Oh, and one other thing.
I'm also going to tell him about the way you run your business.
- I wouldn't advise that.
- I'm sure you wouldn't.
Because whether he forgives me or not, he's gonna despise you for lying to him.
And Arthur's not the right man to have for an enemy.
- Good night, Mr Brimmer.
- I want you to reconsider.
Your husband has some very powerful friends.
That's right.
Now, if you'll please excuse me.
I cannot permit you to do that.
You don't understand.
It's not your choice.
You let go of me!
Let go!
- What's the trouble, Officer?
- Licence and registration, please.
- Turn signal, right?
- The right one.
You know, it's the second time I got stopped today.
I'll get those things fixed as soon as I can.
- You'll get 'em fixed now.
- I would, but I'm going to a 187 PC.
- Say, are you a cop?
- Yeah, uh, Lieutenant...
Columbo.
Well, I'm sorry I flagged you down.
You're just doing your job.
I'll get those things fixed.
- This licence expires next week.
- Oh.
Oh, well, thanks.
I'll give you an escort.
That way you'll get where you wanna go.
OK.
Appreciate that.
But listen, not too fast.
I don't think she was killed here.
Looks like the body was moved.
- And the cause of death?
- Probably a severe concussion.
- Print team wrapped up.
Nothing.
- Two blows...
- Send them home.
... laceration on the cheek and major contusion at the base of the skull.
- How do you read that?
- It's hard to say.
Maybe somebody hit her and she struck her head going down.
- Lieutenant, you got that?
- After the autopsy...
- Yeah.
Got a match?
... I'll have the approximate time of death.
- No.
- No tyre tracks we can use.
I'm sorry.
I don't smoke.
No prints.
Just smudges.
Money?
Just change.
No currency.
- You got a match?
- No, I don't.
Sorry.
- Got a match?
- Yeah, sure.
We're finished.
You can load it up.
Identification and purse.
Mrs Arthur Kennicut - the Arthur Kennicut.
- How do you know that?
- Her cards say Kennicut Publications.
- What's the problem?
- Newspapers.
If we don't handle this to Kennicut's satisfaction he's got a lot of front pages to beat us over the head with.
Thought I told you to move that out of here.
- Lieutenant, what are you looking at?
- The lady has a bruise on the left cheek.
We know that.
I knew you weren't listening.
It's Lenore.
I wanna get out of here.
Oh.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Would you like to be alone?
No.
I can feel sorry for myself some other time - after you've caught him.
Should we get down to business?
Are you sure there's nothing else you want?
As the husband, I'm the most likely suspect, correct?
- Er...
- You don't have to worry about my feelings.
She was killed last night.
What time?
- Between eight and nine.
- I was in San Francisco at a conference.
I didn't fly back until this morning.
- You have the flight numbers on that?
- My secretary can give them to you, together with my hotel and my schedule.
- You'll check them all out, naturally.
- Yes, sir.
And when you do, you'll dismiss me as a possibility, and you can get down to the real business of finding the real killer.
And I want him found, Lieutenant.
Soon.
- I'll do my best.
- I'm sure you will.
Er, Mr Kennicut, it would help if you could tell us a few things.
Did your wife have any enemies?
Lenore never offended a soul.
She was an extraordinary woman.
I see.
This question is a bit awkward, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask - was there ever another man in her life?
Naturally.
More than one.
But that was years ago, before we were married.
- No.
I meant since you were married.
- An affair?
I'm afraid we're gonna have to consider it.
Well, don't bother.
Lenore was faithful to me in every way.
She had a clean bill of health.
All right.
Clean bill of health.
- So we shouldn't go in that direction?
- No, you shouldn't.
Can you tell us about her habits?
What did she do in her spare time?
Nothing unusual.
Shopping, charity work.
- Sports.
- What kind of sports did she play?
Tennis.
She was also very fond of skin diving.
Yes.
Did she do this with you, sir?
Did she do it with friends?
With friends, Lieutenant.
Female friends, in case you're wondering.
Female friends.
All right, sir.
I think I've got enough to start with.
Thank you very much.
Lieutenant, I want you to understand something.
I married a woman young enough to be my daughter.
People were sceptical, but it worked for us.
We loved each other.
We loved each other very much.
We even thought of having a child.
I want this man caught.
And I must warn you, I don't intend to be patient.
Yes, sir.
Oh, Lieutenant?
Thanks for the coffee.
You're welcome, sir.
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Good morning, sir.
- Coffee, juice?
- Nothing for me.
Thank you very much.
- Any progress?
- Er, no, sir.
I hate to admit this, but nothing.
- Not a single lead?
- No, sir.
Nothing.
Well, some of my associates think that your wife was mugged and the fella ran away with the money.
But, you see, they can't really explain how the body was moved.
And, now, me
- I don't know.
I, er...
I think she knew the murderer.
Why?
- Excuse me.
- Yes.
Yes?
All right.
Be right in.
- Why?
- Her behaviour seems a little strange.
She went out to the beach house on a weekday, which is unusual, and she said to the caretaker she had some thinking to do and then she went for a walk.
The next morning, her body was found on the other side of town.
- What are you getting at?
- I wish I knew.
I don't know.
It's just that it sounds to me like a woman that has a problem.
- Did she have any personal problems?
- My wife was a very happy woman.
Yeah, well, it's just if she did have a problem,
I thought that maybe it would be connected with the murder.
- But you've no proof of that.
- No, sir.
No.
Lieutenant, I call the city room every half hour to find out what you people are doing.
So far, not a word.
No arrest.
Not even a promise of one.
Now you tell me you haven't a lead.
Well, I'm sorry, Mr Kennicut.
Looks like it's gonna be slow.
It doesn't have to be.
Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Columbo, this is Mr Brimmer.
- How do you do?
- Lieutenant.
- You've heard of Brimmer Associates?
- No, I haven't.
It's security and investigations.
You might say we're in the same business.
- Really?
- I was talking about you last night.
I ran into the commissioner at a party.
He speaks very highly of you.
Naturally, you're wondering why Mr Brimmer's here.
Don't take this as a reflection on you but I've engaged his firm to work on the case.
Arthur, I'm here in a supplementary, advisory capacity only.
I don't want the lieutenant to think I'm competing with him.
There's no reason a private agency and a public one can't cooperate, is there?
No.
I want as much coverage in this case as possible.
When Mr Brimmer offered his services, I thought it was an excellent idea.
Sure.
I can understand that.
Er, you two know each other?
Mr Brimmer's done some work for me.
I see.
I see.
Some kind of security work?
Guards for the paper?
It was a personal matter.
The point is, Lieutenant,
I told Arthur I thought you would accept a helping hand, considering the manpower shortage in your department.
Mr Brimmer used to be a police officer himself.
Well, it was a long time ago but I can understand your problems, Lieutenant.
Well, listen, I said to Mr Kennicut I'm grateful for all the help I can get.
I'm just not sure how my superior's gonna take this.
That's already been taken care of.
Mr Kennicut is anxious for a quick resolution to the case.
You understand.
- Well, naturally.
- Well, good.
I hope the association will be beneficial to you.
Oh, I'm sure it will.
Yeah.
I suddenly feel very much more optimistic about this whole thing.
It's not based on anything, no facts, but you know, I'm a superstitious guy.
I believe in signs.
I believe in palmistry and astrology and that kinda thing.
- You don't, I know.
- Definitely not.
Let me see your hand.
You see, Mr Kennicut, that's your fate line and it breaks there.
That was your bad fortune.
But it picks up again, and that's interesting.
That's a very good omen.
May I?
Mm.
Deep line of Apollo.
That's a man devoted to his work.
Your Apollo line crosses the mound of the Moon.
That's very rare.
And very impressive.
That's the sign of a man destined to attain a particular kind of distinction.
That's a very good sign.
I know you think it's silly but I'll make a believer out of you before I'm done.
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice to have met you.
Bye-bye.
Oh, Mr Brimmer.
Large thumb, low mound of Venus.
That means ambition, purposefulness.
That's a closet, Lieutenant.
Oh, gee.
I'm sorry.
A lot of people make the same mistake.
Say, that's a terrific-looking set of clubs.
Do you mind?
Go ahead.
These seem light.
Are these ladies' clubs?
- They were Lenore's.
- You didn't say she played golf.
You mentioned tennis and skin diving.
- That's because she just started.
- I see.
Where'd she play?
- At the country club.
- I see.
At the club.
I was just wondering why she didn't keep her clubs in the locker room?
- She did.
- That's an extra set for her lessons.
Oh, I see.
Well, that explains it.
Right.
Er, you mean she didn't take lessons at her own club, but someplace else?
Sky Lane.
Why, is it important?
It's not important.
I just like to get that background information very precise.
Bye.
- Is this the right door?
- Yes.
Well, what was that all about?
I think police techniques have changed a little over the years.
Here, try it again.
And remember, keep the back of your left hand straight.
None of this.
Just stroke it easy, all right?
Oh, that was good.
You're getting better.
I still don't think I'm ever gonna learn this game.
Just have to keep your eye on the ball, watch your concentration.
You're coming along fine.
Do we have time for another bucket?
- Sorry, Jenny.
Time's up.
Tomorrow, 3:00.
- Tomorrow, then.
You a member of the club?
Er, no.
No, I'm Lieutenant Columbo.
I'm from the police.
What's the problem?
I'd like to ask you some questions about a Lenore Kennicut.
You knew her?
Not very well.
I gave her a few lessons.
I see.
Well, this is your appointment book, isn't it?
You should know.
You've been looking at it.
No offence.
I was just killing time but now that you mention it,
I see you gave her a lot of lessons.
- She liked the game.
- I see.
Here's the thing.
Erm, since you spent a lot of time with her,
I was wondering if you could give me some help.
- How?
- Was she the type of woman...
Now this is just between you and me.
Was she the type of woman who was on the lookout?
Did you ever notice her give her eye to any of the men around here?
Look, Lieutenant.
We better get one thing straight.
I teach them golf and I play in their tournaments but I don't get involved in their personal lives.
If they wanna pair off, that's none of my business.
All right.
Well, thanks a lot.
- It's quite all right.
- Take it easy.
Say, er, what kind of club is this?
That's a number one wood.
Number one wood.
Listen, could you give me a lesson?
- What?
- No, I'm serious.
You know what my trouble is?
I work too hard.
Never out of the office.
I figure this - if I could take up a sport, get out in the fresh air and get some exercise, that'd do me some good.
- What do you say?
- Well, I...
Just for a few minutes.
Just to start to swing.
Come on.
You know what was funny about your appointments with Mrs Kennicut?
Er, the first two were in the morning and all the rest, and I counted 13 of them, they were always in the middle or the late afternoon.
- So?
- Well, I guess it's not important.
I guess it's nothing.
Wait a minute.
I'll take off my coat.
Except that, er, every time you had an appointment with Mrs Kennicut, it was always the last lesson of the day.
I like to finish at a reasonable hour.
Doesn't everyone?
Oh, I see.
So those days, you left the club.
I thought you'd hang around to see if you could pick up an odd lesson.
Well, I didn't always go home.
Who said anything about going home?
What I mean is I didn't always leave the club.
Sometimes...
Hey, listen.
Can I help you out?
Don't say anything else.
You don't have an attorney.
Wait until you get an attorney.
This way you can hurt your case.
Believe me, I know something about my business.
I don't know anything about golf.
See, that's your business.
I know something about my business.
And believe me, you know, down through the years, you get so that you develop a nose for things, you see?
And, er... after a while, the old nose just tells you when someone's not giving you the truth.
Now, I'm gonna forget about the lesson, cos I could never learn this game, but I'll be back to talk to you.
Ground covered by the police is not our concern.
One thing to bear in mind, money was taken.
Granted, it could have been a smoke screen but sometimes the obvious answer is the correct one.
- Now, Brooks...
- Yes, sir?
Check into her banking account, particularly withdrawals.
Find out how much cash she was carrying that day.
Mr Kennicut will be glad to cooperate.
My theory, gentlemen, and you will gear your efforts in this direction.
Mrs Kennicut was walking along the Pacific Coast Highway.
She was forced into a car... by someone.
The motive was robbery.
She probably fought back.
In any case, she was killed.
The murderer drove around in a panic and, finally, out to here, to get rid of the body.
- Yes?
- 'It's Lieutenant Columbo. '
Who?
Oh, yes.
Yes, send him in.
Gentlemen, we'll finish this later.
I'll call you.
Thank you.
Lieutenant?
Come in!
Whew!
Boy.
This is quite a building.
- This all yours?
- 'Fraid so. '
Must be a lot of business for your kinda company these days.
We can't handle it all.
Sit down.
Your secretary called.
She said you wanted the files on the case.
I thought it'd be safer if I brought them.
That's nice.
It wasn't necessary, but I appreciate it.
Want some coffee?
- No, thanks.
- Thank you.
- Those are the duplicates.
- OK.
Yes, this will help.
A lot of it.
I wonder if you can give me a little rundown.
Well, it's just what I told Mr Kennicut.
No leads.
Except I was looking through that stuff last night...
- Mm-hm?
- And...
Drives my wife crazy, you know.
The lamp's next to the bed and the poor thing, she can't sleep.
- Did you find anything?
- No, not really.
Well, er...
Take the autopsy report.
Yes.
Here it is.
You see, that jived with something that I noticed about the body the first time I saw it and that bothered me.
Mrs Kennicut was struck on the left cheek and she had a bruise and she had a weird kinda cut.
Erm...
- Do you see what I mean?
- Erm, no.
I don't think so.
Let's start with the cut because that's what bothered me.
I said to myself, "What in the world could have caused that kind of cut?"
Er, does this lighter work?
Yeah, I think so.
Er...
- Where was I?
- About the cut.
Oh, yes.
What could have caused the cut?
I said to myself, "It could be a ring. "
A ring of...
You mean a finger ring.
This kind of ring.
Yeah, something like that.
Now here's the way I figured it.
Suppose you were gonna strike somebody.
Suppose it was a woman.
Now, do you punch her?
Well, maybe.
But more than likely, you hit with your open hand.
- Either this way or this way.
- Mm.
Now, if you hit this way, the ring is not gonna cause any cut.
So I figured it was a backhand blow like this.
OK?
I still don't follow you because that would put it over...
- But I used my right hand, see?
- Yeah.
If the ring was on the right hand, the bruise would be on the right cheek.
But it was on the left cheek so the murderer was left-handed.
Struck her like this.
Which means the murderer is left-handed.
Well, that's interesting.
That's provided, of course, all these speculations are valid.
Yeah, I would say that we have a left-handed murderer and... and an unpremeditated crime.
- We have?
- I think so, yes.
I don't think a man kills with his hands unless he's angry.
As a matter of fact, you know, maybe he didn't mean to do it.
Could be.
Maybe it was an accident.
You know, I got a feeling that when we find our friend, it's gonna turn out that he has a terrible temper.
Well, maybe you're right.
I certainly wish I had your crystal ball, Lieutenant.
Why don't you let me digest all this and then we'll talk again?
OK.
All right.
Fine.
Sure.
Listen.
I want to thank you for the time.
- Listen.
Thank you.
- Right.
Listen, before I forget...
Gee whizz.
I didn't wanna forget that.
But, er, let's see.
I had a receipt here that I wanted you to sign.
Well, listen, let's just make one up.
It's a receipt for the files.
Isn't that weird?
- What a coincidence.
- What's that?
A moment ago, we were talking about left-handed people and you're left-handed.
And right-handed.
I'm ambidextrous.
That means I don't favour either hand particularly.
It's a character trait shared by about ten percent of the world's population.
Ten percent?
No kidding?
- Anything else?
- Er, no.
No, I don't think so.
Listen.
This is a little bit off the subject.
My sister-in-law wants to buy a place at the beach.
How do you like it there?
- Who said I was living at the beach?
- No one.
I noticed your car in front of Mr Kennicut's.
You parked it there in the driveway.
I saw the chrome was tarnished.
You know the salt air just eats the life out of it.
Yeah, that part's a problem, all right.
You're a very observant man, Lieutenant.
That's not what my wife says.
Well, you tell your sister-in-law that she will love it at the beach if she doesn't mind that problem with the salt air on the chrome.
I'll tell her that.
And thanks again.
Thank you.
Oh, er, say, have you ever been in Mr Kennicut's house?
Yes, I met you there.
Not the big house.
I meant at the beach.
Your beach house and his beach house are fairly close, aren't they?
No.
It's a couple miles.
That close?
Isn't that a coincidence?
I'll tell you.
This case is just full of 'em.
Why don't you and I take a walk?
When you showed up today, I kinda panicked.
Then you did have an affair with her?
Turning on the ladies is the only thing I do well.
- I'm not a very good golfer.
- Yeah, go on.
Well, it was pretty good for a while, at least for me.
She got the guilts.
Funny thing, I think she really loved her husband.
One day she said, "Ken, this is bad for both of us.
Let's call it off. "
So we did.
Were you shook up when we found her dead?
I couldn't believe it.
Then I got to thinking, sooner or later, you guys would find out about me.
Maybe even think I killed her.
The night she died, I was...
I was home watching the tube.
No calls.
No company.
No alibi.
That's why I started to run.
Uh-huh?
I can understand that.
You didn't kill her.
No.
I know that but this afternoon, you gave the impression...
No.
You're in the clear.
You got nothing to worry about.
You see, whoever did this, he had to wear a ring.
Now, you don't wear a ring.
Well, I could have taken it off.
No, not with that tan, because that would show.
Now listen.
Tell me something.
Mrs Kennicut.
Did Mrs Kennicut ever indicate to you that she was concerned that her husband knew about you two?
No.
It's funny that you mention it though because, well, I was concerned.
Why?
Lenore never saw anyone, but I'm sure we were being followed.
By who?
There was this one guy in particular.
Sharp, well-dressed.
I only caught him in flashes, but...
Well, he had a crew cut.
Kind of an ex-Marine type.
- Yes?
- Wilcox, Mr Brimmer.
The subject is meeting with Archer and is engaged in conversation.
Did you overhear anything?
'No, sir.
But Archer seems to be doing most of the talking. '
Maintain surveillance and report in the morning.
Yes, sir.
Why, you little bum, you.
Hello?
Oh, yes, he is.
Leo.
Mr Brimmer.
- Yes, sir?
- I'm sorry to trouble you at home, Leo.
'No sweat.
Just playing with Teddy. '
I've got something I want you to do for me.
It may complicate your life a little bit.
- When?
- Immediately.
- Set it up through my secretary.
- Yes, sir.
I'll be in touch.
All of our operatives are skilled marksmen.
Actually, our policy is to avoid the use of the weapon.
This is our memory bank, Lieutenant.
Millions of bits of information, all cross-filed and on tape, immediately available.
There are more electrical impulses in this room than in your brain.
Hard to believe.
We use the most up-to-date equipment, years ahead of what you use at headquarters.
Company cars - custom designed for us.
Most of them with telephonic or radio communication.
Whew!
It's very impressive.
Just one moment, Lieutenant.
One other thing that might interest you.
If you'll just move past this gate.
- It's not working.
- Well, it has to be.
You're carrying a gun, aren't you?
- No.
- No?
Oh, well, that explains the malfunction.
Look here.
A special system is built into the gate.
Now, if you had a gun, it would have registered.
- It's just like out at the airport.
- It's a security precaution.
Not that we expect our clients to carry weapons but there have been exceptions.
- Really?
- A guy came in here about a month ago.
Harmless looking.
An accountant for Mid-Century Oil.
- We were doing a company audit.
- Mr Denning?
I asked you to show the lieutenant around.
I did not suggest that you discuss our confidential matters with anyone at any time!
Our clients pay us to be discreet.
Yes, sir.
Won't you come in, Lieutenant?
Sorry about the outburst but my people have got to learn.
This is a business of trust.
I can't have them gossiping about the clients.
Thank you, Henry.
Hope you'll have lunch with me.
Like quenelle of sole?
Er, well, if it's fish, I like fish.
Love fish.
It's fish.
Drop your coat and dig in.
On the Kennicut case, my men have come up with an interesting lead.
There were two derelicts seen in the area.
I have their description.
I sent them over to your office, copies.
Right.
I'll have that checked out.
Anything new on your end?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, we got a couple of things.
It seems as though Mrs Kennicut was having an affair, you see?
Erm...
Boy, this is delicious.
How do you make this stuff?
I'll have a recipe sent over to you.
You were saying?
Yeah.
It seems as though Mrs Kennicut, she was having an affair.
- And, er...
- Oh?
And...
When you send the recipe, would you send it to the house?
- Don't send it to the office.
- Yes, I'll send it to your house.
Yes, she was having an affair with some golf pro at some country club.
Here's the interesting thing.
Not only were they having an affair, but it seems as though they were being watched.
Now, I got this nutty notion.
Suppose Mr Kennicut...
I'll tell you, it's too far-fetched.
Sometimes it helps to test it out.
Try me.
It's really crazy.
Well, listen.
It doesn't cost anything.
Suppose Mr Kennicut hired somebody to check up on his wife.
And this somebody lied to him.
He said to Mr Kennicut, "Look, your wife, she's got a clean bill of health. "
Now this somebody, whoever it is, he's in a perfect position to blackmail Mrs Kennicut.
Now, suppose she refuses.
See?
She says, "No, I'm gonna go tell my husband. "
I think it's a terrific motive, don't you?
Lieutenant, you have a marvellously convoluted mind.
- I do?
- I like it.
The trouble with your theory is not only is it very tenuous, but it's impossible to prove, isn't it?
I, er...
Got a little tomato on that there.
Well, I said it was nutty.
What do you think?
You think I ought to drop it?
If you believe in it, stick to it.
Run it on down.
One other thing you should keep in mind.
Nothing at all to do with the case.
- What's that?
- Your future.
I'd like you to work for Brimmer Associates.
- Me?
- That's why I gave you the VIP tour.
We're a growing organisation.
You'd be a valuable piece of manpower.
Boy.
You really know how to toss a curve.
No, I don't mean it that way.
I'm quite serious.
You're a good man, Columbo, up here.
It's time you thought about advancement.
What does a lieutenant make?
If you come with us, I'm almost positive I can triple your yearly income.
Whew.
Boy.
I tell you, it's all so sudden.
Let me talk it over with my wife.
Of course.
Think about it carefully.
But remember, we want you here.
Listen.
I'm very flattered.
I mean that.
Just let me mull it over a little bit.
Well, while you're mulling, consider my career.
If I'd stayed with the force... by now, probably with luck, I could have been a captain of detectives.
With one eye on the promotion list, and the other eye on my car payments.
No house by the ocean.
No freedom to travel.
No... what would you say?
Power or sense of accomplishment.
Have I succeeded in getting through, in stimulating you?
Definitely.
Yes, sir.
I'm gonna give it all a lot of thought.
That's as much as I can ask.
- Er, one thing.
- Mm-hm.
If I came with you, would I still be working on the Kennicut case?
Well, let's see.
I have men who are perfectly capable of handling...
The Kennicut case?
No.
I have several other more important matters that I'd put you on right away.
Lieutenant, to the knock of opportunity.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Dry throat for some reason.
- Help yourself.
Yeah.
I hope I didn't get you into trouble before.
- I mean, I'm sorry about what happened.
- I'm used to it.
Does he blow off a lot of steam?
Let's just say our founding father has quite a temper.
No kidding.
That's funny, because he looks to me like a guy that's always under control.
He's under control most of the time.
And when people like that let go, stand back.
I'll tell you why I'm interested.
He offered me a job.
- Oh?
- Yeah.
- Welcome to the family.
- Here's my problem.
- I don't know how much to ask for.
- Whatever you can get.
Top man can pull down about 30,000.
No kidding?
That's a lot of money.
Gee.
Does anybody else here make more than that, besides Mr Brimmer?
Well, maybe Leo.
- Who's Leo?
- Leo Gentry.
- He gets the cream of the cases.
- I think I know him.
- Crew cut, ex-Marine type?
- That's Leo.
Teacher's pet, at least this month.
Hey, listen, where can I talk to him?
Maybe he can give me a few pointers.
I haven't seen him around today, but I'll get his address from personnel.
- Don't mention it to Brimmer.
- Who, me?
That's the last thing I'd do.
- Higher.
- Higher?
If you go any higher, you're gonna go over the top.
Hey, what's going on?
Mrs Gentry?
You got a terrific kid here.
Nothing frightens him.
You can't scare this boy.
- I said higher!
- Higher?
You go higher and I'll eat your ice cream.
- No, I wanna eat it.
- You wanna eat it.
All right.
Here you go.
You're coming down.
Down to earth.
There you are.
Get your ice cream.
- Do we know each other?
- No.
My name is Columbo.
I'm a lieutenant.
I'm from the police.
- My daddy's a private eye.
- I know that, Teddy.
And he's a very good one.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
- Is it about Leo's work?
- Not exactly.
I'm working on a case and I thought he could help me.
- But I can't locate him.
- He went away.
That's right.
His boss called last night and sent him on a special assignment.
Oh, I see.
Do you know where he went or how long he's gonna be away?
Sorry.
That's the way it is with Leo.
He took his passport, so I guess he's overseas somewhere.
- I see.
- Is there something wrong?
No, no, no, not really.
Listen.
Maybe you could help me out.
Was Leo recently on a case where he was following a married woman?
Well, it's possible, but I don't really know.
No?
You never discuss Leo's work?
No.
It's a household rule.
I'm not very much at keeping secrets.
If Leo told me anything, it'd be all over the Laundromat.
If you have any questions, better ask Leo.
It's hard to ask him, because I can't locate him.
He went away.
Why don't you talk to his boss, Mr Brimmer?
He can tell you what Leo's working on.
Er...
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
I have the feeling he won't be too much help, but at any rate, I'm sorry I bothered you.
Bye-bye, Ted.
F
- E-L-O-P-Z-D.
All right.
Now try the next to bottom line.
F
- D-P-T-C...
E
- O?
- Perfect vision.
- It should be.
This is a new prescription.
Here's your temporary.
Expect your license in a few weeks.
Keep this too.
Next.
While I mark your test, read from the eye chart, third line down.
- Did she just say she got new glasses?
- What?
- She wasn't wearing glasses.
- Of course she was.
- Excuse me.
- What about the eye chart?
All of a sudden I remembered this picture.
See?
She's wearing glasses.
But there were no glasses on the body.
Now, could she have dropped them somewhere?
- I'm sorry, but you're on the wrong track.
- Why?
Shortly after that picture was taken, Lenore gave up wearing glasses.
- She switched to contact lenses.
- Ah.
Contact lenses.
Just a matter of vanity.
She thought she looked better.
Uh-huh.
Did she wear 'em often?
All the time.
She was extremely near-sighted.
Mr Kennicut, where's your wife's personal effects?
The funeral director sent them over.
I've avoided going through them.
- Do you mind?
- No, go ahead.
Is this her lens case?
Yes.
It's empty.
She was probably wearing them when she died.
- Well, then, maybe...
- Maybe what?
Mr Kennicut, I'm gonna ask your permission for something.
This is the world's biggest long shot.
It's gonna be painful for you.
But I think it's worth a try.
- Would it help?
- There are no guarantees.
All right, Lieutenant.
You have a blank cheque.
Mobile operator, the number I want is 476-7301.
They just arrived and are entering the vault.
- 'The medical examiner's with them. '
- Why?
I haven't found out, but I did learn one thing.
Kennicut signed an exhumation order.
All right, stay there.
I'll be right over.
Get my car ready.
He says it won't take long.
- What's the trouble?
- I don't know, sir.
The battery's OK but the car won't start.
- I'm in a hurry.
Get me another car.
- Yes, sir.
- Have this one serviced.
I want it tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.
Arthur.
I should have phoned, but there wasn't time.
It's all right.
One of my men told me you were here.
- Something break?
- I don't know yet.
They're exhuming Lenore's body.
- Tell me why.
- The lieutenant's working on a long shot.
Apparently, she was wearing her contact lenses when she was killed.
How's that significant?
There's a chance that she might have lost one of them, maybe both of them, at the scene of the crime.
Well, Arthur, I don't like to be critical, but that's more than a long shot.
- You might as well buy a lottery ticket.
- Maybe not.
Listen to me.
My nephew wears them and half the time they're falling out.
The other morning at breakfast, one ended up in the cereal.
Mrs Kennicut is not your nephew, Lieutenant.
Mrs Kennicut was struck forcibly.
Now, let's bear that in mind.
Isn't it possible they were knocked loose?
Anything's possible.
The autopsy report said nothing about any of this at all.
Forget about that.
I checked with the medical examiner.
They snuffed it off.
They didn't bother to look.
All they were concerned about was cause of death.
Lieutenant!
Well, I hope it's not a waste.
What else can I do?
I've got to pursue every possibility.
It's almost a criminal breach to disappoint you now after what you've been through.
Move over.
Listen.
We're in luck.
The right contact lens is missing and it's not in the coffin.
Well, it might have fallen out in the morgue, I guess.
Or in the ambulance.
Or in the street.
She might have lost it before she was killed.
- Could be a hundred places.
- That's true.
But maybe, and this is what we got to hope for, maybe it's at the place where she was murdered.
- But we don't know where that place is.
- No, sir, we don't know for sure.
But I've got a few hunches.
- Unless you can be specific, I can't help.
- I think the lieutenant deserves some room.
- As you wish.
- You go your own way.
- Thank you, sir.
I will.
- But keep us posted.
Yes, sir.
I will.
I'll keep you posted.
I only wish one thing.
- I wish the murderer knew about this.
- Why?
There'd be conclusive evidence that might be lying around in his premises and he'd have to find it before we did.
I'll keep you posted, sir.
- Er...
- Lieutenant.
I'm sorry to bother you at this hour, but may I come in?
- Yes.
Come in.
- There's something I wanted to talk about.
OK, if you can make it a little brief.
It's been a late day.
Oh, sure.
Say, this is some terrific place you got here.
- And you got the sound of the ocean?
- Yeah.
Well, me, I love the beach.
I love it.
Except when the water gets cold, then I like a pool.
Did you say you had something on your mind?
Oh, yeah.
It's about that job you offered me.
I've been giving it a lot of thought.
As a matter of fact, I haven't been able to sleep and...
Boy, this is a fantastic rug.
My wife would love this rug.
We got to get a new rug and this is just the kind she wants.
Fantastic piling, huh?
Very soft.
You could lose a shoe in here for a week.
It's late.
I've still got a lot of work to do.
About my job offer?
I really don't think I'd be very happy making a change.
I like it where I am.
It's not a bad life.
Mm-hm.
OK.
Is that final?
I think so, yes.
No hard feelings?
No, no, certainly not.
I just...
Well, I think you're making a mistake.
That's all.
You're probably right.
My wife, she's always said I don't have enough ambition.
You know what it was that really made up my mind?
- What was that?
- The Kennicut case.
I don't wanna give up working on it just now.
Not when I'm so close to a solution.
Well, are you gonna let me in on it?
Oh, certainly.
Don't worry.
You'll be the first to know.
Good night.
Good night.
Hello?
Yes, this is Mr Brimmer.
You took my car in to be repaired, didn't you?
Yes, just like you said.
They'll have it for you as soon as they can.
All right, then.
Good night.
Do you mind telling us what you're doing?
I'd say that was none of your business.
Well, if you say so, but it's gonna be hard to explain, isn't it?
Breaking and entering is against the law.
Checking the trunk of your car.
What were you looking for?
Papers... for a case.
I thought they were here.
It's an emergency.
Admit it.
You were searching the trunk because that's where you hid the body.
All right.
What's the next step?
- Why don't we go downtown and talk?
- Am I under arrest?
- You could say so.
- On what evidence?
- It'll be more comfortable downtown.
- All right.
Let's get this farce over with.
Grab his arm!
It was an accident, Arthur.
It wasn't... premeditated.
I hardly knew your wife.
I didn't want to hurt either one of you.
It happened.
How'd you get it?
I got it from the cut on her cheek and your ring.
You never should have let me read your palm.
I felt the ring and the two diamonds sticking out and that raised rectangular border.
That matched up with the cut on her cheek.
You should have taken that job.
You know, we're lucky Lenore lost this.
- She didn't lose it.
- What?
When I spoke to the medical examiner at the cemetery, he told me that both contact lenses were on the body.
But that's impossible.
If it isn't hers, whose was it?
Who knows?
Anyway, it doesn't make any difference.
The fact it's not the real contact lens doesn't count.
What does count is Mr Brimmer's actions, coming here tonight, trying to get rid of that thing and doing it all in front of witnesses.
What would you have done if the car hadn't broken down?
You couldn't set up this trap.
Well, I guess we would have found some other way.
You know what this place reminds me of?
Just seeing all these cars...
In our neighbourhood, we had a bunch of jokers.
We were a real wild bunch of guys.
We figured out a perfect way to put a car out of commission.
You take a potato, you stick it in the exhaust pipe.
It doesn't cause any damage, but the car won't start.
It was a terrible thing to do.
And I got a feeling that the reason I became a cop was to make up for those jokes I played when I was a kid.
This one is as crooked as a dog's hind leg.
Fire it in the vice this afternoon.
Are those yesterday's field reports?
Yes, sir.
I want them now.
[ Teletype Clacking ]
Three more units added to security at Coastal Aircraft.
No progress on the Fairfax Insurance investigation.
We're working with their accountants on the audit.
Uh, Brooks and Wilcox are in court this morning on the Monzio divorce.
Brooks anticipates no problem.
James case looking very positive-- no negative signs in sight.
All men on surveillance have checked in except Russell, but he's in Santa Barbara and he's undercover.
Let me have the afternoon report at 5:30.
Yes, sir.
I assume our guest has arrived.
Yes, sir, but Mr. Kennicutt isn't hear yet.
Well, he's not due for another 30 seconds.
He's just coming in now.
I want you to listen very carefully, please.
My name is Arthur Kennicutt.
Mr. Brimmer's expecting me.
Oh, yes, sir.
Would you go right in, please?
Thank you.
Oh, Mr. Kennicutt.
You're right on time.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Would you care for something to drink?
Oh.
Some coffee, black.
I was just reading one of your papers.
I see you've taken a stand on this federal judgeship that's giving everybody fits.
I'd rather not talk politics right now, Mr. Brimmer, if you don't mind.
Yes, of course.
Thank you, Henry.
Well, this is your wife's file, Mr. Kennicutt, and the fact sheet shows five weeks now of intensive surveillance.
All movement, personal contact, telephone communications.
It's really quite extensive.
And?
Mr. Kennicutt, you have nothing to worry about.
It's a clean bill of health.
- You sure?
- Well, I'm not in the habit of making mistakes.
Yes.
I'm sorry, of course.
But lately it's been like waiting for a biopsy report-- benign or malignant.
Well, in this case, benign.
I don't know which I feel most, relief or anger.
Anger?
At myself-- my idiotic suspicions.
But I suppose when one marries a much younger woman, one tends to become a little paranoid.
[ Brimmer] Well, sometimes there's good cause.
In this case, not.
Read it at your leisure.
There's not a hint of another man.
You know, it's funny.
I love her.
I love her very much.
And I think I know her.
But lately I could have sworn that-- Well, it doesn't matter now.
I feel so guilty, I'm going to start showering her with gifts.
She won't know what hit her.
Mr. Brimmer, I owe you a great deal.
Well, it's a pleasure to set your mind at rest, sir.
Thank you.
And you'll have my check in the morning.
Very kind of you.
Thank you again.
Thank you.
Could you hear everything?
[ Woman ] Yes.
- Well, you seem confused.
- Well, I don't know why you asked me to come here.
- I thought it was obvious.
- No, not really.
- You--
- What you're trying to say is that I lied to your husband.
Well, that's correct, Mrs. Kennicutt.
I even went so far as to falsify the report.
- Would you like a glass of water?
- No.
Uh, nothing, thank you.
In point of fact, you were having an affair.
The man's name was Archer.
It's over, Mr. Brimmer.
But I'm sure you already know that.
It was a mistake.
[ Sighs ] A stupid mistake.
But I ended it.
And it won't ever happen again.
Why didn't you tell my husband the truth?
[ Sighs ] Oddly enough, Mrs. Kennicutt,
I am a moralist-- a vanishing species, so I'm told.
A thousand broken marriages come across my desk-- infidelities, uh, domestic deceit.
In your case, 1 0 years of marriage... and one brief indiscretion.
So, why not bend the truth a little bit?
Uh, then you're not going to tell him?
I haven't and I won't.
File's closed.
[ Exhales Deeply ]
[ Sighs ] Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Brimmer.
I am so grateful.
How grateful?
Mrs. Kennicutt, a detective agency runs on information.
That's our raw material.
Your husband owns three newspapers, two on this coast and one on the East.
Whenever anything happens on the inside of business or politics or even in the jet-set--
I still don't understand how I--
Information, Mrs. Kennicutt.
It is our only stock in trade.
For example, at the moment I'm working on case... wherein it would be very beneficial to my client... to have certain information about a federal judge that your husband is supporting.
Are you saying that you want me to be a pipeline to my husband?
No.
Just [ Sighs ] a good listener.
Is it really asking so much, Mrs. Kennicutt?
I can't do this kind of work alone.
I need that kind of help.
Why don't you think about it and we'll talk again.
[ Ice Cubes Jingling ]
Your terrace door was unlocked, so I trespassed.
Well, there's no car in the front.
Oh.
I thought you knew everything, Mr. Brimmer.
We're neighbors.
My husband and I have a weekend house about three miles from here.
Ironic, isn't it?
Why are you here?
Well, why else?
To discuss your--
What shall we call it?
Your proposition.
I've been walking on the beach for hours, thinking.
And you've come to a decision.
Oh, yes.
Tell me something, Mr. Brimmer.
How many other rich men's wives owe you favors?
Do they all capitulate easily?
I'm waiting for your answer.
Oh, indulge me.
I should think the blackmail-ee has some right.
Mrs. Kennicutt, I r-- The answer is no.
No deal.
Is that plain enough for you?
If you want a spy, you find someone else.
All right.
I'll have to call your husband in the morning and--
And what?
Tell him I had an affair?
Sorry.
It won't work.
I'm going to tell him myself.
I can't believe that you'd want to do that.
Well, what you believe really doesn't matter, does it?
It's what Arthur thinks that's important.
Maybe he'll ask for a divorce or maybe he'll forgive me.
But it's time I was honest with him.
You're being very foolish.
Only if I lose.
But you can't threaten me anymore, can you?
You just lost your leverage.
Oh, and one other thing.
I'm also going to tell him about the way you run your business.
I wouldn't advise that.
Oh, I'm sure you wouldn't.
Because whether he forgives me or not, he's gonna despise you for lying to him.
And Arthur's not the right man to have for an enemy.
Good night, Mr. Brimmer.
Mrs. Kennicutt, I want you to reconsider.
Your husband has some very powerful friends.
[ Chortles ] That's right.
Now, if you'll please excuse me.
I cannot permit you to do that.
Well, you don't understand.
It's not your choice.
You let go of me!
Let go!
[ Glass Shatters ]
[ Car Horn Blaring ]
[ Siren Approaching ]
[ Siren Dies Out ]
[ Engine Stops ]
What's the trouble, Officer?
May I see your license and registration?
Turn signal, right?
The right one.
You know, it's the second time I got stopped today.
I tell you, I'll get those things fixed as soon as I can.
- You'll get 'em fixed now.
- I would, but I'm on my way to a 1 87 P.C.
- Say, are you a cop?
- Uh, yeah, a lieutenant-
- Columbo.
Well, I'm sorry, Lieutenant, I flagged you down.
Well, that's all right.
You're just doing your job.
Listen, I'll get those things fixed.
This license expires next week.
Oh.
Oh, well, thanks.
Say, I better give you an escort.
That way you'll get where you wanna go.
Oh.
Okay.
Appreciate that.
But listen, not too fast.
[ Police Radio Chatter ]
Can't tell for sure, but I don't think she was killed her.
Looks like the body was moved.
And the cause of death?
Probably a severe concussion.
Print team all wrapped up, Captain.
Nothing.
There were two blows.
Uh, send them on home.
Laceration on the cheek and major contusion at the base of the skull.
How do you read that?
It's hard to say.
Maybe somebody hit her and she struck her head going down.
- Lieutenant, you got that?
- I'll know more about this after the autopsy.
Uh, yeah.
Got a match?
Plus the approximate time of death.
No.
No tire tracks we can use.
Got a match?
I'm sorry.
I don't smoke.
Oh.
No prints.
Just smudges.
Money?
just change.
No currency.
You got a match.
No, I don't.
Sorry.
Got a match.
Yeah, sure.
[ Captain ] We're all finished here.
You can load it up.
Identification and purse.
Mrs. Arthur Kennicutt-- the Arthur Kennicutt.
How do you know that?
Credit card's made out to Kennicutt Publications.
What's the problem?
Newspapers.
If we don't handle this according to Kennicutt's satisfaction, he's got an awful lot of front pages to beat us over the head with.
Thought I told you to move that out of here.
Lieutenant, what are you looking at?
The bruise, sir.
The lady has a bruise on the left cheek.
We know that.
I knew you weren't listening.
[ Police Radio Chatter Continues ]
It's Lenore.
I wanna get out of here.
Oh.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Would you like to be alone for a few moments?
No, no.
I can feel sorry for myself some other time, after you've caught him.
Well, should we get down to business?
Are you sure there's nothing else you want?
As the husband, I'm the most likely suspect, correct?
Uh-- You don't have to worry about my feelings, Lieutenant.
She was killed last night.
What time?
Between 8:00 and 9:00.
Well, I was in San Francisco addressing a conference.
I didn't fly back until this morning.
Uh, you have the flight numbers on that?
My secretary can give them to you, together with my hotel and my schedule.
You'll check them all out, naturally.
Yes, sir.
And when you do, you'll dismiss me as a possibility... and then get down to the real business of finding the real killer.
And I want him found, Lieutenant.
Soon.
I'll do my best.
I'm sure you will.
Uh, Mr. Kennicutt, it would help if you could tell us a few things.
Did your wife have any enemies?
Lenore never offended a soul.
She was an extraordinary woman.
I see.
This question is a bit awkward, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask it-- was there ever, uh, another man in her life?
Naturally.
More than one.
But that was years ago, before we were married.
- No, sir.
I meant since you were married.
- You're speaking of an affair?
Well, I'm afraid we're gonna have to consider it.
Well, don't bother.
Lenore was faithful to me in every way.
She had a clean bill of health.
All right.
Clean bill of health.
So you don't think we ought to go in that direction?
No, I don't.
All right.
Can you tell us about her habits?
What did she do in her spare time?
Nothing unusual.
Shopping, charity work.
Sports.
Sports.
What kind of sports did she play?
Oh, tennis.
She was also very fond of skin diving.
Yes.
Uh, did she do this with you, sir?
Did she do it with friends?
With friends, Lieutenant.
Female friends, in case you're wondering.
Female friends.
All right, sir.
I think I've got enough to start with.
Thank you very much.
Lieutenant,
I want you to understand something.
I married a woman young enough to be my daughter.
A lot of people were skeptical, but it worked for us.
We loved each other.
We loved each other very much.
We even thought of having a child.
I want this man caught.
And I must warn you, I don't intend to be patient.
Yes, sir.
Oh, Lieutenant.
Thanks for the coffee.
You're welcome, sir.
Good morning, Lieutenant.
Good morning, sir.
Would you like some coffee, some juice?
Uh, nothing for me.
No.
Thank you very much.
Any progress?
Uh, no, sir.
I hate to admit this, but, uh, nothing.
Not a single lead?
No, sir.
Nothing.
Well, uh-
- Well, some of my associates think... that, uh, your wife was mugged and the fella ran away with the money.
But, um, you see, they can't really explain how the body was moved.
And, uh, now, me, I don't know.
I, uh-
- I think she knew the murderer.
Why?
Excuse me.
[ Ringing ]
Yes.
Yes?
All right.
Be right in.
Why?
Well, her behavior seems a little strange, sir.
Uh, she went out to the beach house in the middle of the week, which is unusual.
And, uh, she said to the caretaker she had some thinking to do... and then she went for a walk.
And then the next morning her body was found on the other side of town.
What are you getting at?
I wish I knew.
I don't know.
It's just that it sounds to me like a woman that has a problem.
Now, did your wife have any personal problems?
My wife was a very happy woman.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, it's just that if she did have a problem,
I thought that maybe it would be connected with the murder.
But you've no proof of that.
Oh, no, sir.
No.
Lieutenant, I call the City Room every half hour to find out what you people are doing.
So far, not a word.
No arrest-- not even a promise of one.
Now you tell me you haven't a lead.
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Kennicutt.
Uh, looks like it's gonna be slow.
It doesn't have to be.
Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Columbo, this is Mr. Brimmer.
How do you do?
Lieutenant.
You've heard of Brimmer Associates?
Uh, no, I haven't.
Well, it's security and investigations, Lieutenant.
You might say you and I are in the same business.
Oh, really?
Matter of fact, I was talking about you just last night.
I ran into the commissioner at a party.
He speaks very highly of you.
Naturally, you're wondering why Mr. Brimmer's here.
Now, please don't take this as a reflection on you, but I've engaged his firm to work on the case.
Well, now, Arthur, I'm here in an advisory capacity-- a supplemental capacity only.
I don't want the lieutenant to get the idea that I'm competing with him.
Uh, but there's no reason why a private agency and a public one... can't cooperate, is there?
No.
You see, I want as much coverage in this case as possible.
And when Mr. Brimmer called and offered his services,
I thought it was an excellent idea.
Sure, uh, I can understand that.
Uh, you two know each other?
Well, Mr. Brimmer's done some work for me.
I see.
I see.
[ Clears Throat ]
Some kind of security work?
Guards for the paper?
Oh, it was a personal matter.
The point is, Lieutenant,
I told Arthur on the phone I couldn't imagine you wouldn't accept a helping hand... considering the manpower shortage in your department.
You see, Mr. Brimmer used to be a police officer himself.
[ Brimmer] Well, it was a long time ago.
But at least I can understand your problems, Lieutenant.
Well, now, listen, I said to Mr. Kennicutt I'm grateful for all the help I can get.
I'm just not sure how my superior's gonna take this.
That's already been taken care of.
It's just that Mr. Kennicutt is anxious for a quick resolution to the case.
You can understand that.
Well, naturally.
[ Brimmer ] Well, good.
I hope the association will be beneficial to you.
Oh, I'm sure it will.
Yeah.
You know, I suddenly feel very much more optimistic about this whole thing.
Uh, it's not based on anything, no facts, but, you know, I'm a superstitious guy.
You know, I believe in signs.
I believe in palmistry and astrology and all that kinda thing.
You don't, I know that.
Oh, definitely not.
Let me see your hand.
You see, Mr. Kennicutt, that's your fate line and it breaks there.
That was your bad fortune.
But it picks up again, and that's interesting.
That's a very good omen.
May I?
Mmm.
Deep line of Apollo.
That's a man devoted to his work.
Your Apollo line crosses the mound of the Moon.
You know, that's very rare.
And very impressive.
That's the sign of a man who's destined to attain a very particular kind of distinction.
That's a very good sign.
I know you think it's silly, but I'm gonna make a believer out of you before I'm done.
It was very nice meeting you.
Nice to have met you.
Bye-bye.
Oh, Mr. Brimmer.
Large thumb, low mound of Venus.
That means ambition, purposefulness.
That's a closet, Lieutenant.
[ Chuckles ] Oh, gee.
I'm sorry.
A lot of people make the same mistake.
Say, that's a terrific-looking set of clubs.
Do you mind?
Go ahead.
These seem light.
Are these ladies' clubs?
- They were Lenore's.
- You didn't say she played golf, did you?
You mentioned tennis and skin diving.
- That's because she just started.
- Ahh.
I see.
Where'd she play?
At the country club.
I see.
At the club.
Well, I was just wondering why she just didn't keep her clubs in the locker room?
She did.
That's an extra set she used to take lessons with.
Oh, I see.
Well, that explains it.
Right.
Uh, you mean she didn't take lessons at her own club?
She took them someplace else?
Sky Lane.
Why, is it important?
It's not important.
It's just I like to get that background information very precise if I can.
Bye.
- Is this the right door?
- [ Chuckles ] Yes.
Well, what was that all about?
Well, I think, uh, police techniques have changed a little over the years.
Here, try it again.
And remember, keep the back of your left hand straight.
None of this.
just stroke it easy, all right?
Oh, that was good.
You're getting better.
Well, I still don't think I'm ever gonna learn this game.
Oh, you just have to keep your eye on the ball, watch your concentration.
You're coming along fine.
Do we have time for another bucket?
Sorry, Jenny.
Time's up.
Tomorrow, 3:00.
Tomorrow then.
You a member of the club?
Uh, no.
No, I'm, uh, Lieutenant Columbo.
I'm from the police.
[ Mumbles ]
What's the problem?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about a Lenore Kennicutt.
Uh, you knew her?
Not very well.
I gave her a few lessons.
I see.
Uh, well, this is your appointment book, isn't it?
Well, you should know.
You've been looking at it.
Well, no offense.
I was just killing time.
But, uh, you know, now that you mention it,
I see that you gave her a lot of lessons.
She liked the game.
I see.
Well, look here's the thing.
Um, since you spent a lot of time with her,
I was wondering if you could give me some help.
How?
Was she the type of woman-- now this is just between you and me-- was she the type of woman who was on the lookout?
I mean, did you ever notice her give her eye to any of the men around here?
Uh, look, Lieutenant.
We better get one thing straight.
I teach them golf and I play in their tournaments, but I don't get involved in their personal lives.
If they wanna pair off, that's none of my business.
Okay.
All right.
Uh, well, thanks a lot.
It's quite all right.
Take it easy.
Uh, say, uh, what kind of club is this?
Oh, that's a number one wood.
Number one wood.
Listen, uh, could you give me a lesson?
What?
No, I'm serious.
You know what my trouble is?
I work too hard.
Never out of the office.
I figure this:
if I could take up a sport, get out in the fresh air and get some exercise, that'd do me some good.
- What do you say?
- Well, I-- just for a few minutes.
just to, you know, start to swing.
Come on.
Say, you know what was a funny thing about your appointments with Mrs. Kennicutt?
Uh, the first two were in the morning... and all the rest, and I counted 1 3 of them, uh, they were always in the middle or the late afternoon.
So?
Uh, well, I guess it's not important.
I guess it's nothing.
Uh, wait a minute.
I'll take off my coat.
Except that, uh, now, every time you had an appointment with Mrs. Kennicutt, it was always the last lesson of the day.
I like to finish at a reasonable hour.
Doesn't everyone?
Oh, I see.
So those days, you left the club.
I thought maybe you'd hang around to see if you could pick up an odd lesson.
Well, I didn't always go home.
Oh, who said anything about going home?
Oh.
What I mean is I didn't always leave the club.
Sometimes--
Hey, listen.
Can I help you out?
Don't say anything else.
You don't have an attorney.
Wait until you get an attorney.
This way you can hurt your case.
Believe me, I know something about my business.
I don't know nothing about golf, you know.
See that's your business.
I know something about my business.
And believe me, you know, down through the years, uh, you get so that you develop a nose for things, you see?
And, uh--
After a while, the old nose just tells you when someone's not giving you the truth.
Now, uh, I'm gonna forget about the lesson, 'cause I could never learn this game, but I'll be back to talk to you.
Ground covered by the police is not our concern.
One thing to bear in mind, money was taken.
Granted, it could have been a smoke screen, but sometimes the obvious answer is the correct one.
Now, Brooks-- Yes, sir?
Check into her banking account with particular attention to withdrawals.
See if you can find out how much cash she was carrying that day.
Mr. Kennicutt will be glad to cooperate.
Now, my theory, gentlemen, and you will gear your efforts in this direction,
Mrs. Kennicutt was walking along the Pacific Coast Highway.
She was forced into a car... by someone.
The motive was robbery.
She probably fought back.
In any case, she was killed.
The murderer drove around in a panic... and finally all the way out to here, where he got rid of the body.
[ Intercom Buzzer ] Yes?
[ Woman ] Lieutenant Columbo to see you.
Who?
Oh, yes.
Yes, send him in.
Gentlemen, we'll finish this later.
I'll call you.
Thank you.
Lieutenant!
Come in.!
Whew!
Boy.
This is quite a building.
This all yours?
'Fraid so.
Must be a lot of business for your kinda company these days.
Well, we can't handle it all.
Sit down.
Uh, listen, your secretary called.
She said you wanted to see the files on the case, so I thought it'd be a lot safer if I brought 'em over myself.
Oh.
That's very nice of you.
It wasn't necessary, but I appreciate it very much.
Uh, want some coffee?
No.
No, thanks.
Thank you.
Uh, those are the duplicates.
Okay.
Yes, this will help.
A lot of it.
I wonder if you can give me a little rundown.
Well, it's just what I told Mr. Kennicutt.
No leads.
Except, you know, I was looking through that stuff last night.
Mm-hmm.
And, uh, drives my wife crazy, you know.
Because we have the lamp right next to the bed, and the poor thing, she can't sleep.
Did you find anything?
No, not really.
Well, uh, take the autopsy report.
Yes.
Here it is.
You see now, that jibed with something that I noticed about the body... the first time I saw it, and that bothered me.
Mrs. Kennicutt was struck on the left cheek, and she had a bruise.
And she had a weird kinda cut.
Um--
Do you see what I mean?
Um, no.
I don't think so.
Well, let's start with the cut, because that's what bothered me.
I said to myself, ""Now what in the world could have caused that kind of cut?"
Uh, does this lighter work?
Yeah, I think so.
Uh--
Uh, wh-- where was I?
About the cut.
Oh, yes.
What could have caused the cut?
I said to myself, ""It could be a ring."
A ring of-
- You mean a finger ring.
This kind of ring.
Yeah, something like that.
Now here's the way I figured it.
Suppose you were gonna strike somebody.
Suppose it was a woman.
Now, do you punch her?
Well, maybe.
But more than likely, you hit with your open hand.
Either this way or this way.
Mm-hmm.
Now, if you hit this way, then the ring is not gonna cause any cut.
So I figured it was a backhand blow like this.
All right?
I still don't follow you too well, because that would, uh, that would put it over on--
But I used my right hand, you see?
Yeah.
And if the ring was on the right hand, then the bruise would be on the right cheek.
But it was on the left cheek, so the murderer was left-handed.
Struck her like this.
Which means the murderer is left-handed.
Well, that's interesting.
That's provided, of course, all these, uh, speculations are valid.
Yeah, I would say that we have a left-handed murderer, and, uh, and an unpremeditated crime.
We have?
Oh, I think so, yes.
I mean, I don't think a man kills with his hands unless he's angry.
As a matter of fact, you know, maybe he didn't mean to do it.
Could be.
You know, maybe it was an accident.
You know, I got a feeling that when we find our friend, it's gonna turn out that he has a terrible temper.
Hmm.
[ Chuckles ]
Well, maybe you're right.
I certainly wish I had your crystal ball, Lieutenant.
Why don't you let me digest this material, and then we'll talk again.
Okay.
All right.
Fine.
Sure.
Listen.
I want to thank you for the time.
Listen.
Thank you.
Right.
Oh, listen, before I forget, uh--
Gee whiz.
I didn't wanna forget that.
But, uh, let's see.
I had a receipt here that I wanted you to sign.
Well, listen, let's just make one up.
It's a receipt for the files.
Isn't that weird?
- What a coincidence.
- What's that?
Here, a moment ago, we were talking about left-handed people, and you're left-handed.
And right-handed.
I'm ambidextrous.
That means I don't favor either hand particularly.
It's a character trait shared by about 1 0% of the world's population.
Ten percent?
No kidding?
Anything else?
Uh, no.
No, I don't think so.
Uh, oh, listen.
This is a little bit off the subject.
My sister-in-law, she wants to buy a place out at the beach.
How do you like it out there?
Who told you I was living out at the beach?
Well, no one.
I-
- I noticed your car out in front of Mr. Kennicutt's.
You know, you parked it there in the driveway.
As I was walking by, I saw the chrome was tarnished.
You know what the salt air does to it.
It just eats the life out of it.
Yeah, that part's a problem, all right.
Uh, you're a very observant man, Lieutenant.
That's not what my wife says.
[ Laughs ]
Well, you tell your sister-in-law that she will love it at the beach... if she doesn't mind that problem with the salt air on the chrome.
I'll give her that message.
And thanks again.
Thank you.
Oh, uh, say.
Have you ever been in Mr. Kennicutt's house?
Yes, I met you there.
No, I didn't mean the big house.
I meant out at the beach.
I was just wondering, because your beach house and his beach house, they're fairly close, aren't they?
No.
It's a couple miles.
That close?
Tsk.
Isn't that a coincidence?
[ Chuckles ]
I'll tell you, this case is just full of 'em.
[ Door Closes ]
[ Sighs ] Why don't you and I take a walk?
When you showed up today, I-
- I kinda panicked.
Then you did have an affair with her?
Turning on the ladies is about the only thing I do well.
I'm not a very good golfer.
Yeah, go on.
Well, it was pretty good for a while-- at least for me.
She got the guilts.
Funny thing, I think she really loved her husband.
One day she said, ""Ken, this is bad for both of us.
Let's call it off." So we did.
Must have shook you up when we found her dead.
I couldn't believe it.
Then I got to thinking, sooner or later, you guys would find out about me.
Maybe even think I killed her.
The night she died, I was-- I was home watching the tube.
No calls.
No company.
No alibi.
That's-- That's why I started to run.
Uh-huh.
I can understand that.
You didn't kill her.
No, no.
I know that, but this afternoon, you gave me the impression--
No.
You're in the clear.
You got nothing to worry about.
You see, whoever did this, he had to wear a ring.
Now, you don't wear a ring.
Well, I could have taken it off.
No, not with that tan, because that would show.
Now listen.
Tell me something.
Mrs. Kennicutt--
Did Mrs. Kennicutt ever indicate to you... that she was concerned that her husband knew about you two?
No.
That's funny that you mention it though, because, well, I was concerned.
Why?
Well, Lenore never saw anyone, but I'm sure we were being followed.
By who?
Well, there was this one guy in particular.
Sharp, well-dressed.
I only caught him in flashes, but--
Well, he-- he had a crew cut.
Kind of an ex-marine type.
[ Telephone Ringing ]
- Yes?
- Wilcox, Mr. Brimmer.
The subject is meeting with Archer, and they've engaged in conversation.
Did you overhear anything?
No, sir.
But Archer seems to be doing most of the talking.
Maintain the surveillance and report to me in the morning.
Yes, sir.
[ Phone Ringing ] Why, you little bum, you.
Hello?
Oh, yes, he is.
Leo.
Mr. Brimmer.
- Yes, sir?
- I'm sorry to trouble you at home, Leo.
No sweat.
just playing with Teddy.
Well, I've got a little something I want you to do for me.
It may complicate your life a little bit.
- When?
- Immediately.
- Set it up through my secretary.
- Yes, sir.
I'll be in touch.
Every one of our operatives is a skilled marksman.
Actually, our policy is to avoid the use of the weapon.
This is our memory bank, Lieutenant.
Millions of bits of information, all cross-filed and on tape, immediately available.
There are more electrical impulses in this room than in your brain.
Hard to believe.
[ Chuckles ]
We here at Brimmer Associates use the most up-to-date equipment.
Years ahead of what you use at police headquarters.
Company cars-- custom designed for us.
Most of them with telephonic or radio communication.
Phew!
It's very impressive.
Oh, uh, just one moment, Lieutenant.
One other thing that might interest you.
If you'll just move past this gate.
- It's not working.
- Well, it has to be.
You're carrying a gun, aren't you, Lieutenant?
No.
No?
Oh.
Well, that explains the malfunction.
Look here.
A special system is built into the gate.
Now, if you had a gun, it would have registered.
It's just like out at the airport.
It's a security precaution.
Not that we expect our clients to be carrying concealed weapons, but, uh, well, there have been a few exceptions.
Really?
Well, a guy came in here just about a month ago.
Harmless looking.
An accountant for Mid-Century Oil.
We were doing a company audit.
[ Brimmer ] Mr. Denning?
I asked you to show the lieutenant around.
I did not suggest that you discuss our confidential matters... with anyone at anytime.!
Our clients pay us to be discreet.
Yes, sir.
Won't you come in, Lieutenant?
Sorry about the outburst, but my people have got to learn.
This is a business of trust.
I can't have them gossiping about the clients.
Thank you, Henry.
Hope you'll have lunch with me.
Like quenelle of sole?
Uh, well, if it's fish, I like fish.
I love fish.
Yeah, it's fish.
Drop your coat and dig in.
On the Kennicutt case, my men have come up with an interesting lead.
There were two derelicts seen in the area.
I have their description.
I sent them over to your office, copies.
Right.
Uh, I'll have that checked out.
Anything new on your end?
Uh, oh, yeah.
Yeah, we got a couple of things.
It seems as though Mrs. Kennicutt was having an affair, you see?
Uh--
Boy, this is delicious.
How do you make this stuff?
I'll have a recipe sent over to you.
You were saying?
Oh, yeah.
Uh, it seems as though...
Mrs. Kennicutt, uh, she was having an affair.
And, uh-- Oh?
And, uh-- Oh, listen, when you send the recipe, would you send it to the house?
- Don't send it to the office.
- Yes, I'll send it to your house.
Yeah, she was having an affair with some golf pro at some country club.
And, uh, here's the interesting thing.
Not only were they having an affair, but it seems as though they were being watched.
Now I got this nutty notion.
Suppose Mr. Kennicutt, uh--
I'll tell you, it's too far-fetched.
Sometimes it helps to test it out.
Try me.
It's really crazy.
Well, listen.
It doesn't cost anything.
Suppose-- Suppose Mr. Kennicutt... hired somebody to check up on his wife.
And this somebody lied to him.
He said to Mr. Kennicutt, ""Look.
Your wife, she's got a clean bill of health."
Now this somebody, whoever it is, he's in a perfect position to blackmail Mrs. Kennicutt.
Now suppose she refuses.
See?
She says, ""No, I'm gonna go tell my husband."
Hmm.
I think it's a terrific motive, don't you?
Lieutenant, you have a marvelously convoluted mind.
I do?
I like it.
The trouble with your theory is, not only is it very tenuous, but it's impossible to prove, isn't it?
I, uh-
- Oh.
Got a little tomato on that there.
Well, I said it was nutty.
What do you think?
You think I oughta drop it, hmm?
[ Clears Throat ] If you believe in it, stick to it.
Run it on down.
One other thing you should keep in mind.
Nothing at all to do with the case.
- What's that?
- Your future.
I'd like you to work for Brimmer Associates.
Me?
That's why I had you taken on a V.I.P. tour.
We're a growing organization.
You can see that.
You'll be a valuable piece of manpower for us.
Oh, boy.
You really know how to toss a curve.
No, no, I don't mean it that way.
I'm quite serious.
You're a good man, Columbo-- up here.
It's time you were thinking about advancement.
What does a lieutenant make?
If you come with us,
I'm almost positive I can triple your yearly income.
Whew!
Boy.
I'll tell you, it's all so sudden.
Uh, let me talk it over with my wife.
Of course talk it over with your wife.
Think about it carefully.
But remember, we want you here.
Listen.
I'm very flattered.
I mean that.
just let me mull it over a little bit.
Well, while you're mulling, consider my career.
If I'd stayed with the force, by now, probably with luck,
I could have been a captain of detectives.
Hmm?
With one eye on the promotion list, and the other eye on my car payments.
No house by the ocean.
No freedom to travel.
No-- what would you say?
Power or sense of accomplishment.
Have I succeeded in getting through--
[ Clears Throat ] in stimulating you?
Definitely.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I'm gonna give it all a lot of thought.
That's as much as I can ask.
Uh, one thing.
Hmm?
If I came with you, would I still be working on the Kennicutt case?
Well, let's see.
I have men who are perfectly capable of handling the Kennicutt case.
No.
I have several other matters that are far more important than that I'd like to put you on right away.
Lieutenant, to the knock of opportunity.
Hey.
Hi.
Dry throat for some reason.
Oh, help yourself.
Yeah.
Hey, I hope I didn't get you into trouble before.
I mean, I'm sorry about what happened.
I'm used to it.
Why?
Does he blow off a lot of steam?
Well, let's just say our founding father has quite a temper.
No kidding.
That's funny, because he-- he looks to me like he's a guy that's always under control.
Uh, correction.
He's under control most of the time.
And when people like that let go, stand back.
Oh.
I'll tell you why I'm interested.
He offered me a job.
Oh?
Yeah.
Well, welcome to the family.
Yeah, here's my problem.
I don't know how much to ask for.
Whatever you can get.
Top man can pull down about 30,000.
No kidding?
[ Whistles ] That's a lot of money.
Gee, listen.
Does anybody else here make more than that?
I mean, besides Mr. Brimmer?
Well, maybe Leo.
Who's Leo?
Leo Gentry.
He's the boy who gets the cream of the cases.
Hey, I think I know him.
Crew cut, ex-marine type?
Yeah, that's Leo.
Teacher's pet, at least this month.
Hey, listen.
Where can I talk to him?
Maybe he can give me a few pointers.
Oh.
I haven't seen him around yet today, but, uh--
I'll get his address from Personnel.
Uh, don't mention it to Brimmer.
Who me?
No.
That's the last thing I'd do.
[ Children Chattering ]
Higher.
Higher?
Listen.
If you go any higher, you're gonna go right over the top.
Hey, what's going on?
Mrs. Gentry?
I wanna tell you, you got a terrific kid here.
Nothing frightens him.
You can't scare this boy.
I said higher!
Higher?
All right, listen.
You go higher, and I'll eat your ice cream, all right?
No, I wanna eat it.
You wanna eat it.
All right.
Here you go.
You're coming down.
Down to earth.
There you are.
Get your ice cream.
Do we know each other?
Uh, no.
Uh, my name is Columbo.
I'm a lieutenant.
I'm from the police.
My daddy's a private eye.
I know that, Teddy.
And he's a very good one.
Listen.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
- Well, is it about Leo's work?
- Well, not exactly.
I'm working on a case, and I thought maybe he could help me out.
- But I can't seem to locate him.
- He went away.
That's right, Lieutenant.
His boss called last night... and sent him on a special assignment.
Oh, I see.
Uh, do you know where he went?
Or, uh, how long he's gonna be away?
Sorry.
That's the way it is with Leo.
He took his passport, so I guess he's overseas somewhere.
I see.
Is there something wrong?
No, no, no.
No, not really.
Listen.
Maybe you could help me out.
Was Leo recently on a case where he was following a woman?
A married woman?
Well, it's-- it's possible, but I don't really know.
No?
You never discuss Leo's work?
No.
It's a household rule.
I mean, I'm not very much at keeping secrets.
If Leo were to tell me anything, it'd be all over the Laundromat.
If you have any questions, you better ask Leo.
It's kinda hard to ask him, because I can't locate him.
He went away.
But why don't you talk to his boss, Mr. Brimmer?
He can tell you what Leo's working on.
Uh, oh, yeah.
I, uh-
- Thanks.
I have the feeling he won't be too much help.
But, uh, at any rate, uh, I'm sorry I bothered you.
Bye-bye, Teddy.
F-E-L-O-P-
Z-D.
All right.
Now try the next to the bottom line.
F-D-P-
T-C-E-O?
Perfect vision.
Well, it should be.
This is a new prescription.
Here's your temporary.
You should have your license in a few weeks.
Thank you very much.
Keep this too.
Next.
Now, while I mark your test, please read from the eye chart, third line down.
Did that lady say that she just got a new pair of glasses?
- What?
- [ Slams Counter]
- She wasn't wearing glasses.
- Of course she was.
Excuse me.
Uh, wait.
What about the eye chart?
And all of a sudden, I remembered this picture.
See?
She's wearing glasses.
But there were no glasses on the body.
Now, could she have dropped them somewhere?
I'm sorry, Lieutenant, but you're on the wrong track.
Why?
Well, shortly after that picture was taken,
Lenore gave up wearing glasses.
She switched to contact lenses.
Ah, contact lenses.
just a matter of vanity.
She thought she looked better.
Uh-huh.
Did she wear 'em often?
All the time.
She was extremely nearsighted.
Mr. Kennicutt, where's your wife's personal effects?
The funeral director sent them over.
I've avoided going through them.
Do you mind?
No, go ahead.
This her lens case?
Yes.
It's empty.
Well, she was probably wearing them when she died.
Well, then maybe, uh--
Maybe what?
Mr. Kennicutt, I'm gonna ask your permission for something.
This is the world's biggest long shot.
And it's gonna be painful for you.
But I think it's worth a try.
Would it help?
There are no guarantees.
All right, Lieutenant.
You have a blank check.
Mobile Operator, the number I want is 47 6-7301 .
[ Line Ringing ] They just arrived, and they're entering the vault.
The medical examiner's with them.
Why?
What's the reason?
Haven't been able to find out, sir, but I did learn one thing.
Kennicutt signed an exhumation order.
All right, stay there.
I'll be right over.
Get my car ready.
He says it won't take long.
[ Car Ignition Grinding ]
[ Ignition Continues Grinding ]
What's the trouble?
I don't know, sir.
The battery's okay, but the car won't start.
[ Ignition Grinding ] I'm in a hurry.
Get me another car.
Yes, sir.
Have this one serviced.
Tell them I want it tomorrow.
Yes, sir.
[ Tires Squealing ]
[ Police Radio Chatter]
[ Police Radio Chatter Continues ]
Arthur.
I should have phoned you, but there wasn't time.
Well, it's all right.
One of my men told me you were here.
Something break?
I don't know yet.
They're exhuming Lenore's body.
Tell me why.
Well, the lieutenant's working on a long shot.
Apparently, she was wearing her contact lenses when she was killed.
How's that significant?
Well, there's a chance that she might have lost one of them-- maybe both of them at the scene of the crime.
Well, Arthur, I don't like to be critical, but that's more than a long shot.
You might as well buy a lottery ticket.
Maybe not.
Listen to me.
My nephew wears those things, and half of the time they're falling out.
Now, the other morning at breakfast, one of them ended up in the cereal.
[ Brimmer ] Mrs. Kennicutt is not your nephew, Lieutenant.
Listen.
Mrs. Kennicutt was struck forcibly.
Now let's bear that in mind.
Why isn't it possible that they were knocked loose?
Anything's possible.
The autopsy report said nothing about any of this at all.
Listen.
Forget about the autopsy report.
I checked with the medical examiner about that.
They snuffed it off.
They didn't even bother to look.
All they were concerned about was the cause of death.
[ Man ] Lieutenant.
Well, I hope it's not a waste.
What else can I do?
I've got to pursue every possibility.
Arthur, it's almost a criminal breach... to disappoint you now after what you've been through.
Move over.
Listen.
We're in luck.
The right contact lens is missing, and it's not in the coffin.
Well, it might have fallen out in the morgue, I guess.
Or in the ambulance.
Or in the street.
She might have lost it before she was killed.
Could be a hundred places.
That's true, but maybe-- and this is what we gotta hope for-- maybe it's at the place where she was murdered.
[ Kennicutt ] But we don't know where that place is.
[ Columbo ] No, sir, we don't.
We don't know for sure.
But I've got a few hunches.
Unless you can be specific, I can't help.
I think the lieutenant deserves some room.
Don't you?
As you wish.
You go your own way, Lieutenant.
Thank you, sir.
I will.
But keep us posted.
Yes, sir.
I will.
I'll keep you posted.
[ Sighs ]
I only wish one thing.
I wish the murderer knew about this.
Why?
There'd be a piece of conclusive evidence that might be lying around in his premises, and he'd have to find it before we did.
I'll keep you posted, sir.
[ Doorbell Rings ]
Oh, uh, Mr. Brimmer.
Lieutenant.
Listen.
I'm sorry to bother you at this hour, but, uh-
- May I come in?
Yes, sure.
Come on in.
There's something I wanted to talk to you about.
Okay.
Fine, if you can make it a little brief.
It's been a late day.
Oh, sure.
Say, this is some terrific place you got here.
And you got the sound of the ocean all the time, huh?
Yeah.
Well, me, I love the beach.
I love it.
Except when the water gets cold, then I don't like to go in.
Then I like a pool.
Lieutenant, did you say you had something on your mind?
Oh, yeah.
It's about that job you offered me.
I've been giving it a lot of thought.
Uh, as a matter of fact, uh, I haven't been able to sleep.
And, uh--
Boy, this is a fantastic rug.
My wife would love this rug.
We gotta get a new rug, and this is just the kind she wants.
Fantastic piling, huh?
Very soft.
Bet you could lose a shoe in here for a week, you wouldn't find it.
It's late.
I still got a lot of work to do.
You were talking about my job offer.
I really don't think I'd be very happy making a change, you know.
I like it where I am.
It's not a bad life.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Uh, is that final?
I think so, yes.
No hard feelings?
No, no, certainly not.
I just, uh--
Well, I think you're making a mistake.
That's all.
You're probably right.
You know, my wife, she's always said I don't have enough ambition.
You know what it was that really made up my mind?
What was that?
The Kennicutt case.
I don't wanna give up working on it just now.
Not when I'm so close to a solution.
Well, uh, are you gonna let me in on it?
Oh, certainly.
Don't worry.
You'll be the first to know.
Good night.
Good night.
[ Car Door Closes ] [ Engine Starts ]
[ Vehicle Departs ]
- Hello?
- Yes, this is Mr. Brimmer.
You took my car in to be repaired, didn't you?
Yes, sir.
Just like you said.
They'll try to have it for you as soon as they can.
All right then.
Good night.
[ Footsteps ]
[ Keys Jingling ]
[ Car Door Opens, Closes ]
You mind telling us what you're doing?
I'd say that was none of your business, Lieutenant.
Well, if you say so, but, uh, it's gonna be kinda hard to explain, isn't it?
I mean, breaking and entering?
That's against the law.
Checking the trunk of your car.
What in the world were you looking for?
Papers... for a case.
I thought they were here.
It's an emergency.
Why don't you admit it?
You were searching the trunk, 'cause that's where you hid the body.
All right.
What's the next step?
Why don't we go downtown and talk it over?
Am I under arrest?
I guess you could say so.
On what evidence?
I think it's gotta be more comfortable downtown.
All right.
Let's get this farce over with.
Grab his arm!
It was an accident, Arthur.
It wasn't... premeditated.
I hardly knew your wife.
I didn't want to hurt either one of you.
It happened.
How'd you get it?
I got it from the cut on her cheek and your ring.
You never should have let me read your palm.
'Cause then I felt the ring and I felt the two diamonds sticking out... and that raised rectangular border.
That matched up with the cut on her cheek.
You should have taken that job.
You know, we're lucky Lenore lost this.
Uh, she didn't lose it.
What?
When I spoke to the medical examiner at the cemetery, he told me that both contact lenses were on the body.
But that's impossible.
If it isn't hers, whose was it?
Who knows?
Anyway, it doesn't make any difference.
The fact that it's not the real contact lens, that doesn't count.
What does count is Mr. Brimmer's actions-- coming here tonight, trying to get rid of that thing... and doing it all in front of witnesses.
What would you have done if the car hadn't broken down?
You couldn't set up this trap.
Well, I guess we would have found some other way.
You know what this place reminds me of?
just seeing all these cars--
You know, in our neighborhood, we had a bunch of jokers.
I mean, we were a real wild bunch of guys.
And we figured out a perfect way to put a car out of commission.
You take a potato, you stick it in the exhaust pipe.
It doesn't cause any damage, but the car won't start.
It was a terrible thing to do.
And I got a feeling... that the reason I became a cop was to make up for all those jokes I played when I was a kid.
This one is as crooked as a dog's hind leg.
Fire it in the vice this afternoon.
Are those yesterday's field reports?
Yes, sir.
I want them now.
[Teletype Clacking]
Three more units added to security at Coastal Aircraft.
No progress on the Fairfax Insurance investigation.
We're working with their accountants on the audit.
Uh, Brooks and Wilcox are in court this morning on the Monzio divorce.
Brooks anticipates no problem.
James case looking very positive...
no negative signs in sight.
All men on surveillance have checked in except Russell, but he's in Santa Barbara and he's undercover.
Let me have the afternoon report at 5:30.
Yes, sir.
I assume our guest has arrived.
Yes, sir, but Mr. Kennicutt isn't hear yet.
Well, he's not due for another 30 seconds.
He's just coming in now.
I want you to listen very carefully, please.
My name is Arthur Kennicutt.
Mr. Brimmer's expecting me.
Oh, yes, sir.
Would you go right in, please?
Thank you.
Oh, Mr. Kennicutt.
You're right on time.
Wort you sit down?
Thank you.
Would you care for something to drink?
Oh.
Some coffee, black.
I was just reading one of your papers.
I see you've taken a stand on this federal judgeship that's giving everybody fits.
I'd rather not talk politics right now, Mr. Brimmer, if you don't mind.
Yes, of course.
Thank you, Henry.
Well, this is your wife's file, Mr. Kennicutt, and the fact sheet shows five weeks now of intensive surveillance.
All movement, personal contact, telephone communications.
It's really quite extensive.
And?
Mr. Kennicutt, you have nothing to worry about.
It's a clean bill of health.
- You sure?
- Well, I'm not in the habit of making mistakes.
Yes.
I'm sorry, of course.
But lately it's been like waiting for a biopsy report...
benign or malignant.
Well, in this case, benign.
I don't know which I feel most, relief or anger.
Anger?
At myself... my idiotic suspicions.
But I suppose when one marries a much younger woman, one tends to become a little paranoid.
[Brimmer] Well, sometimes there's good cause.
In this case, not.
Read it at your leisure.
There's not a hint of another man.
You know, it's funny.
I love her.
I love her very much.
And I think I know her.
But lately I could have sworn that...
Well, it doesn't matter now.
I feel so guilty, I'm going to start showering her with gifts.
She won't know what hit her.
Mr. Brimmer, I owe you a great deal.
Well, it's a pleasure to set your mind at rest, sir.
Thank you.
And you'll have my check in the morning.
Very kind of you.
Thank you again.
Thank you.
Could you hear everything?
[Woman] Yes.
- Well, you seem confused.
- Well, I don't know why you asked me to come here.
- I thought it was obvious.
- No, not really.
- You...
- What you're trying to say is that I lied to your husband.
Well, that's correct, Mrs. Kennicutt.
I even went so far as to falsify the report.
- Would you like a glass of water?
- No.
Uh, nothing, thank you.
In point of fact, you were having an affair.
The mars name was Archer.
It's over, Mr. Brimmer.
But I'm sure you already know that.
It was a mistake.
[Sighs] A stupid mistake.
But I ended it.
And it won't ever happen again.
Why didn't you tell my husband the truth?
[Sighs] Oddly enough, Mrs. Kennicutt,
I am a moralist... a vanishing species, so I'm told.
A thousand broken marriages come across my desk... infidelities, uh, domestic deceit.
In your case, 10 years of marriage... and one brief indiscretion.
So, why not bend the truth a little bit?
Uh, then you're not going to tell him?
I haven't and I won't.
File's closed.
[Exhales Deeply]
[Sighs] Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Brimmer.
I am so grateful.
How grateful?
Mrs. Kennicutt, a detective agency runs on information.
That's our raw material.
Your husband owns three newspapers, two on this coast and one on the East.
Whenever anything happens on the inside of business or politics or even in the jet-set...
I still don't understand how I...
Information, Mrs. Kennicutt.
It is our only stock in trade.
For example, at the moment I'm working on case... wherein it would be very beneficial to my client... to have certain information about a federal judge that your husband is supporting.
Are you saying that you want me to be a pipeline to my husband?
No.
Just [Sighs] A good listener.
Is it really asking so much, Mrs. Kennicutt?
I can't do this kind of work alone.
I need that kind of help.
Why don't you think about it and we'll talk again.
[Ice Cubes Jingling]
Your terrace door was unlocked, so I trespassed.
Well, there's no car in the front.
Oh.
I thought you knew everything, Mr. Brimmer.
We're neighbors.
My husband and I have a weekend house about three miles from here.
Ironic, isn't it?
Why are you here?
Well, why else?
To discuss your...
What shall we call it?
Your proposition.
I've been walking on the beach for hours, thinking.
And you've come to a decision.
Oh, yes.
Tell me something, Mr. Brimmer.
How many other rich mers wives owe you favors?
Do they all capitulate easily?
I'm waiting for your answer.
Oh, indulge me.
I should think the blackmail-ee has some right.
Mrs. Kennicutt, I r...
The answer is no.
No deal.
Is that plain enough for you?
If you want a spy, you find someone else.
All right.
I'll have to call your husband in the morning and...
And what?
Tell him I had an affair?
Sorry.
It won't work.
I'm going to tell him myself.
I can't believe that you'd want to do that.
Well, what you believe really doesn't matter, does it?
It's what Arthur thinks that's important.
Maybe he'll ask for a divorce or maybe he'll forgive me.
But it's time I was honest with him.
You're being very foolish.
Only if I lose.
But you can't threaten me anymore, can you?
You just lost your leverage.
Oh, and one other thing.
I'm also going to tell him about the way you run your business.
I wouldn't advise that.
Oh, I'm sure you wouldn't.
Because whether he forgives me or not, he's gonna despise you for lying to him.
And Arthur's not the right man to have for an enemy.
Good night, Mr. Brimmer.
Mrs. Kennicutt, I want you to reconsider.
Your husband has some very powerful friends.
[Chortles] That's right.
Now, if you'll please excuse me.
I cannot permit you to do that.
Well, you don't understand.
It's not your choice.
You let go of me!
Let go!
[Glass Shatters]
[Car Horn Blaring]
[Siren Approaching]
[Siren Dies Out]
[Engine Stops]
What's the trouble, Officer?
May I see your license and registration?
Turn signal, right?
The right one.
You know, it's the second time I got stopped today.
I tell you, I'll get those things fixed as soon as I can.
- You'll get 'em fixed now.
- I would, but I'm on my way to a 187 P.C.
- Say, are you a cop?
- Uh, yeah, a lieutenant...
Columbo.
Well, I'm sorry, Lieutenant, I flagged you down.
Well, that's all right.
You're just doing your job.
Listen, I'll get those things fixed.
This license expires next week.
Oh.
Oh, well, thanks.
Say, I better give you an escort.
That way you'll get where you wanna go.
Oh.
Okay.
Appreciate that.
But listen, not too fast.
[Police Radio Chatter]
Can't tell for sure, but I don't think she was killed her.
Looks like the body was moved.
And the cause of death?
Probably a severe concussion.
Print team all wrapped up, Captain.
Nothing.
There were two blows.
Uh, send them on home.
Laceration on the cheek and major contusion at the base of the skull.
How do you read that?
It's hard to say.
Maybe somebody hit her and she struck her head going down.
- Lieutenant, you got that?
- I'll know more about this after the autopsy.
Uh, yeah.
Got a match?
Plus the approximate time of death.
No.
No tire tracks we can use.
Got a match?
I'm sorry.
I don't smoke.
Oh.
No prints.
Just smudges.
Money?
Just change.
No currency.
You got a match.
No, I don't.
Sorry.
Got a match.
Yeah, sure.
[Captain] We're all finished here.
You can load it up.
Identification and purse.
Mrs. Arthur Kennicutt... the Arthur Kennicutt.
How do you know that?
Credit card's made out to Kennicutt Publications.
What's the problem?
Newspapers.
If we don't handle this according to Kennicutt's satisfaction, he's got an awful lot of front pages to beat us over the head with.
Thought I told you to move that out of here.
Lieutenant, what are you looking at?
The bruise, sir.
The lady has a bruise on the left cheek.
We know that.
I knew you werert listening.
[Police Radio Chatter Continues]
It's Lenore.
I wanna get out of here.
Oh.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Would you like to be alone for a few moments?
No, no.
I can feel sorry for myself some other time, after you've caught him.
Well, should we get down to business?
Are you sure there's nothing else you want?
As the husband, I'm the most likely suspect, correct?
Uh...
You don't have to worry about my feelings, Lieutenant.
She was killed last night.
What time?
Between 8:00 and 9:00.
Well, I was in San Francisco addressing a conference.
I didn't fly back until this morning.
Uh, you have the flight numbers on that?
My secretary can give them to you, together with my hotel and my schedule.
You'll check them all out, naturally.
Yes, sir.
And when you do, you'll dismiss me as a possibility... and then get down to the real business of finding the real killer.
And I want him found, Lieutenant.
Soon.
I'll do my best.
I'm sure you will.
Uh, Mr. Kennicutt, it would help if you could tell us a few things.
Did your wife have any enemies?
Lenore never offended a soul.
She was an extraordinary woman.
I see.
This question is a bit awkward, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask it... was there ever, uh, another man in her life?
Naturally.
More than one.
But that was years ago, before we were married.
- No, sir.
I meant since you were married.
- You're speaking of an affair?
Well, I'm afraid we're gonna have to consider it.
Well, don't bother.
Lenore was faithful to me in every way.
She had a clean bill of health.
All right.
Clean bill of health.
So you don't think we ought to go in that direction?
No, I don't.
All right.
Can you tell us about her habits?
What did she do in her spare time?
Nothing unusual.
Shopping, charity work.
Sports.
Sports.
What kind of sports did she play?
Oh, tennis.
She was also very fond of skin diving.
Yes.
Uh, did she do this with you, sir?
Did she do it with friends?
With friends, Lieutenant.
Female friends, in case you're wondering.
Female friends.
All right, sir.
I think I've got enough to start with.
Thank you very much.
Lieutenant,
I want you to understand something.
I married a woman young enough to be my daughter.
A lot of people were skeptical, but it worked for us.
We loved each other.
We loved each other very much.
We even thought of having a child.
I want this man caught.
And I must warn you, I don't intend to be patient.
Yes, sir.
Oh, Lieutenant.
Thanks for the coffee.
You're welcome, sir.
Good morning, Lieutenant.
Good morning, sir.
Would you like some coffee, some juice?
Uh, nothing for me.
No.
Thank you very much.
Any progress?
Uh, no, sir.
I hate to admit this, but, uh, nothing.
Not a single lead?
No, sir.
Nothing.
Well, uh...
Well, some of my associates think... that, uh, your wife was mugged and the fella ran away with the money.
But, um, you see, they can't really explain how the body was moved.
And, uh, now, me, I don't know.
I, uh...
I think she knew the murderer.
Why?
Excuse me.
[Ringing]
Yes.
Yes?
All right.
Be right in.
Why?
Well, her behavior seems a little strange, sir.
Uh, she went out to the beach house in the middle of the week, which is unusual.
And, uh, she said to the caretaker she had some thinking to do... and then she went for a walk.
And then the next morning her body was found on the other side of town.
What are you getting at?
I wish I knew.
I don't know.
It's just that it sounds to me like a woman that has a problem.
Now, did your wife have any personal problems?
My wife was a very happy woman.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, it's just that if she did have a problem,
I thought that maybe it would be connected with the murder.
But you've no proof of that.
Oh, no, sir.
No.
Lieutenant, I call the City Room every half hour to find out what you people are doing.
So far, not a word.
No arrest...
not even a promise of one.
Now you tell me you haven't a lead.
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Kennicutt.
Uh, looks like it's gonna be slow.
It doesn't have to be.
Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Columbo, this is Mr. Brimmer.
How do you do?
Lieutenant.
You've heard of Brimmer Associates?
Uh, no, I haven't.
Well, it's security and investigations, Lieutenant.
You might say you and I are in the same business.
Oh, really?
Matter of fact, I was talking about you just last night.
I ran into the commissioner at a party.
He speaks very highly of you.
Naturally, you're wondering why Mr. Brimmer's here.
Now, please don't take this as a reflection on you, but I've engaged his firm to work on the case.
Well, now, Arthur, I'm here in an advisory capacity...
a supplemental capacity only.
I don't want the lieutenant to get the idea that I'm competing with him.
Uh, but there's no reason why a private agency and a public one... can't cooperate, is there?
No.
You see, I want as much coverage in this case as possible.
And when Mr. Brimmer called and offered his services,
I thought it was an excellent idea.
Sure, uh, I can understand that.
Uh, you two know each other?
Well, Mr. Brimmer's done some work for me.
I see.
I see.
[Clears Throat]
Some kind of security work?
Guards for the paper?
Oh, it was a personal matter.
The point is, Lieutenant,
I told Arthur on the phone I couldn't imagine you wouldn't accept a helping hand... considering the manpower shortage in your department.
You see, Mr. Brimmer used to be a police officer himself.
[Brimmer] Well, it was a long time ago.
But at least I can understand your problems, Lieutenant.
Well, now, listen, I said to Mr. Kennicutt I'm grateful for all the help I can get.
I'm just not sure how my superior's gonna take this.
That's already been taken care of.
It's just that Mr. Kennicutt is anxious for a quick resolution to the case.
You can understand that.
Well, naturally.
[Brimmer] Well, good.
I hope the association will be beneficial to you.
Oh, I'm sure it will.
Yeah.
You know, I suddenly feel very much more optimistic about this whole thing.
Uh, it's not based on anything, no facts, but, you know, I'm a superstitious guy.
You know, I believe in signs.
I believe in palmistry and astrology and all that kinda thing.
You don't, I know that.
Oh, definitely not.
Let me see your hand.
You see, Mr. Kennicutt, that's your fate line and it breaks there.
That was your bad fortune.
But it picks up again, and that's interesting.
That's a very good omen.
May I?
Mmm.
Deep line of Apollo.
That's a man devoted to his work.
Your Apollo line crosses the mound of the Moon.
You know, that's very rare.
And very impressive.
That's the sign of a man who's destined to attain a very particular kind of distinction.
That's a very good sign.
I know you think it's silly, but I'm gonna make a believer out of you before I'm done.
It was very nice meeting you.
Nice to have met you.
Bye-bye.
Oh, Mr. Brimmer.
Large thumb, low mound of Venus.
That means ambition, purposefulness.
That's a closet, Lieutenant.
[Chuckles] Oh, gee.
I'm sorry.
A lot of people make the same mistake.
Say, that's a terrific-looking set of clubs.
Do you mind?
Go ahead.
These seem light.
Are these ladies' clubs?
- They were Lenore's.
- You didn't say she played golf, did you?
You mentioned tennis and skin diving.
- That's because she just started.
- Ahh.
I see.
Where'd she play?
At the country club.
I see.
At the club.
Well, I was just wondering why shejust didn't keep her clubs in the locker room?
She did.
That's an extra set she used to take lessons with.
Oh, I see.
Well, that explains it.
Right.
Uh, you mean she didn't take lessons at her own club?
She took them someplace else?
Sky Lane.
Why, is it important?
It's not important.
It's just I like to get that background information very precise if I can.
Bye.
- Is this the right door?
- [Chuckles] Yes.
Well, what was that all about?
Well, I think, uh, police techniques have changed a little over the years.
Here, try it again.
And remember, keep the back of your left hand straight.
None of this.
Just stroke it easy, all right?
Oh, that was good.
You're getting better.
Well, I still don't think I'm ever gonna learn this game.
Oh, you just have to keep your eye on the ball, watch your concentration.
You're coming along fine.
Do we have time for another bucket?
Sorry, Jenny.
Time's up.
Tomorrow, 3:00.
Tomorrow then.
You a member of the club?
Uh, no.
No, I'm, uh, Lieutenant Columbo.
I'm from the police.
[Mumbles]
What's the problem?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about a Lenore Kennicutt.
Uh, you knew her?
Not very well.
I gave her a few lessons.
I see.
Uh, well, this is your appointment book, isn't it?
Well, you should know.
You've been looking at it.
Well, no offense.
I was just killing time.
But, uh, you know, now that you mention it,
I see that you gave her a lot of lessons.
She liked the game.
I see.
Well, look here's the thing.
Um, since you spent a lot of time with her,
I was wondering if you could give me some help.
How?
Was she the type of woman... now this is just between you and me... was she the type of woman who was on the lookout?
I mean, did you ever notice her give her eye to any of the men around here?
Uh, look, Lieutenant.
We better get one thing straight.
I teach them golf and I play in their tournaments, but I don't get involved in their personal lives.
If they wanna pair off, that's none of my business.
Okay.
All right.
Uh, well, thanks a lot.
It's quite all right.
Take it easy.
Uh, say, uh, what kind of club is this?
Oh, that's a number one wood.
Number one wood.
Listen, uh, could you give me a lesson?
What?
No, I'm serious.
You know what my trouble is?
I work too hard.
Never out of the office.
I figure this:
If I could take up a sport, get out in the fresh air and get some exercise, that'd do me some good.
- What do you say?
- Well, I...
Just for a few minutes.
Just to, you know, start to swing.
Come on.
Say, you know what was a funny thing about your appointments with Mrs. Kennicutt?
Uh, the first two were in the morning... and all the rest, and I counted 13 of them, uh, they were always in the middle or the late afternoon.
So?
Uh, well, I guess it's not important.
I guess it's nothing.
Uh, wait a minute.
I'll take off my coat.
Except that, uh, now, every time you had an appointment with Mrs. Kennicutt, it was always the last lesson of the day.
I like to finish at a reasonable hour.
Doesrt everyone?
Oh, I see.
So those days, you left the club.
I thought maybe you'd hang around to see if you could pick up an odd lesson.
Well, I didn't always go home.
Oh, who said anything about going home?
Oh.
What I mean is I didn't always leave the club.
Sometimes...
Hey, listen.
Can I help you out?
Don't say anything else.
You don't have an attorney.
Wait until you get an attorney.
This way you can hurt your case.
Believe me, I know something about my business.
I don't know nothing about golf, you know.
See that's your business.
I know something about my business.
And believe me, you know, down through the years, uh, you get so that you develop a nose for things, you see?
And, uh...
After a while, the old nose just tells you when someone's not giving you the truth.
Now, uh, I'm gonna forget about the lesson, 'cause I could never learn this game, but I'll be back to talk to you.
Ground covered by the police is not our concern.
One thing to bear in mind, money was taken.
Granted, it could have been a smoke screen, but sometimes the obvious answer is the correct one.
Now, Brooks...
Yes, sir?
Check into her banking account with particular attention to withdrawals.
See if you can find out how much cash she was carrying that day.
Mr. Kennicutt will be glad to cooperate.
Now, my theory, gentlemen, and you will gear your efforts in this direction,
Mrs. Kennicutt was walking along the Pacific Coast Highway.
She was forced into a car... by someone.
The motive was robbery.
She probably fought back.
In any case, she was killed.
The murderer drove around in a panic... and finally all the way out to here, where he got rid of the body.
[Intercom Buzzer] Yes?
[Woman] Lieutenant Columbo to see you.
Who?
Oh, yes.
Yes, send him in.
Gentlemen, we'll finish this later.
I'll call you.
Thank you.
Lieutenant!
Come in.!
Whew!
Boy.
This is quite a building.
This all yours?
'Fraid so.
Must be a lot of business for your kinda company these days.
Well, we can't handle it all.
Sit down.
Uh, listen, your secretary called.
She said you wanted to see the files on the case, so I thought it'd be a lot safer if I brought 'em over myself.
Oh.
That's very nice of you.
It wasrt necessary, but I appreciate it very much.
Uh, want some coffee?
No.
No, thanks.
Thank you.
Uh, those are the duplicates.
Okay.
Yes, this will help.
A lot of it.
I wonder if you can give me a little rundown.
Well, it's just what I told Mr. Kennicutt.
No leads.
Except, you know, I was looking through that stuff last night.
Mm-hmm.
And, uh, drives my wife crazy, you know.
Because we have the lamp right next to the bed, and the poor thing, she can't sleep.
Did you find anything?
No, not really.
Well, uh, take the autopsy report.
Yes.
Here it is.
You see now, that jibed with something that I noticed about the body... the first time I saw it, and that bothered me.
Mrs. Kennicutt was struck on the left cheek, and she had a bruise.
And she had a weird kinda cut.
Um...
Do you see what I mean?
Um, no.
I don't think so.
Well, let's start with the cut, because that's what bothered me.
I said to myself, 'Now what in the world could have caused that kind of cut?"
Uh, does this lighter work?
Yeah, I think so.
Uh...
Uh, wh... where was I?
About the cut.
Oh, yes.
What could have caused the cut?
I said to myself, ' It could be a ring."
A ring of...
You mean a finger ring.
This kind of ring.
Yeah, something like that.
Now here's the way I figured it.
Suppose you were gonna strike somebody.
Suppose it was a woman.
Now, do you punch her?
Well, maybe.
But more than likely, you hit with your open hand.
Either this way or this way.
Mm-hmm.
Now, if you hit this way, then the ring is not gonna cause any cut.
So I figured it was a backhand blow like this.
All right?
I still don't follow you too well, because that would, uh, that would put it over on...
But I used my right hand, you see?
Yeah.
And if the ring was on the right hand, then the bruise would be on the right cheek.
But it was on the left cheek, so the murderer was left-handed.
Struck her like this.
Which means the murderer is left-handed.
Well, that's interesting.
That's provided, of course, all these, uh, speculations are valid.
Yeah, I would say that we have a left-handed murderer, and, uh, and an unpremeditated crime.
We have?
Oh, I think so, yes.
I mean, I don't think a man kills with his hands unless he's angry.
As a matter of fact, you know, maybe he didn't mean to do it.
Could be.
You know, maybe it was an accident.
You know, I got a feeling that when we find our friend, it's gonna turn out that he has a terrible temper.
Hmm.
[Chuckles]
Well, maybe you're right.
I certainly wish I had your crystal ball, Lieutenant.
Why don't you let me digest this material, and then we'll talk again.
Okay.
All right.
Fine.
Sure.
Listen.
I want to thank you for the time.
Listen.
Thank you.
Right.
Oh, listen, before I forget, uh...
Gee whiz.
I didn't wanna forget that.
But, uh, let's see.
I had a receipt here that I wanted you to sign.
Well, listen, let's just make one up.
It's a receipt for the files.
Isn't that weird?
- What a coincidence.
- What's that?
Here, a moment ago, we were talking about left-handed people, and you're left-handed.
And right-handed.
I'm ambidextrous.
That means I don't favor either hand particularly.
It's a character trait shared by about 10% of the world's population.
Ten percent?
No kidding?
Anything else?
Uh, no.
No, I don't think so.
Uh, oh, listen.
This is a little bit off the subject.
My sister-in-law, she wants to buy a place out at the beach.
How do you like it out there?
Who told you I was living out at the beach?
Well, no one.
L...
I noticed your car out in front of Mr. Kennicutt's.
You know, you parked it there in the driveway.
As I was walking by, I saw the chrome was tarnished.
You know what the salt air does to it.
It just eats the life out of it.
Yeah, that part's a problem, all right.
Uh, you're a very observant man, Lieutenant.
That's not what my wife says.
[Laughs]
Well, you tell your sister-in-law that she will love it at the beach... if she doesn't mind that problem with the salt air on the chrome.
I'll give her that message.
And thanks again.
Thank you.
Oh, uh, say.
Have you ever been in Mr. Kennicutt's house?
Yes, I met you there.
No, I didn't mean the big house.
I meant out at the beach.
I was just wondering, because your beach house and his beach house, they're fairly close, aren't they?
No.
It's a couple miles.
That close?
Tsk.
Isn't that a coincidence?
[Chuckles]
I'll tell you, this case is just full of'em.
[Door Closes]
[Sighs] Why don't you and I take a walk?
When you showed up today, I...
I kinda panicked.
Then you did have an affair with her?
Turning on the ladies is about the only thing I do well.
I'm not a very good golfer.
Yeah, go on.
Well, it was pretty good for a while... at least for me.
She got the guilts.
Funny thing, I think she really loved her husband.
One day she said, 'Ken, this is bad for both of us.
Let's call it off." So we did.
Must have shook you up when we found her dead.
I couldn't believe it.
Then I got to thinking, sooner or later, you guys would find out about me.
Maybe even think I killed her.
The night she died, I was...
I was home watching the tube.
No calls.
No company.
No alibi.
That's...
That's why I started to run.
Uh-huh.
I can understand that.
You didn't kill her.
No, no.
I know that, but this afternoon, you gave me the impression...
No.
You're in the clear.
You got nothing to worry about.
You see, whoever did this, he had to wear a ring.
Now, you don't wear a ring.
Well, I could have taken it off.
No, not with that tan, because that would show.
Now listen.
Tell me something.
Mrs. Kennicutt...
Did Mrs. Kennicutt ever indicate to you... that she was concerned that her husband knew about you two?
No.
That's funny that you mention it though, because, well, I was concerned.
Why?
Well, Lenore never saw anyone, but I'm sure we were being followed.
By who?
Well, there was this one guy in particular.
Sharp, well-dressed.
I only caught him in flashes, but...
Well, he... he had a crew cut.
Kind of an ex-marine type.
[Telephone Ringing]
- Yes?
- Wilcox, Mr. Brimmer.
The subject is meeting with Archer, and they've engaged in conversation.
Did you overhear anything?
No, sir.
But Archer seems to be doing most of the talking.
Maintain the surveillance and report to me in the morning.
Yes, sir.
[Phone Ringing] Why, you little bum, you.
Hello?
Oh, yes, he is.
Leo.
Mr. Brimmer.
- Yes, sir?
- I'm sorry to trouble you at home, Leo.
No sweat.
Just playing with Teddy.
Well, I've got a little something I want you to do for me.
It may complicate your life a little bit.
- When?
- Immediately.
- Set it up through my secretary.
- Yes, sir.
I'll be in touch.
Every one of our operatives is a skilled marksman.
Actually, our policy is to avoid the use of the weapon.
This is our memory bank, Lieutenant.
Millions ofbits of information, all cross-filed and on tape, immediately available.
There are more electrical impulses in this room than in your brain.
Hard to believe.
[Chuckles]
We here at Brimmer Associates use the most up-to-date equipment.
Years ahead of what you use at police headquarters.
Company cars...
custom designed for us.
Most of them with telephonic or radio communication.
Phew!
It's very impressive.
Oh, uh, just one moment, Lieutenant.
One other thing that might interest you.
If you'll just move past this gate.
- It's not working.
- Well, it has to be.
You're carrying a gun, aren't you, Lieutenant?
No.
No?
Oh.
Well, that explains the malfunction.
Look here.
A special system is built into the gate.
Now, if you had a gun, it would have registered.
It's just like out at the airport.
It's a security precaution.
Not that we expect our clients to be carrying concealed weapons, but, uh, well, there have been a few exceptions.
Really?
Well, a guy came in here just about a month ago.
Harmless looking.
An accountant for Mid-Century Oil.
We were doing a company audit.
[Brimmer] Mr. Denning?
I asked you to show the lieutenant around.
I did not suggest that you discuss our confidential matters... with anyone at anytime.!
Our clients pay us to be discreet.
Yes, sir.
Wort you come in, Lieutenant?
Sorry about the outburst, but my people have got to learn.
This is a business of trust.
I can't have them gossiping about the clients.
Thank you, Henry.
Hope you'll have lunch with me.
Like quenelle of sole?
Uh, well, if it's fish, I like fish.
I love fish.
Yeah, it's fish.
Drop your coat and dig in.
On the Kennicutt case, my men have come up with an interesting lead.
There were two derelicts seen in the area.
I have their description.
I sent them over to your office, copies.
Right.
Uh, I'll have that checked out.
Anything new on your end?
Uh, oh, yeah.
Yeah, we got a couple of things.
It seems as though Mrs. Kennicutt was having an affair, you see?
Uh...
Boy, this is delicious.
How do you make this stuff?
I'll have a recipe sent over to you.
You were saying?
Oh, yeah.
Uh, it seems as though...
Mrs. Kennicutt, uh, she was having an affair.
And, uh...
Oh?
And, uh...
Oh, listen, when you send the recipe, would you send it to the house?
- Don't send it to the office.
- Yes, I'll send it to your house.
Yeah, she was having an affair with some golf pro at some country club.
And, uh, here's the interesting thing.
Not only were they having an affair, but it seems as though they were being watched.
Now I got this nutty notion.
Suppose Mr. Kennicutt, uh...
I'll tell you, it's too far-fetched.
Sometimes it helps to test it out.
Try me.
It's really crazy.
Well, listen.
It doesn't cost anything.
Suppose...
Suppose Mr. Kennicutt... hired somebody to check up on his wife.
And this somebody lied to him.
He said to Mr. Kennicutt, ' Look.
Your wife, she's got a clean bill of health."
Now this somebody, whoever it is, he's in a perfect position to blackmail Mrs. Kennicutt.
Now suppose she refuses.
See?
She says, 'No, I'm gonna go tell my husband."
Hmm.
I think it's a terrific motive, don't you?
Lieutenant, you have a marvelously convoluted mind.
I do?
I like it.
The trouble with your theory is, not only is it very tenuous, but it's impossible to prove, isn't it?
I, uh...
Oh.
Got a little tomato on that there.
Well, I said it was nutty.
What do you think?
You think I oughta drop it, hmm?
[Clears Throat] If you believe in it, stick to it.
Run it on down.
One other thing you should keep in mind.
Nothing at all to do with the case.
- What's that?
- Your future.
I'd like you to work for Brimmer Associates.
Me?
That's why I had you taken on a V.I.P. Tour.
We're a growing organization.
You can see that.
You'll be a valuable piece of manpower for us.
Oh, boy.
You really know how to toss a curve.
No, no, I don't mean it that way.
I'm quite serious.
You're a good man, Columbo...
up here.
It's time you were thinking about advancement.
What does a lieutenant make?
If you come with us,
I'm almost positive I can triple your yearly income.
Whew!
Boy.
I'll tell you, it's all so sudden.
Uh, let me talk it over with my wife.
Of course talk it over with your wife.
Think about it carefully.
But remember, we want you here.
Listen.
I'm very flattered.
I mean that.
Just let me mull it over a little bit.
Well, while you're mulling, consider my career.
If I'd stayed with the force, by now, probably with luck,
I could have been a captain of detectives.
Hmm?
With one eye on the promotion list, and the other eye on my car payments.
No house by the ocean.
No freedom to travel.
No... what would you say?
Power or sense of accomplishment.
Have I succeeded in getting through...
[Clears Throat] In stimulating you?
Definitely.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I'm gonna give it all a lot of thought.
That's as much as I can ask.
Uh, one thing.
Hmm?
If I came with you, would I still be working on the Kennicutt case?
Well, let's see.
I have men who are perfectly capable of handling the Kennicutt case.
No.
I have several other matters that are far more important than that I'd like to put you on right away.
Lieutenant, to the knock of opportunity.
Hey.
Hi.
Dry throat for some reason.
Oh, help yourself.
Yeah.
Hey, I hope I didn't get you into trouble before.
I mean, I'm sorry about what happened.
I'm used to it.
Why?
Does he blow off a lot of steam?
Well, let's just say our founding father has quite a temper.
No kidding.
That's funny, because he... he looks to me like he's a guy that's always under control.
Uh, correction.
He's under control most of the time.
And when people like that let go, stand back.
Oh.
I'll tell you why I'm interested.
He offered me a job.
Oh?
Yeah.
Well, welcome to the family.
Yeah, here's my problem.
I don't know how much to ask for.
Whatever you can get.
Top man can pull down about 30,000.
No kidding?
[Whistles] That's a lot of money.
Gee, listen.
Does anybody else here make more than that?
I mean, besides Mr. Brimmer?
Well, maybe Leo.
Who's Leo?
Leo Gentry.
He's the boy who gets the cream of the cases.
Hey, I think I know him.
Crew cut, ex-marine type?
Yeah, that's Leo.
Teacher's pet, at least this month.
Hey, listen.
Where can I talk to him?
Maybe he can give me a few pointers.
Oh.
I haven't seen him around yet today, but, uh...
I'll get his address from Personnel.
Uh, don't mention it to Brimmer.
Who me?
No.
That's the last thing I'd do.
[Children Chattering]
Higher.
Higher?
Listen.
If you go any higher, you're gonna go right over the top.
Hey, what's going on?
Mrs. Gentry?
I wanna tell you, you got a terrific kid here.
Nothing frightens him.
You can't scare this boy.
I said higher!
Higher?
All right, listen.
You go higher, and I'll eat your ice cream, all right?
No, I wanna eat it.
You wanna eat it.
All right.
Here you go.
You're coming down.
Down to earth.
There you are.
Get your ice cream.
Do we know each other?
Uh, no.
Uh, my name is Columbo.
I'm a lieutenant.
I'm from the police.
My daddy's a private eye.
I know that, Teddy.
And he's a very good one.
Listen.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
- Well, is it about Leo's work?
- Well, not exactly.
I'm working on a case, and I thought maybe he could help me out.
- But I can't seem to locate him.
- He went away.
That's right, Lieutenant.
His boss called last night... and sent him on a special assignment.
Oh, I see.
Uh, do you know where he went?
Or, uh, how long he's gonna be away?
Sorry.
That's the way it is with Leo.
He took his passport, so I guess he's overseas somewhere.
I see.
Is there something wrong?
No, no, no.
No, not really.
Listen.
Maybe you could help me out.
Was Leo recently on a case where he was following a woman?
A married woman?
Well, it's... it's possible, but I don't really know.
No?
You never discuss Leo's work?
No.
It's a household rule.
I mean, I'm not very much at keeping secrets.
If Leo were to tell me anything, it'd be all over the Laundromat.
If you have any questions, you better ask Leo.
It's kinda hard to ask him, because I can't locate him.
He went away.
But why don't you talk to his boss, Mr. Brimmer?
He can tell you what Leo's working on.
Uh, oh, yeah.
I, uh...
Thanks.
I have the feeling he won't be too much help.
But, uh, at any rate, uh, I'm sorry I bothered you.
Bye-bye, Teddy.
F
- E-L-O-P-
Z-D.
All right.
Now try the next to the bottom line.
F-D-P-
T-C-E-O?
Perfect vision.
Well, it should be.
This is a new prescription.
Here's your temporary.
You should have your license in a few weeks.
Thank you very much.
Keep this too.
Next.
Now, while I mark your test, please read from the eye chart, third line down.
Did that lady say that she just got a new pair of glasses?
- What?
- [Slams Counter]
- She wasrt wearing glasses.
- Of course she was.
Excuse me.
Uh, wait.
What about the eye chart?
And all of a sudden, I remembered this picture.
See?
She's wearing glasses.
But there were no glasses on the body.
Now, could she have dropped them somewhere?
I'm sorry, Lieutenant, but you're on the wrong track.
Why?
Well, shortly after that picture was taken,
Lenore gave up wearing glasses.
She switched to contact lenses.
Ah, contact lenses.
Just a matter of vanity.
She thought she looked better.
Uh-huh.
Did she wear 'em often?
All the time.
She was extremely nearsighted.
Mr. Kennicutt, where's your wife's personal effects?
The funeral director sent them over.
I've avoided going through them.
Do you mind?
No, go ahead.
This her lens case?
Yes.
It's empty.
Well, she was probably wearing them when she died.
Well, then maybe, uh...
Maybe what?
Mr. Kennicutt, I'm gonna ask your permission for something.
This is the world's biggest long shot.
And it's gonna be painful for you.
But I think it's won'th a try.
Would it help?
There are no guarantees.
All right, Lieutenant.
You have a blank check.
Mobile Operator, the number I want is 476-7301.
[Line Ringing] They just arrived, and they're entering the vault.
The medical examiner's with them.
Why?
What's the reason?
Havert been able to find out, sir, but I did learn one thing.
Kennicutt signed an exhumation order.
All right, stay there.
I'll be right over.
Get my car ready.
He says it won't take long.
[Car Ignition Grinding]
[Ignition Continues Grinding]
What's the trouble?
I don't know, sir.
The battery's okay, but the car won't start.
[Ignition Grinding] I'm in a hurry.
Get me another car.
Yes, sir.
Have this one serviced.
Tell them I want it tomorrow.
Yes, sir.
[Tires Squealing]
[Police Radio Chatter]
[Police Radio Chatter Continues]
Arthur.
I should have phoned you, but there wasrt time.
Well, it's all right.
One of my men told me you were here.
Something break?
I don't know yet.
They're exhuming Lenore's body.
Tell me why.
Well, the lieutenant's working on a long shot.
Apparently, she was wearing her contact lenses when she was killed.
How's that significant?
Well, there's a chance that she might have lost one of them... maybe both of them at the scene of the crime.
Well, Arthur, I don't like to be critical, but that's more than a long shot.
You might as well buy a lottery ticket.
Maybe not.
Listen to me.
My nephew wears those things, and half of the time they're falling out.
Now, the other morning at breakfast, one of them ended up in the cereal.
[Brimmer] Mrs. Kennicutt is not your nephew, Lieutenant.
Listen.
Mrs. Kennicutt was struck forcibly.
Now let's bear that in mind.
Why isn't it possible that they were knocked loose?
Anything's possible.
The autopsy report said nothing about any of this at all.
Listen.
Forget about the autopsy report.
I checked with the medical examiner about that.
They snuffed it off.
They didn't even bother to look.
All they were concerned about was the cause of death.
[Man] Lieutenant.
Well, I hope it's not a waste.
What else can I do?
I've got to pursue every possibility.
Arthur, it's almost a criminal breach... to disappoint you now after what you've been through.
Move over.
Listen.
We're in luck.
The right contact lens is missing, and it's not in the coffin.
Well, it might have fallen out in the morgue, I guess.
Or in the ambulance.
Or in the street.
She might have lost it before she was killed.
Could be a hundred places.
That's true, but maybe... and this is what we gotta hope for... maybe it's at the place where she was murdered.
[Kennicutt] But we don't know where that place is.
[Columbo] No, sir, we don't.
We don't know for sure.
But I've got a few hunches.
Unless you can be specific, I can't help.
I think the lieutenant deserves some room.
Don't you?
As you wish.
You go your own way, Lieutenant.
Thank you, sir.
I will.
But keep us posted.
Yes, sir.
I will.
I'll keep you posted.
[Sighs]
I only wish one thing.
I wish the murderer knew about this.
Why?
There'd be a piece of conclusive evidence that might be lying around in his premises, and he'd have to find it before we did.
I'll keep you posted, sir.
[Doorbell Rings]
Oh, uh, Mr. Brimmer.
Lieutenant.
Listen.
I'm sorry to bother you at this hour, but, uh...
May I come in?
Yes, sure.
Come on in.
There's something I wanted to talk to you about.
Okay.
Fine, if you can make it a little brief.
It's been a late day.
Oh, sure.
Say, this is some terrific place you got here.
And you got the sound of the ocean all the time, huh?
Yeah.
Well, me, I love the beach.
I love it.
Except when the water gets cold, then I don't like to go in.
Then I like a pool.
Lieutenant, did you say you had something on your mind?
Oh, yeah.
It's about that job you offered me.
I've been giving it a lot of thought.
Uh, as a matter of fact, uh, I haven't been able to sleep.
And, uh...
Boy, this is a fantastic rug.
My wife would love this rug.
We gotta get a new rug, and this is just the kind she wants.
Fantastic piling, huh?
Very soft.
Bet you could lose a shoe in here for a week, you wouldn't find it.
It's late.
I still got a lot of work to do.
You were talking about my job offer.
I really don't think I'd be very happy making a change, you know.
I like it where I am.
It's not a bad life.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Uh, is that final?
I think so, yes.
No hard feelings?
No, no, certainly not.
I just, uh...
Well, I think you're making a mistake.
That's all.
You're probably right.
You know, my wife, she's always said I don't have enough ambition.
You know what it was that really made up my mind?
What was that?
The Kennicutt case.
I don't wanna give up working on it just now.
Not when I'm so close to a solution.
Well, uh, are you gonna let me in on it?
Oh, certainly.
Don't worry.
You'll be the first to know.
Good night.
Good night.
[Car Door Closes] [Engine Starts]
[Vehicle Departs]
- Hello?
- Yes, this is Mr. Brimmer.
You took my car in to be repaired, didn't you?
Yes, sir.
Just like you said.
They'll try to have it for you as soon as they can.
All right then.
Good night.
[Footsteps]
[Keys Jingling]
[Car Door Opens, Closes]
You mind telling us what you're doing?
I'd say that was none of your business, Lieutenant.
Well, if you say so, but, uh, it's gonna be kinda hard to explain, isn't it?
I mean, breaking and entering?
That's against the law.
Checking the trunk of your car.
What in the world were you looking for?
Papers... for a case.
I thought they were here.
It's an emergency.
Why don't you admit it?
You were searching the trunk, 'cause that's where you hid the body.
All right.
What's the next step?
Why don't we go downtown and talk it over?
Am I under arrest?
I guess you could say so.
On what evidence?
I think it's gotta be more comfortable downtown.
All right.
Let's get this farce over with.
Grab his arm!
It was an accident, Arthur.
It wasrt... premeditated.
I hardly knew your wife.
I didn't want to hurt either one of you.
It happened.
How'd you get it?
I got it from the cut on her cheek and your ring.
You never should have let me read your palm.
'Cause then I felt the ring and I felt the two diamonds sticking out... and that raised rectangular border.
That matched up with the cut on her cheek.
You should have taken that job.
You know, we're lucky Lenore lost this.
Uh, she didn't lose it.
What?
When I spoke to the medical examiner at the cemetery, he told me that both contact lenses were on the body.
But that's impossible.
If it isn't hers, whose was it?
Who knows?
Anyway, it doesn't make any difference.
The fact that it's not the real contact lens, that doesn't count.
What does count is Mr. Brimmer's actions... coming here tonight, trying to get rid of that thing... and doing it all in front of witnesses.
What would you have done if the car hadrt broken down?
You couldn't set up this trap.
Well, I guess we would have found some other way.
You know what this place reminds me of?
Just seeing all these cars...
You know, in our neighborhood, we had a bunch ofjokers.
I mean, we were a real wild bunch of guys.
And we figured out a perfect way to put a car out of commission.
You take a potato, you stick it in the exhaust pipe.
It doesn't cause any damage, but the car won't start.
It was a terrible thing to do.
And I got a feeling... that the reason I became a cop was to make up for all those jokes I played when I was a kid.
This one is as crooked as a dog's hind leg.
Fire it in the vice this afternoon.
- I want yesterday's field reports now.
- Yes, sir.
(Teleprinter)
Three more units added to security at Coastal Aircraft.
No progress on the Fairfax Insurance investigation - we're working with their accountants.
Brooks and Wilcox are in court on the Monzio divorce - should be no problem.
James case looking very positive, no negative signs.
Everyone's checked in but Russell and he's undercover in Santa Barbara.
- Give me the afternoon report at 5:30.
- Yes, sir.
- Our guest has arrived?
- Yes, but Mr Kennicut hasn't.
He's not due for another 30 seconds.
He's just coming in now.
'I want you to listen very carefully, please.'
I'm Arthur Kennicut.
Mr Brimmer's expecting me.
- Oh, yes, sir.
Go right in, please.
- Thank you.
Oh, Mr Kennicut.
You're right on time.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
- Would you care for something to drink?
- Some coffee, black.
From your paper, I see you've taken a stand on this federal judgeship that's giving everybody fits.
I'd rather not talk politics right now, Mr Brimmer.
Yes, of course.
Thank you, Henry.
Well, this is your wife's file, Mr Kennicut, and the fact sheet shows five weeks of intensive surveillance.
'All movement, personal contact, telephone communications.'
- It's really quite extensive.
- And?
You have nothing to worry about.
It's a clean bill of health.
- You sure?
- I'm not in the habit of making mistakes.
Yes.
I'm sorry, of course.
But lately it's been like waiting for a biopsy report - benign or malignant.
Well, in this case, benign.
I don't know which I feel most, relief or anger.
- Anger?
- At myself, my idiotic suspicions.
I suppose when one marries a much younger woman one tends to become a little paranoid.
(Brimmer) 'There's often good cause.
In this case, not.'
Read it at your leisure.
There's not a hint of another man.
You know, it's funny.
I love her.
I love her very much.
And I think I know her.
But lately I could have sworn that...
Well, it doesn't matter now.
I feel so guilty, I'm going to shower her with gifts.
She won't know what hit her.
Mr Brimmer, I owe you a great deal.
- It's a pleasure to set your mind at rest.
- Thank you.
You'll have my cheque in the morning.
- Very kind of you.
- Thank you again.
Thank you.
- Could you hear everything?
- (Woman) Yes.
- You seem confused.
- I don't know why you asked me to come.
- I thought it was obvious.
- No, not really.
- You...
- What you're trying to say is that I lied to your husband.
Well, that's correct, Mrs Kennicut.
I even went so far as to falsify the report.
- Would you like a glass of water?
- No.
Nothing, thank you.
In point of fact you were having an affair.
- The man's name was Archer.
- It's over, Mr Brimmer.
But I'm sure you already know that.
It was a mistake.
A stupid mistake.
But I ended it.
And it won't ever happen again.
Why didn't you tell my husband the truth?
Oddly enough, Mrs Kennicut, I am a moralist - a vanishing species, so I'm told.
A thousand broken marriages come across my desk - infidelities, domestic deceit.
In your case, ten years of marriage and one brief indiscretion.
So, why not bend the truth a little bit?
- But...
Then you're not going to tell him?
- I haven't and I won't.
File's closed.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Brimmer.
I am so grateful.
How grateful?
Mrs Kennicut, a detective agency runs on information.
That's our raw material.
Your husband owns three newspapers - two on this coast and one on the East.
Whenever anything happens on the inside of business or politics...
- I still don't understand how I...
- Information, Mrs Kennicut.
It is our only stock in trade.
I'm currently working on a case where it would be very beneficial to have certain information about a federal judge
- that your husband supports.
- Are you saying you want me to be a pipeline to my husband?
No.
Just... a good listener.
Is it really asking so much, Mrs Kennicut?
I can't do this kind of work alone.
I need that kind of help.
Why don't you think about it and we'll talk again?
Your terrace door was unlocked, so I trespassed.
Well, there's no car in the front.
I thought you knew everything, Mr Brimmer.
We're neighbours.
My husband and I have a weekend house about three miles from here.
Ironic, isn't it?
Why are you here?
Well, why else?
To discuss your...
What shall we call it?
Your proposition.
I've been walking on the beach for hours, thinking.
- And you've come to a decision.
- Oh, yes.
Tell me something, Mr Brimmer.
How many other rich men's wives owe you favours?
Do they all capitulate easily?
- I'm waiting for your answer.
- Indulge me.
I should think the blackmailee has some right.
- Mrs Kennicut, I...
- The answer is no.
No deal.
Is that plain enough for you?
If you want a spy, you find someone else.
All right.
I'll have to call your husband and...
And what?
Tell him I had an affair?
Sorry.
It won't work.
I'm going to tell him myself.
I can't believe that you'd want to do that.
Well, what you believe really doesn't matter, does it?
It's what Arthur thinks that's important.
Maybe he'll ask for a divorce or maybe he'll forgive me.
But it's time I was honest with him.
- You're being very foolish.
- Only if I lose.
But you can't threaten me any more, can you?
You just lost your leverage.
Oh, and one other thing.
I'm also going to tell him about the way you run your business.
- I wouldn't advise that.
- I'm sure you wouldn't.
Because whether he forgives me or not, he's gonna despise you for lying to him.
And Arthur's not the right man to have for an enemy.
- Good night, Mr Brimmer.
- I want you to reconsider.
Your husband has some very powerful friends.
That's right.
Now, if you'll please excuse me.
I cannot permit you to do that.
You don't understand.
It's not your choice.
You let go of me!
- Let go!
- (Glass shatters)
(Blaring horn)
(Siren)
(Drowned by traffic)
- What's the trouble, Officer?
- Licence and registration, please.
- Turn signal, right?
- The right one.
You know, it's the second time I got stopped today.
I'll get those things fixed as soon as I can.
- You'll get 'em fixed now.
- I would, but I'm going to a 187 PC.
- Say, are you a cop?
- Yeah, uh, Lieutenant...
Columbo.
Well, I'm sorry I flagged you down.
You're just doing your job.
I'll get those things fixed.
- This licence expires next week.
- Oh.
Oh, well, thanks.
I'll give you an escort.
That way you'll get where you wanna go.
OK.
Appreciate that.
But listen, not too fast.
(Police radio)
I don't think she was killed here.
Looks like the body was moved.
- (Captain) And the cause of death?
- Probably a severe concussion.
- Print team wrapped up.
Nothing.
- Two blows...
- Send them home.
...laceration on the cheek and major contusion at the base of the skull.
- How do you read that?
- It's hard to say.
Maybe somebody hit her and she struck her head going down.
- Lieutenant, you got that?
- (Coroner) After the autopsy...
- Yeah.
Got a match?
...I'll have the approximate time of death.
- No.
- (Detective) No tyre tracks we can use.
(Coroner) I'm sorry.
I don't smoke.
(Policeman) No prints.
Just smudges.
(Captain) Money?
(Policeman) Just change.
No currency.
- You got a match?
- No, I don't.
Sorry.
(Police radio)
- Got a match?
- Yeah, sure.
(Captain) We're finished.
You can load it up.
Identification and purse.
Mrs Arthur Kennicut - the Arthur Kennicut.
- How do you know that?
- Her cards say Kennicut Publications.
- What's the problem?
- Newspapers.
If we don't handle this to Kennicut's satisfaction he's got a lot of front pages to beat us over the head with.
Thought I told you to move that out of here.
- Lieutenant, what are you looking at?
- The lady has a bruise on the left cheek.
(Captain) We know that.
I knew you weren't listening.
It's Lenore.
I wanna get out of here.
Oh.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Would you like to be alone?
No.
I can feel sorry for myself some other time - after you've caught him.
Should we get down to business?
Are you sure there's nothing else you want?
As the husband, I'm the most likely suspect, correct?
- Er...
- You don't have to worry about my feelings.
She was killed last night.
What time?
- Between eight and nine.
- I was in San Francisco at a conference.
I didn't fly back until this morning.
- You have the flight numbers on that?
- My secretary can give them to you, together with my hotel and my schedule.
- You'll check them all out, naturally.
- Yes, sir.
And when you do, you'll dismiss me as a possibility, and you can get down to the real business of finding the real killer.
And I want him found, Lieutenant.
Soon.
- I'll do my best.
- I'm sure you will.
Er, Mr Kennicut, it would help if you could tell us a few things.
Did your wife have any enemies?
Lenore never offended a soul.
She was an extraordinary woman.
I see.
This question is a bit awkward, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask - was there ever another man in her life?
Naturally.
More than one.
But that was years ago, before we were married.
- No.
I meant since you were married.
- An affair?
I'm afraid we're gonna have to consider it.
Well, don't bother.
Lenore was faithful to me in every way.
She had a clean bill of health.
All right.
Clean bill of health.
- So we shouldn't go in that direction?
- No, you shouldn't.
Can you tell us about her habits?
What did she do in her spare time?
Nothing unusual.
Shopping, charity work.
- Sports.
- What kind of sports did she play?
Tennis.
She was also very fond of skin diving.
Yes.
Did she do this with you, sir?
Did she do it with friends?
With friends, Lieutenant.
Female friends, in case you're wondering.
Female friends.
All right, sir.
I think I've got enough to start with.
Thank you very much.
Lieutenant, I want you to understand something.
I married a woman young enough to be my daughter.
People were sceptical, but it worked for us.
We loved each other.
We loved each other very much.
We even thought of having a child.
I want this man caught.
And I must warn you, I don't intend to be patient.
Yes, sir.
Oh, Lieutenant?
Thanks for the coffee.
You're welcome, sir.
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Good morning, sir.
- Coffee, juice?
- Nothing for me.
Thank you very much.
- Any progress?
- Er, no, sir.
I hate to admit this, but nothing.
- Not a single lead?
- No, sir.
Nothing.
Well, some of my associates think that your wife was mugged and the fella ran away with the money.
But, you see, they can't really explain how the body was moved.
And, now, me
- I don't know.
I, er...
I think she knew the murderer.
- Why?
- (Phone)
- Excuse me.
- Yes.
Yes?
All right.
Be right in.
- Why?
- Her behaviour seems a little strange.
She went out to the beach house on a weekday, which is unusual, and she said to the caretaker she had some thinking to do and then she went for a walk.
The next morning, her body was found on the other side of town.
- What are you getting at?
- I wish I knew.
I don't know.
It's just that it sounds to me like a woman that has a problem.
- Did she have any personal problems?
- My wife was a very happy woman.
Yeah, well, it's just if she did have a problem,
I thought that maybe it would be connected with the murder.
- But you've no proof of that.
- No, sir.
No.
Lieutenant, I call the city room every half hour to find out what you people are doing.
So far, not a word.
No arrest.
Not even a promise of one.
Now you tell me you haven't a lead.
Well, I'm sorry, Mr Kennicut.
Looks like it's gonna be slow.
It doesn't have to be.
Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Columbo, this is Mr Brimmer.
- How do you do?
- Lieutenant.
- You've heard of Brimmer Associates?
- No, I haven't.
It's security and investigations.
You might say we're in the same business.
- Really?
- I was talking about you last night.
I ran into the commissioner at a party.
He speaks very highly of you.
Naturally, you're wondering why Mr Brimmer's here.
Don't take this as a reflection on you but I've engaged his firm to work on the case.
Arthur, I'm here in a supplementary, advisory capacity only.
I don't want the lieutenant to think I'm competing with him.
There's no reason a private agency and a public one can't cooperate, is there?
No.
I want as much coverage in this case as possible.
When Mr Brimmer offered his services, I thought it was an excellent idea.
Sure.
I can understand that.
Er, you two know each other?
Mr Brimmer's done some work for me.
I see.
I see.
Some kind of security work?
Guards for the paper?
It was a personal matter.
The point is, Lieutenant,
I told Arthur I thought you would accept a helping hand, considering the manpower shortage in your department.
Mr Brimmer used to be a police officer himself.
Well, it was a long time ago but I can understand your problems, Lieutenant.
Well, listen, I said to Mr Kennicut I'm grateful for all the help I can get.
I'm just not sure how my superior's gonna take this.
That's already been taken care of.
Mr Kennicut is anxious for a quick resolution to the case.
You understand.
- Well, naturally.
- Well, good.
I hope the association will be beneficial to you.
Oh, I'm sure it will.
Yeah.
I suddenly feel very much more optimistic about this whole thing.
It's not based on anything, no facts, but you know, I'm a superstitious guy.
I believe in signs.
I believe in palmistry and astrology and that kinda thing.
- You don't, I know.
- (Kennicut) Definitely not.
Let me see your hand.
You see, Mr Kennicut, that's your fate line and it breaks there.
That was your bad fortune.
But it picks up again, and that's interesting.
That's a very good omen.
May I?
Mm.
Deep line of Apollo.
That's a man devoted to his work.
Your Apollo line crosses the mound of the Moon.
That's very rare.
And very impressive.
That's the sign of a man destined to attain a particular kind of distinction.
That's a very good sign.
I know you think it's silly but I'll make a believer out of you before I'm done.
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice to have met you.
Bye-bye.
Oh, Mr Brimmer.
Large thumb, low mound of Venus.
That means ambition, purposefulness.
That's a closet, Lieutenant.
Oh, gee.
I'm sorry.
A lot of people make the same mistake.
Say, that's a terrific-looking set of clubs.
Do you mind?
Go ahead.
These seem light.
Are these ladies' clubs?
- They were Lenore's.
- You didn't say she played golf.
You mentioned tennis and skin diving.
- That's because she just started.
- I see.
Where'd she play?
- At the country club.
- I see.
At the club.
I was just wondering why she didn't keep her clubs in the locker room?
- She did.
- That's an extra set for her lessons.
Oh, I see.
Well, that explains it.
Right.
Er, you mean she didn't take lessons at her own club, but someplace else?
Sky Lane.
Why, is it important?
It's not important.
I just like to get that background information very precise.
Bye.
- Is this the right door?
- Yes.
Well, what was that all about?
I think police techniques have changed a little over the years.
Here, try it again.
And remember, keep the back of your left hand straight.
None of this.
Just stroke it easy, all right?
Oh, that was good.
You're getting better.
I still don't think I'm ever gonna learn this game.
Just have to keep your eye on the ball, watch your concentration.
You're coming along fine.
Do we have time for another bucket?
- Sorry, Jenny.
Time's up.
Tomorrow, 3:00.
- Tomorrow, then.
You a member of the club?
Er, no.
No, I'm Lieutenant Columbo.
I'm from the police.
What's the problem?
I'd like to ask you some questions about a Lenore Kennicut.
You knew her?
Not very well.
I gave her a few lessons.
I see.
Well, this is your appointment book, isn't it?
You should know.
You've been looking at it.
No offence.
I was just killing time but now that you mention it,
I see you gave her a lot of lessons.
- She liked the game.
- I see.
Here's the thing.
Erm, since you spent a lot of time with her,
I was wondering if you could give me some help.
- How?
- Was she the type of woman...
Now this is just between you and me.
Was she the type of woman who was on the lookout?
Did you ever notice her give her eye to any of the men around here?
Look, Lieutenant.
We better get one thing straight.
I teach them golf and I play in their tournaments but I don't get involved in their personal lives.
If they wanna pair off, that's none of my business.
All right.
Well, thanks a lot.
- It's quite all right.
- Take it easy.
Say, er, what kind of club is this?
That's a number one wood.
Number one wood.
Listen, could you give me a lesson?
- What?
- No, I'm serious.
You know what my trouble is?
I work too hard.
Never out of the office.
I figure this - if I could take up a sport, get out in the fresh air and get some exercise, that'd do me some good.
- What do you say?
- Well, I...
Just for a few minutes.
Just to start to swing.
Come on.
You know what was funny about your appointments with Mrs Kennicut?
Er, the first two were in the morning and all the rest, and I counted 13 of them, they were always in the middle or the late afternoon.
- So?
- Well, I guess it's not important.
I guess it's nothing.
Wait a minute.
I'll take off my coat.
Except that, er, every time you had an appointment with Mrs Kennicut, it was always the last lesson of the day.
I like to finish at a reasonable hour.
Doesn't everyone?
Oh, I see.
So those days, you left the club.
I thought you'd hang around to see if you could pick up an odd lesson.
Well, I didn't always go home.
Who said anything about going home?
What I mean is I didn't always leave the club.
Sometimes...
Hey, listen.
Can I help you out?
Don't say anything else.
You don't have an attorney.
Wait until you get an attorney.
This way you can hurt your case.
Believe me, I know something about my business.
I don't know anything about golf.
See, that's your business.
I know something about my business.
And believe me, you know, down through the years, you get so that you develop a nose for things, you see?
And, er... after a while, the old nose just tells you when someone's not giving you the truth.
Now, I'm gonna forget about the lesson, cos I could never learn this game, but I'll be back to talk to you.
Ground covered by the police is not our concern.
One thing to bear in mind, money was taken.
Granted, it could have been a smoke screen but sometimes the obvious answer is the correct one.
- Now, Brooks...
- Yes, sir?
Check into her banking account, particularly withdrawals.
Find out how much cash she was carrying that day.
Mr Kennicut will be glad to cooperate.
My theory, gentlemen, and you will gear your efforts in this direction.
Mrs Kennicut was walking along the Pacific Coast Highway.
She was forced into a car... by someone.
The motive was robbery.
She probably fought back.
In any case, she was killed.
The murderer drove around in a panic and, finally, out to here,
- to get rid of the body.
- (Buzzer)
- Yes?
- (Woman) 'It's Lieutenant Columbo.'
Who?
Oh, yes.
Yes, send him in.
Gentlemen, we'll finish this later.
I'll call you.
Thank you.
Lieutenant?
Come in!
Whew!
Boy.
This is quite a building.
- This all yours?
- 'Fraid so.'
Must be a lot of business for your kinda company these days.
We can't handle it all.
Sit down.
Your secretary called.
She said you wanted the files on the case.
I thought it'd be safer if I brought them.
That's nice.
It wasn't necessary, but I appreciate it.
Want some coffee?
- No, thanks.
- Thank you.
- Those are the duplicates.
- OK.
Yes, this will help.
A lot of it.
I wonder if you can give me a little rundown.
Well, it's just what I told Mr Kennicut.
No leads.
Except I was looking through that stuff last night...
- Mm-hm?
- And...
Drives my wife crazy, you know.
The lamp's next to the bed and the poor thing, she can't sleep.
- Did you find anything?
- No, not really.
Well, er...
Take the autopsy report.
Yes.
Here it is.
You see, that jived with something that I noticed about the body the first time I saw it and that bothered me.
Mrs Kennicut was struck on the left cheek and she had a bruise and she had a weird kinda cut.
Erm...
- Do you see what I mean?
- Erm, no.
I don't think so.
Let's start with the cut because that's what bothered me.
I said to myself, "What in the world could have caused that kind of cut?"
Er, does this lighter work?
Yeah, I think so.
Er...
- Where was I?
- About the cut.
Oh, yes.
What could have caused the cut?
I said to myself, "It could be a ring."
A ring of...
You mean a finger ring.
This kind of ring.
Yeah, something like that.
Now here's the way I figured it.
Suppose you were gonna strike somebody.
Suppose it was a woman.
Now, do you punch her?
Well, maybe.
But more than likely, you hit with your open hand.
- Either this way or this way.
- Mm.
Now, if you hit this way, the ring is not gonna cause any cut.
So I figured it was a backhand blow like this.
OK?
I still don't follow you because that would put it over...
- But I used my right hand, see?
- Yeah.
If the ring was on the right hand, the bruise would be on the right cheek.
But it was on the left cheek so the murderer was left-handed.
Struck her like this.
Which means the murderer is left-handed.
Well, that's interesting.
That's provided, of course, all these speculations are valid.
Yeah, I would say that we have a left-handed murderer and... and an unpremeditated crime.
- We have?
- I think so, yes.
I don't think a man kills with his hands unless he's angry.
As a matter of fact, you know, maybe he didn't mean to do it.
Could be.
Maybe it was an accident.
You know, I got a feeling that when we find our friend, it's gonna turn out that he has a terrible temper.
(Laughs)
Well, maybe you're right.
I certainly wish I had your crystal ball, Lieutenant.
Why don't you let me digest all this and then we'll talk again?
OK.
All right.
Fine.
Sure.
Listen.
I want to thank you for the time.
- Listen.
Thank you.
- Right.
Listen, before I forget...
Gee whizz.
I didn't wanna forget that.
But, er, let's see.
I had a receipt here that I wanted you to sign.
Well, listen, let's just make one up.
It's a receipt for the files.
Isn't that weird?
- What a coincidence.
- What's that?
A moment ago, we were talking about left-handed people and you're left-handed.
And right-handed.
I'm ambidextrous.
That means I don't favour either hand particularly.
It's a character trait shared by about ten percent of the world's population.
Ten percent?
No kidding?
- Anything else?
- Er, no.
No, I don't think so.
Listen.
This is a little bit off the subject.
My sister-in-law wants to buy a place at the beach.
How do you like it there?
- Who said I was living at the beach?
- No one.
I noticed your car in front of Mr Kennicut's.
You parked it there in the driveway.
I saw the chrome was tarnished.
You know the salt air just eats the life out of it.
Yeah, that part's a problem, all right.
You're a very observant man, Lieutenant.
- That's not what my wife says.
- (Laughs)
Well, you tell your sister-in-law that she will love it at the beach if she doesn't mind that problem with the salt air on the chrome.
I'll tell her that.
And thanks again.
Thank you.
Oh, er, say, have you ever been in Mr Kennicut's house?
(Sighs) Yes, I met you there.
Not the big house.
I meant at the beach.
Your beach house and his beach house are fairly close, aren't they?
No.
It's a couple miles.
That close?
Isn't that a coincidence?
- (Laughs)
- I'll tell you.
This case is just full of 'em.
Why don't you and I take a walk?
When you showed up today, I kinda panicked.
Then you did have an affair with her?
Turning on the ladies is the only thing I do well.
- I'm not a very good golfer.
- Yeah, go on.
Well, it was pretty good for a while, at least for me.
She got the guilts.
Funny thing, I think she really loved her husband.
One day she said, "Ken, this is bad for both of us.
Let's call it off."
So we did.
Were you shook up when we found her dead?
I couldn't believe it.
Then I got to thinking, sooner or later, you guys would find out about me.
Maybe even think I killed her.
The night she died, I was...
I was home watching the tube.
No calls.
No company.
No alibi.
That's why I started to run.
Uh-huh?
I can understand that.
You didn't kill her.
No.
I know that but this afternoon, you gave the impression...
No.
You're in the clear.
You got nothing to worry about.
You see, whoever did this, he had to wear a ring.
Now, you don't wear a ring.
Well, I could have taken it off.
No, not with that tan, because that would show.
Now listen.
Tell me something.
Mrs Kennicut.
Did Mrs Kennicut ever indicate to you that she was concerned that her husband knew about you two?
No.
It's funny that you mention it though because, well, I was concerned.
Why?
Lenore never saw anyone, but I'm sure we were being followed.
By who?
There was this one guy in particular.
Sharp, well-dressed.
I only caught him in flashes, but...
Well, he had a crew cut.
Kind of an ex-Marine type.
(Phone)
- Yes?
- Wilcox, Mr Brimmer.
The subject is meeting with Archer and is engaged in conversation.
Did you overhear anything?
'No, sir.
But Archer seems to be doing most of the talking.'
Maintain surveillance and report in the morning.
Yes, sir.
- (Phone) - (Man) Why, you little bum, you.
Hello?
Oh, yes, he is.
Leo.
Mr Brimmer.
- Yes, sir?
- I'm sorry to trouble you at home, Leo.
'No sweat.
Just playing with Teddy.'
I've got something I want you to do for me.
It may complicate your life a little bit.
- When?
- Immediately.
- Set it up through my secretary.
- Yes, sir.
I'll be in touch.
All of our operatives are skilled marksmen.
Actually, our policy is to avoid the use of the weapon.
This is our memory bank, Lieutenant.
Millions of bits of information, all cross-filed and on tape, immediately available.
There are more electrical impulses in this room than in your brain.
Hard to believe.
We use the most up-to-date equipment, years ahead of what you use at headquarters.
Company cars - custom designed for us.
Most of them with telephonic or radio communication.
Whew!
It's very impressive.
Just one moment, Lieutenant.
One other thing that might interest you.
If you'll just move past this gate.
- It's not working.
- Well, it has to be.
You're carrying a gun, aren't you?
- No.
- No?
Oh, well, that explains the malfunction.
Look here.
A special system is built into the gate.
Now, if you had a gun, it would have registered.
- It's just like out at the airport.
- It's a security precaution.
Not that we expect our clients to carry weapons but there have been exceptions.
- Really?
- A guy came in here about a month ago.
Harmless looking.
An accountant for Mid-Century Oil.
- We were doing a company audit.
- Mr Denning?
I asked you to show the lieutenant around.
I did not suggest that you discuss our confidential matters with anyone at any time!
Our clients pay us to be discreet.
Yes, sir.
Won't you come in, Lieutenant?
Sorry about the outburst but my people have got to learn.
This is a business of trust.
I can't have them gossiping about the clients.
Thank you, Henry.
Hope you'll have lunch with me.
Like quenelle of sole?
Er, well, if it's fish, I like fish.
Love fish.
It's fish.
Drop your coat and dig in.
On the Kennicut case, my men have come up with an interesting lead.
There were two derelicts seen in the area.
I have their description.
I sent them over to your office, copies.
Right.
I'll have that checked out.
Anything new on your end?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, we got a couple of things.
It seems as though Mrs Kennicut was having an affair, you see?
Erm...
Boy, this is delicious.
How do you make this stuff?
I'll have a recipe sent over to you.
You were saying?
Yeah.
It seems as though Mrs Kennicut, she was having an affair.
- And, er...
- Oh?
And...
When you send the recipe, would you send it to the house?
- Don't send it to the office.
- Yes, I'll send it to your house.
Yes, she was having an affair with some golf pro at some country club.
Here's the interesting thing.
Not only were they having an affair, but it seems as though they were being watched.
Now, I got this nutty notion.
Suppose Mr Kennicut...
I'll tell you, it's too far-fetched.
Sometimes it helps to test it out.
Try me.
It's really crazy.
Well, listen.
It doesn't cost anything.
Suppose Mr Kennicut hired somebody to check up on his wife.
And this somebody lied to him.
He said to Mr Kennicut, "Look, your wife, she's got a clean bill of health."
Now this somebody, whoever it is, he's in a perfect position to blackmail Mrs Kennicut.
Now, suppose she refuses.
See?
She says, "No, I'm gonna go tell my husband."
I think it's a terrific motive, don't you?
Lieutenant, you have a marvellously convoluted mind.
- I do?
- I like it.
The trouble with your theory is not only is it very tenuous, but it's impossible to prove, isn't it?
I, er...
Got a little tomato on that there.
Well, I said it was nutty.
What do you think?
You think I ought to drop it?
If you believe in it, stick to it.
Run it on down.
One other thing you should keep in mind.
Nothing at all to do with the case.
- What's that?
- Your future.
I'd like you to work for Brimmer Associates.
- Me?
- That's why I gave you the VIP tour.
We're a growing organisation.
You'd be a valuable piece of manpower.
Boy.
You really know how to toss a curve.
No, I don't mean it that way.
I'm quite serious.
You're a good man, Columbo, up here.
It's time you thought about advancement.
What does a lieutenant make?
If you come with us, I'm almost positive I can triple your yearly income.
Whew.
Boy.
I tell you, it's all so sudden.
Let me talk it over with my wife.
Of course.
Think about it carefully.
But remember, we want you here.
Listen.
I'm very flattered.
I mean that.
Just let me mull it over a little bit.
Well, while you're mulling, consider my career.
If I'd stayed with the force... by now, probably with luck, I could have been a captain of detectives.
With one eye on the promotion list, and the other eye on my car payments.
No house by the ocean.
No freedom to travel.
No... what would you say?
Power or sense of accomplishment.
Have I succeeded in getting through, in stimulating you?
Definitely.
Yes, sir.
I'm gonna give it all a lot of thought.
That's as much as I can ask.
- Er, one thing.
- Mm-hm.
If I came with you, would I still be working on the Kennicut case?
Well, let's see.
I have men who are perfectly capable of handling...
The Kennicut case?
No.
I have several other more important matters that I'd put you on right away.
Lieutenant, to the knock of opportunity.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Dry throat for some reason.
- Help yourself.
Yeah.
I hope I didn't get you into trouble before.
- I mean, I'm sorry about what happened.
- I'm used to it.
Does he blow off a lot of steam?
Let's just say our founding father has quite a temper.
No kidding.
That's funny, because he looks to me like a guy that's always under control.
He's under control most of the time.
And when people like that let go, stand back.
I'll tell you why I'm interested.
He offered me a job.
- Oh?
- Yeah.
- Welcome to the family.
- Here's my problem.
- I don't know how much to ask for.
- Whatever you can get.
Top man can pull down about 30,000.
No kidding?
That's a lot of money.
Gee.
Does anybody else here make more than that, besides Mr Brimmer?
Well, maybe Leo.
- Who's Leo?
- Leo Gentry.
- He gets the cream of the cases.
- I think I know him.
- Crew cut, ex-Marine type?
- That's Leo.
Teacher's pet, at least this month.
Hey, listen, where can I talk to him?
Maybe he can give me a few pointers.
I haven't seen him around today, but I'll get his address from personnel.
- Don't mention it to Brimmer.
- Who, me?
That's the last thing I'd do.
- Higher.
- Higher?
If you go any higher, you're gonna go over the top.
Hey, what's going on?
Mrs Gentry?
You got a terrific kid here.
Nothing frightens him.
You can't scare this boy.
- I said higher!
- Higher?
You go higher and I'll eat your ice cream.
- No, I wanna eat it.
- You wanna eat it.
All right.
Here you go.
You're coming down.
Down to earth.
There you are.
Get your ice cream.
- Do we know each other?
- No.
My name is Columbo.
I'm a lieutenant.
I'm from the police.
- My daddy's a private eye.
- I know that, Teddy.
And he's a very good one.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
- Is it about Leo's work?
- Not exactly.
I'm working on a case and I thought he could help me.
- But I can't locate him.
- He went away.
That's right.
His boss called last night and sent him on a special assignment.
Oh, I see.
Do you know where he went or how long he's gonna be away?
Sorry.
That's the way it is with Leo.
He took his passport, so I guess he's overseas somewhere.
- I see.
- Is there something wrong?
No, no, no, not really.
Listen.
Maybe you could help me out.
Was Leo recently on a case where he was following a married woman?
Well, it's possible, but I don't really know.
No?
You never discuss Leo's work?
No.
It's a household rule.
I'm not very much at keeping secrets.
If Leo told me anything, it'd be all over the Laundromat.
If you have any questions, better ask Leo.
It's hard to ask him, because I can't locate him.
He went away.
Why don't you talk to his boss, Mr Brimmer?
He can tell you what Leo's working on.
Er...
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
I have the feeling he won't be too much help, but at any rate, I'm sorry I bothered you.
Bye-bye, Ted.
F-E-L-O-P-Z-D.
All right.
Now try the next to bottom line.
F-D-P-T-C...
E-O?
- Perfect vision.
- It should be.
This is a new prescription.
Here's your temporary.
Expect your license in a few weeks.
Keep this too.
Next.
While I mark your test, read from the eye chart, third line down.
- Did she just say she got new glasses?
- What?
- She wasn't wearing glasses.
- Of course she was.
- Excuse me.
- What about the eye chart?
All of a sudden I remembered this picture.
See?
She's wearing glasses.
But there were no glasses on the body.
Now, could she have dropped them somewhere?
- I'm sorry, but you're on the wrong track.
- Why?
Shortly after that picture was taken, Lenore gave up wearing glasses.
- She switched to contact lenses.
- Ah.
Contact lenses.
Just a matter of vanity.
She thought she looked better.
Uh-huh.
Did she wear 'em often?
All the time.
She was extremely near-sighted.
Mr Kennicut, where's your wife's personal effects?
The funeral director sent them over.
I've avoided going through them.
- Do you mind?
- No, go ahead.
Is this her lens case?
Yes.
It's empty.
She was probably wearing them when she died.
- Well, then, maybe...
- Maybe what?
Mr Kennicut, I'm gonna ask your permission for something.
This is the world's biggest long shot.
It's gonna be painful for you.
But I think it's worth a try.
- Would it help?
- There are no guarantees.
All right, Lieutenant.
You have a blank cheque.
Mobile operator, the number I want is 476-7301.
(Bleeping)
They just arrived and are entering the vault.
- 'The medical examiner's with them.'
- Why?
I haven't found out, but I did learn one thing.
Kennicut signed an exhumation order.
All right, stay there.
I'll be right over.
Get my car ready.
He says it won't take long.
(Engine splutters)
- What's the trouble?
- I don't know, sir.
The battery's OK but the car won't start.
- I'm in a hurry.
Get me another car.
- Yes, sir.
- Have this one serviced.
I want it tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.
(Police radio)
Arthur.
I should have phoned, but there wasn't time.
It's all right.
One of my men told me you were here.
- Something break?
- I don't know yet.
They're exhuming Lenore's body.
- Tell me why.
- The lieutenant's working on a long shot.
Apparently, she was wearing her contact lenses when she was killed.
How's that significant?
There's a chance that she might have lost one of them, maybe both of them, at the scene of the crime.
Well, Arthur, I don't like to be critical, but that's more than a long shot.
- You might as well buy a lottery ticket.
- Maybe not.
Listen to me.
My nephew wears them and half the time they're falling out.
The other morning at breakfast, one ended up in the cereal.
Mrs Kennicut is not your nephew, Lieutenant.
Mrs Kennicut was struck forcibly.
Now, let's bear that in mind.
Isn't it possible they were knocked loose?
Anything's possible.
The autopsy report said nothing about any of this at all.
Forget about that.
I checked with the medical examiner.
They snuffed it off.
They didn't bother to look.
All they were concerned about was cause of death.
(Man) Lieutenant!
(Brimmer) Well, I hope it's not a waste.
What else can I do?
I've got to pursue every possibility.
It's almost a criminal breach to disappoint you now after what you've been through.
Move over.
Listen.
We're in luck.
The right contact lens is missing and it's not in the coffin.
Well, it might have fallen out in the morgue, I guess.
Or in the ambulance.
Or in the street.
She might have lost it before she was killed.
- Could be a hundred places.
- (Colombo) That's true.
But maybe, and this is what we got to hope for, maybe it's at the place where she was murdered.
- But we don't know where that place is.
- No, sir, we don't know for sure.
But I've got a few hunches.
- Unless you can be specific, I can't help.
- I think the lieutenant deserves some room.
- As you wish.
- You go your own way.
- Thank you, sir.
I will.
- But keep us posted.
Yes, sir.
I will.
I'll keep you posted.
I only wish one thing.
- I wish the murderer knew about this.
- Why?
There'd be conclusive evidence that might be lying around in his premises and he'd have to find it before we did.
I'll keep you posted, sir.
(Doorbell)
- Er...
- Lieutenant.
I'm sorry to bother you at this hour, but may I come in?
- Yes.
Come in.
- There's something I wanted to talk about.
OK, if you can make it a little brief.
It's been a late day.
Oh, sure.
Say, this is some terrific place you got here.
- And you got the sound of the ocean?
- Yeah.
Well, me, I love the beach.
I love it.
Except when the water gets cold, then I like a pool.
Did you say you had something on your mind?
Oh, yeah.
It's about that job you offered me.
I've been giving it a lot of thought.
As a matter of fact, I haven't been able to sleep and...
Boy, this is a fantastic rug.
My wife would love this rug.
We got to get a new rug and this is just the kind she wants.
Fantastic piling, huh?
Very soft.
You could lose a shoe in here for a week.
It's late.
I've still got a lot of work to do.
About my job offer?
I really don't think I'd be very happy making a change.
I like it where I am.
It's not a bad life.
Mm-hm.
OK.
Is that final?
I think so, yes.
No hard feelings?
No, no, certainly not.
I just...
Well, I think you're making a mistake.
That's all.
You're probably right.
My wife, she's always said I don't have enough ambition.
You know what it was that really made up my mind?
- What was that?
- The Kennicut case.
I don't wanna give up working on it just now.
Not when I'm so close to a solution.
Well, are you gonna let me in on it?
Oh, certainly.
Don't worry.
You'll be the first to know.
Good night.
Good night.
(Car door closes, engine starts)
- (Rings)
- Hello?
Yes, this is Mr Brimmer.
You took my car in to be repaired, didn't you?
Yes, just like you said.
They'll have it for you as soon as they can.
All right, then.
Good night.
Do you mind telling us what you're doing?
I'd say that was none of your business.
Well, if you say so, but it's gonna be hard to explain, isn't it?
Breaking and entering is against the law.
Checking the trunk of your car.
What were you looking for?
Papers... for a case.
I thought they were here.
It's an emergency.
Admit it.
You were searching the trunk because that's where you hid the body.
All right.
What's the next step?
- Why don't we go downtown and talk?
- Am I under arrest?
- You could say so.
- On what evidence?
- It'll be more comfortable downtown.
- All right.
Let's get this farce over with.
Grab his arm!
It was an accident, Arthur.
It wasn't... premeditated.
I hardly knew your wife.
I didn't want to hurt either one of you.
It happened.
How'd you get it?
I got it from the cut on her cheek and your ring.
You never should have let me read your palm.
I felt the ring and the two diamonds sticking out and that raised rectangular border.
That matched up with the cut on her cheek.
You should have taken that job.
You know, we're lucky Lenore lost this.
- She didn't lose it.
- What?
When I spoke to the medical examiner at the cemetery, he told me that both contact lenses were on the body.
But that's impossible.
If it isn't hers, whose was it?
Who knows?
Anyway, it doesn't make any difference.
The fact it's not the real contact lens doesn't count.
What does count is Mr Brimmer's actions, coming here tonight, trying to get rid of that thing and doing it all in front of witnesses.
What would you have done if the car hadn't broken down?
You couldn't set up this trap.
Well, I guess we would have found some other way.
You know what this place reminds me of?
Just seeing all these cars...
In our neighbourhood, we had a bunch of jokers.
We were a real wild bunch of guys.
We figured out a perfect way to put a car out of commission.
You take a potato, you stick it in the exhaust pipe.
It doesn't cause any damage, but the car won't start.
It was a terrible thing to do.
And I got a feeling that the reason I became a cop was to make up for those jokes I played when I was a kid.
This one is as crooked as a dog's hind leg
Fire it in the vice this afternoon
Are those yesterday's field reports?
Yes, sir
I want them now
[Teletype Clacking]
Three more units added to security at Coastal Aircraft
No progress on the Fairfax Insurance investigation
We're working with their accountants on the audit
Uh, Brooks and Wilcox are in court this morning on the Monzio divorce
Brooks anticipates no problem james case looking very positive...
no negative signs in sight
All men on surveillance have checked in except Russell, but he's in Santa Barbara and he's undercover
Let me have the afternoon report at 5:3O Yes, sir
I assume our guest has arrived Yes, sir, but Mr Kennicutt isn't hear yet
Well, he's not due for another 3O seconds
He's just coming in now
I want you to listen very carefully, please
My name is Arthur Kennicutt Mr Brimmer's expecting me
Oh, yes, sir Would you go right in, please?
Thank you
Oh, Mr Kennicutt
You're right on time
Won't you sit down?
Thank you
Would you care for something to drink?
Oh Some coffee, black
I was just reading one of your papers
I see you've taken a stand on this federal judgeship that's giving everybody fits
I'd rather not talk politics right now, Mr Brimmer, if you don't mind
Yes, of course Thank you, Henry
Well, this is your wife's file, Mr Kennicutt, and the fact sheet shows five weeks now of intensive surveillance
All movement, personal contact, telephone communications
It's really quite extensive And?
Mr Kennicutt, you have nothing to worry about It's a clean bill of health
- You sure?
- Well, I'm not in the habit of making mistakes
Yes I'm sorry, of course
But lately it's been like waiting for a biopsy report...
benign or malignant
Well, in this case, benign
I don't know which I feel most, relief or anger
Anger?
At myself... my idiotic suspicions
But I suppose when one marries a much younger woman, one tends to become a little paranoid
[Brimmer] Well, sometimes there's good cause In this case, not
Read it at your leisure There's not a hint of another man
You know, it's funny
I love her I love her very much
And I think I know her
But lately I could have sworn that...
Well, it doesn't matter now
I feel so guilty, I'm going to start showering her with gifts
She won't know what hit her
Mr Brimmer, I owe you a great deal
Well, it's a pleasure to set your mind at rest, sir Thank you
And you'll have my check in the morning
Very kind of you Thank you again
Thank you
Could you hear everything?
[Woman] Yes
- Well, you seem confused
- Well, I don't know why you asked me to come here
- I thought it was obvious
- No, not really
- You...
- What you're trying to say is that I lied to your husband
Well, that's correct, Mrs Kennicutt
I even went so far as to falsify the report
- Would you like a glass of water?
- No Uh, nothing, thank you
In point of fact, you were having an affair
The man's name was Archer It's over, Mr Brimmer
But I'm sure you already know that
It was a mistake
[Sighs] A stupid mistake
But I ended it
And it won't ever happen again
Why didn't you tell my husband the truth?
[Sighs] Oddly enough, Mrs Kennicutt,
I am a moralist... a vanishing species, so I'm told
A thousand broken marriages come across my desk... infldelities, uh, domestic deceit
In your case, 1 O years of marriage and one brief indiscretion
So, why not bend the truth a little bit?
Uh, then you're not going to tell him?
I haven't and I won't File's closed
[Exhales Deeply]
[Sighs] Thank you
Thank you, Mr Brimmer
I am so grateful
How grateful?
Mrs Kennicutt, a detective agency runs on information
That's our raw material
Your husband owns three newspapers, two on this coast and one on the East
Whenever anything happens on the inside of business or politics or even in the jet-set...
I still don't understand how I...
Information, Mrs Kennicutt
It is our only stock in trade
For example, at the moment I'm working on case wherein it would be very beneficial to my client to have certain information about a federal judge that your husband is supporting
Are you saying that you want me to be a pipeline to my husband?
NoJust [Sighs] a good listener
Is it really asking so much, Mrs Kennicutt?
I can't do this kind of work alone
I need that kind of help
Why don't you think about it and we'll talk again
[Ice Cubes Jingling]
Your terrace door was unlocked, so I trespassed
Well, there's no car in the front
Oh I thought you knew everything, Mr Brimmer We're neighbors
My husband and I have a weekend house about three miles from here
Ironic, isn't it?
Why are you here?
Well, why else?
To discuss your...
What shall we call it?
Your proposition
I've been walking on the beach for hours, thinking
And you've come to a decision
Oh, yes
Tell me something, Mr Brimmer
How many other rich men's wives owe you favors?
Do they all capitulate easily?
I'm waiting for your answer
Oh, indulge me
I should think the blackmail-ee has some right
Mrs Kennicutt, I r...
The answer is no
No deal
Is that plain enough for you?
If you want a spy, you find someone else
All right
I'll have to call your husband in the morning and...
And what?
Tell him I had an affair?
Sorry It won't work
I'm going to tell him myself
I can't believe that you'd want to do that
Well, what you believe really doesn't matter, does it?
It's what Arthur thinks that's important
Maybe he'll ask for a divorce or maybe he'll forgive me
But it's time I was honest with him
You're being very foolish
Only if I lose
But you can't threaten me anymore, can you?
You just lost your leverage
Oh, and one other thing
I'm also going to tell him about the way you run your business
I wouldn't advise that Oh, I'm sure you wouldn't
Because whether he forgives me or not, he's gonna despise you for lying to him
And Arthur's not the right man to have for an enemy
Good night, Mr Brimmer Mrs Kennicutt, I want you to reconsider
Your husband has some very powerful friends
[Chortles] That's right
Now, if you'll please excuse me
I cannot permit you to do that Well, you don't understand It's not your choice
You let go of me!
Let go!
[Glass Shatters]
[Car Horn Blaring]
[Siren Approaching]
[Siren Dies Out]
[Engine Stops]
What's the trouble, Offlcer?
May I see your license and registration?
Turn signal, right?
The right one
You know, it's the second time I got stopped today
I tell you, I'll get those things fixed as soon as I can
- You'll get 'em fixed now
- I would, but I'm on my way to a 187 PC
- Say, are you a cop?
- Uh, yeah, a lieutenant...
Columbo
Well, I'm sorry, Lieutenant, I flagged you down
Well, that's all right You're just doing your job Listen, I'll get those things fixed
This license expires next week
Oh Oh, well, thanks
Say, I better give you an escort That way you'll get where you wanna go
Oh Okay Appreciate that But listen, not too fast
[Police Radio Chatter]
Can't tell for sure, but I don't think she was killed her Looks like the body was moved
And the cause of death?
Probably a severe concussion
Print team all wrapped up, Captain Nothing
There were two blows Uh, send them on home
Laceration on the cheek and major contusion at the base of the skull
How do you read that?
It's hard to say
Maybe somebody hit her and she struck her head going down
- Lieutenant, you got that?
- I'll know more about this after the autopsy
Uh, yeah Got a match?
Plus the approximate time of death
No No tire tracks we can use
Got a match?
I'm sorry I don't smoke
Oh No printsJust smudges
Money?
just change No currency
You got a match No, I don't Sorry
Got a match Yeah, sure
[Captain] We're all finished here You can load it up
Identification and purse Mrs Arthur Kennicutt... the Arthur Kennicutt
How do you know that?
Credit card's made out to Kennicutt Publications
What's the problem?
Newspapers
If we don't handle this according to Kennicutt's satisfaction, he's got an awful lot of front pages to beat us over the head with
Thought I told you to move that out of here
Lieutenant, what are you looking at?
The bruise, sir The lady has a bruise on the left cheek
We know that
I knew you weren't listening
[Police Radio Chatter Continues]
It's Lenore I wanna get out of here
Oh Thank you, Lieutenant
Would you like to be alone for a few moments?
No, no I can feel sorry for myself some other time, after you've caught him
Well, should we get down to business?
Are you sure there's nothing else you want?
As the husband, I'm the most likely suspect, correct?
Uh...
You don't have to worry about my feelings, Lieutenant
She was killed last night What time?
Between 8:
OO and 9:
OO
Well, I was in San Francisco addressing a conference
I didn't fly back until this morning
Uh, you have the flight numbers on that?
My secretary can give them to you, together with my hotel and my schedule
You'll check them all out, naturally
Yes, sir And when you do, you'll dismiss me as a possibility and then get down to the real business of finding the real killer
And I want him found, Lieutenant
Soon I'll do my best
I'm sure you will
Uh, Mr Kennicutt, it would help if you could tell us a few things
Did your wife have any enemies?
Lenore never offended a soul
She was an extraordinary woman
I see This question is a bit awkward, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask it... was there ever, uh, another man in her life?
Naturally More than one
But that was years ago, before we were married
- No, sir I meant since you were married
- You're speaking of an affair?
Well, I'm afraid we're gonna have to consider it
Well, don't bother Lenore was faithful to me in every way
She had a clean bill of health
All right Clean bill of health
So you don't think we ought to go in that direction?
No, I don't
All right Can you tell us about her habits?
What did she do in her spare time?
Nothing unusual
Shopping, charity work
Sports Sports What kind of sports did she play?
Oh, tennis She was also very fond of skin diving
Yes Uh, did she do this with you, sir?
Did she do it with friends?
With friends, Lieutenant
Female friends, in case you're wondering
Female friends
All right, sir I think I've got enough to start with
Thank you very much
Lieutenant,
I want you to understand something
I married a woman young enough to be my daughter
A lot of people were skeptical, but it worked for us
We loved each other We loved each other very much
We even thought of having a child
I want this man caught
And I must warn you, I don't intend to be patient
Yes, sir
Oh, Lieutenant Thanks for the coffee
You're welcome, sir
Good morning, Lieutenant Good morning, sir
Would you like some coffee, some juice?
Uh, nothing for me
No Thank you very much Any progress?
Uh, no, sir I hate to admit this, but, uh, nothing
Not a single lead?
No, sir Nothing
Well, uh...
Well, some of my associates think that, uh, your wife was mugged and the fella ran away with the money
But, um, you see, they can't really explain how the body was moved
And, uh, now, me, I don't know
I, uh...
I think she knew the murderer
Why?
Excuse me [Ringing]
Yes
All right Be right in
Why?
Well, her behavior seems a little strange, sir
Uh, she went out to the beach house in the middle of the week, which is unusual
And, uh, she said to the caretaker she had some thinking to do and then she went for a walk
And then the next morning her body was found on the other side of town
What are you getting at?
I wish I knew I don't know
It's just that it sounds to me like a woman that has a problem
Now, did your wife have any personal problems?
My wife was a very happy woman
Uh-huh Yeah, well, it's just that if she did have a problem,
I thought that maybe it would be connected with the murder
But you've no proof of that Oh, no, sir No
Lieutenant, I call the City Room every half hour to find out what you people are doing
So far, not a word
No arrest...
not even a promise of one
Now you tell me you haven't a lead
Well, I'm sorry, Mr Kennicutt Uh, looks like it's gonna be slow
It doesn't have to be
Lieutenant
Lieutenant Columbo, this is Mr Brimmer
How do you do?
Lieutenant
You've heard of Brimmer Associates?
Uh, no, I haven't
Well, it's security and investigations, Lieutenant
You might say you and I are in the same business
Oh, really?
Matter of fact, I was talking about you just last night
I ran into the commissioner at a party
He speaks very highly of you
Naturally, you're wondering why Mr Brimmer's here
Now, please don't take this as a reflection on you, but I've engaged his firm to work on the case
Well, now, Arthur, I'm here in an advisory capacity...
a supplemental capacity only
I don't want the lieutenant to get the idea that I'm competing with him
Uh, but there's no reason why a private agency and a public one can't cooperate, is there?
No
You see, I want as much coverage in this case as possible
And when Mr Brimmer called and offered his services,
I thought it was an excellent idea
Sure, uh, I can understand that
Uh, you two know each other?
Well, Mr Brimmer's done some work for me
I see I see [Clears Throat]
Some kind of security work?
Guards for the paper?
Oh, it was a personal matter The point is, Lieutenant,
I told Arthur on the phone I couldn't imagine you wouldn't accept a helping hand considering the manpower shortage in your department
You see, Mr Brimmer used to be a police officer himself
[Brimmer] Well, it was a long time ago
But at least I can understand your problems, Lieutenant
Well, now, listen, I said to Mr Kennicutt I'm grateful for all the help I can get
I'm just not sure how my superior's gonna take this
That's already been taken care of
It's just that Mr Kennicutt is anxious for a quick resolution to the case You can understand that
Well, naturally [Brimmer] Well, good
I hope the association will be beneficial to you
Oh, I'm sure it will Yeah
You know, I suddenly feel very much more optimistic about this whole thing
Uh, it's not based on anything, no facts, but, you know, I'm a superstitious guy
You know, I believe in signs I believe in palmistry and astrology and all that kinda thing
You don't, I know that Oh, definitely not
Let me see your hand
You see, Mr Kennicutt, that's your fate line and it breaks there
That was your bad fortune
But it picks up again, and that's interesting
That's a very good omen
May I?
Mmm
Deep line of Apollo
That's a man devoted to his work
Your Apollo line crosses the mound of the Moon You know, that's very rare
And very impressive
That's the sign of a man who's destined to attain a very particular kind of distinction
That's a very good sign
I know you think it's silly, but I'm gonna make a believer out of you before I'm done
It was very nice meeting you Nice to have met you
Bye-bye
Oh, Mr Brimmer Large thumb, low mound of Venus
That means ambition, purposefulness
That's a closet, Lieutenant
[Chuckles] Oh, gee I'm sorry
A lot of people make the same mistake
Say, that's a terriflc-looking set of clubs Do you mind?
Go ahead
These seem light Are these ladies' clubs?
- They were Lenore's
- You didn't say she played golf, did you?
You mentioned tennis and skin diving
- That's because she just started
- Ahh I see Where'd she play?
At the country club I see At the club
Well, I was just wondering why shejust didn't keep her clubs in the locker room?
She did That's an extra set she used to take lessons with
Oh, I see Well, that explains it Right
Uh, you mean she didn't take lessons at her own club?
She took them someplace else?
Sky Lane Why, is it important?
It's not important It's just I like to get that background information very precise if I can
Bye
- Is this the right door?
- [Chuckles] Yes
Well, what was that all about?
Well, I think, uh, police techniques have changed a little over the years
Here, try it again
And remember, keep the back of your left hand straight
None of this just stroke it easy, all right?
Oh, that was good You're getting better
Well, I still don't think I'm ever gonna learn this game
Oh, you just have to keep your eye on the ball, watch your concentration
You're coming along fine
Do we have time for another bucket?
Sorry, Jenny Time's up Tomorrow, 3:
OO
Tomorrow then
You a member of the club?
Uh, no No, I'm, uh, Lieutenant Columbo I'm from the police
[Mumbles]
What's the problem?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about a Lenore Kennicutt
Uh, you knew her?
Not very well
I gave her a few lessons
I see Uh, well, this is your appointment book, isn't it?
Well, you should know You've been looking at it
Well, no offense I was just killing time
But, uh, you know, now that you mention it,
I see that you gave her a lot of lessons
She liked the game I see
Well, look here's the thing Um, since you spent a lot of time with her,
I was wondering if you could give me some help
How?
Was she the type of woman... now this is just between you and me... was she the type of woman who was on the lookout?
I mean, did you ever notice her give her eye to any of the men around here?
Uh, look, Lieutenant We better get one thing straight
I teach them golf and I play in their tournaments, but I don't get involved in their personal lives
If they wanna pair off, that's none of my business
Okay All right Uh, well, thanks a lot
It's quite all right Take it easy
Uh, say, uh, what kind of club is this?
Oh, that's a number one wood
Number one wood
Listen, uh, could you give me a lesson?
What?
No, I'm serious You know what my trouble is?
I work too hard Never out of the office
I figure this.
if I could take up a sport, get out in the fresh air and get some exercise, that'd do me some good
- What do you say?
- Well, I...
Just for a few minutes Just to, you know, start to swing Come on
Say, you know what was a funny thing about your appointments with Mrs Kennicutt?
Uh, the first two were in the morning and all the rest, and I counted 13 of them, uh, they were always in the middle or the late afternoon
So?
Uh, well, I guess it's not important
I guess it's nothing Uh, wait a minute I'll take off my coat
Except that, uh, now, every time you had an appointment with Mrs Kennicutt, it was always the last lesson of the day
I like to finish at a reasonable hour Doesn't everyone?
Oh, I see So those days, you left the club
I thought maybe you'd hang around to see if you could pick up an odd lesson
Well, I didn't always go home
Oh, who said anything about going home?
Oh What I mean is I didn't always leave the club Sometimes...
Hey, listen Can I help you out?
Don't say anything else You don't have an attorney
Wait until you get an attorney This way you can hurt your case
Believe me, I know something about my business
I don't know nothing about golf, you know See that's your business
I know something about my business
And believe me, you know, down through the years, uh, you get so that you develop a nose for things, you see?
And, uh...
After a while, the old nose just tells you when someone's not giving you the truth
Now, uh, I'm gonna forget about the lesson, 'cause I could never learn this game, but I'll be back to talk to you
Ground covered by the police is not our concern
One thing to bear in mind, money was taken
Granted, it could have been a smoke screen, but sometimes the obvious answer is the correct one
Now, Brooks...
Yes, sir?
Check into her banking account with particular attention to withdrawals
See if you can find out how much cash she was carrying that day Mr Kennicutt will be glad to cooperate
Now, my theory, gentlemen, and you will gear your efforts in this direction,
Mrs Kennicutt was walking along the Pacific Coast Highway
She was forced into a car by someone
The motive was robbery
She probably fought back In any case, she was killed
The murderer drove around in a panic and finally all the way out to here, where he got rid of the body
[Intercom Buzzer] Yes?
[Woman] Lieutenant Columbo to see you Who?
Oh, yes Yes, send him in
Gentlemen, we'll finish this later I'll call you Thank you
Lieutenant!
Come in
Whew!
Boy This is quite a building
This all yours?
'Fraid so
Must be a lot of business for your kinda company these days Well, we can't handle it all
Sit down Uh, listen, your secretary called
She said you wanted to see the files on the case, so I thought it'd be a lot safer if I brought 'em over myself
Oh That's very nice of you It wasn't necessary, but I appreciate it very much
Uh, want some coffee?
No No, thanks
Thank you Uh, those are the duplicates
Okay
Yes, this will help
A lot of it I wonder if you can give me a little rundown
Well, it's just what I told Mr Kennicutt
No leads Except, you know, I was looking through that stuff last night
Mm-hmm
And, uh, drives my wife crazy, you know
Because we have the lamp right next to the bed, and the poor thing, she can't sleep
Did you find anything?
No, not really Well, uh, take the autopsy report
Yes Here it is
You see now, that jibed with something that I noticed about the body the first time I saw it, and that bothered me
Mrs Kennicutt was struck on the left cheek, and she had a bruise
And she had a weird kinda cut
Um...
Do you see what I mean?
Um, no I don't think so
Well, let's start with the cut, because that's what bothered me
I said to myself, "Now what in the world could have caused that kind of cut? "
Uh, does this lighter work?
Yeah, I think so
Uh...
Uh, wh... where was I?
About the cut
Oh, yes What could have caused the cut?
I said to myself, "lt could be a ring"
A ring of...
You mean a finger ring This kind of ring
Yeah, something like that Now here's the way I figured it
Suppose you were gonna strike somebody
Suppose it was a woman
Now, do you punch her?
Well, maybe
But more than likely, you hit with your open hand
Either this way or this way Mm-hmm
Now, if you hit this way, then the ring is not gonna cause any cut
So I figured it was a backhand blow like this All right?
I still don't follow you too well, because that would, uh, that would put it over on...
But I used my right hand, you see?
Yeah
And if the ring was on the right hand, then the bruise would be on the right cheek
But it was on the left cheek, so the murderer was left-handed
Struck her like this
Which means the murderer is left-handed Well, that's interesting
That's provided, of course, all these, uh, speculations are valid
Yeah, I would say that we have a left-handed murderer, and, uh, and an unpremeditated crime
We have?
Oh, I think so, yes
I mean, I don't think a man kills with his hands unless he's angry
As a matter of fact, you know, maybe he didn't mean to do it
Could be
You know, maybe it was an accident
You know, I got a feeling that when we flnd our friend, it's gonna turn out that he has a terrible temper
Hmm [Chuckles]
Well, maybe you're right
I certainly wish I had your crystal ball, Lieutenant
Why don't you let me digest this material, and then we'll talk again
Okay All right Fine
Sure Listen I want to thank you for the time
Listen Thank you Right
Oh, listen, before I forget, uh...
Gee whiz
I didn't wanna forget that
But, uh, let's see
I had a receipt here that I wanted you to sign
Well, listen, let's just make one up
It's a receipt for the fl/es
Isn't that weird?
- What a coincidence
- What's that?
Here, a moment ago, we were talking about left-handed people, and you're left-handed
And right-handed
I'm ambidextrous
That means I don't favor either hand particularly
It's a character trait shared by about 1 O%o of the world's population
Ten percent?
No kidding?
Anything else?
Uh, no
No, I don't think so Uh, oh, listen This is a little bit off the subject
My sister-in-law, she wants to buy a place out at the beach How do you like it out there?
Who told you I was living out at the beach?
Well, no one I...
I noticed your car out in front of Mr Kennicutt's
You know, you parked it there in the driveway
As I was walking by, I saw the chrome was tarnished
You know what the salt air does to it It just eats the life out of it
Yeah, that part's a problem, all right
Uh, you're a very observant man, Lieutenant
That's not what my wife says [Laughs]
Well, you tell your sister-in-law that she will love it at the beach if she doesn't mind that problem with the salt air on the chrome
I'll give her that message And thanks again
Thank you
Oh, uh, say
Have you ever been in Mr Kennicutt's house?
Yes, I met you there
No, I didn't mean the big house I meant out at the beach
I was just wondering, because your beach house and his beach house, they're fairly close, aren't they?
No It's a couple miles
That close?
Tsk Isn't that a coincidence?
[Chuckles]
I'll tell you, this case is just full of'em
[Door Closes]
[Sighs] Why don't you and I take a walk?
When you showed up today, I...
I kinda panicked
Then you did have an affair with her?
Turning on the ladies is about the only thing I do well
I'm not a very good golfer Yeah, go on
Well, it was pretty good for a while... at least for me
She got the guilts
Funny thing, I think she really loved her husband
One day she said, "Ken, this is bad for both of us Let's call it off" So we did
Must have shook you up when we found her dead
I couldn't believe it
Then I got to thinking, sooner or later, you guys would find out about me
Maybe even think I killed her
The night she died, I was...
I was home watching the tube
No calls No company
No alibi That's...
That's why I started to run
Uh-huh I can understand that
You didn't kill her
No, no I know that, but this afternoon, you gave me the impression...
No You're in the clear You got nothing to worry about
You see, whoever did this, he had to wear a ring
Now, you don't wear a ring
Well, I could have taken it off
No, not with that tan, because that would show
Now listen Tell me something
Mrs Kennicutt...
Did Mrs Kennicutt ever indicate to you that she was concerned that her husband knew about you two?
No
That's funny that you mention it though, because, well, I was concerned
Why?
Well, Lenore never saw anyone, but I'm sure we were being followed
By who?
Well, there was this one guy in particular
Sharp, well-dressed I only caught him in flashes, but...
Well, he... he had a crew cut Kind of an ex-marine type
[Telephone Ringing]
- Yes?
- Wilcox, Mr Brimmer
The subject is meeting with Archer, and they've engaged in conversation
Did you overhear anything?
No, sir But Archer seems to be doing most of the talking
Maintain the surveillance and report to me in the morning
Yes, sir
[Phone Ringing] Why, you little bum, you
Hello?
Oh, yes, he is Leo
Mr Brimmer
- Yes, sir?
- I'm sorry to trouble you at home, Leo
No sweat just playing with Teddy
Well, I've got a little something I want you to do for me It may complicate your life a little bit
- When?
- Immediately
- Set it up through my secretary
- Yes, sir I'll be in touch
Every one of our operatives is a skilled marksman
Actually, our policy is to avoid the use of the weapon
This is our memory bank, Lieutenant
Millions ofbits of information, all cross-flled and on tape, immediately available
There are more electrical impulses in this room than in your brain
Hard to believe [Chuckles]
We here at Brimmer Associates use the most up-to-date equipment
Years ahead of what you use at police headquarters
Company cars...
custom designed for us
Most of them with telephonic or radio communication
Phew!
It's very impressive
Oh, uh, just one moment, Lieutenant
One other thing that might interest you
If you'll just move past this gate
- It's not working
- Well, it has to be
You're carrying a gun, aren't you, Lieutenant?
No No?
Oh
Well, that explains the malfunction
Look here A special system is built into the gate
Now, if you had a gun, it would have registered
It's just like out at the airport
It's a security precaution
Not that we expect our clients to be carrying concealed weapons, but, uh, well, there have been a few exceptions
Really?
Well, a guy came in here just about a month ago
Harmless looking An accountant for Mid-Century Oil
We were doing a company audit [Brimmer] Mr Denning?
I asked you to show the lieutenant around
I did not suggest that you discuss our confidential matters with anyone at anytime
Our clients pay us to be discreet
Yes, sir
Won't you come in, Lieutenant?
Sorry about the outburst, but my people have got to learn
This is a business of trust I can't have them gossiping about the clients
Thank you, Henry
Hope you'll have lunch with me Like quenelle of sole?
Uh, well, if it's fish, I like fish I love fish
Yeah, it's fish Drop your coat and dig in
On the Kennicutt case, my men have come up with an interesting lead
There were two derelicts seen in the area
I have their description I sent them over to your office, copies
Right Uh, I'll have that checked out
Anything new on your end?
Uh, oh, yeah Yeah, we got a couple of things
It seems as though Mrs Kennicutt was having an affair, you see?
Uh...
Boy, this is delicious How do you make this stuff?
I'll have a recipe sent over to you You were saying?
Oh, yeah Uh, it seems as though
Mrs Kennicutt, uh, she was having an affair
And, uh...
Oh?
And, uh...
Oh, listen, when you send the recipe, would you send it to the house?
- Don't send it to the office
- Yes, I'll send it to your house
Yeah, she was having an affair with some golf pro at some country club
And, uh, here's the interesting thing
Not only were they having an affair, but it seems as though they were being watched
Now I got this nutty notion
Suppose Mr Kennicutt, uh...
I'll tell you, it's too far-fetched
Sometimes it helps to test it out Try me
It's really crazy Well, listen It doesn't cost anything
Suppose...
Suppose Mr Kennicutt hired somebody to check up on his wife
And this somebody lied to him
He said to Mr Kennicutt, "Look
Your wife, she's got a clean bill of health"
Now this somebody, whoever it is, he's in a perfect position to blackmail Mrs Kennicutt
Now suppose she refuses
See?
She says, "No, I'm gonna go tell my husband"
Hmm I think it's a terrific motive, don't you?
Lieutenant, you have a marvelously convoluted mind
I do?
I like it
The trouble with your theory is, not only is it very tenuous, but it's impossible to prove, isn't it?
I, uh...
Oh Got a little tomato on that there
Well, I said it was nutty
What do you think?
You think I oughta drop it, hmm?
[Clears Throat] If you believe in it, stick to it
Run it on down
One other thing you should keep in mind
Nothing at all to do with the case
- What's that?
- Your future
I'd like you to work for Brimmer Associates
Me?
That's why I had you taken on a VIP tour
We're a growing organization You can see that
You'll be a valuable piece of manpower for us
Oh, boy You really know how to toss a curve
No, no, I don't mean it that way I'm quite serious
You're a good man, Columbo...
up here
It's time you were thinking about advancement
What does a lieutenant make?
If you come with us,
I'm almost positive I can triple your yearly income
Whew!
Boy I'll tell you, it's all so sudden
Uh, let me talk it over with my wife
Of course talk it over with your wife Think about it carefully
But remember, we want you here
Listen I'm very flattered I mean that just let me mull it over a little bit
Well, while you're mulling, consider my career
If I'd stayed with the force, by now, probably with luck,
I could have been a captain of detectives
Hmm?
With one eye on the promotion list, and the other eye on my car payments
No house by the ocean
No freedom to travel No... what would you say?
Power or sense of accomplishment
Have I succeeded in getting through...
[Clears Throat] in stimulating you?
Deflnitely Yes, sir
Yes, I'm gonna give it all a lot of thought
That's as much as I can ask
Uh, one thing Hmm?
If I came with you, would I still be working on the Kennicutt case?
Well, let's see
I have men who are perfectly capable of handling the Kennicutt case
No I have several other matters that are far more important than that I'd like to put you on right away
Lieutenant, to the knock of opportunity
Hey Hi
Dry throat for some reason Oh, help yourself
Yeah Hey, I hope I didn't get you into trouble before
I mean, I'm sorry about what happened I'm used to it
Why?
Does he blow off a lot of steam?
Well, let's just say our founding father has quite a temper
No kidding That's funny, because he... he looks to me like he's a guy that's always under control
Uh, correction He's under control most of the time
And when people like that let go, stand back
Oh I'll tell you why I'm interested He offered me a job
Oh?
Yeah
Well, welcome to the family Yeah, here's my problem
I don't know how much to ask for Whatever you can get
Top man can pull down about 3O, OOO
No kidding?
[Whistles] That's a lot of money
Gee, listen Does anybody else here make more than that?
I mean, besides Mr Brimmer?
Well, maybe Leo
Who's Leo?
Leo Gentry
He's the boy who gets the cream of the cases Hey, I think I know him
Crew cut, ex-marine type?
Yeah, that's Leo
Teacher's pet, at least this month
Hey, listen Where can I talk to him?
Maybe he can give me a few pointers
Oh I haven't seen him around yet today, but, uh...
I'll get his address from Personnel
Uh, don't mention it to Brimmer
Who me?
No That's the last thing I'd do
[Children Chattering]
Higher Higher?
Listen If you go any higher, you're gonna go right over the top
Hey, what's going on?
Mrs Gentry?
I wanna tell you, you got a terrific kid here
Nothing frightens him You can't scare this boy
I said higher!
Higher?
All right, listen You go higher, and I'll eat your ice cream, all right?
No, I wanna eat it You wanna eat it
All right Here you go You're coming down
Down to earth There you are Get your ice cream
Do we know each other?
Uh, no Uh, my name is Columbo
I'm a lieutenant I'm from the police
My daddy's a private eye I know that, Teddy
And he's a very good one Listen Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
- Well, is it about Leo's work?
- Well, not exactly
I'm working on a case, and I thought maybe he could help me out
- But I can't seem to locate him
- He went away
That's right, Lieutenant His boss called last night and sent him on a special assignment
Oh, I see Uh, do you know where he went?
Or, uh, how long he's gonna be away?
Sorry That's the way it is with Leo
He took his passport, so I guess he's overseas somewhere
I see Is there something wrong?
No, no, no No, not really Listen Maybe you could help me out
Was Leo recently on a case where he was following a woman?
A married woman?
Well, it's... it's possible, but I don't really know
No?
You never discuss Leo's work?
No It's a household rule
I mean, I'm not very much at keeping secrets
If Leo were to tell me anything, it'd be all over the Laundromat
If you have any questions, you better ask Leo
It's kinda hard to ask him, because I can't locate him
He went away
But why don't you talk to his boss, Mr Brimmer?
He can tell you what Leo's working on
Uh, oh, yeah I, uh...
Thanks
I have the feeling he won't be too much help
But, uh, at any rate, uh, I'm sorry I bothered you
Bye-bye, Teddy
F
- E-L-O-P-
Z-D
All right Now try the next to the bottom line
F-D-P-
T-C-E-O?
Perfect vision Well, it should be This is a new prescription
Here's your temporary You should have your license in a few weeks
Thank you very much Keep this too
Next
Now, while I mark your test, please read from the eye chart, third line down
Did that lady say that she just got a new pair of glasses?
- What?
- [Slams Counter]
- She wasn't wearing glasses
- Of course she was
Excuse me Uh, wait What about the eye chart?
And all of a sudden, I remembered this picture See?
She's wearing glasses
But there were no glasses on the body
Now, could she have dropped them somewhere?
I'm sorry, Lieutenant, but you're on the wrong track
Why?
Well, shortly after that picture was taken,
Lenore gave up wearing glasses
She switched to contact lenses
Ah, contact lenses just a matter of vanity She thought she looked better
Uh-huh Did she wear 'em often?
All the time She was extremely nearsighted
Mr Kennicutt, where's your wife's personal effects?
The funeral director sent them over
I've avoided going through them
Do you mind?
No, go ahead
This her lens case?
Yes
It's empty
Well, she was probably wearing them when she died
Well, then maybe, uh...
Maybe what?
Mr Kennicutt, I'm gonna ask your permission for something
This is the world's biggest long shot
And it's gonna be painful for you
But I think it's worth a try
Would it help?
There are no guarantees
All right, Lieutenant You have a blank check
Mobile Operator, the number I want is 476-73O1
[Line Ringing] They just arrived, and they're entering the vault
The medical examiner's with them Why?
What's the reason?
Haven't been able to find out, sir, but I did learn one thing
Kennicutt signed an exhumation order
All right, stay there I'll be right over
Get my car ready
He says it won't take long
[Car Ignition Grinding]
[Ignition Continues Grinding]
What's the trouble?
I don't know, sir
The battery's okay, but the car won't start
[Ignition Grinding] I'm in a hurry Get me another car
Yes, sir
Have this one serviced Tell them I want it tomorrow Yes, sir
[Tires Squealing]
[Police Radio Chatter]
[Police Radio Chatter Continues]
Arthur I should have phoned you, but there wasn't time
Well, it's all right One of my men told me you were here
Something break?
I don't know yet They're exhuming Lenore's body
Tell me why
Well, the lieutenant's working on a long shot
Apparently, she was wearing her contact lenses when she was killed
How's that significant?
Well, there's a chance that she might have lost one of them... maybe both of them at the scene of the crime
Well, Arthur, I don't like to be critical, but that's more than a long shot
You might as well buy a lottery ticket
Maybe not Listen to me
My nephew wears those things, and half of the time they're falling out
Now, the other morning at breakfast, one of them ended up in the cereal
[Brimmer] Mrs Kennicutt is not your nephew, Lieutenant
Listen Mrs Kennicutt was struck forcibly Now let's bear that in mind
Why isn't it possible that they were knocked loose?
Anything's possible
The autopsy report said nothing about any of this at all
Listen Forget about the autopsy report I checked with the medical examiner about that
They snuffed it off They didn't even bother to look
All they were concerned about was the cause of death
[Man] Lieutenant
Well, I hope it's not a waste
What else can I do?
I've got to pursue every possibility
Arthur, it's almost a criminal breach to disappoint you now after what you've been through
Move over
Listen We're in luck The right contact lens is missing, and it's not in the coffin
Well, it might have fallen out in the morgue, I guess
Or in the ambulance Or in the street
She might have lost it before she was killed
Could be a hundred places That's true, but maybe... and this is what we gotta hope for... maybe it's at the place where she was murdered
[Kennicutt] But we don't know where that place is
[Columbo] No, sir, we don't We don't know for sure
But I've got a few hunches
Unless you can be specific, I can't help
I think the lieutenant deserves some room Don't you?
As you wish You go your own way, Lieutenant
Thank you, sir I will But keep us posted
Yes, sir I will I'll keep you posted
[Sighs]
I only wish one thing
I wish the murderer knew about this Why?
There'd be a piece of conclusive evidence that might be lying around in his premises, and he'd have to find it before we did
I'll keep you posted, sir
[Doorbell Rings]
Oh, uh, Mr Brimmer Lieutenant
Listen I'm sorry to bother you at this hour, but, uh...
May I come in?
Yes, sure Come on in There's something I wanted to talk to you about
Okay Fine, if you can make it a little brief It's been a late day
Oh, sure Say, this is some terrific place you got here
And you got the sound of the ocean all the time, huh?
Yeah
Well, me, I love the beach I love it
Except when the water gets cold, then I don't like to go in Then I like a pool
Lieutenant, did you say you had something on your mind?
Oh, yeah It's about that job you offered me
I've been giving it a lot of thought
Uh, as a matter of fact, uh, I haven't been able to sleep
And, uh...
Boy, this is a fantastic rug My wife would love this rug
We gotta get a new rug, and this is just the kind she wants
Fantastic piling, huh?
Very soft
Bet you could lose a shoe in here for a week, you wouldn't find it It's late
I still got a lot of work to do You were talking about my job offer
I really don't think I'd be very happy making a change, you know
I like it where I am It's not a bad life
Mm-hmm Okay Uh, is that final?
I think so, yes No hard feelings?
No, no, certainly not I just, uh...
Well, I think you're making a mistake That's all
You're probably right You know, my wife, she's always said I don't have enough ambition
You know what it was that really made up my mind?
What was that?
The Kennicutt case
I don't wanna give up working on it just now
Not when I'm so close to a solution
Well, uh, are you gonna let me in on it?
Oh, certainly Don't worry
You'll be the first to know Good night
Good night
[Car Door Closes] [Engine Starts]
[Vehicle Departs]
- Hello?
- Yes, this is Mr Brimmer
You took my car in to be repaired, didn't you?
Yes, sirJust like you said They'll try to have it for you as soon as they can
All right then Good night
[Footsteps]
[Keys Jingling]
[Car Door Opens, Closes]
You mind telling us what you're doing?
I'd say that was none of your business, Lieutenant
Well, if you say so, but, uh, it's gonna be kinda hard to explain, isn't it?
I mean, breaking and entering?
That's against the law
Checking the trunk of your car What in the world were you looking for?
Papers for a case
I thought they were here It's an emergency
Why don't you admit it?
You were searching the trunk, 'cause that's where you hid the body
All right What's the next step?
Why don't we go downtown and talk it over?
Am I under arrest?
I guess you could say so On what evidence?
I think it's gotta be more comfortable downtown All right
Let's get this farce over with
Grab his arm!
It was an accident, Arthur
It wasn't premeditated
I hardly knew your wife
I didn't want to hurt either one of you
It happened
How'd you get it?
I got it from the cut on her cheek and your ring
You never should have let me read your palm
'Cause then I felt the ring and I felt the two diamonds sticking out and that raised rectangular border
That matched up with the cut on her cheek
You should have taken that job
You know, we're lucky Lenore lost this
Uh, she didn't lose it What?
When I spoke to the medical examiner at the cemetery, he told me that both contact lenses were on the body
But that's impossible If it isn't hers, whose was it?
Who knows?
Anyway, it doesn't make any difference
The fact that it's not the real contact lens, that doesn't count
What does count is Mr Brimmer's actions... coming here tonight, trying to get rid of that thing and doing it all in front of witnesses
What would you have done if the car hadn't broken down?
You couldn't set up this trap
Well, I guess we would have found some other way
You know what this place reminds me of?
just seeing all these cars...
You know, in our neighborhood, we had a bunch ofjokers
I mean, we were a real wild bunch of guys
And we figured out a perfect way to put a car out of commission
You take a potato, you stick it in the exhaust pipe
It doesn't cause any damage, but the car won't start
It was a terrible thing to do And I got a feeling that the reason I became a cop was to make up for all those jokes I played when I was a kid
Ifyou had a choice, would you rather love a girl, or have her love you?
- I want it mutual.
- If you couldn't have that.
Would I rather be the one who loves, or is loved?
It's not an easy question.
I think I'd rather be in love.
Me, too.
I wouldn't want to get hurt, though.
- You were in love with Gloria.
- I was starting to be.
Then she let me feel her up on the first date.
Turned me right off.
- You kept going with her.
- Well, she let me feel her up.
- What about Gwen?
- Her I could talk to.
- I never could talk to any girl.
- I was getting crazy about her.
But she wouldn't let me lay a hand on her.
- So I went back to Gloria.
- You want perfection.
- What do you want?
- She just has to be nice.
- Not beautiful?
- She doesn't have to be.
- I'd like her built, though.
- I want mine sexy.
- She shouldn't look like a tramp.
- Sexy doesn't mean like a tramp.
- There's a middle ground.
- I would want that.
Tall, very tall...
That would scare me.
She should be very understanding.
Start the same sentences together.
- I'd like that.
- Big tits...
- Yeah, but still a virgin.
- I don't care about that.
I wouldn't mind if she was a little ahead of me, with those big tits.
And knew hundreds of different ways.
I want a companion.
The other stuff I can get on the outside.
The first time I do it, I don't want to waste it on some beast.
I feel about getting laid the same way I feel about college.
I'm being pressured into it.
- You like that?
- Yeah.
I give her to you.
I'm a generous guy.
I'm grateful.
How do I break the news to her?
Go over there.
There's a way to talk to girls.
Tell her a joke.
Tell her about your unhappy childhood.
- That's not bad.
- But don't make it like an act.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, schmuck.
If you don't, I will.
You can't even stand up.
- I fucked up.
- My turn.
- She's mine, you gave her to me.
- You struck out.
I get two more times at bat.
- This is my first college mixer.
- I hate them.
- It's so phony.
- Everybody puts on an act.
- You don't know who you meet.
- Because you're meeting the act.
- I'm not sure I agree.
- I don't either.
- You don't agree with yourself?
- How do you feel about it?
People like to think they put on an act, but it's really them.
- They think they can change it.
- They're kidding themselves?
- It is an act, but the act is them.
- Then how can it be an act?
- Because they're an act.
- They're also real.
So I'm not real?
- I'm an act?
- It's all right, so am I.
Don't you behave differently with different people?
- With your family?
- I thought you meant people.
- Sure, with my family...
- And with friends, another way.
And with your teachers, still another way.
So which one is you?
- You ought to be a lawyer.
- I'm gonna be a lawyer.
A lady lawyer.
You're from Smith, right?
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.
Do you like Amherst?
Sure.
My parents worked very hard to send me.
I'd better like it.
Do you have a name?
- Susan.
- I'm Sandy.
I think you can make out with her.
She's stuff.
- You think so?
- I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
- Shouldn't I try somebody else?
- Who?
She was the best-looking girl at the mixer.
Wasn't she?
- Her tits were too small.
- Yeah.
The hell with her.
- But her legs were great.
- I was standing too close.
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
- She's got funny ideas.
- I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
- Don't rush me.
- What is it?
I like you very much.
It's our third date.
You let me kiss you last week.
If I could kiss you once last week, I should kiss you twice tonight.
- You're the only boy I can talk to.
- I can't see you being quiet.
If somebody doesn't approve of what you are...
- Whatever that is.
- You just don't tell him.
If I want a boy to like me, and I'm brighter than him, -
- I can't show it or I'll lose him.
- I don't want anyone overly bright.
- You wouldn't feel threatened.
Not nearly as much as some people.
I want to write novels.
Later, when I have something to say.
Does that threaten you?
No.
Maybe a little.
Don't press so hard.
It's better when it's gentle.
See?
What are you grinning at?
- Did you feel her up yet?
- I don't want to ruin things.
Was I right about kissing her?
- You won?
- I don't know.
- You let yourself be pushed around.
- You're pushing me around.
I guess I won, she kissed me five times.
That's when you should've put your hand on her tit.
- I should do thatto her?
- She's not doing you a favor.
When a girl lets you kiss her, and feel her up...
Go all the way and all the rest of it...
Isn't it a favor?
What's in it for her?
She's not getting paid.
Fuck you.
Okay, I'll feel her up.
Please take your hand off my breast.
I want you to.
- It can't be fun if I don't want it.
- I didn't say it was fun.
- Then why is your hand there?
- I should be feeling you up by now.
I don't feel that way about you.
I feel that way about you.
Don't you want me to feel something for you, too?
I do like you, but for other reasons.
If we went any further, there wouldn't be those reasons.
- We might have something else.
- What?
Something else.
You're the first girl I've ever done that to.
- I didn't know that.
- It doesn't show?
It's something we both have to go through.
Susan, are you a virgin?
What do I do with my other hand?
What are you gonna do with your hands?
Then she told me to take my hand off her breast.
I said I didn't want to.
She said how could it be fun for me if she didn't like it?
I said I thought she liked me.
She said, "for other reasons."
I told her I really needed this.
That it was my first time.
- What did you say exactly?
- I don't remember exactly.
That she was the first girl I ever tried to feel up.
Was that a mistake?
Then she got nicer to me.
- She put my hand on her breast.
- You mean she left it on.
- She picked it up and put it on.
- She took your hand?
- And put it on like this?
- Yes.
I didn't know what to think.
Suddenly she gets pretty aggressive.
Then I asked if she was a virgin.
Was that a mistake?
- Anyhow, she is.
- She says.
So you got one or two hands on her tits?
- She put the other hand on the other.
- Two hands?
I said, "What are you gonna do with your hands?"
- Then what?
- She unzipped my fly.
- Bullshit artist!
Then what?
- Then she did it.
Did what?
Bullshit artist!
She really did that to you?
Is this Susan?
I'm a friend of Sandy's.
His roommate.
Yeah, Jonathan.
He told you about me?
I'm here at Smith just for tonight, practically on campus.
I was just taking a drive and I found myself practically on campus.
Do you like Smith?
- Where did you go to high school?
- What do you do in the summer?
You always answer with a question?
You always date your best friend's girl?
- Sandy told me you were beautiful.
- He told me you were sexy.
- I guess he's a poor judge.
- He meant you had personality.
- You have a special quality.
- I'm hardly that special.
Most girls I talk to it's like we're spies from foreign countries, speaking in code.
Everything means something else.
I say, "How about a walk?" And it means something else.
"No, I've got a French test tomorrow." And it means something else.
And you say, "I'll help you study."
You're sharp, I like that.
You're too sharp.
- Does that bother you?
- It interests me.
- We'd be good together.
- I'm dating your best friend.
- He won't mind.
I won't tell him.
- What if I mind?
- Want to go out Friday?
- I'm seeing Sandy.
- Saturday?
- I have a date.
- Sunday?
- I'm seeing my folks.
- Where do they live?
- Newton.
- Sunday night?
- I'll be too tired.
I'll help you get over your folks.
- What are you so afraid of?
- Not you.
I think I'm in love.
- Bullshit artist.
- I really think so.
- Did you get in yet?
- What's that got to do with it?
How do you know if you don't know how you are in bed together?
She tells me thoughts I didn't even know I had.
- I can talk to her.
- You can talk to me.
I can say things to her I wouldn't dare say to you.
- Things you'd laugh at.
- I'm laughing now.
She thinks I'm sensitive.
Sensitive?
Oh, boy!
- Do you talk about flowers?
- Books.
- I read more books than you do.
- I'm gonna start.
- I'm reading "The Fountainhead."
- What's that?
Her favorite book.
Ever hear of "Jean Christophe"?
It's a classic, you moron.
I'll read it after "The Fountainhead."
Ever read "Guadalcanal Diary" by Richard Tregaskis?
I read it.
Ever read "Gentleman's Agreement"?
Or "A Bell For Adano"?
- I'm gonna read everything.
- I read more than you.
So who's sensitive?
- I've had a messed-up childhood.
- What does your father do?
- He fails.
It's not funny.
- I'm sorry.
Were you very poor?
My father couldn't hold on to a job.
He kept giving me advice.
The more he failed, the more advice.
He's a Communist.
We're Republicans.
Sometimes I think I'm a Communist.
Me, too.
We have so much, and other people have so little.
After I get set up as a lawyer, I really want to go into politics.
Public service.
It gets me that I was too young to fight in the war.
That was all about proving that, if everybody pitches in, plain people have a chance.
So although I'm the first in my family to get an education, -
- I don't ever want to forget where I came from.
- You're more serious than I thought.
- I know.
I'm another person with her.
The things I say...
- Boy!
Is she built?
- She has... a quality.
She doesn't talk much, but the things she says are sharp.
We should double-date.
I want to know her better before we double-date.
Isn't it great?
A month ago, neither of us even knew a girl.
- What's her name?
- Myrtle.
Bullshit artist!
You're not kidding me?
You really did it!
- Next it's my turn.
- I don't think she'll do it.
- Sandy, find somebody else.
- Are you crazy?
I'm on the verge.
I'll see her tomorrow night.
Sandy?
Do you ever talk to her about me?
Sometimes.
Do me a favor.
Don't tell her I got laid.
Please, Susan.
Sometimes I want to do it, and then I don't.
I don't know why you put up with me.
- I don't think I can do it.
- It really hurts, Susan.
- Let me.
- Not anymore.
Susan, let's do it.
I love you.
Do you have anything?
How long have you had that?
- Not a year or anything?
- I'm sure it's okay.
- I'm not taking any chances.
- These have to be okay.
It's okay.
I'm positive it's okay.
- You're not the first to get laid.
- It's myfirst time.
I don't crow about it.
There's such a thing as good taste.
After you started scoring, what did I get out of you?
"We did it standing, sitting, in the car, under the car.
Myrtle..."
I knew Susan before you knew Myrtle.
But you scored first.
It made me very jealous.
But I didn't try to shut you up.
- I'm your friend, I sat through it.
- Okay, you made your point.
I'm a better friend to you than you are to me.
Didn't you ever do that?
Of course, I knew what "misled" meant.
But when I saw it, I thought it was "myzeled"!
I kept wondering what it meant.
Anybody ever heard of "Round John Virgin"?
- Little John!
- What did you say?
- Round John Virgin.
- Round yon virgin mother and child.
All right:
Gunshee.
G-u-n-s-h-y.
Susan, do the one about the bear.
The hymn we used to sing about the bear with crossed eyes?
Whose name was Gladly.
Don't you know it?
Gladly the cross I'd bear.
Oh, Gladly the cross-eyed bear!
Pronounce this:
c-h-o-p-h-o-u-s-e.
Chophus...
Chop house.
- This has to stop.
- I don't know how to tell him.
- You tell him a lot of other things.
- What does that mean?
You never talk to me the way you talk to him.
- What way?
- I don't know.
- I don't want to hurt him.
- You're hurting me.
- He loves me.
- That's no reason to sleep with him.
You would have just gone on if he hadn't told me, wouldn't you?
- I would never have known.
- I don't know.
Maybe.
- You're really something.
- I don't feel like something.
I feel like nothing.
How much longer do you expect me to take this?
- I'm trying to tell him.
- I see how you're trying.
It's not my fault.
You're supposed to be in love with me.
I'm gonna tell him.
What?
No, Jonathan!
- Try understanding me for once.
- You're stronger.
- You tell him everything else.
- Who says so?
He tells me, he's my best friend.
Are you going to tell him?
He's so helpless.
Susan, I love you.
Why can't you be more with me like you are with Sandy?
She says she's no good for me.
Maybe she's trying to let you down easy.
Go ahead and laugh.
It adds up.
Go ahead and laugh.
You don't know every mood of mine like you know his.
How come?
You don't tell me thoughts I never knew I had.
- You can do it with me.
- I can't.
You can do it with him, you can do it with me.
- I can't with you.
- This has gone far enough.
- I can't stand any more ultimatums.
- Tell him tonight.
Or tomorrow I tell him.
Look at me!
Now tell me my goddamn thoughts!
- You didn't do it, did you?
- No.
- Why not?
- He looks at me with such trust.
- How do I Iook atyou?
- With bitterness.
It used to be trust.
At least you know my thoughts.
- Did you tell him?
- What do you think?
What do we do now?
- I guess I get an ultimatum.
- Is there any sense in this?
- In what?
- In you and me.
- That's up to you.
- No, it's up to you.
I don't see any point in it.
I wish I were wrong.
I don't feel anything anymore.
Neither do I.
The reason I didn't say anything to Sandy I knew he wouldn't believe me.
And I'd go into details.
I knew he'd come running to you, you'd tell him it was all true, and then you'd go to bed with him.
That sounds like what would happen.
- So?
- So?
Jonathan...
- I'll always be your friend.
- Jesus, Susan, I hope not.
It's going to be buggy.
It's the tropics, the jungle.
- Just cover yourself.
- I'll get eaten alive.
You've never camped out.
Isn't he being silly, Jonathan?
- You're a real city boy.
- How about the cot?
- We've got a sleeping bag.
- Are we sleeping on the ground?
- This knapsack's heavy.
- Why did you pack a pillowcase?
- Put it back.
- lsn't he a nut, Jonathan?
- Let me pack my things.
- I'm just trying to help...
- Jesus...
- Do you want her?
- I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
- Look at the pair on her.
- That schmuck's trying to keep up.
- They're always with those guys.
- He must be 60.
- He might have a heart attack.
You could save his life.
Get her number and fuck her.
You bastard...
- How's Susan?
- Couldn't be better.
I always said it:
You found yourself a jewel.
- Not bad, that one.
- You get more than your share.
- I'd marry if I found the right girl.
- Bullshit.
You and your actresses...
You got the deal, Doctor.
What can I say?
"Take your clothes off, I wanna check your capital gains."
- I just look.
- Sure you do.
Susan is plenty enough woman for one man.
Look at that.
- That's Sally Joyce.
- I saw her on TV.
I fucked her once.
We used to do her taxes.
- She's with another firm now.
- Why not say hello?
She wouldn't remember me.
She's a real ball-buster.
I've been through the mill with her kind.
You think a girl goes for you, but it's your money or your balls...
Andyour balls.
Women today are better hung than the men.
- I should have your problems.
- It used to be easier to get laid.
I don't fuck more than a dozen new girls a year now.
I may be too much of a perfectionist.
This last one came so close.
Good tits.
Not great.
Almost no ass at all, and that bothered me.
Sensational legs.
I'd settle for the legs, if she had two more inches here and three here.
- That took two years out of my life.
- You don't want a family?
Who needs it?
- Fucking can't be your life's work.
- Don't tell me what I can't do.
You're so well-off?
Susan's a very good homemaker.
Very efficient.
I come home, everything is in its place.
I like that.
It's tiring, a full day at the office, then the hospital for a few hours.
So it's nice when everything's in its place.
Martini, dinner, the kids.
We don't watch much TV.
We read aloud to each other.
We used to have more friends.
On weekends we might entertain a little, or go to see a friend.
Come into town, see a play or a good film.
It's not glamorous or anything.
There are other things than glamor.
- You have a long lifeline.
- I like that.
The way you run your nail across my...
- You're difficult to get along with.
- Me?
Bobbie...
- You always know your own mind.
- Right this minute, anyway.
You won't stop until you get what you want.
Let me see your hand.
- Well?
- You are built.
- Do you see that in my hand?
- Even your hand is built.
- You're a dirty old man.
- I'm a dirty young man.
- How old are you?
- What do you think?
19... 20?
- 21?
22...
- No.
- 24.
- You skipped 23.
- 23?
- No.
24?
25?
- 26?
27?
- You're getting warm.
28?
29.
I like going out with older women.
Are you married?
You don't want to get married?
I'd marry you in a minute.
Can you cook?
- Spaghetti.
- I can cook spaghetti.
- Good, you do the cooking.
- What'll you do?
- What would you like me to do?
- What would you like to do?
- I asked you first.
- I'm not gonna answer.
- Well...
I can sew.
- Not much of a marriage.
- Me cooking, you sewing.
- Wanna divorce?
I'll take every cent.
I didn't know I was marrying a gold-digger.
- You won't take pity on me?
- Only if you say you're sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- And you'll never do it again.
- And you'll always be a good boy.
- Yes, Mama.
- Do you like to be mothered?
- I like to be smothered by you.
What else would you like me to do to you?
Well, how do you like it?
- How do I like what?
- My... you know.
- What do I know?
- You know everything.
- I know you.
- And I know you.
Well, I almost came that time.
- Nurse?
- What is it, Mr. Weisenborn?
- Come in here a minute, please.
- Certainly.
Why, Mr. Weisenborn!
Most guys I know are pricks.
I don't know what they want.
I'll tell you.
They want the boodle.
But they ain't gonna get the boodle.
Because this kid here has got it.
You're pretty sure of yourself.
- You're a nice man.
- And you're a very lucky girl.
- You know something, Sam?
- What is it, sweetheart?
Would it be a mistake if we shacked up?
It's very difficult, Bobbie.
These last weeks we got on so well.
The idea...
I like you very much.
So much that this idea...
To be perfectly honest, it sounds very good to me.
Let's give it a couple of days to think about it.
It sounds like... very good.
Very, very...
Good.
Only, our eyes should be open.
We should know exactly what we're getting into.
I'm not asking you for marriage.
- As long as we both understand that.
- We do.
It's better to get it all out on the table, so later there can be no misunderstanding.
Many business deals have come to grief...
Okay...
You're a real prick, you know that?
Prick?
I could get serious about this girl.
She's a lot of fun to be with.
Just between the two of us, for the last year, I've been having...
A little trouble.
I wasn't worried, but still...
A little trouble with... myself.
... Getting hard.
It took a long time.
Girls today judge you very quickly.
So I had a real rough time a couple of times.
Some very nasty innuendos.
As I say, I wasn't too worried...
I won't lie to you, I was worried.
Then along comes Bobbie.
One look at the pair on her and I never doubted that I'd be okay again.
And I was.
With all our kidding, I don't mind telling you I had tears in my eyes.
She's really the one in the airline commercial?
You lucky son of a bitch.
I don't want to get in over my head.
I did that already.
And you have to be a real bastard.
I don't like being put in that position.
- What would you do?
- If she looks like she does on TV...
- Size 38, with a D cup.
- Looks aren't everything.
Believe me, looks are everything.
Maybe.
- I'm hungry.
- I'll get up.
- Why do we always eat so late?
- Because I work late.
- Why do you work at all?
- Brings in extra money.
- I make enough.
- You want me to quit?
I thought you were bored with it.
So quit.
- What would I do?
- What do other women do?
Have children.
Well, you asked me.
- What about my beer?
- We're all out.
- I really wanted a beer.
- Should I run to the corner?
- You're too tired.
- I don't mind.
- I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.
It's my fault.
I should have reminded you when I called.
I'm sorry.
You're more tired now than when you were working.
I'm in the house all day.
Did you get up at all?
What do you do?
When you're not on the phone?
- I'm not on the phone that much.
- It took 45 minutes to get through.
- I'll get the beer.
- I'll go.
- I thought you were too tired.
- I haven't been out all day.
Fresh air will do you good.
- Will you walk with me?
- Then I may as well go myself.
You wanna make love?
We haven't in a week.
Is it a week?
It's funny.
Susan and I do all the right things.
We undress in front of each other, spend 15 minutes on foreplay.
We do it in different rooms.
It's a seven-room house.
We do it when we feel like it.
We don't feel we always need to be passionate.
Necking can be more fun.
We're considerate of each other.
I had a tendency to be selfish.
But I don't do that now.
We try to be patient, and we are.
Gentle with each other.
Maybe it's not meant to be enjoyable with women you love.
Do you want to get laid?
Please.
Very nice.
I almost had it.
Right, Cindy?
- See that, Cindy?
- He was lucky.
- Bastard, that was out.
- Bullshit.
- We'll do it over, all right?
- All right.
Deuce!
You see that shot, Cindy?
Now we got some tennis.
- Game!
Luck, my ass!
- You want to take me on, Cindy?
- It's my turn.
- Come on, Bobbie, you're so awful.
You serve.
Very nice.
You play well.
Look, Sandy!
Terrific, Cindy.
She's racking me up, I'm not kidding.
Look at this. 40-love.
And I'm not taking it easy.
You and Lord Taylor's have to work out a trial separation.
The water was running.
What did you say?
You and Lord Taylor's have to work out a trial separation.
Look at the date.
Five months ago.
I'm sorry I cost you so much money.
I want to get married.
Are you tired of me, Jonathan?
The answer is yes.
You said, "Am I ever." I need more in life than this.
After a long bed hunt, you finally chose me.
Cindy's not a virgin either!
Is that what brought this on?
You must have a low opinion of me to think I'd do that to Sandy.
No, you wouldn't cheat on Sandy.
He spends half his life here.
You just had me screwing Cindy.
Am I screwing Sandy now?
I'm going too fast?
Your mind works like an ibm.
First Cindy, then Sandy.
How about Cindy and Sandy?
When I heard about your checkered past, I felt like a celibate.
- You made me tell.
- Sure, I twisted your arm.
- It got you hot!
- Something has to.
- You have such contempt for me.
- You worked hard for it.
It's yours.
- The way you paw me at parties.
- Now affection is contempt.
Everything upside down.
Feeling me up in public is not affection.
I know I'm doing a terrible job, but you're not helping me.
- I help you.
- I can do without your kind of help.
Can you really?
You'll do anything to ruin my day.
I got up today feeling so good.
You couldn't leave us alone.
We were doing so well.
It was great what we had.
It can't have a natural time span?
Affairs can't dissolve in a good way?
- I really don't see why.
- Do you want it over?
Why must it be one or the other?
I want you here where you belong!
- What about you?
- When I'm here, I'm here.
Or there.
No.
I'm a man-eater and a ball-buster...
I want to get married.
Where the fuck is my shoehorn?
This place is a mess!
You look like you fell out of bed!
You're in bed longer than a baby!
I sleep all day because I can't stand my life...
Now I'll fall in love with you all over again.
- Marry me, Jonathan.
Please.
- You're trying to kill me.
- Marriage isn't death.
- Why now?
Two years ago I slept 8 hours, a year ago it was 12.
- Soon it'll be 24.
- Are you trying to scare me?
- I need a life!
- Get a job!
- I want you.
- I'm taken, by me!
Go out!
- Do something useful!
- You wouldn't let me work.
You throw a tantrum if I'm out when you call.
I'm out there in the jungle eight hours a day!
- You even tell me who to vote for.
- You want a job?
I got it!
Fix up this pigsty!
You get a pretty good salary for testing this bed.
You want $50 extra?
Try vacuuming!
An extra 100?
Make this bed!
Open some windows!
It smells like a coffin in here!
You don't need me.
Why do you take this kind of abuse?
Walk out.
Please leave me.
- I'd almost marry you if you'd leave.
- Abuse?
I'm used to worse.
With all your carrying on, to me you're a gift.
So what's it gonna be?
- You sure know how to ruin things.
- Where does that leave us?
Is this an ultimatum?
Is this an ultimatum?
Answer me, you ball-busting bitch!
If it is, I'm gonna tell you what you can do with your ultimatum!
You can make this goddamned bed!
That's what you can do...
Clean these filthy sheets..!
- She's not ready.
- We're a little early.
- You're looking good, Cindy.
- Will Bobbie be long?
No...
- Do we have to go to this party?
- How about it, Cindy?
Where's the powder room?
I'm going, you do what you want.
Man, she's really something.
- I'm bored out of my mind.
- With that?
You must be kidding.
Do you have to go to this party?
- Stick around.
- No, it's better that I go.
I just did my hair.
I've got this at home.
How's your tennis game, Jonathan?
- We'll have to have a rematch.
- Any time.
Is she always that way?
Boy, is she competitive.
She is.
I find that attractive.
You know her problem?
She wants balls.
- She's all right.
- It's no criticism.
- I wish she were more feminine.
- She is a little masculine.
- She always demands her way.
- She's got a great body.
I have to give her everything she wants.
I wouldn't mind giving her something.
You got Bobbie.
I should have it that good.
I've never seen a body like Bobbie's.
She could do with more of what Cindy's got.
She's so passive.
I wouldn't mind Cindy lying still.
Her instructions in bed are like a drill.
I wouldn't mind a little of that.
If she remembers who's boss.
You wouldn't want to swap?
- Are you serious?
- It might liven things up.
- She can miss one party.
- What about Bobbie?
She's so mad at me she'll jump on you just for revenge.
- Seriously?
- She's in the bedroom.
If you're quiet, you can do it and she won't even know.
Give me a minute.
Tell Sandy it's time to leave.
I hope you dance better than you play tennis.
- Sandy won't mind.
- What's he got to do with it?
You're his girl.
He said it would be okay.
- What did Sandy say?
- That you and me... you know.
- And you had nothing to do with it?
- A little.
- A little or a lot?
- This much.
I'm surprised it took you this long.
- Sandy and I have to go to a party.
- Sandy's busy.
You can come around, alone, that's one thing.
I've been expecting that.
But you tell Sandy that if he lays one hand on that tub of lard, not to come home.
So you call me.
Jesus!
She's semi-comatose.
Send a resuscitation unit and an airway.
Be ready to give her an iv.
We'll put her in intensive care.
Bastard.
Very slick.
Very clever!
Well, it's not going to work, Bobbie!

A JONATHAN FUERST production
BALLBUSTERS ON PARADE!
That's Bonnie, my first love.
She lived upstairs from us.
We exposed ourselves to each other at ten.
My mother caught us.
She washed my mouth out with soap.
I never got the connection.
Here's Emily, my first steady.
I never laid a hand on her.
Mildred I think this one's name was.
She followed me around at school.
The fellas kidded me about her.
I told her to stop or I'd beat her up.
She dropped her drawers and shoved her ass at me.
So I got my first sight of ass at 12.
Marcia, 13,5.
I kissed her at a spin-the-bottle party.
This was Rosalie.
She looked just like Elizabeth Taylor.
I had a crush on her and I never went near her.
In those days, we had illusions.
Here's Charlotte.
Not much on looks, but great tits for 15.
That's Lenny Hartman's sister.
My first French kiss, 16 years old.
Here's Gloria, the best-built girl in school.
I took her to the zoo and copped a cheap feel.
Here's Gwen.
I tried for a year to get her to put out, but she was saving me for marriage.
Every guy at Evander got into her pants except me.
Here's my first...
No, that's not it.
Here's Eileen, my very first fuck.
She was a modern dancer.
Great body, but a waste.
Frigid.
Here's Nancy.
Sweet kid.
She went into biology.
Very frigid.
Here's Bobbie!
My wife.
The fastest tits in the West.
And king of the ball-busters.
Conned me into marriage.
Now she's killing me with alimony.
How did this one get in here?
This is my little girl, Wendy.
"Princess," I call her.
Isn't she a dreamboat?
Here's a real cunt.
I forget her name.
A Nazi.
I banged her in Berlin.
This I went with for a few months.
Banged her on a yacht race.
This slob I went with a year.
I got sick of her and couldn't get it up.
Can't remember her name.
This was my Jap in the sack.
I heard Oriental girls were different.
Not in America, they're not.
Here's a 16-year-old I gave $20 to one night when I was drunk.
Maybe you know her, Jennifer.
She gave me a dose.
That's all, folks.
What are you crying for?
It's not a Lassie movie.
Sorry about that.
- So, what else is new?
- I don't see anybody anymore.
- Neither do we.
- You've got each other.
- I thought she was your daughter.
- She's older than I in many ways.
She knows worlds I can't even begin to touch yet.
- I found out who I am.
- You're in big trouble.
Same old Jonathan.
Let me talk to her about you.
Talk to her about me?
I'm forty, she's nine.
- You just don't get it.
- I've been getting it a long time.
What's the point?
You found a good piece of ass.
God bless you.
You're my friend, I'm happy for you, for as long as it lasts.
You deserve to be happy.
I mean it.
Why fight?
All those games.
You don't need them, Jonathan.
I've played more games than anyone.
The obedient son, bright student, the cocksman's game.
The good husband and father game.
Games don't impress Jennifer.
Just life, just love.
I don't want to argue, so let's just agree to disagree, okay?
Jennifer knows more at 18 than Susan knows to this day.
- You found yourself a real jewel.
- She's my love teacher.
- Finally got it up, huh?
- You give off such bad vibrations.
I love you, but you're a schmuck.
You were always young, open.
Maybe schmuckiness is what you need to stay young and open.
Don't listen to me.
You're doing great and I'm making money.
You can find what I found.
Don't make me insult you.
Women...
All ball-busters, right?
When you think of what he has to dip into, any guy with a conscience has a right to turn soft.
- Am I right, Louise?
- You're always right, lover.
I don't think we're going to have any trouble tonight.
- Are you sure?
- Want to bet?
- How much?
- The sky's the limit.
Goddammit!
- You're doing it all wrong.
- I'm doing it like always.
You never said that before.
"The sky's the limit."
- Never.
- What do I say?
You forgot, didn't you?
I say a hundred.
- Okay.
- It just came out.
I just want it right.
I don't think we're going to have any trouble tonight.
- Are you sure?
- Wanna bet?
- How much?
- A hundred.
- You sound pretty sure.
- With your kind, why shouldn't I be?
What kind of man am I?
A real man.
A kind man.
- I'm not kind.
- I don't mean weak, like many men.
I mean the kindness that comes from an inner power so strong that every act is more proof of that power.
Women resent that.
That's why they try to cut you down.
Because your knowledge is so true that it exposes the lies which every scheming one of them lives by.
It takes a true woman to understand the purest form of love:
To love a man who denies himself to her.
A man who inspires worship.
Because he has no need for any woman.
Because he has himself.
And who is better, more beautiful, more powerful, more perfect...
You're getting hard...
More masculine, extraordinary.
More robust...
It's rising.
More virile, domineering.
More irresistible...
It's up, in the air.

If you had a choice, -
- Yeah ?
- would you rather love a girl, or have her love you?
- I want it mutual.
- I mean if you couldn't it mutual.
Would I rather be the one who loves, or is loved?
It's not that easy a question.
I think I'd rather be in love.
Me, too.
I wouldn't want to get hurt, though.
- You were in love with Gloria.
- I was starting to be in love with her.
Then she let me feel her up on the first date.
Turned me right off.
- You kept going with her.
- Well, she let me feel her up.
- What about Gwen?
- Her I could talk to.
- I've never been able to talk to any girl.
- I was really getting crazy about her.
But she's stuck up.
She wouldn't let me lay a hand on her.
- So I went back to Gloria.
- You want perfection.
- What do you want, wise guy?
- She just has to be nice.
That's all.
- You'd not want her beautiful?
- She doesn't have to be beautiful.
- I'd like her built, though.
- I want mine sexy looking.
- I wouldn't want her look like a tramp.
- Sexy doesn't mean she has to look like a tramp.
- There's a middle ground, you know?
- I would want that.
Tall, very tall...
That would scare me.
She should be very understanding.
Start the same sentences together.
- I'd like that.
- Big tits...
- Yeah, but still a virgin.
- I don't care about that.
I wouldn't mind if she was a little ahead of me, with those big tits.
And knew hundreds of different ways.
I want more of a companion.
The other stuff I can get on the outside.
The first time I do it, I want it beautiful.
I don't want to waste it on some beast.
I feel the same way about getting laid as I feel about going to college.
I'm being pressured into it.
- You like that?
- Yeah.
I'd give her to you.
- What's wrong?
I'm a generous guy.
Yeah, I'm grateful.
How do I break the news to her?
You go over there.
There's a way to talk to girls, you know?
Tell her a joke.
Tell her about your unhappy childhood.
- That's not bad.
- But don't make it like an act.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, schmuck.
If you don't, I will.
You can't even stand up.
- I fucked up.
- My turn.
- She's mine, you gave her to me.
- You struck out.
I get two more times at bat.
- This is the first time I've been at a college mixer.
- Me too, I hate them.
- It's so phony way of meeting people.
- Everybody puts on an act.
- So even if you meet somebody you don't know who you meet.
- Because you're meeting the act.
- I'm not sure I agree.
- I don't either.
- You don't agree with what you said?
- How do you feel about it?
People like to think they put on an act, but it's really them.
- They think they can change it.
- They're kidding themselves?
- It is an act, but the act is them.
- Then how can it be an act?
- Because they're an act.
- They're also real.
So I'm not real?
- I'm an act?
- It's all right, so am an act too.
Don't you behave differently with different people?
- With your family?
- I thought you meant different people.
- Sure, with my family...
- And with friends, you're another way.
And with your teachers, still another way.
So which one is you?
- Well, if you put it that way.
- You ought to be a lawyer.
- I'm gonna be a lawyer.
A lady lawyer.
You're from Smith, right?
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.
Do you like Amherst?
Sure.
My parents worked very hard to send me.
I'd better like it.
Do you have a name?
- Susan.
- I'm Sandy.
I think you can make out with her.
She's stuff.
- You think so?
- I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
- Shouldn't I try somebody else?
- Who?
She was the best-looking girl at the whole mixer.
I'll say that for her.
Wasn't she?
- Her tits were too small.
- Yeah.
The hell with her.
- But her legs were great.
- You thing so?
I was standing too close I couln't tell.
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
- She's got funny ideas.
- I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
- Don't rush me.
- What's the matter?
I like you very much.
It's our third date.
You let me kiss you last week.
If I could kiss you once last week, I should be able to kiss you twice tonight.
- You're the only boy I can talk to.
- I can't see you being quiet.
If somebody doesn't approve of what you are...
- Whatever that is.
- You just don't tell him.
I mean, if I like a boy and I want him to keep liking me, and I'm brighter than him, -
- I can't show it or I'll lose him.
- I don't want anyone overly bright.
- You wouldn't feel threatened.
Not nearly as much as some people.
I want to write novels.
Later, when I have something to say.
Does that threaten you?
No.
Maybe a little.
Don't press so hard.
It's better when it's gentle.
See?
What are you grinning at?
- Did you feel her up yet?
- I don't want to ruin things.
Was I right about kissing her?
- You won?
- I don't know.
- You let yourself be pushed around.
- You're pushing me around.
I guess I won, she kissed me five times.
That's when you should've put your hand on her tit.
- I should do that to her?
- She's not doing you a favor.
When a girl lets you kiss her, and feel her up...
Go all the way and all the rest of it...
Isn't it a favor?
What's in it for her?
She's not getting paid or anything.
Fuck you.
Okay, I'll feel her up.
Please take your hand off my breast.
- Why?
- 'Cause I want you to.
- It can't be fun if you know I don't want it.
- I didn't say it was fun.
- Then why is your hand where it is?
- Because the way we're going, I should be feeling you up.
I don't feel that way about you, Sandy.
I feel that way about you.
Don't you want me to feel something for you, too?
I do like you, but I like you for other reasons.
If we went any further, there wouldn't be those reasons anymore.
- We might have something else.
- What?
Something else.
You're the first girl I've ever done that to, Susan.
- I didn't know that.
- It doesn't show?
It's something we both have to go through.
Susan, are you a virgin?
What do I do with my other hand?
What are you gonna do with your hands?
Then she told me to take my hand off her breast.
I said I didn't want to.
She said how could it be fun for me if she didn't like it?
I said I thought she liked me.
She said, "for other reasons."
I told her I really needed this.
That it was my first time.
- What did you say exactly?
- I don't remember exactly.
That she was the first girl I ever tried to feel up.
Was that a mistake?
Then she got nicer to me.
- She put my hand on her breast.
- You mean she left it on.
- She picked it up and put it on.
- She took your hand?
- And put it on like this?
- Yes.
I didn't know what to think.
Suddenly she gets pretty aggressive.
Then I asked if she was a virgin.
- You're kiddning?
- Was that a mistake?
- Anyhow, she is.
- She says.
So you got one or two hands on her tits?
- She put the other hand on the other.
- Two hands?
I said, "What are you gonna do with your hands?"
- Then what?
- She unzipped my fly.
- Bullshit artist!
Then what?
- Then she did it.
Did what?
Bullshit artist!
She really did that to you?
Is this Susan?
Well, you don't know me.
I'm a friend of Sandy's, his roommate.
Yeah, Jonathan.
He told you about me?
I'm here at Smith just for tonight, practically on campus.
I was just taking a drive and I found myself practically on campus.
Do you like Smith?
- Where did you go to high school?
- What do you do in the summer?
You always answer a question with a question?
You always date your best friend's girl?
- Sandy told me you were beautiful.
- He told me you were sexy.
- I guess he's just a poor judge.
- I guess he meant you had personality.
- You have a special quality.
I like girls who are special.
- I'm hardly that special.
Most girls I talk to it's like we're spies from foreign countries, speaking in code.
Everything means something else.
I say, "How about a walk?" And it means something else.
"No, I've got a French test tomorrow." And it means something else.
And you say, "I'll help you study." And it means something else.
You're very sharp, I like that.
-And that means something else.
- You're too sharp.
- Does that bother you?
- It interests me.
- We'd be good together.
- I'm dating your best friend.
- He won't mind.
I won't tell him.
- What if I mind?
- Want to go out Friday?
- I'm seeing Sandy.
- Saturday?
- I have a date.
- Sunday?
- I'm seeing my folks.
- Where do they live?
- Newton.
- Sunday night?
- I'll be too tired.
I'll help you get over your folks.
- What are you so afraid of?
- Not you.
I think I'm in love.
- Bullshit artist.
- I really think so.
- Did you get in yet?
- What's that got to do with it?
How do you know if you don't know how you are in bed together?
She tells me thoughts I didn't even know I had until she tells them to me.
- I can talk to her.
- You can talk to me too.
You're in love with me?
I can say things to her I wouldn't dare say to you.
- Things you'd laugh at.
- I'm laughing now.
She thinks I'm sensitive.
Sensitive?
Oh, boy!
- Do you to her talk about?
Flowers?
- Books.
- I read more books than you do.
- Well, I'm gonna start.
- I'm reading "The Fountainhead."
- What's that?
Her favorite book.
Ever hear of "Jean Christophe"?
It's a classic, you moron.
I'll read it right after "The Fountainhead."
Ever read "Guadalcanal Diary" by Richard Tregaskis?
I read it.
Ever read "Gentleman's Agreement"?
Or "A Bell For Adano"?
- I'm gonna read everything from now on.
- I read more than you do.
So who's the one who's sensitive?
You or me?
Come on, who's sensitive?
- I've had a very messed-up childhood.
- What does your father do?
- He fails.
It's not funny.
- I'm sorry.
Were you very poor?
My father couldn't hold on to a job.
He kept giving me advice.
The more he failed, the more advice I got.
He's a communist, my father.
We're republicans.
Sometimes I think I'm a communist.
Me, too.
We have so much, and other people have so little.
After I get set up as a lawyer, I really want to go into politics.
Public service.
What really gets me is I was too young to fight in the war.
Because what was all about except to prove if everybody pitches in, plain people have a chance.
So although I'm the first in my family to get an education, -
- I don't ever want to forget where I came from.
- You're more serious than I thought.
- I know.
I'm another person with her.
The things that come out of my mouth...
- Boy!
Is she built?
- She has... a quality.
She doesn't talk much, but the things she says are sharp.
We should double-date some time.
I want to know her better before we double-date.
Isn't it great?
A month ago, neither of us even knew a girl.
- What's her name?
- Myrtle.
Bullshit artist!
You're not kidding me?
You really did it!
- Next it's my turn.
- I don't think she'll do it.
- Sandy, find somebody else.
- Are you crazy?
I'm on the verge.
I'll see her tomorrow night.
Sandy?
Do you ever talk to her about me?
Sometimes.
Do me a favor.
Don't tell her I got laid.
Please, Susan.
Sometimes I want to do it and a second later I don't want to do it.
- Let's do it.
I don't know why you put up with me.
- I don't think I can do it.
- It really hurts, Susan.
- Let me.
- Not anymore.
Susan, let's do it.
I love you.
Do you have anything?
How long have you had that?
- Not a year or anything?
- I'm sure it's okay.
- I won't take any chances.
- These things have to be okay.
It's okay.
I'm positive it's okay.
- You think you're the first time in history who ever get laid.
- I'm the first time in my history who ever get laid.
You don't hear me crowing about it.
There's such a thing as good taste.
After you started scoring, what did I get out of you?
"We did it standing, sitting, in the car, under the car.
Myrtle, Myrtle, Myrtle!"
Maybe you forget that I knew Susan before you knew Myrtle and who scored first?
You!
That didn't make me feel very good.
It made me very jealous.
But I didn't try to shut you up.
- I'm your friend, I sat through it.
- Okay, you made your point.
Sometimes I think I'm a better friend to you than you are to me.
Didn't you ever do that?
Of course, I knew what "misled" meant.
But when I saw it, I thought it was "myzeled"!
I kept wondering what it meant.
Anybody ever heard of "Round John Virgin"?
- Little John!
- What did you say?
- Round John Virgin.
- Round yon virgin mother and child.
All right:
Gunshee.
G-u-n-s-h-y.
Susan, do the one about the bear.
The hymn we used to sing in church about the bear with crossed eyes?
Whose name was Gladly.
Don't you know it?
Gladly the cross I'd bear.
Oh, Gladly the cross-eyed bear!
Pronounce this:
C-h-o-p-h-o-u-s-e.
Chophus...
Chop house.
- This has to stop.
- I don't know how to tell him.
- You don't have any trouble telling him a lot of other things.
- What does that mean?
The way you talk to him I don't ever hear you talking to me that way.
- What way?
- I don't know.
- I don't want to hurt him.
- You're hurting me.
- He loves me.
- That's no reason to go to bed with him.
You would have just gone on if he hadn't told me, wouldn't you?
- I would never have known.
- I don't know.
Maybe.
- Boy, you're really something.
- I don't feel like something.
I feel like nothing.
How much longer do you expect me to take this?
- I'm trying to tell him.
- I see how you're trying.
It's not my fault.
I don't enjoy these fights.
You're supposed to be in love with me.
I'm gonna tell him.
What?
No, Jonathan!
- Try understanding me for once.
- You're stronger.
- You tell him everything else, you can tell him about us.
- What do you mean I tell him everyting.
Who says so?
He tells me, he's my best friend.
Are you going to tell him?
He's so helpless.
Susan, I love you.
Why can't you be more with me like you are with Sandy?
She says she's no good for me.
Maybe she's trying to let you down easy.
Go ahead and laugh.
It adds up.
Go ahead and laugh.
You don't know every mood of mine like you know his.
How come?
You don't tell me thoughts I never knew I had.
- You can do it with me.
- I can't.
You can do it with him, you can do it with me.
- I can't with you.
- This has gone far enough.
- I can't stand any more ultimatums.
- This is my last one now tonight you tell him about us..
...
Or tomorrow I tell him.
Look at me!
Now tell me my goddamn thoughts!
- You didn't do it, did you?
- No.
- Why not?
- He looks at me with such trust.
- How do I look at you?
- With bitterness.
It used to be trust.
At least you know my thoughts.
- Did you tell him?
- What do you think?
What do we do now?
- I guess I get an ultimatum.
- Do you think there's any sense in this?
- In what?
- In you and me.
- That's up to you.
- No, it's up to you.
I don't see any point in it.
I wish I were wrong.
I don't feel anything anymore.
Neither do I.
The reason I didn't say anything to Sandy I knew he wouldn't believe me.
And I'd go into details.
I knew he'd come running to you, you'd tell him it was all true, and then you'd go to bed with him.
Yeah, that sounds like what would happen.
- So?
- So?
Jonathan...
- I'll always be your friend.
- Jesus, Susan, I hope not.
It's going to be buggy.
It's the tropics, the jungle.
- Just can cover yourself from head to toe.
- I'll get eaten alive.
You've never camped out.
Isn't he being silly, Jonathan?
- You're a real city boy.
- How about the cot?
- We've got a sleeping bag.
- You're really serious about sleeping on the ground?
- Christ, this knapsack's heavy.
- I told you you overpacked.
What you plan to do with a pillowcase?
- Put it back.
- Isn't he a nut, Jonathan?
- You pack your things.
Let me pack mine.
- I'm just trying to help...
- Jesus...
- Do you want her?
- I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
- Look at the pair on her.
- Look at that schmuck's trying to keep up with her.
- They're always with guys like that.
- That guy must be 60.
- Maybe he will have a heart attack.
You could save his life.
Get her number and fuck her.
You bastard...
- How's Susan?
- Couldn't be better.
I always said it and I say it now:
You found yourself a jewel.
- Not bad, that one.
- You get more than your share.
- I'd marry if I found the right girl.
- Bullshit artist.
You and your actress friends...
Are you kidding, Doctor.
You're the one that's got the deal.
What can I say?
"Take your clothes off, I wanna check your capital gains."
- I just look.
- Sure you do.
Susan is plenty enough woman for one man.
Hey, look at that.
- That's Sally Joyce.
- I saw her on TV.
I fucked her once.
- Bullshit artist.
- We used to do her taxes.
- She's with another firm now.
- Why not say hello?
She wouldn't remember me.
She's a real ball-buster.
I've been through the mill with her kind.
You think a girl goes for you, you'll find out she's after your money or your balls...
Or your money and your balls.
Women today are better hung than the men.
- I should have your problems.
- It is not as easy getting laid as it used to be.
I don't think I fuck more than a dozen new girls a year now.
I may be too much of a perfectionist.
This last one came so close to being the one I want.
Good pair of tits on her.
Not a great pair.
Almost no ass at all, and that bothered me.
Sensational legs.
I would have settled for the legs, if she had two more inches here and three more here.
- Anyhow, that took two years out of my life.
- You don't want a family?
I don't want to put it down but who needs it?
- You can't make fucking your life's working.
- Don't tell me what I can and can't do.
You so well-off?
Susan's a very good homemaker.
Very efficient.
I come home, everything is in its place.
Which I like.
It's tiring, a full day at the office, then the hospital for a few hours.
So it's nice when everything's in its place.
Martini, dinner, the kids.
We don't watch much TV.
We read aloud to each other.
We used to have more friends.
On weekends we might entertain a little, or go over to see a friend.
Come into town, see a play or a good film.
It's not glamourous or anything.
There are other things than glamour.
- You have a long lifeline.
- I like that.
The way you run your nail across my...
- You're difficult to get along with.
- Me?
Bobbie...
- You always know your own mind.
- Right this minute, anyway.
You won't stop going after what you want until you get it.
Let me see your hand.
- Well?
- You are built.
- Do you see that in my hand?
- Even your hand is built.
- I think you're a dirty old man.
- I'm a dirty young man.
- How old are you?
- What do you think?
19... 20?
- 21?
22...
- No.
- 24.
- You skipped 23.
- 23?
- No.
24?
25?
- 26?
27?
- You're getting warm.
28?
29.
I like going out with older women.
Are you married?
- Are you kidding?
- You don't want to get married?
I'd marry you in a minute.
Can you cook?
- Spaghetti.
- I can cook spaghetti.
- Good, you do the cooking.
- Well, what'll you do?
- What would you like me to do?
- What would you like to do?
- I asked you first.
- well, I'm not gonna answer you first.
- Well...
I can sow.
- Doesnt sound like much of a marriage.
- Me cooking spaghetti and you sowing.
- You want to divorce?
I'll take you for every cent you got.
I didn't know I was marrying a gold-digger.
- You won't take pity on me?
- Only if you say you're sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- And you'll never do it again.
- And you'll always be a good boy.
- Yes, Mama.
- Do you like to be mothered?
- I like to be smothered by you.
What else would you like me to do to you?
Well, how do you like it?
- How do I like what?
- My... you know.
- What do I know?
- You know everything.
- I know you.
- And I know you.
Well, I almost came that time.
- Nurse?
- What is it, Mr. Weisenborn?
- Come in here a minute, please.
- Certainly.
Why, Mr. Weisenborn!
Most guys I know are pricks.
I don't know anymore what they want.
I'd be happy to tell ya.
They want the boodle.
But they ain't gonna get the boodle.
Because this kid here has got the boodle.
You're pretty sure of yourself.
- You're a nice man.
- And you're a very lucky girl.
- You know something, Sam?
- What is it, sweetheart?
Would it be a fatal mistake if we shacked up?
It's very difficult, Bobbie.
These last weeks we get along so well together.
The idea...
I like you very much.
So much that this idea...
To be perfectly honest, I mean, it sounds very good to me.
Let's both give it a couple of days to think about it.
It sounds like...well, very good.
Very, very...
hm, well...
Good.
Only, our eyes should be open.
We should know exactly what we're getting into.
That's just a shack-up, I'm not asking you for hand in marriage.
- Well, as long as we both understand that.
- We do.
I just thought it's better to get it all out on the table, so later there can be no possibility of a misunderstanding.
I don't know how many business deals I have seen come to grief...
Okay...
You're a real prick, you know that?
Prick?
I could very easily get serious about this girl.
She's a lot of fun to be with.
Just between the two of us, for the last year, I've been having...
I don't know.. a little trouble.
I wasn't worried, but still and all...
A little trouble with... myself.
...Getting hard.
It took a long time.
You know how girls are today, they judge you.
They judge you very quickly.
So...
I had a real rough time a couple of times.
Some very nasty innuendos.
As I say, I wasn't too worried...
I won't lie to you, I was a little worried.
Then along comes this Bobbie.
I get one look at the size of the pair on her and I never had a doubt that I'd be anything but okay again.
And I was.
I was.
With all our kidding, back and forth on our first night together.
I don't mind telling you, I had tears in my eyes.
She's really the girl in the airline commercial?
You lucky son of a bitch!
I don't know.
I don't want to get in over my head.
I got in over my head three of four times already.
And you have to be a real bastard.
I don't like being put in that position.
- What would you do?
- If she looks like she does on TV...
- Size 38, with a D cup.
- Looks aren't everything.
Believe me, looks are everything.
Maybe.
- I'm hungry.
- I'll get up.
- Why do we always have to eat so late?
- Because I work late.
- Why do you work at all?
- Brings in extra money.
- I make enough.
- You want me to quit working?
I thought you were bored with it.
- I am.
- So quit.
- What would I do?
- What do other women do?
Have children.
Well, you asked me.
- What about my beer?
- We're all out.
- I really wanted a beer.
- Do you want me to run to the corner?
- You're too tired.
- I don't mind.
- I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.
It's my fault.
I knew I should have reminded you when I called.
I'm sorry.
You're more tired now than when you were working.
I'm in the house all day.
Did you get up at all today ?
What do you do?
When you're not telephoning?
- I'm not on the phone that much.
- It took me 45 minutes to get through this afternoon.
- I'll go get the beer.
- No, I'll go.
- I thought you were too tired.
- I haven't been out all day.
Fresh air will do you good.
- Will you walk with me?
- Then I may as well go myself.
You wanna make love?
We haven't in a week.
Is it a week?
It's funny.
Susan and I do all the right things.
We undress in front of each other, spend 15 minutes on foreplay.
We experiment doing it in different rooms.
It's a seven-room house.
We don't believe in making a ritual out of it.
We do it when we feel like it.
We don't feel we have to be passionate all the time.
Sometimes it's even more fun necking.
We're considerate of each other's feelings I had a tendency... men, I guess, have to be selfish.
But I stopped, I don't do that now.
We try to be patient, and we are patient, gentle with each other.
Maybe it's not meant to be enjoyable with women you love.
Sandy?
Do you want to get laid?
Please.
Very nice.
I almost had it.
Right, Cindy?
- See that, Cindy?
- He was lucky.
- Bastard, that was out.
- Bullshit it was.
- We'll do it over, all right?
- All right.
Fair's fair.
Deuce!
You see that shot, Cindy?
Now we got some tennis.
- Game!
Luck, my ass!
- You want to take me on, Cindy?
- It's my turn.
- Come on, Bobbie, you're so awful.
You serve.
Very nice.
You play well.
Hey, Sandy, you look at this girl?
Terrific, Cindy.
She's racking me up, I'm not kidding.
Bou, will you look at this. 40-love.
And I'm not taking it easy on her either.
You and Lord Taylor's are going to have to work out a trial separation.
I had the water running.
What did you say?
You and Lord Taylor's are going to have to work out a trial separation.
Look at the date.
Five months ago.
I'm sorry I cost you so much money.
I want to get married.
Are you tired of me, Jonathan?
The answer is yes.
- I didn't say yes.
You said, "Am I ever." I need more in life than this.
After a long exhausting bed hunt, you finally chose me.
Cindy's not a virgin either!
Oh, I get it!
Is that what brought this on?
Your mind is unbelievable.
You have to have a low opinion of me thinking I that I would do that to Sandy.
No, you wouldn't want to cheat on Sandy.
He spends half his life here.
Wait a minute, a second ago you had me screwing Cindy.
Who am I screwing now?
Sandy?
- You're going to fast for me.
- I'm going too fast for you ?
Your little mind works like an IBM, like a pinball machine.
First Cindy, oh no not Cindy.
How 'bout Sandy.
How about Cindy and Sandy?
Talk about the pot calling the kettle.
The day I got an earfull of your checkered past, I felt like a celibate.
- You made me tell.
- Sure, I twisted your arm.
- It got you hot!
- Something has to.
- You have such contempt for me.
- Kid, you worked hard for it.
It's yours.
- The way you paw me at parties.
- Now affection is contempt.
Everything upside down.
Feeling me up in public is not affection.
I know I sleep all day, I know I'm doing a terrible job, but you're not helping me any.
- And who helps me?
- I help you.
- Your kind of help I can do without.
Can you really?
You'll do anything you can do to ruin my day.
I got up today feeling so good!
You couldn't leave us alone.
We were doing so well.
At one time it was great what we had.
It can't have a natural time span?
Affairs can't dissolve in a good way?
- I don't see why.
I really don't see why.
- Do you want it over?
Why does it have to be one way or the other?
-You don't want me to leave?
I want you right here where you belong!
- What about you?
- When I'm here, I'm here.
When I'm not here, I'm... there.
No.
I'm a man-eater or a ball-buster and castrater.
I want to get married.
Where the fuck is my shoehorn?
This place is a mess!
There's not any food in the house.
You look like you fell out of bed!
You spend more time in bed than any other human being passed the age of six months.
I sleep all day because I can't stand my life...
- What life?
- Sleeping all day!
Now I'll fall in love with you all over again.
- Marry me, Jonathan.
Please.
- You're trying to kill me.
- Marriage isn't death.
- Why now?
Because two years ago I slept 8 hours, a year ago it was 12.
- Soon it'll be 24.
- Are you trying to scare me?
- I need a life!
- Get a job!
- I don't want a job, I want you.
- I'm taken, by me!
Go out of the house!
- Do something useful, god damn it!
- You wouldn't let me work.
You throw a tantrum every time you call and I'm not home.
I'm out there in the jungle eight hours a day!
- You even let me canvass for Kennedy.
- You want a job?
I got a job for ya!
Fix up this pigsty!
You get a pretty god damn good salary for testing this bed all day.
You want an extra $50 a week?
Try vacuming!
An extra 100?
Make this god damn bed!
Try opening some god damn windows!
That's why you can't stand up in here.
The god damn place smells like a coffin!
You don't need me.
Why do you let yourself in for this kind of abuse?
Walk out.
Please leave me.
- For God's sake, I'd almost marry you if you'd leave me.
- Call that abuse?
You don't what I'm used to.
With all your carrying on, to me you're a gift.
So what's it gonna be?
- You sure know how to screw things up.
- Where does that leave us?
Is this an ultimatum?
Is this an ultimatum?
Answer me, you ball-busting castrating son-of-a-cunt bitch!
If it is, I'm gonna tell you what you can do with your ultimatum!
You can make this goddamned bed!
That's what you can do with it.
Clean these filthy sheets...!
That's what you can do with it.
- She's not ready.
- We're a little early.
- You're looking good, Cindy.
- Will Bobbie be long?
No...
- Do we have to go to this party?
- How about it, Cindy?
Where's the powder room?
- Right there.
I'm going, you do what you want.
Man, she's really something.
- I'm so bored I'm going out of my mind.
- Bored?
With that?
You must be kidding.
Do you have to go to this party?
- Stick around.
- No, it's better that I go.
I just did my hair.
I've got this at home.
How's your tennis game, Jonathan?
- We'll have to have a rematch.
- Any time.
Is she always that way?
Boy, is she competitive.
She is very competative.
I find that attractive.
You know her problem?
She wants balls.
- She's all right.
- It's no criticism.
- I wish she were more feminine.
- She is a little masculine.
- I just wish she didn't always demands her way.
- She's got a great body.
I have to treat her like a child, give her everything she wants.
I wouldn't mind giving her something.
You got Bobbie.
I should have it that good.
Bobbie, are you kidding?
I've never seen a body like Bobbie's.
She could do with a little more of what Cindy's got.
She's so passive.
I wouldn't mind Cindy lying still once.
She so busy handing out instructions in bed it's like a close order drill.
I wouldn't mind a little of that.
As long as she doesn't forget who's boss.
You wouldn't want to swap some time, would you?
- Are you serious?
- What do you say?
It might liven things up a bit.
- She can miss one party.
Leave her to me.
- What about Bobbie?
She's so mad at me she'll jump all over you just for revenge.
- Seriously?
- She's in the bedroom.
If you're quiet, you can do it and she won't even know.
Give me a minute.
Tell Sandy it's time to leave.
I hope you dance better than you play tennis.
- Sandy won't mind.
- What's Sandy got to do with it?
You're his girl.
He said it would be okay.
- What did Sandy say?
- That you and me... you know.
- That was his idea and you had nothing to do with it?
- A little.
- A little or a lot?
- This much.
I'm surprised it took you this long to get around to it.
- Sandy and I have a party to go to.
- Sandy's busy.
You wanna come around some time by yourself, that's one thing.
I've been expecting that.
But you tell Sandy that if he lays one hand on that tub of lard in there, not to come home.
So you call me.
Jesus!
She's semi-comatose.
Better send a resuscitation unit and an airway.
Be ready to give her an IV on admission.
Tell him we'll put her in intensive care.
Bastard.
Very slick.
Very clever!
Well, it's not going to work, Bobbie!
That's Bonnie, my first love.
She lived upstairs from us.
We started exposing ourselves to each other at ten. we caught on the roof one day by my mother.
Who washed out my mouth out with soap.
I never got the connection.
Here's Emily, my first steady until she moved off the block at eleven.
I never laid a hand on her.
Mildred, I think this one's name was.
She followed me around at school.
The fellas kidded me about her.
I warned her if she didn't stop, I'd beat her up.
She picked up her skirt, dropped her drawers and shoved her ass at me.
So I got my first sight of ass at 12.
Marcia, 13½ or thereabouts.
I kissed her one night at a spin-the-bottle party.
This one's Rosalie.
Rosalie looked just like Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet.
I had a crush on Rosalie from 14 to 15 and I never went near her.
In those days, we had illusions.
Here's Charlotte.
Not much on looks, but great tits for 15.
That's Lenny Hartman's sister.
My first French kiss, 16 years old.
Here's Gloria, the best-built girl in school.
I took her to the Bronx' zoo and on the bus copped a cheap feel.
Here's Gwen.
I went with her for a year trying to get her to put out, but she thought I was too nice and was saving me for marriage.
Every guy at Evander must have got into her pants except me.
Here's my first...
No, that one's a mistake.
Here's Eileen, my very first fuck.
She was a modern dancer at Swarthmore.
Great body on her, but a waste.
Frigid.
Here's Nancy.
Sweet kid.
She went into biology.
Very frigid.
Here's Bobbie!
My wife.
The fastest tits in the West.
And king of the ball-busters.
Conned me into marrying her..
..and now she's killing me with alimony.
I don't know how did this one get in here?
This is my little girl, Wendy.
"Princess," I call her.
Isn't she a dreamboat?
Here's a real cunt.
I forget her name.
A Nazi.
I banged her in Berlin.
Here's something I went with for a few months.
First time I banged her on a yacht race to Nassau
This slob I went with for a year, 'till I got so sick of her ballbusting and couldn't get it up anymore
Can't remember her name.
This was my Jap in the sack.
I heard Oriental girls were different.
Not in America, they're not.
Here's a 16-year-old I gave 20 bucks to one night when I was drunk.
Maybe you know her, Jennifer.
She gave me a dose.
That's all, folks.
What are you crying for?
It's not a Lassie movie.
Sorry about that.
- So, what else is new?
- I don't see anybody anymore.
- Neither do we.
- You've got each other.
- I thought she was your daughter when you first came in.
- In a lot of ways she's older than I am.
She knows worlds I can't even begin to touch yet.
- Sandy, please.
- I found out who I am.
- You're in big trouble.
Same old Jonathan.
Let me talk to her about you.
Talk to her about me?
I'm forty, she's nine.
- You just don't get it, do you?
- I get it all right, I've been getting it a long time.
What's the point?
Sandy, you found a good piece of ass.
God bless you.
You're my friend, I'm happy for you, for as long as it lasts.
You deserve to be happy.
I mean it.
Why fight, okay?
All those games, Jesus Christ!
You don't need them, Jonathan.
I know, I've played more games than anyone.
The obedient son, bright student, the cocksman's game.
The respectable husband's game, the good father's game.
Games don't impress Jennifer.
Just life, just love.
Yeah, well I don't want to argue with you, Sandy, so let's just agree to disagree, okay?
Don't make me mad, okay?
Jennifer knows more at 18 than Susan knows to this day.
- You found yourself a real jewel, okay?
- She's my love teacher.
- Finally got it up, huh?
- You give off such bad vibrations.
I love you, but you're a schmuck.
You were always young, Sandy, open.
Maybe schmuckiness is what you need to stay young and open.
Don't listen to me.
You're doing great and I'm making money.
You can find what I found.
Don't make me insult you.
Women...
All ball-busters, right?
- You know it!
When you think of what he has to dip into, any guy with a conscience has a right to turn soft.
- Am I right, Louise?
- You're always right, lover.
I don't think we're going to have any trouble tonight.
- Are you sure?
- Want to bet?
- How much?
- The sky's the limit.
Goddammit!
- You're doing it all wrong.
- I'm doing it like always.
You never said that before.
"The sky's the limit."
- Never.
- What do I say?
You forgot, didn't you?
A hundred, I say a hundred.
- Okay.
- It just came out.
I just want it right, that's all.
I don't think we're going to have any trouble tonight.
- Are you sure?
- Wanna bet?
- How much?
- A hundred.
- You sound pretty sure.
- With your kind of man, why shouldn't I be?
What kind of man am I?
A real man.
A kind man.
- I'm not kind.
- I don't mean weak kind, the way so many men are.
I mean the kindness that comes from an enormous strength, an inner power so strong that every act no matter what is more proof of that power.
That's what women resent.
That's why they try to cut you down.
Because your knowledge of yourself and them is so right, so true that it exposes the lies which every scheming one of them lives by.
It takes a true woman to understand the purest form of love:
To love a man who denies himself to her.
A man who inspires worship.
Because he has no need for any woman.
Because he has himself.
And who is better, more beautiful, more powerful, more perfect...
You're getting hard...
More strong, more masculine, extraordinary.
More robust...
It's rising.
More virile, domineering.
More irresistible...
It's up, in the air.

( whispered conversation )
You like that?
Yeah.
I give her to you.
What's wrong with her?
I'm a generous guy.
Yeah, I'm grateful.
How do I break the news to her?
You go over there.
Yeah?
There's a way to talk to girls, you know?
Tell her a joke.
What joke?
Tell her about your unhappy childhood.
That's not bad.
But don't make it like an act.
No.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, schmuck.
If you don't, I will.
You?
You can't even stand up.
I fucked up.
It's my turn.
What do you mean, it's your turn?
She's mine, you gave her to me.
You struck out.
I get two more times at bat.
This is the first time
I've ever been to a college mixer.
- Me too.
I hate them.
- I hate them too.
It's such a phony way of meeting people.
Everybody puts on an act.
So, even if you meet somebody, you don't know who you're meeting.
'Cause you're meeting the act.
That's right, not the person.
I'm not sure I agree.
- With what?
- With what you said.
No, I don't either.
You don't agree with what you said?
How do you feel about it?
I think people only like to think they're putting on an act, but it's not an act, it's really them.
If they think it's an act, they feel better, because they think they can always change it.
You mean, they're kidding themselves, because it's not really an act.
Yes, it is an act, but they're the act.
The act is them.
But if it's them, then how can it be an act?
- Because they're an act.
- But they're also real.
- No.
- I'm not real?
- No.
- I'm an act.
It's all right, I'm an act too.
Don't you behave differently with different people?
No.
With your family?
I thought you meant different people.
Well, sure, with my family--
And with friends, you're another way.
Well, sure, with my friends.
And with your teachers, you're still another way.
So which one is you?
Well, when you put it that way...
You ought to be a lawyer.
I'm gonna be a lawyer.
A lady lawyer.
Um... you're from Smith, right?
Uh-huh.
Do you like it?
Yeah, I like it all right.
Do you like Amherst?
Sure, why shouldn't I?
My parents worked very hard to send me.
I'd better like it.
Do you have a name or something?
Susan.
I'm Sandy.
I think you can make out with her.
Think so?
She's stuff.
You think so?
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
I shouldn't try somebody else, then?
Who?
( both laughing )
She was the best-looking girl at the whole mixer.
I'll say that for her...
Wasn't she?
Her tits were too small.
Yeah, I was thinking that.
The hell with her.
But her legs were great.
You think so?
Standing so close, I really couldn't tell about her legs.
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
She's got some funny ideas.
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
Don't rush me, please.
What's the matter?
I like you very much, Susan.
It's our third date.
I like you too.
You let me kiss you last week.
And this week.
If I could kiss you once last week,
I should be able to kiss you at least twice tonight.
- Well?
- You're the only boy
I know that I can talk to.
I can't see you being quiet for any guy.
No, not quiet, exactly.
But if you know somebody's not going to approve of what you are...
- Whatever that is.
- Whatever that is.
Well, you just don't tell him.
I mean, if I like a boy and I want him to keep liking me, and I'm brighter than he is,
I have to not show it or I'll lose him, so it's hard.
Well, I wouldn't want anyone overly bright.
Yeah, but you wouldn't feel threatened.
I might be bothered a little.
I don't think you would nearly as much as some people.
Now, for instance, someday I want to write novels.
Not now, but you know, later on, when I have something to say.
Now, that doesn't threaten you, does it?
- No...
- ( bell tolling )
Maybe a little.
Don't press so hard.
See, it's better when it's gentle.
See?
What are you grinning at?
Did you feel her up yet?
Come on, I like this girl.
I don't want to ruin things.
Was I right about kissing her?
Listen, we had a big fight over it.
And you won?
Well, I don't know if I won or not.
Why are you letting yourself be pushed around?
You're the one who's pushing me around!
I guess I won.
Sure, I won.
She kissed me five times.
Now, that's when you should've put your hand on her tit.
Come on, when this girl's nice enough to kiss me,
I should do that to her?
You act as if she's doing you a favor.
Well, it is sort of a favor, isn't it?
I mean, when a girl lets you kiss her and, you know, go on from there.
Feel her up and, you know, the rest of it.
Go all the way and the rest of it.
I mean, isn't it a favor?
What's in it for her?
I mean, if she's not getting paid or anything.
Fuck you.
( laughing )
Okay, okay, I'll feel her up.
Sandy, please take your hand off my breast.
- Why?
- 'Cause I want you to.
How can it be any fun for you if you know I don't want it?
I didn't say it was fun.
Then why is your hand where it is?
Because, the way we're going, by this time,
I should be feeling you up.
I don't feel that way about you, Sandy.
I feel that way about you.
Well, you want me to feel something for you too, don't you?
I thought you liked me.
I do like you, but I like you for other reasons.
So...
So... if we went any further, there wouldn't be those reasons anymore.
Well, we might have something else, though.
What?
Something else.
You're the first girl I've ever done that to, Susan.
( sighs )
I didn't know that.
It doesn't show?
No.
( sighs )
Well, it's something we both have to go through, I guess.
Susan, are you a virgin?
What do I do with my other hand?
What are you gonna do with your hands?
Jonathan:
Andthenwhat?
Sandy:
Shetoldme to take myhandoffher breast.
- What did you do?
- I said I didn't want to.
Then what?
She said how could it be fun for me if she didn't like it?
Oh, Jesus.
- I said I thought she liked me.
- Yeah?
She said, "I like you for other reasons."
Other reasons?
So, I told her how I really needed this.
What did you tell her?
You know, that it was my first time.
Your first time what?
What did you say exactly?
I don't remember exactly.
That she was the first girl I ever tried to feel up.
- You told her that?
- Was it a mistake?
I wouldn't.
Then she got nicer to me.
What do you mean nicer?
She put my hand on her breast.
You mean you put it on, she left it there.
No, she picked it up and put it on.
She took your hand like this?
And put it on like this?
That's right.
So, I didn't know what to think.
You didn't, huh?
For just wanting to be friends, she's suddenly getting pretty aggressive.
Yeah, then what?
I asked her if she was a virgin.
- You're kidding.
- Was that a mistake?
Anyhow, she is.
She says.
So now you got, what, one hand or two hands on her tits?
By this time, she's put the other hand on the other one.
She put both hands on?
Two hands?
So I said, "What are you gonna do with your hands?"
You didn't say that.
It just came out.
Yeah, then what?
Let me see if I got this.
She unzipped my fly.
Bullshit artist!
Then what?
Then what?
Then she did it.
Did what?
Bullshit artist!
She really did that to you?
- She did that?
- Yeah.
( both laughing )
Hello, is this Susan?
Well, you don't know me.
I'm a friend of Sandy's.
His roommate.
Yeah, Jonathan.
He told you about me?
Yeah, so, I'm just here at Smith for tonight, practically on campus.
I was just taking a drive, you know, and I found myself practically on campus.
How do you like Smith?
What's your major?
Where did you go to high school?
What do you do in the summer?
Do you always answer a question with a question?
Do you always date your best friend's girlfriends?
Sandy told me you were beautiful.
He told me you were sexy.
I guess he's just a poor judge.
I guess he meant you had personality.
Good grief.
You have a special quality.
I like girls who are special.
I'm hardly that special.
Some people you can tell about right away.
Most girls I talk to it's like we're spies from foreign countries and we're speaking in code.
Everything means something else.
Like, I say, "Would you like to take a walk?"
And it means something else.
And she says, "I can't.
I've got a French test tomorrow."
And it means something else.
And you say, "I'll come over and help you study."
And it means something else.
You're very sharp, I like that.
And that means something else.
You're too sharp.
Does that bother you?
It interests me.
Is that more code?
We'd be good together.
I'm dating your best friend.
He won't mind.
- How do you know?
- I won't tell him.
What if I mind?
You want to go out Friday?
I'm seeing Sandy.
Saturday?
I have a date.
Sunday?
I'm seeing my folks.
Where do they live?
Newton.
Sunday night?
I'llbetootired.
I'll help you get over your folks.
How about it, Susan?
What are you so afraid of?
Not you.
(belltolling)
I think I'm in love.
Mmm...
IthinkI'minlove .
Bullshit artist.
I really think so.
Did you get in yet?
What's that got to do with it?
How do you know if you don't know how you are in bed together?
Well, that's not everything.
It's a lot.
She tells me thoughts I didn't even know I had until she tells them to me.
It's unbelievable.
I can talk to her.
You can talk to me too.
Are you in love with me?
I can say things to her
I wouldn't dare say to you.
What, for instance?
Things you'd laugh at.
I'm laughing now.
( laughing )
She thinks I'm sensitive.
Sensitive?
( laughs )
Sensitive?
Oh, boy!
Whoa-ho!
What do you talk to her about, flowers?
Books.
Books?
You phony,
I read more books than you do.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna start.
I'm reading "The Fountainhead."
"The Fountainhead." What's that?
It's her favorite book.
You ever hear of "Jean-Christophe"?
What's that?
It's a classic, you moron.
Gonna read it after "The Fountainhead."
Yeah, you ever read "Guadalcanal Diary"
- by Richard Tregaskis?
- No.
That was a best seller and I read it.
Ever read "Gentleman's Agreement"
by Laura Z. Hobson?
You ever read "A Bell For Adano" by John Hersey?
I'm gonna read everything from now on.
I read more than you do.
So who's the one who's sensitive?
You or me?
Come on, who's sensitive?
I've had a very messed-up childhood.
What does your father do?
He fails.
- ( chuckles )
- It's not funny.
I'm sorry.
Were you very poor?
My father couldn't hold on to a job.
He kept giving me advice.
The more he failed, the more advice I got.
He's a Communist, my father.
We're Republicans.
Sometimes I think I'm a Communist, though.
Me, too.
We have so much, and other people have, you know, so little.
After I get set up as a lawyer, what I'd really like to do is go into politics, public service.
What really gets me is I was too young to fight in the war, because what was that all about except to prove that if everybody pitches in, the plain people have a chance.
So, even though I'm the first in my family to get an education,
I don't ever want to forget where I came from.
You're a lot more serious than I thought.
I know.
Sandy:
Where did you meet her?
Jonathan:
I'm another person with her.
You wouldn't recognize me.
The things that come out of my mouth.
Boy, she really sounds like something.
Is she built?
She's, uh...
she's got a quality.
She doesn't talk much, but the things she says are so sharp.
We should double-date sometime.
Well...
I want to know her a little better, you know, before we double-date.
Gee, isn't it great?
A month ago, neither of us even knew a girl.
What'shername?
Myrtle.
( Susan gasping )
( moaning )
Bullshit artist!
( whooping )
You're kidding!
You're not kidding me?
You really did it!
You bastard!
You beat me to it!
What's up?
( laughing )
Next is my turn.
I don't think she'll do it, Sandy.
She will.
I've just been taking it easy on her.
Sandy, believe me, find somebody else.
Are you crazy, when I'm right on the verge?
I'll see her tomorrow night.
Uh, Sandy?
Yeah.
Do you ever talk to her about me?
Yeah, sure, sometimes.
Do me a favor, will you?
What?
Don't tell her I got laid.
Please, Susan.
Sometimes I want to do it, and a second later, I don't want to do it.
Let's do it.
I don't know why you put up with me.
I don't think I can do it.
It really hurts, Susan.
Let me--
Not anymore.
Please, Sandy.
Not anymore.
Susan, let's do it.
I love you.
Do you have anything?
How long have you had that?
- Not too long.
- ( bell tolling )
Not a year or anything?
I'm sure it's okay.
I don't wanna take any chances.
These things have to be okay.
It's okay.
I'm positive it's okay.
Jonathan:
It's as if you're the first guy in history who ever got laid.
Sandy:
I'm the first guy in my history who ever got laid.
I like it too, but you don't hear me crowing about it.
There's such a thing as good taste, you know?
- What's the matter with you?
- Jeez!
After you started scoring, what did I get out of you?
"We did it standing, sitting, in the car, under the car.
Myrtle, Myrtle, Myrtle..."
Maybe you forget, but I knew Susan before you knew Myrtle, and who scored first?
You.
That didn't make me feel very good, you know?
In fact, it made me feel very jealous.
But did I try to shut you up?
Did I say, "I'm tired of hearing about it already"?
I didn't say it, 'cause I'm your friend, so I sat through it.
Okay, okay.
You made your point.
Sometimes I think I'm a better friend to you than you are to me.
(musicplaying)
( laughing )
Sandy:
Didn'tyou everdothat?
Ofcourse,I...
Iknewwhatthe word "misled"meant.
Ijust didn'tknow... ( laughing )
So,whenIfirst sawitin print,

Hehadbeen "myzeled."
Ikeptwondering, whatdoesthis wordmean?"Myzeled"?
Jonathan:
Sexy.
Let's"myzle."
Hasanybodyeverheard of" RoundJohnVirgin"?
Oneoftheguys in" RobinHood."
That's Little John!
Whatdidyousay ?
RoundJohn...?
RoundJohnVirgin.
Isthat inFalstaff?
"Round John Virgin mother and child."
RoundJohnVirgin mother...?
¶ Holy infant so tender and mild ¶
Allright, gunshee.
Gunshee?
G-u-n-s-h-y, gunshee.
Gun-shy...
Ialwaysthought itwasgunshee.
Susan,dotheone aboutthebear.
You'lllove this,John.
Oh, yeah, the hymn we used to sing in church about the bear with crossed eyes?
Whose name was Gladly.
Gladlythebear?
Don't you know it?
Gladly the cross-eyed bear.
Gladlythecross-eyed bear,getit ?
Gladlythecross...
oh,Gladlythe cross-eyedbear!
(laughing)
Allright, pronouncethis:
c-h-o-p-h-o-u-s-e.
Chophuse...
Chophus...?
( laughing )
Chophouse.
( laughing )
This has to stop.
I don't know how to tell him.
You don't have any trouble telling him a lot of other things.
- What does that mean?
- The way you talk to him.
I don't ever hear you talking to me that way.
What way?
I don't know.
He's very vulnerable.
I don't want to hurt him.
You're hurting me.
He loves me.
That's no reason to go to bed with him.
You would have just gone on, wouldn't you, if he hadn't told me?
I don't know.
I would have never known a thing about it.
I don't know, maybe.
Boy, you're really something.
I don't feel like something.
I feel like nothing.
How much longer do you expect me to take this?
I'm trying to tell him.
I see how you're trying.
It's not my fault.
I don't enjoy these fights.
Listen, it's me you're supposed to be in love with.
- I'm gonna tell him.
- What?
- I'm gonna tell him about you and me.
- No, Jonathan!
Why don't you give me some of the understanding that you give to him?
You're stronger.
You tell him everything else.
You can tell him about us.
What do you mean, I tell him everything?
Who says so?
He tells me, he's my best friend.
Are you going to tell him?
He's so helpless.
Susan, I love you.
Why can't you be more with me like you are with Sandy?
( chuckling ) She says she's no good for me.
Maybe she's trying to let you down easy.
( laughing )
Go ahead and laugh.
It adds up.
( laughing )
Go ahead and laugh.
You know every mood of mine like you know every mood of his.
- No.
- How come?
- I don't know.
- You don't tell me thoughts I never knew I had.
- Does he say I do that?
- Yes.
- Then I guess I must.
- You do it all right, so do it with me.
I can't.
You can do it with him, you can do it with me.
Now tell me my thoughts.
- I can't.
- Why can't you?
I can't with you.
This has gone far enough.
I cannot stand any more ultimatums.
This is my last one.
Now, tonight, you tell him about us, or tomorrow, I tell him.
Look at me, Susan!
Now tell me my goddamn thoughts!
Hello.
You didn't do it, did you?
No.
Whynot?
He looks at me with such trust.
HowdoI lookatyou?
With bitterness.
Itusedto be trust.
Atleast youknowmy thoughts.
Did you tell him?
Whatdoyouthink?
No.
So,what dowedo now?
( clears throat ) I don't know.
I guess I get an ultimatum.
Doyouthinkthere's anysensein this?
In what?
Inyouandme.
That's up to you.
No,it'sup to you.
Idon'tsee anypointin it .
Iwish Iwerewrong.
I don't feel anything anymore.
Neither do I.
The reason I didn't say anything to Sandy...
I knew he wouldn't believe me.
And I'd go into details so he would have to believe me.
And I knew he'd come running to you, and I knew you'd tell him everything I said was true, and I knew then you'd go to bed with him.
Yeah, that sounds like what would happen.
( sighs ) So?
So?
Jonathan...
I'll always be your friend.
Jesus, Susan, I hope not.
Sandy:
It'sgoingto be buggy.
Susan:
It's not goingtobe buggy.
It'sthetropics.
Whatdoyoumean?
It'sthejungle.
Youcan't coveryourself fromheadto toe.
I'llget eatenalive.
You don't know what it's like.
You've never camped out before.
Isn't he being silly, Jonathan?
- I am not.
- Are too.
- Am not.
- Are too.
You're a real city boy.
Howaboutthecot ?
Comeon,sweetie, we'vegotasleepingbag.

We'regoing ina littlecar... (musicplaying)
Jesus...
You want her?
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
Will you look at the pair on her?
Get a look at that schmuck trying to keep up with her.
They're always with guys like that.
That guy must be 60 if he's a day.
Maybe he'll have a heart attack.
You could save his life.
Get her number and fuck her.
( both laugh )
You bastard...
Bastard...
How's Susan?
Couldn't be better.
I always said it, and I say it now.
You found yourself a jewel.
She is a jewel.
Not bad, that one.
Listen, you must be getting more than your share.
I'd get married in a minute if I could find the right girl.
Bullshit artist.
You and your actress friends.
Are you kidding, Doctor?
You're the one that's got the deal.
I mean, what can I say?
"Take your clothes off, baby,
I wanna check your capital gains."
I just look.
( coughs ) Sure, you do.
I really do.
Susan's plenty enough woman for one man.
Hey, look at that.
Jonathan:
That'sSallyJoyce.
Didn'tI seeher onEdSullivan?
I fucked her once.
Bullshit artist.
We used to do her taxes.
She's with another firm now.
Why don't you say hello?
She wouldn't remember me.
She's a real ball-buster, that one.
I've been through the mill with her kind.
Yeah?
You think a girl goes for you, and you find out she's after your money or your balls... or your money and your balls.
Women today are better hung than the men.
I should have your problems.
It's not as easy getting laid as it used to be.
I don't think I fuck more than a dozen new girls a year now.
Maybe I'm too much of a perfectionist.
This last one came so close to being what I wanted.
Good pair of tits on her--
Not a great pair.
Almost no ass at all, and that bothered me.
Sensational legs.
I would have settled for the legs, if she had just two more inches here and three more here.
Anyhow... that took two years out of my life.
You don't want a family?
Idon'twant toputit down, butwhoneedsit?
You can't make fucking your life's work.
Don't tell me what I can and can't do.
You're so well-off?
(musicplaying)
Susan's a very good homemaker.
Very efficient.
I come home, everything is in its place... which I like, because it's tiring putting in a full day at the office, then Doctors' Hospital for a couple of hours.
So it's nice to have everything in its place when I get home.
A martini, dinner, the kids.
We don't watch much television.
We like to read aloud to each other.
We used to have more friends than we do, but we don't have that many anymore.
So, on weekends we might entertain a little or go over to see a friend.
Come into town, see a play or a good film.
It's not glamorous or anything.
There are other things besides glamour.
(musicplaying)
You have a long lifeline.
Ilikethat.
The way you run your nail across my...
You're difficult to get along with.
Me?
- Mm-hmm.
- Bobbie...
You always know your own mind.
Right this minute, anyway.
You won't stop going after what you want until you get it.
Let me see your hand.
Ahh... mmm...
Well?
You are built.
You see that in my hand?
Even your hand is built.
I think you're a dirty old man.
I'm a dirty young man.
How old are you?
How old do you think I am?
19.
( laughing ) No... 20?
No.
21?
22?
No.
24?
You skipped 23.
23?
No.
( both laughing ) 24?
No.
25?
26?
No.
27?
You're getting warm.
28?
No.
29?
I like going out with older women.
Are you married?
Are you kidding?
You don't want to get married?
I'd marry you in a minute.
Can you cook?
Spaghetti.
I can cook spaghetti.
Good, you do the cooking.
What will you do?
What would you like me to do?
What would you like to do?
I asked you first.
Well, I'm not gonna answer you first.
Well...
I can sew.
Doesn't sound like much of a marriage.
Me cooking spaghetti, and you sewing.
You want a divorce?
I'll take you for every cent you got.
I didn't know I was marrying a gold digger.
Mm-hmm...
You won't take pity on me?
Only if you say you're sorry.
I'm sorry.
And you'll never do it again.
I'll never do it again.
And you'll always be a good boy.
Yes, Mama.
You like to be mothered?
I'd like to be smothered by you.
What else would you like me to do to you?
Well...
How do you like it?
How do I like what?
My, uh... you know.
What do I know?
You know everything.
I know you.
And I know you.
Mmm...

Why, Mr. Weisenborn!
Bobbie:
Most guys I know are pricks.
( sighing ) I don't know anymore what they want.
Jonathan:
I'll be happy to tell you.
They want...
( slapping ) the boodle.
But they ain't gonna get the boodle.
Goddamn right.
Because this kid here has got the boodle.
You're pretty sure of yourself, aren't you?
Mmm...
( sighing ) You're a nice man.
And you're a very lucky girl.
( chuckling )
(showerrunning)
(Jonathanhumming)
You know something, Sam?
(Jonathanimitating HumphreyBogart) Whatisit ,sweetheart?
You think it would be a fatal mistake in our lives if we shacked up?
It's very difficult, Bobbie.
These last couple of weeks, we get along so well together.
The idea...
I like you very much.
So much... this idea... to be perfectly honest,
I mean, it sounds very good to me.
Let's both give it a couple of days to think about it.
It sounds, like... well, very good.
Very, very, uh... well... good.
Only, our eyes should be open.
If we should go into this, we should know exactly what we're getting into.
It's just a shack-up.
I'm not asking for your hand in marriage.
Yeah, well, as long as we both understand that.
We do.
I just thought it's better to get it all out on the table,
( coughs ) so later, there can be no possibility of a misunderstanding.
I don't know how many business deals I've seen come to grief--
Okay...
Okay.
You're a real prick, you know that?
Prick?
I could very easily get serious about this girl.
She's a lot of fun to be with.
This is just between the two of us, but for the last year or so,
I've been having...
I don't know, a little trouble.
I wasn't worried, but still and all... a little trouble with... well, myself.
You know... getting hard.
It took a long time, and you know how girls are today, they judge you.
They judge you very quickly.
So, uh...
I had a real rough time a couple of times.
Some very nasty innuendos.
And, as I say,
I wasn't too worried, but...
I won't lie to you,
I was a little worried.
Then along comes this Bobbie.
I get one look at the size of the pair on her and I never had a doubt I'd ever be anything but okay again, and I was, I was.
With all our kidding, back and forth on our first night together,
I don't mind telling you I had tears in my eyes.
She's really the girl in the airline commercial?
Youlucky sonofabitch.
I don't know.
I don't want to get in over my head.
I got in over my head three, four times already, and you have to be a real bastard.
I don't like being put in that position.
What would you do?
If she looks anything like she looks on television...
Size 38, with a D cup.
But looks aren't everything.
Believe me, looks are everything.
Maybe.
I'm hungry.
I'll get up.
Why do we always have to eat so late?
Because I work late, dumb-o.
Why do you work at all?
Brings in extra money.
I make enough.
You want me to quit working?
I thought you were bored with it.
I am.
So quit.
What'll I do?
What do other women do?
Have children.
Well, you asked me.

What about my beer?
We're all out.
I really wanted a beer.
Do you want me to run out to the corner?
You're too tired.
I'm tired, but I don't mind.
I'll get it.
No, I'll get it.
It's my fault.
I knew I should have reminded you when I called this afternoon.
I'm sorry, honey.
You're more tired now than when you were working.
I'm in the house all day.
Did you get up at all today?
What do you do?
I mean, when you're not telephoning?
I'm not on the phone that much.
It took me 45 minutes to get through this afternoon.
I'll go get the beer.
No, I'll go.
I thought you were too tired.
I haven't been out all day.
Fresh air will do you good.

Then I may as well go myself.

Wanna make love?
We haven't in a week.
Is it a week?
It's funny.
Susan and I do all the right things.
We undress in front of each other.
We spend 15 minutes on foreplay.
We experiment, do it in different rooms.
It's a seven-room house.
We don't believe in making a ritual of it.
We do it when we feel like it.
We don't feel we have to be passionate all the time.
Sometimes it's even more fun necking.
We're considerate of each other's feelings.
I had a tendency-- men, I guess, have-- to be selfish.
But I stopped.
I don't do that now.
We try to be patient, and we are patient, gentle with each other.
( sighs )
Maybe it's just not meant to be enjoyable with women you love.
Sandy... do you want to get laid?
( sighs )
Please.
Sandy:
Very nice.
Jonathan:

Indeed.

I had the water running.
What did you say?
You and Lord Taylor's are going to have to work out a trial separation.
Look at the date.
What do you mean?
Five months ago.
( sighs )
I'm sorry I cost you so much money.
(telephoneringing)
(ringingcontinues)
I want to get married.
(doorslams)
Are you tired of me, Jonathan?
AmI ever.
- The answer is yes.
- I didn't say yes.
You said, "Am I ever."
I need more in life than this.
Who put you up to this?
Your psychiatrist?
Aftera long, exhaustivebedhunt, youfinallychoseme.
Cindy's not a virgin either!
What?
Oh, I get it.
Is that what brought this on?
Your mind is unbelievable.
You have to have a low opinion of me thinking that I would do that to Sandy.
Oh, no, you wouldn't want to cheat on Sandy.
Oh, now it's Sandy.
Well, he spends half his life over here.
Wait a minute.
A second ago you had me screwing Cindy.
Who am I screwing now, Sandy?
You're going too fast for me.
I'm going too fast for you?
Your little mind operates like an IBM, like a pinball machine.
First Cindy.
Oh, no, not Cindy?
How about Sandy?
How about Cindy and Sandy?
Talk about the pot calling the kettle.
The day I got an earful of your checkered past, I felt like a celibate.
You made me tell you.
Sure,I twisted yourarm.
It got you hot!
Something has to.
You have such contempt for me.
Kid,youworked hardforit .
It'syours.
The way you paw me at parties.
Now affection is contempt.
Upside down.
Everything upside down.
Feelingmeup inpublicis notaffection.
Will you come on?
I know I sleep all day.
I know I'm doing a terrible job, but you're not helping me any.
And who helps me?
I help you.
Your kind of help I can do without.
Can you?
Can you really?
Ahh!
You'll do anything you can to ruin my day, won't you?
I got up today feeling so good.
You couldn't leave us alone.
- We were doing so well.
- What?
At one time-- at one time, it was great what we had.
The kidding around.
It can't have a natural time span?
Affairs can't dissolve in a good way.
There's always got to be poison.
I don't see why.
I really don't see why!
Jonathan, do you want it over between us?
Why does it have to be one way or the other?
You don't want me to leave?
Iwantyourighthere whereyoubelong!
And what about you?
When I'm here, I'm here.
When I'm not here, I'm there.
- Where?
- Wherever?
No.
I'm a man-eater or a ball-buster and a castrator.
I want to get married.
All right, where the fuck is my shoehorn?
This place is a mess!
There's not any food in the house!
Half the time, you look like you fell out of bed!
You spend more time in bed than any other human being past the age of six months than I ever heard of!
The reason I sleep all day is because I can't stand my life!
Whatlife?
!
Sleeping all day!
( sobbing )
You say that sort of thing,
I fall in love with you all over again.
Marry me, Jonathan.
Please, marry me.
You're trying to kill me.
Marriage isn't death.
Why now?
Because two years ago, I slept eight hours.
A year ago, it was 12.
It's up to 15 now.
Pretty soon, it's gonna be 24.
What are you trying to do, scare me?
- I need a life!
- Get a job!
I don't want a job.
I want you.
I'm taken, by me!
Get out of the house!
Do something useful, God damn it!
You wouldn't let me work when I wanted to.
That was a year ago.
You throw a tantrum every time you call and I'm not home.
Look, sister, I'm out there in the jungle eight hours a day!
You wouldn't even let me canvass for Kennedy.
You want a job?
I got a job for you!
Fix up this pigsty!
You get a pretty goddamn good salary for testing out this bed all day!
You want an extra $50 a week?
Try vacuuming!
You want an extra 100?
Make this goddamn bed!
Try opening some goddamn windows!
That's why you can't stand up in here!
The goddamn place smells like a coffin!
Oh...
Bobbie.
You don't need me.
Why do you let yourself in for this kind of abuse?
Walk out.
Leave me.
Please leave me.
God's sake, I'd almost marry you if you'd leave me.
You call that abuse?
You don't know what I'm used to.
With all your carrying on, to me you're a gift.
So what's it gonna be?
You sure know how to screw things up.
So where does that leave us?
Are you giving me an ultimatum?
Is this an ultimatum?
Answer me, you ball-busting, castrating, son-of-a-cunt bitch!
Is this an ultimatum or not?
!
Because if it is, I'm gonna tell you what you can do with your ultimatum!
I'm gonna tell you what you can do with it!
You can make this goddamn bed!
That's what you can do with it!
Goddamn clean these filthy sheets!
That's what you can do with it!
(doorbuzzersounding)
She's not ready.
We're a little early.
You're looking good, Cindy.
I do my best.
Will Bobbie be long?
Uh, no.
Hey, uh... do we have to go to this party?
How about it, Cindy?
Where's the powder room?
Uh, right there.
I'm going.
You do what you want.
Man, she's really something.
I'm so bored, I'm going out of my mind.
Bored?
With that?
You must be kidding.
You have to go to this party?
Stick around.
- No, it's better that I go.
- ( door opens, closes )
Hey, I just did my hair.
I've got this at home.
How's your tennis game, Jonathan?
We'll have to have a rematch.
Anytime.
(musicplaying)
Is she always that way?
You know women.
Boy, is she competitive.
She is very competitive, but I find that attractive.
You know her problem?
She wants balls.
She's all right.
I'm not criticizing.
I wish she were more feminine.
She is a little masculine.
I just wish she wouldn't always demand her own way.
She's got a great body on her.
I have to treat her like a child, give her everything she wants.
I wouldn't mind giving her something.
You got Bobbie.
I should only have it that good.
Ohh...
Bobbie.
Bobbie, are you kidding?
I've never seen a body like that.
She could do with a little more of what Cindy's got.
She's so goddamn passive.
Yeah, I wouldn't mind Cindy just lying still once.
She's so busy handing out instructions in bed.
It's like close-order drill.
Yeah, I wouldn't mind a little of that, as long as she doesn't forget who's boss.
Hey, uh... you wouldn't want to swap sometime, would you?
Are you serious?
What do you say?
Might liven things up a bit.
( both laughing )
She can miss one party.
Leave her to me.
What about Bobbie?
She's so mad at me, she'll jump all over you just for revenge.
Hey, you like that, huh?
Seriously?
She's in the bedroom.
If you're quiet, you can do it and she won't even know.
- ( both laughing )
- You bastard.
Give me a minute.
(musicplaying)
Tell Sandy it's time to leave.
I hope you dance better than you play tennis.
Sandy won't mind.
What's Sandy got to do with it?
You're his girl.
He said it would be okay.
(musicstops)
What did Sandy say?
( sighing ) That you and me, uh... you know.
That was his idea.
You had nothing to do with it?
A little.
Alittle ora lot?
This much.
I'm surprised it took you this long to get around to it.
Sandy and I have a party to go to.
Sandy's busy.
You wanna come around sometime by yourself, that's one thing.
I've been expecting that.
But you tell Sandy that if he lays one hand on that tub of lard in there, not to come home.
So you call me.
Jesus!
Sandy:
She'ssemicomatose.
Bettersendaresuscitation unitandan airway.
Bereadyto giveher anIVon admission.

What are you crying for?
It's not a Lassie movie.
Sorry about that.
Or something.
So, what else is new?
To tell you the truth,
I don't see anybody anymore.
Neither do we.
Well, you've got each other.
I thought she was your daughter when you first came in.
In a lot of ways, she's older than I am.
Yeah.
She knows worlds I can't even begin to touch yet.
Sandy, please.
I found out who I am.
You're in big trouble.
Same old Jonathan.
Indubitably.
Let me talk to her about you, John.
Talk to her about me?
I'm 40, she's nine.
You just don't get it, do you?
Oh, I get it, all right.
I've been getting it for a long time.
What's the point?
Sandy, you found a good piece of ass.
God bless you.
You're my friend, I'm happy for you.
As long as it lasts, I'm happy for you.
You deserve to be happy.
I mean it.
Why fight?
Okay?
All those games.
Jesus Christ!
You don't need those games, Jonathan.
I know.
I've played more games than anyone.
The obedient son game.
The bright student game.
- The cocksman's game.
- Some cocksman.
The respectable husband game.
The good father game.
- The specialist game.
- Good father?
Games don't impress Jennifer.
Just life, just love.
Yeah, well, I don't want to argue with you, Sandy.
So let's just agree to disagree, okay?
Don't make me mad, okay?
Jennifer knows more at 18 than Susan knows to this day.
You found yourself a real jewel, okay?
She's my love teacher.
Finally got it up, huh?
You give off such bad vibrations.
Bad vibrations?
Sandy, I love you, but you're a schmuck.
You were always young, Sandy, open.
You were schmucky a lot of the time, but maybe schmuckiness is what you need to stay young and open.
Listen...
don't listen to me.
You're doing great, and I'm making money.
You can find what I found, Jonathan.
Don't make me insult you.
Women...
All ball-busters, right?
You know it.
When you think of some of the things he has to dip into, any guy with a conscience has a right to turn soft.
Am I right, Louise?
You're always right, lover.
I don't think we're going to have any trouble tonight.
- You don't?
- No, I don't.
Are you sure?
You wanna bet?
How much?
The sky's the limit.
God damn it!
What did I do?
You're doing it all wrong.
I'm doing it like always.
You never said that before.
- Said what?
- "Sky's the limit."
Sure, I...
Never.
What do I say?
You forgot, didn't you?
A hundred.
I say a hundred.
Okay.
It just came out.
I just want it right, that's all.
I don't think we're going to have any trouble tonight.
- You don't?
- No, I don't.
Are you sure?
You wanna bet?
How much?
A hundred?
You sound pretty sure.
You're a kind of man... why shouldn't I be sure?
What kind of man am I?
A real man.
A kind man.
I'm not kind.
I don't mean weak kind, the way so many men are.
I mean the kindness that comes from an enormous strength, from an inner power so strong that every act, nomatterwhat, ismoreproof ofthatpower.
That'swhat allwomenresent.

If you had a choice, would you rather love a girl, or have her love you?
- I want it mutual.
- If you couldn't have that.
Would I rather be the one who loves, or is loved?
It's not an easy question.
I think I'd rather be in love.
Me, too.
I wouldn't want to get hurt, though.
- You were in love with Gloria.
- I was starting to be.
Then she let me feel her up on the first date.
Turned me right off.
- You kept going with her.
- Well, she let me feel her up.
- What about Gwen?
- Her I could talk to.
- I never could talk to any girl.
- I was getting crazy about her.
But she wouldn't let me lay a hand on her.
- So I went back to Gloria.
- You want perfection.
- What do you want?
- She just has to be nice.
- Not beautiful?
- She doesn't have to be.
- I'd like her built, though.
- I want mine sexy.
- She shouldn't look like a tramp.
- Sexy doesn't mean like a tramp.
- There's a middle ground.
- I would want that.
Tall, very tall...
That would scare me.
She should be very understanding.
Start the same sentences together.
- I'd like that.
- Big tits...
- Yeah, but still a virgin.
- I don't care about that.
I wouldn't mind if she was a little ahead of me, with those big tits.
And knew hundreds of different ways.
I want a companion.
The other stuff I can get on the outside.
The first time I do it, I don't want to waste it on some beast.
I feel about getting laid the same way I feel about college.
I'm being pressured into it.
- You like that?
- Yeah.
I give her to you.
I'm a generous guy.
I'm grateful.
How do I break the news to her?
Go over there.
There's a way to talk to girls.
Tell her ajoke.
Tell her about your unhappy childhood.
- That's not bad.
- But don't make it like an act.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, schmuck.
If you don't, I will.
You can't even stand up.
- I fucked up.
- My turn.
- She's mine, you gave her to me.
- You struck out.
I get two more times at bat.
- This is my first college mixer.
- I hate them.
- It's so phony.
- Everybody puts on an act.
- You don't know who you meet.
- Because you're meeting the act.
- I'm not sure I agree.
- I don't either.
- You don't agree with yourself?
- How do you feel about it?
People like to think they put on an act, but it's really them.
- They think they can change it.
- They're kidding themselves?
- It is an act, but the act is them.
- Then how can it be an act?
- Because they're an act.
- They're also real.
So I'm not real?
- I'm an act?
- It's all right, so am I.
Don't you behave differently with different people?
- With your family?
- I thought you meant people.
- Sure, with my family...
- And with friends, another way.
And with your teachers, still another way.
So which one is you?
- You ought to be a lawyer.
- I'm gonna be a lawyer.
A lady lawyer.
You're from Smith, right?
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.
Do you like Amherst?
Sure.
My parents worked very hard to send me.
I'd better like it.
Do you have a name?
- Susan.
- I'm Sandy.
I think you can make out with her.
She's stuff.
- You think so?
- I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
- Shouldn't I try somebody else?
- Who?
She was the best-looking girl at the mixer.
Wasn't she?
- Her tits were too small.
- Yeah.
The hell with her.
- But her legs were great.
- I was standing too close.
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
- She's got funny ideas.
- I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
- Don't rush me.
- What is it?
I like you very much.
It's our third date.
You let me kiss you last week.
If I could kiss you once last week, I should kiss you twice tonight.
- You're the only boy I can talk to.
- I can't see you being quiet.
If somebody doesn't approve of what you are...
- Whatever that is.
- You just don't tell him.
If I want a boy to like me, and I'm brighter than him, -
- I can't show it or I'll lose him.
- I don't want anyone overly bright.
- You wouldn't feel threatened.
Not nearly as much as some people.
I want to write novels.
Later, when I have something to say.
Does that threaten you?
No.
Maybe a little.
Don't press so hard.
It's better when it's gentle.
See?
What are you grinning at?
- Did you feel her up yet?
- I don't want to ruin things.
Was I right about kissing her?
- You won?
- I don't know.
- You let yourself be pushed around.
- You're pushing me around.
I guess I won, she kissed me five times.
That's when you should've put your hand on her tit.
- I should do that to her?
- She's not doing you a favor.
When a girl lets you kiss her, and feel her up...
Go all the way and all the rest of it...
Isn't it a favor?
What's in it for her?
She's not getting paid.
Fuck you.
Okay, I'll feel her up.
Please take your hand off my breast.
I want you to.
- It can't be fun if I don't want it.
- I didn't say it was fun.
- Then why is your hand there?
- I should be feeling you up by now.
I don't feel that way about you.
I feel that way about you.
Don't you want me to feel something for you, too?
I do like you, but for other reasons.
If we went any further, there wouldn't be those reasons.
- We might have something else.
- What?
Something else.
You're the first girl I've ever done that to.
- I didn't know that.
- It doesn't show?
It's something we both have to go through.
Susan, are you a virgin?
What do I do with my other hand?
What are you gonna do with your hands?
Then she told me to take my hand off her breast.
I said I didn't want to.
She said how could it be fun for me if she didn't like it?
I said I thought she liked me.
She said, "for other reasons."
I told her I really needed this.
That it was my first time.
- What did you say exactly?
- I don't remember exactly.
That she was the first girl I ever tried to feel up.
Was that a mistake?
Then she got nicer to me.
- She put my hand on her breast.
- You mean she left it on.
- She picked it up and put it on.
- She took your hand?
- And put it on like this?
- Yes.
I didn't know what to think.
Suddenly she gets pretty aggressive.
Then I asked if she was a virgin.
Was that a mistake?
- Anyhow, she is.
- She says.
So you got one or two hands on her tits?
- She put the other hand on the other.
- Two hands?
I said, "What are you gonna do with your hands?"
- Then what?
- She unzipped my fly.
- Bullshit artist!
Then what?
- Then she did it.
Did what?
Bullshit artist!
She really did that to you?
Is this Susan?
I'm a friend of Sandy's.
His roommate.
Yeah, Jonathan.
He told you about me?
I'm here at Smith just for tonight, practically on campus.
I was just taking a drive and I found myself practically on campus.
Do you like Smith?
- Where did you go to high school?
- What do you do in the summer?
You always answer with a question?
You always date your best friend's girl?
- Sandy told me you were beautiful.
- He told me you were sexy.
- I guess he's a poorjudge.
- He meant you had personality.
- You have a special quality.
- I'm hardly that special.
Most girls I talk to it's like we're spies from foreign countries, speaking in code.
Everything means something else.
I say, "How about a walk?" And it means something else.
"No, I've got a French test tomorrow." And it means something else.
And you say, "I'll help you study."
You're sharp, I like that.
You're too sharp.
- Does that bother you?
- It interests me.
- We'd be good together.
- I'm dating your best friend.
- He won't mind.
I won't tell him.
- What if I mind?
- Want to go out Friday?
- I'm seeing Sandy.
- Saturday?
- I have a date.
- Sunday?
- I'm seeing my folks.
- Where do they live?
- Newton.
- Sunday night?
- I'll be too tired.
I'll help you get over your folks.
- What are you so afraid of?
- Not you.
I think I'm in love.
- Bullshit artist.
- I really think so.
- Did you get in yet?
- What's that got to do with it?
How do you know if you don't know how you are in bed together?
She tells me thoughts I didn't even know I had.
- I can talk to her.
- You can talk to me.
I can say things to her I wouldn't dare say to you.
- Things you'd laugh at.
- I'm laughing now.
She thinks I'm sensitive.
Sensitive?
Oh, boy!
- Do you talk about flowers?
- Books.
- I read more books than you do.
- I'm gonna start.
- I'm reading "The Fountainhead."
- What's that?
Her favorite book.
Ever hear of "Jean Christophe"?
It's a classic, you moron.
I'll read it after "The Fountainhead."
Ever read "Guadalcanal Diary" by Richard Tregaskis?
I read it.
Ever read "Gentleman's Agreement"?
Or "A Bell For Adano"?
- I'm gonna read everything.
- I read more than you.
So who's sensitive?
- I've had a messed-up childhood.
- What does your father do?
- He fails.
It's not funny.
- I'm sorry.
Were you very poor?
My father couldn't hold on to ajob.
He kept giving me advice.
The more he failed, the more advice.
He's a Communist.
We're Republicans.
Sometimes I think I'm a Communist.
Me, too.
We have so much, and other people have so little.
After I get set up as a lawyer, I really want to go into politics.
Public service.
It gets me that I was too young to fight in the war.
That was all about proving that, if everybody pitches in, plain people have a chance.
So although I'm the first in my family to get an education, -
- I don't ever want to forget where I came from.
- You're more serious than I thought.
- I know.
I'm another person with her.
The things I say...
- Boy!
Is she built?
- She has... a quality.
She doesn't talk much, but the things she says are sharp.
We should double-date.
I want to know her better before we double-date.
Isn't it great?
A month ago, neither of us even knew a girl.
- What's her name?
- Myrtle.
Bullshit artist!
You're not kidding me?
You really did it!
- Next it's my turn.
- I don't think she'll do it.
- Sandy, find somebody else.
- Are you crazy?
I'm on the verge.
I'll see her tomorrow night.
Sandy?
Do you ever talk to her about me?
Sometimes.
Do me a favor.
Don't tell her I got laid.
Please, Susan.
Sometimes I want to do it, and then I don't.
I don't know why you put up with me.
- I don't think I can do it.
- It really hurts, Susan.
- Let me.
- Not anymore.
Susan, let's do it.
I love you.
Do you have anything?
How long have you had that?
- Not a year or anything?
- I'm sure it's okay.
- I'm not taking any chances.
- These have to be okay.
It's okay.
I'm positive it's okay.
- You're not the first to get laid.
- It's my first time.
I don't crow about it.
There's such a thing as good taste.
After you started scoring, what did I get out of you?
"We did it standing, sitting, in the car, under the car.
Myrtle..."
I knew Susan before you knew Myrtle.
But you scored first.
It made me very jealous.
But I didn't try to shut you up.
- I'm your friend, I sat through it.
- Okay, you made your point.
I'm a better friend to you than you are to me.
Didn't you ever do that?
Of course, I knew what "misled" meant.
But when I saw it, I thought it was "myzeled"!
I kept wondering what it meant.
Anybody ever heard of "Round John Virgin"?
- Little John!
- What did you say?
- Round John Virgin.
- Round yon virgin mother and child.
All right:
Gunshee.
G-u-n-s-h-y.
Susan, do the one about the bear.
The hymn we used to sing about the bear with crossed eyes?
Whose name was Gladly.
Don't you know it?
Gladly the cross I'd bear.
Oh, Gladly the cross-eyed bear!
Pronounce this:
C-h-o-p-h-o-u-s-e.
Chophus...
Chop house.
- This has to stop.
- I don't know how to tell him.
- You tell him a lot of other things.
- What does that mean?
You never talk to me the way you talk to him.
- What way?
- I don't know.
- I don't want to hurt him.
- You're hurting me.
- He loves me.
- That's no reason to sleep with him.
You would have just gone on if he hadn't told me, wouldn't you?
- I would never have known.
- I don't know.
Maybe.
- You're really something.
- I don't feel like something.
I feel like nothing.
How much longer do you expect me to take this?
- I'm trying to tell him.
- I see how you're trying.
It's not my fault.
You're supposed to be in love with me.
I'm gonna tell him.
What?
No, Jonathan!
- Try understanding me for once.
- You're stronger.
- You tell him everything else.
- Who says so?
He tells me, he's my best friend.
Are you going to tell him?
He's so helpless.
Susan, I love you.
Why can't you be more with me like you are with Sandy?
She says she's no good for me.
Maybe she's trying to let you down easy.
Go ahead and laugh.
It adds up.
Go ahead and laugh.
You don't know every mood of mine like you know his.
How come?
You don't tell me thoughts I never knew I had.
- You can do it with me.
- I can't.
You can do it with him, you can do it with me.
- I can't with you.
- This has gone far enough.
- I can't stand any more ultimatums.
- Tell him tonight.
Or tomorrow I tell him.
Look at me!
Now tell me my goddamn thoughts!
- You didn't do it, did you?
- No.
- Why not?
- He looks at me with such trust.
- How do I look at you?
- With bitterness.
It used to be trust.
At least you know my thoughts.
- Did you tell him?
- What do you think?
What do we do now?
- I guess I get an ultimatum.
- Is there any sense in this?
- In what?
- In you and me.
- That's up to you.
- No, it's up to you.
I don't see any point in it.
I wish I were wrong.
I don't feel anything anymore.
Neither do I.
The reason I didn't say anything to Sandy I knew he wouldn't believe me.
And I'd go into details.
I knew he'd come running to you, you'd tell him it was all true, and then you'd go to bed with him.
That sounds like what would happen.
- So?
- So?
Jonathan...
- I'll always be your friend.
- Jesus, Susan, I hope not.
It's going to be buggy.
It's the tropics, the jungle.
- Just cover yourself.
- I'll get eaten alive.
You've never camped out.
Isn't he being silly, Jonathan?
- You're a real city boy.
- How about the cot?
- We've got a sleeping bag.
- Are we sleeping on the ground?
- This knapsack's heavy.
- Why did you pack a pillowcase?
- Put it back.
- Isn't he a nut, Jonathan?
- Let me pack my things.
- I'm just trying to help...
- Jesus...
- Do you want her?
- I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
- Look at the pair on her.
- That schmuck's trying to keep up.
- They're always with those guys.
- He must be 60.
- He might have a heart attack.
You could save his life.
Get her number and fuck her.
You bastard...
- How's Susan?
- Couldn't be better.
I always said it:
You found yourself ajewel.
- Not bad, that one.
- You get more than your share.
- I'd marry if I found the right girl.
- Bullshit.
You and your actresses...
You got the deal, Doctor.
What can I say?
"Take your clothes off, I wanna check your capital gains."
- I just look.
- Sure you do.
Susan is plenty enough woman for one man.
Look at that.
- That's Sally Joyce.
- I saw her on TV.
I fucked her once.
We used to do her taxes.
- She's with another firm now.
- Why not say hello?
She wouldn't remember me.
She's a real ball-buster.
I've been through the mill with her kind.
You think a girl goes for you, but it's your money or your balls...
And your balls.
Women today are better hung than the men.
- I should have your problems.
- It used to be easier to get laid.
I don't fuck more than a dozen new girls a year now.
I may be too much of a perfectionist.
This last one came so close.
Good tits.
Not great.
Almost no ass at all, and that bothered me.
Sensational legs.
I'd settle for the legs, if she had two more inches here and three here.
- That took two years out of my life.
- You don't want a family?
Who needs it?
- Fucking can't be your life's work.
- Don't tell me what I can't do.
You're so well-off?
Susan's a very good homemaker.
Very efficient.
I come home, everything is in its place.
I like that.
It's tiring, a full day at the office, then the hospital for a few hours.
So it's nice when everything's in its place.
Martini, dinner, the kids.
We don't watch much TV.
We read aloud to each other.
We used to have more friends.
On weekends we might entertain a little, or go to see a friend.
Come into town, see a play or a good film.
It's not glamorous or anything.
There are other things than glamor.
- You have a long lifeline.
- I like that.
The way you run your nail across my...
- You're difficult to get along with.
- Me?
Bobbie...
- You always know your own mind.
- Right this minute, anyway.
You won't stop until you get what you want.
Let me see your hand.
- Well?
- You are built.
- Do you see that in my hand?
- Even your hand is built.
- You're a dirty old man.
- I'm a dirty young man.
- How old are you?
- What do you think?
19... 20?
- 21?
22...
- No.
- 24.
- You skipped 23.
- 23?
- No.
24?
25?
- 26?
27?
- You're getting warm.
28?
29.
I like going out with older women.
Are you married?
You don't want to get married?
I'd marry you in a minute.
Can you cook?
- Spaghetti.
- I can cook spaghetti.
- Good, you do the cooking.
- What'll you do?
- What would you like me to do?
- What would you like to do?
- I asked you first.
- I'm not gonna answer.
- Well...
I can sew.
- Not much of a marriage.
- Me cooking, you sewing.
- Wanna divorce?
I'll take every cent.
I didn't know I was marrying a gold-digger.
- You won't take pity on me?
- Only if you say you're sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- And you'll never do it again.
- And you'll always be a good boy.
- Yes, Mama.
- Do you like to be mothered?
- I like to be smothered by you.
What else would you like me to do to you?
Well, how do you like it?
- How do I like what?
- My... you know.
- What do I know?
- You know everything.
- I know you.
- And I know you.
Well, I almost came that time.
- Nurse?
- What is it, Mr. Weisenborn?
- Come in here a minute, please.
- Certainly.
Why, Mr. Weisenborn!
Most guys I know are pricks.
I don't know what they want.
I'll tell you.
They want the boodle.
But they ain't gonna get the boodle.
Because this kid here has got it.
You're pretty sure of yourself.
- You're a nice man.
- And you're a very lucky girl.
- You know something, Sam?
- What is it, sweetheart?
Would it be a mistake if we shacked up?
It's very difficult, Bobbie.
These last weeks we got on so well.
The idea...
I like you very much.
So much that this idea...
To be perfectly honest, it sounds very good to me.
Let's give it a couple of days to think about it.
It sounds like... very good.
Very, very...
Good.
Only, our eyes should be open.
We should know exactly what we're getting into.
I'm not asking you for marriage.
- As long as we both understand that.
- We do.
It's better to get it all out on the table, so later there can be no misunderstanding.
Many business deals have come to grief...
Okay...
You're a real prick, you know that?
Prick?
I could get serious about this girl.
She's a lot of fun to be with.
Just between the two of us, for the last year, I've been having...
A little trouble.
I wasn't worried, but still...
A little trouble with... myself.
...Getting hard.
It took a long time.
Girls today judge you very quickly.
So I had a real rough time a couple of times.
Some very nasty innuendos.
As I say, I wasn't too worried...
I won't lie to you, I was worried.
Then along comes Bobbie.
One look at the pair on her and I never doubted that I'd be okay again.
And I was.
With all our kidding, I don't mind telling you I had tears in my eyes.
She's really the one in the airline commercial?
You lucky son of a bitch.
I don't want to get in over my head.
I did that already.
And you have to be a real bastard.
I don't like being put in that position.
- What would you do?
- If she looks like she does on TV...
- Size 38, with a D cup.
- Looks aren't everything.
Believe me, looks are everything.
Maybe.
- I'm hungry.
- I'll get up.
- Why do we always eat so late?
- Because I work late.
- Why do you work at all?
- Brings in extra money.
- I make enough.
- You want me to quit?
I thought you were bored with it.
So quit.
- What would I do?
- What do other women do?
Have children.
Well, you asked me.
- What about my beer?
- We're all out.
- I really wanted a beer.
- Should I run to the corner?
- You're too tired.
- I don't mind.
- I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.
It's my fault.
I should have reminded you when I called.
I'm sorry.
You're more tired now than when you were working.
I'm in the house all day.
Did you get up at all?
What do you do?
When you're not on the phone?
- I'm not on the phone that much.
- It took 45 minutes to get through.
- I'll get the beer.
- I'll go.
- I thought you were too tired.
- I haven't been out all day.
Fresh air will do you good.
- Will you walk with me?
- Then I may as well go myself.
You wanna make love?
We haven't in a week.
Is it a week?
It's funny.
Susan and I do all the right things.
We undress in front of each other, spend 15 minutes on foreplay.
We do it in different rooms.
It's a seven-room house.
We do it when we feel like it.
We don't feel we always need to be passionate.
Necking can be more fun.
We're considerate of each other.
I had a tendency to be selfish.
But I don't do that now.
We try to be patient, and we are.
Gentle with each other.
Maybe it's not meant to be enjoyable with women you love.
Do you want to get laid?
Please.
Very nice.
I almost had it.
Right, Cindy?
- See that, Cindy?
- He was lucky.
- Bastard, that was out.
- Bullshit.
- We'll do it over, all right?
- All right.
Deuce!
You see that shot, Cindy?
Now we got some tennis.
- Game!
Luck, my ass!
- You want to take me on, Cindy?
- It's my turn.
- Come on, Bobbie, you're so awful.
You serve.
Very nice.
You play well.
Look, Sandy!
Terrific, Cindy.
She's racking me up, I'm not kidding.
Look at this. 40-love.
And I'm not taking it easy.
You and Lord Taylor's have to work out a trial separation.
The water was running.
What did you say?
You and Lord Taylor's have to work out a trial separation.
Look at the date.
Five months ago.
I'm sorry I cost you so much money.
I want to get married.
Are you tired of me, Jonathan?
The answer is yes.
You said, "Am I ever." I need more in life than this.
After a long bed hunt, you finally chose me.
Cindy's not a virgin either!
Is that what brought this on?
You must have a low opinion of me to think I'd do that to Sandy.
No, you wouldn't cheat on Sandy.
He spends half his life here.
You just had me screwing Cindy.
Am I screwing Sandy now?
I'm going too fast?
Your mind works like an IBM.
First Cindy, then Sandy.
How about Cindy and Sandy?
When I heard about your checkered past, I felt like a celibate.
- You made me tell.
- Sure, I twisted your arm.
- It got you hot!
- Something has to.
- You have such contempt for me.
- You worked hard for it.
It's yours.
- The way you paw me at parties.
- Now affection is contempt.
Everything upside down.
Feeling me up in public is not affection.
I know I'm doing a terrible job, but you're not helping me.
- I help you.
- I can do without your kind of help.
Can you really?
You'll do anything to ruin my day.
I got up today feeling so good.
You couldn't leave us alone.
We were doing so well.
It was great what we had.
It can't have a natural time span?
Affairs can't dissolve in a good way?
- I really don't see why.
- Do you want it over?
Why must it be one or the other?
I want you here where you belong!
- What about you?
- When I'm here, I'm here.
Or there.
No.
I'm a man-eater and a ball-buster...
I want to get married.
Where the fuck is my shoehorn?
This place is a mess!
You look like you fell out of bed!
You're in bed longer than a baby!
I sleep all day because I can't stand my life...
Now I'll fall in love with you all over again.
- Marry me, Jonathan.
Please.
- You're trying to kill me.
- Marriage isn't death.
- Why now?
Two years ago I slept 8 hours, a year ago it was 12.
- Soon it'll be 24.
- Are you trying to scare me?
- I need a life!
- Get ajob!
- I want you.
- I'm taken, by me!
Go out!
- Do something useful!
- You wouldn't let me work.
You throw a tantrum if I'm out when you call.
I'm out there in the jungle eight hours a day!
- You even tell me who to vote for.
- You want ajob?
I got it!
Fix up this pigsty!
You get a pretty good salary for testing this bed.
You want $50 extra?
Try vacuuming!
An extra 100?
Make this bed!
Open some windows!
It smells like a coffin in here!
You don't need me.
Why do you take this kind of abuse?
Walk out.
Please leave me.
- I'd almost marry you if you'd leave.
- Abuse?
I'm used to worse.
With all your carrying on, to me you're a gift.
So what's it gonna be?
- You sure know how to ruin things.
- Where does that leave us?
Is this an ultimatum?
Is this an ultimatum?
Answer me, you ball-busting bitch!
If it is, I'm gonna tell you what you can do with your ultimatum!
You can make this goddamned bed!
That's what you can do...
Clean these filthy sheets...!
- She's not ready.
- We're a little early.
- You're looking good, Cindy.
- Will Bobbie be long?
No...
- Do we have to go to this party?
- How about it, Cindy?
Where's the powder room?
I'm going, you do what you want.
Man, she's really something.
- I'm bored out of my mind.
- With that?
You must be kidding.
Do you have to go to this party?
- Stick around.
- No, it's better that I go.
I just did my hair.
I've got this at home.
How's your tennis game, Jonathan?
- We'll have to have a rematch.
- Any time.
Is she always that way?
Boy, is she competitive.
She is.
I find that attractive.
You know her problem?
She wants balls.
- She's all right.
- It's no criticism.
- I wish she were more feminine.
- She is a little masculine.
- She always demands her way.
- She's got a great body.
I have to give her everything she wants.
I wouldn't mind giving her something.
You got Bobbie.
I should have it that good.
I've never seen a body like Bobbie's.
She could do with more of what Cindy's got.
She's so passive.
I wouldn't mind Cindy lying still.
Her instructions in bed are like a drill.
I wouldn't mind a little of that.
If she remembers who's boss.
You wouldn't want to swap?
- Are you serious?
- It might liven things up.
- She can miss one party.
- What about Bobbie?
She's so mad at me she'll jump on you just for revenge.
- Seriously?
- She's in the bedroom.
If you're quiet, you can do it and she won't even know.
Give me a minute.
Tell Sandy it's time to leave.
I hope you dance better than you play tennis.
- Sandy won't mind.
- What's he got to do with it?
You're his girl.
He said it would be okay.
- What did Sandy say?
- That you and me... you know.
- And you had nothing to do with it?
- A little.
- A little or a lot?
- This much.
I'm surprised it took you this long.
- Sandy and I have to go to a party.
- Sandy's busy.
You can come around, alone, that's one thing.
I've been expecting that.
But you tell Sandy that if he lays one hand on that tub of lard, not to come home.
So you call me.
Jesus!
She's semi-comatose.
Send a resuscitation unit and an airway.
Be ready to give her an IV.
We'll put her in intensive care.
Bastard.
Very slick.
Very clever!
Well, it's not going to work, Bobbie!
JONATHAN FUERST PRESENTS
A JONATHAN FUERST PRODUCTION
BALLBUSTERS ON PARADE!
That's Bonnie, my first love.
She lived upstairs from us.
We exposed ourselves to each other at ten.
My mother caught us.
She washed my mouth out with soap.
I never got the connection.
Here's Emily, my first steady.
I never laid a hand on her.
Mildred I think this one's name was.
She followed me around at school.
The fellas kidded me about her.
I told her to stop or I'd beat her up.
She dropped her drawers and shoved her ass at me.
So I got my first sight of ass at 12.
Marcia, 13½.
I kissed her at a spin-the-bottle party.
This was Rosalie.
She looked just like Elizabeth Taylor.
I had a crush on her and I never went near her.
In those days, we had illusions.
Here's Charlotte.
Not much on looks, but great tits for 15.
That's Lenny Hartman's sister.
My first French kiss, 16 years old.
Here's Gloria, the best-built girl in school.
I took her to the zoo and copped a cheap feel.
Here's Gwen.
I tried for a year to get her to put out, but she was saving me for marriage.
Every guy at Evander got into her pants except me.
Here's my first...
No, that's not it.
Here's Eileen, my very first fuck.
She was a modern dancer.
Great body, but a waste.
Frigid.
Here's Nancy.
Sweet kid.
She went into biology.
Very frigid.
Here's Bobbie!
My wife.
The fastest tits in the West.
And king of the ball-busters.
Conned me into marriage.
Now she's killing me with alimony.
How did this one get in here?
This is my little girl, Wendy.
"Princess," I call her.
Isn't she a dreamboat?
Here's a real cunt.
I forget her name.
A Nazi.
I banged her in Berlin.
This I went with for a few months.
Banged her on a yacht race.
This slob I went with a year.
I got sick of her and couldn't get it up.
Can't remember her name.
This was my Jap in the sack.
I heard Oriental girls were different.
Not in America, they're not.
Here's a 16-year-old I gave $20 to one night when I was drunk.
Maybe you know her, Jennifer.
She gave me a dose.
That's all, folks.
What are you crying for?
It's not a Lassie movie.
Sorry about that.
- So, what else is new?
- I don't see anybody anymore.
- Neither do we.
- You've got each other.
- I thought she was your daughter.
- She's older than I in many ways.
She knows worlds I can't even begin to touch yet.
- I found out who I am.
- You're in big trouble.
Same old Jonathan.
Let me talk to her about you.
Talk to her about me?
I'm forty, she's nine.
- You just don't get it.
- I've been getting it a long time.
What's the point?
You found a good piece of ass.
God bless you.
You're my friend, I'm happy for you, for as long as it lasts.
You deserve to be happy.
I mean it.
Why fight?
All those games.
You don't need them, Jonathan.
I've played more games than anyone.
The obedient son, bright student, the cocksman's game.
The good husband and father game.
Games don't impress Jennifer.
Just life, just love.
I don't want to argue, so let's just agree to disagree, okay?
Jennifer knows more at 18 than Susan knows to this day.
- You found yourself a real jewel.
- She's my love teacher.
- Finally got it up, huh?
- You give off such bad vibrations.
I love you, but you're a schmuck.
You were always young, open.
Maybe schmuckiness is what you need to stay young and open.
Don't listen to me.
You're doing great and I'm making money.
You can find what I found.
Don't make me insult you.
Women...
All ball-busters, right?
When you think of what he has to dip into, any guy with a conscience has a right to turn soft.
- Am I right, Louise?
- You're always right, lover.
I don't think we're going to have any trouble tonight.
- Are you sure?
- Want to bet?
- How much?
- The sky's the limit.
Goddammit!
- You're doing it all wrong.
- I'm doing it like always.
You never said that before.
"The sky's the limit."
- Never.
- What do I say?
You forgot, didn't you?
I say a hundred.
- Okay.
- Itjust came out.
I just want it right.
I don't think we're going to have any trouble tonight.
- Are you sure?
- Wanna bet?
- How much?
- A hundred.
- You sound pretty sure.
- With your kind, why shouldn't I be?
What kind of man am I?
A real man.
A kind man.
- I'm not kind.
- I don't mean weak, like many men.
I mean the kindness that comes from an inner power so strong that every act is more proof of that power.
Women resent that.
That's why they try to cut you down.
Because your knowledge is so true that it exposes the lies which every scheming one of them lives by.
It takes a true woman to understand the purest form of love:
To love a man who denies himself to her.
A man who inspires worship.
Because he has no need for any woman.
Because he has himself.
And who is better, more beautiful, more powerful, more perfect...
You're getting hard...
More masculine, extraordinary.
More robust...
It's rising.
More virile, domineering.
More irresistible...
It's up, in the air.

If you had a choice...
Yeah?
...would you rather love a girl, or have her love you?
I'd want it mutual.
If you couldn't have it mutual.
Would I rather be the one who loves, or is loved?
Yeah.
It's not that easy a question.
I think I'd rather be in love.
Me, too.
I wouldn't want to get hurt, though.
You were in love with Gloria.
I was starting to be in love with her, then she let me feel her up on the first date.
Turned me right off.
You kept going with her, though.
Well, she let me feel her up.
Yeah, what about Gwen?
Her I could talk to.
I've never been able to talk to any girl.
I was really getting crazy about her.
She's stuck up.
Wouldn't let me lay a hand on her.
So I went back to Gloria.
Well, you want perfection.
What do you want, wise guy?
She just has to be nice, that's all.
You wouldn't want her beautiful?
She doesn't have to be beautiful.
I would like her built, though.
I want mine sexy-looking.
I wouldn't want her to look like a tramp.
Sexy doesn't mean she has to look like a tramp.
There's a middle ground, you know?
I would want that, yeah.
Tall, very tall...
Eww, that would scare me.
She should be very understanding.
Start the same sentences together.
Yeah, I'd like that.
Big tits...
Yeah, but still a virgin.
I don't care about that.
Come on.
I wouldn't mind if she was a little ahead of me, with those big tits, and knew hundreds of different ways.
I want more of a companion.
The other stuff I can get on the outside.
The first time I do it,
I want it beautiful.
I don't want to waste it on some beast.
I feel the same way about getting laid as I feel about going to college.
I'm being pressured into it.
You like that?
Yeah.
I give her to you.
What's wrong with her?
I'm a generous guy.
Yeah, I'm grateful.
How do I break the news to her?
You go over there.
Yeah?
There's a way to talk to girls, you know?
Tell her a joke.
What joke?
Tell her about your unhappy childhood.
That's not bad.
But don't make it like an act.
No.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, schmuck.
If you don't, I will.
You?
You can't even stand up.
I fucked up.
It's my turn.
What do you mean, it's your turn?
She's mine, you gave her to me.
You struck out.
I get two more times at bat.
This is the first time
I've ever been to a college mixer.
- Me too.
I hate them.
- I hate them too.
It's such a phony way of meeting people.
Everybody puts on an act.
So, even if you meet somebody, you don't know who you're meeting.
'Cause you're meeting the act.
That's right, not the person.
I'm not sure I agree.
- With what?
- With what you said.
No, I don't either.
You don't agree with what you said?
How do you feel about it?
I think people only like to think they're putting on an act, but it's not an act, it's really them.
If they think it's an act, they feel better, because they think they can always change it.
You mean, they're kidding themselves, because it's not really an act.
Yes, it is an act, but they're the act.
The act is them.
But if it's them, then how can it be an act?
- Because they're an act.
- But they're also real.
- No.
- I'm not real?
- No.
- I'm an act.
It's all right, I'm an act too.
Don't you behave differently with different people?
No.
With your family?
I thought you meant different people.
Well, sure, with my family--
And with friends, you're another way.
Well, sure, with my friends.
And with your teachers, you're still another way.
So which one is you?
Well, when you put it that way...
You ought to be a lawyer.
I'm gonna be a lawyer.
A lady lawyer.
Um... you're from Smith, right?
Uh-huh.
Do you like it?
Yeah, I like it all right.
Do you like Amherst?
Sure, why shouldn't I?
My parents worked very hard to send me.
I'd better like it.
Do you have a name or something?
Susan.
I'm Sandy.
I think you can make out with her.
Think so?
She's stuff.
You think so?
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
I shouldn't try somebody else, then?
Who?
She was the best-looking girl at the whole mixer.
I'll say that for her...
Wasn't she?
Her tits were too small.
Yeah, I was thinking that.
The hell with her.
But her legs were great.
You think so?
Standing so close, I really couldn't tell about her legs.
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
She's got some funny ideas.
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
Don't rush me, please.
What's the matter?
I like you very much, Susan.
It's our third date.
I like you too.
You let me kiss you last week.
And this week.
If I could kiss you once last week,
I should be able to kiss you at least twice tonight.
- Well?
- You're the only boy
I know that I can talk to.
I can't see you being quiet for any guy.
No, not quiet, exactly.
But if you know somebody's not going to approve of what you are...
- Whatever that is.
- Whatever that is.
Well, you just don't tell him.
I mean, if I like a boy and I want him to keep liking me, and I'm brighter than he is,
I have to not show it or I'll lose him, so it's hard.
Well, I wouldn't want anyone overly bright.
Yeah, but you wouldn't feel threatened.
I might be bothered a little.
I don't think you would nearly as much as some people.
Now, for instance, someday I want to write novels.
Not now, but you know, later on, when I have something to say.
Now, that doesn't threaten you, does it?
- No...
Maybe a little.
Don't press so hard.
See, it's better when it's gentle.
See?
What are you grinning at?
Did you feel her up yet?
Come on, I like this girl.
I don't want to ruin things.
Was I right about kissing her?
Listen, we had a big fight over it.
And you won?
Well, I don't know if I won or not.
Why are you letting yourself be pushed around?
You're the one who's pushing me around!
I guess I won.
Sure, I won.
She kissed me five times.
Now, that's when you should've put your hand on her tit.
Come on, when this girl's nice enough to kiss me,
I should do that to her?
You act as if she's doing you a favor.
Well, it is sort of a favor, isn't it?
I mean, when a girl lets you kiss her and, you know, go on from there.
Feel her up and, you know, the rest of it.
Go all the way and the rest of it.
I mean, isn't it a favor?
What's in it for her?
I mean, if she's not getting paid or anything.
Fuck you.
Okay, okay, I'll feel her up.
Sandy, please take your hand off my breast.
- Why?
- 'Cause I want you to.
How can it be any fun for you if you know I don't want it?
I didn't say it was fun.
Then why is your hand where it is?
Because, the way we're going, by this time,
I should be feeling you up.
I don't feel that way about you, Sandy.
I feel that way about you.
Well, you want me to feel something for you too, don't you?
I thought you liked me.
I do like you, but I like you for other reasons.
So...
So... if we went any further, there wouldn't be those reasons anymore.
Well, we might have something else, though.
What?
Something else.
You're the first girl I've ever done that to, Susan.
I didn't know that.
It doesn't show?
No.
Well, it's something we both have to go through, I guess.
Susan, are you a virgin?
What do I do with my other hand?
What are you gonna do with your hands?
Jonathan:
And then what?
Sandy:
She told me to take my hand off her breast.
- What did you do?
- I said I didn't want to.
Then what?
She said how could it be fun for me if she didn't like it?
Oh, Jesus.
- I said I thought she liked me.
- Yeah?
She said, "I like you for other reasons."
Other reasons?
So, I told her how I really needed this.
What did you tell her?
You know, that it was my first time.
Your first time what?
What did you say exactly?
I don't remember exactly.
That she was the first girl I ever tried to feel up.
- You told her that?
- Was it a mistake?
I wouldn't.
Then she got nicer to me.
What do you mean nicer?
She put my hand on her breast.
You mean you put it on, she left it there.
No, she picked it up and put it on.
She took your hand like this?
And put it on like this?
That's right.
So, I didn't know what to think.
You didn't, huh?
For just wanting to be friends, she's suddenly getting pretty aggressive.
Yeah, then what?
I asked her if she was a virgin.
- You're kidding.
- Was that a mistake?
Anyhow, she is.
She says.
So now you got, what, one hand or two hands on her tits?
By this time, she's put the other hand on the other one.
She put both hands on?
Two hands?
So I said, "What are you gonna do with your hands?"
You didn't say that.
It just came out.
Yeah, then what?
Let me see if I got this.
She unzipped my fly.
Bullshit artist!
Then what?
Then what?
Then she did it.
Did what?
Bullshit artist!
She really did that to you?
- She did that?
- Yeah.
Hello, is this Susan?
Well, you don't know me.
I'm a friend of Sandy's.
His roommate.
Yeah, Jonathan.
He told you about me?
Yeah, so, I'm just here at Smith for tonight, practically on campus.
I was just taking a drive, you know, and I found myself practically on campus.
How do you like Smith?
What's your major?
Where did you go to high school?
What do you do in the summer?
Do you always answer a question with a question?
Do you always date your best friend's girlfriends?
Sandy told me you were beautiful.
He told me you were sexy.
I guess he's just a poor judge.
I guess he meant you had personality.
Good grief.
You have a special quality.
I like girls who are special.
I'm hardly that special.
Some people you can tell about right away.
Most girls I talk to it's like we're spies from foreign countries and we're speaking in code.
Everything means something else.
Like, I say, "Would you like to take a walk?"
And it means something else.
And she says, "I can't.
I've got a French test tomorrow."
And it means something else.
And you say, "I'll come over and help you study."
And it means something else.
You're very sharp, I like that.
And that means something else.
You're too sharp.
Does that bother you?
It interests me.
Is that more code?
We'd be good together.
I'm dating your best friend.
He won't mind.
- How do you know?
- I won't tell him.
What if I mind?
You want to go out Friday?
I'm seeing Sandy.
Saturday?
I have a date.
Sunday?
I'm seeing my folks.
Where do they live?
Newton.
Sunday night?
I'll be too tired.
I'll help you get over your folks.
How about it, Susan?
What are you so afraid of?
Not you.
I think I'm in love.
Mmm...
I think I'm in love.
Bullshit artist.
I really think so.
Did you get in yet?
What's that got to do with it?
How do you know if you don't know how you are in bed together?
Well, that's not everything.
It's a lot.
She tells me thoughts I didn't even know I had until she tells them to me.
It's unbelievable.
I can talk to her.
You can talk to me too.
Are you in love with me?
I can say things to her
I wouldn't dare say to you.
What, for instance?
Things you'd laugh at.
I'm laughing now.
She thinks I'm sensitive.
Sensitive?
Sensitive?
Oh, boy!
Whoa-ho!
What do you talk to her about, flowers?
Books.
Books?
You phony,
I read more books than you do.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna start.
I'm reading "The Fountainhead."
"The Fountainhead." What's that?
It's her favorite book.
You ever hear of "Jean-Christophe"?
What's that?
It's a classic, you moron.
Gonna read it after "The Fountainhead."
Yeah, you ever read "Guadalcanal Diary"
- by Richard Tregaskis?
- No.
That was a best seller and I read it.
Ever read "Gentleman's Agreement"
by Laura Z. Hobson?
You ever read "A Bell For Adano" by John Hersey?
I'm gonna read everything from now on.
I read more than you do.
So who's the one who's sensitive?
You or me?
Come on, who's sensitive?
I've had a very messed-up childhood.
What does your father do?
He fails.
- It's not funny.
I'm sorry.
Were you very poor?
My father couldn't hold on to a job.
He kept giving me advice.
The more he failed, the more advice I got.
He's a Communist, my father.
We're Republicans.
Sometimes I think I'm a Communist, though.
Me, too.
We have so much, and other people have, you know, so little.
After I get set up as a lawyer, what I'd really like to do is go into politics, public service.
What really gets me is I was too young to fight in the war, because what was that all about except to prove that if everybody pitches in, the plain people have a chance.
So, even though I'm the first in my family to get an education,
I don't ever want to forget where I came from.
You're a lot more serious than I thought.
I know.
Sandy:
Where did you meet her?
Jonathan:
I'm another person with her.
You wouldn't recognize me.
The things that come out of my mouth.
Boy, she really sounds like something.
Is she built?
She's, uh...
she's got a quality.
She doesn't talk much, but the things she says are so sharp.
We should double-date sometime.
Well...
I want to know her a little better, you know, before we double-date.
Gee, isn't it great?
A month ago, neither of us even knew a girl.
What's her name?
Myrtle.
Bullshit artist!
You're kidding!
You're not kidding me?
You really did it!
You bastard!
You beat me to it!
What's up?
Next is my turn.
I don't think she'll do it, Sandy.
She will.
I've just been taking it easy on her.
Sandy, believe me, find somebody else.
Are you crazy, when I'm right on the verge?
I'll see her tomorrow night.
Uh, Sandy?
Yeah.
Do you ever talk to her about me?
Yeah, sure, sometimes.
Do me a favor, will you?
What?
Don't tell her I got laid.
Please, Susan.
Sometimes I want to do it, and a second later, I don't want to do it.
Let's do it.
I don't know why you put up with me.
I don't think I can do it.
It really hurts, Susan.
Let me--
Not anymore.
Please, Sandy.
Not anymore.
Susan, let's do it.
I love you.
Do you have anything?
How long have you had that?
- Not too long.
Not a year or anything?
I'm sure it's okay.
I don't wanna take any chances.
These things have to be okay.
It's okay.
I'm positive it's okay.
Jonathan:
It's as if you're the first guy in history who ever got laid.
Sandy:
I'm the first guy in my history who ever got laid.
I like it too, but you don't hear me crowing about it.
There's such a thing as good taste, you know?
- What's the matter with you?
- Jeez!
After you started scoring, what did I get out of you?
"We did it standing, sitting, in the car, under the car.
Myrtle, Myrtle, Myrtle..."
Maybe you forget, but I knew Susan before you knew Myrtle, and who scored first?
You.
That didn't make me feel very good, you know?
In fact, it made me feel very jealous.
But did I try to shut you up?
Did I say, "I'm tired of hearing about it already"?
I didn't say it, 'cause I'm your friend, so I sat through it.
Okay, okay.
You made your point.
Sometimes I think I'm a better friend to you than you are to me.
Sandy:
Didn't you ever do that?
Of course, I...
I knew what the word "misled" meant.
I just didn't know...
So, when I first saw it in print,
I thought it was "myzeled"!
He had been "myzeled."
I kept wondering, what does this word mean? "Myzeled"?
Jonathan:
Sexy.
Let's "myzle."
Has anybody ever heard of "Round John Virgin"?
One of the guys in "Robin Hood."
That's Little John!
What did you say?
Round John...?
Round John Virgin.
Is that in Falstaff?
"Round John Virgin mother and child."
Round John Virgin mother...?
* Holy infant so tender and mild *
All right, gunshee.
Gunshee?
G-u-n-s-h-y, gunshee.
Gun-shy...
I always thought it was gunshee.
Susan, do the one about the bear.
You'll love this, John.
Oh, yeah, the hymn we used to sing in church about the bear with crossed eyes?
Whose name was Gladly.
Gladly the bear?
Don't you know it?
Gladly the cross-eyed bear.
Gladly the cross-eyed bear, get it?
Gladly the cross...
oh, Gladly the cross-eyed bear!
All right, pronounce this:
c-h-o-p-h-o-u-s-e.
Chophuse...
Chophus...?
Chophouse.
This has to stop.
I don't know how to tell him.
You don't have any trouble telling him a lot of other things.
- What does that mean?
- The way you talk to him.
I don't ever hear you talking to me that way.
What way?
I don't know.
He's very vulnerable.
I don't want to hurt him.
You're hurting me.
He loves me.
That's no reason to go to bed with him.
You would have just gone on, wouldn't you, if he hadn't told me?
I don't know.
I would have never known a thing about it.
I don't know, maybe.
Boy, you're really something.
I don't feel like something.
I feel like nothing.
How much longer do you expect me to take this?
I'm trying to tell him.
I see how you're trying.
It's not my fault.
I don't enjoy these fights.
Listen, it's me you're supposed to be in love with.
- I'm gonna tell him.
- What?
- I'm gonna tell him about you and me.
- No, Jonathan!
Why don't you give me some of the understanding that you give to him?
You're stronger.
You tell him everything else.
You can tell him about us.
What do you mean, I tell him everything?
Who says so?
He tells me, he's my best friend.
Are you going to tell him?
He's so helpless.
Susan, I love you.
Why can't you be more with me like you are with Sandy?
She says she's no good for me.
Maybe she's trying to let you down easy.
Go ahead and laugh.
It adds up.
Go ahead and laugh.
You know every mood of mine like you know every mood of his.
- No.
- How come?
- I don't know.
- You don't tell me thoughts I never knew I had.
- Does he say I do that?
- Yes.
- Then I guess I must.
- You do it all right, so do it with me.
I can't.
You can do it with him, you can do it with me.
Now tell me my thoughts.
- I can't.
- Why can't you?
I can't with you.
This has gone far enough.
I cannot stand any more ultimatums.
This is my last one.
Now, tonight, you tell him about us, or tomorrow, I tell him.
Look at me, Susan!
Now tell me my goddamn thoughts!
Hello.
You didn't do it, did you?
No.
Why not?
He looks at me with such trust.
How do I look at you?
With bitterness.
It used to be trust.
At least you know my thoughts.
Did you tell him?
What do you think?
No.
So, what do we do now?
I don't know.
I guess I get an ultimatum.
Do you think there's any sense in this?
In what?
In you and me.
That's up to you.
No, it's up to you.
I don't see any point in it.
I wish I were wrong.
I don't feel anything anymore.
Neither do I.
The reason I didn't say anything to Sandy...
I knew he wouldn't believe me.
And I'd go into details so he would have to believe me.
And I knew he'd come running to you, and I knew you'd tell him everything I said was true, and I knew then you'd go to bed with him.
Yeah, that sounds like what would happen.
So?
So?
Jonathan...
I'll always be your friend.
Jesus, Susan, I hope not.
Sandy:
It's going to be buggy.
Susan:
It's not going to be buggy.
It's the tropics.
What do you mean?
It's the jungle.
You can't cover yourself from head to toe.
I'll get eaten alive.
You don't know what it's like.
You've never camped out before.
Isn't he being silly, Jonathan?
- I am not.
- Are too.
- Am not.
- Are too.
You're a real city boy.
How about the cot?
Come on, sweetie, we've got a sleeping bag.
You're really serious about sleeping on the ground?
You are a baby.
Christ, this knapsack's heavy.
Well, I told you you overpacked.
What in the world do you plan to do with a pillowcase?
Put it back.
Well, you are a nut.
Isn't he a nut, Jonathan?
You pack your things.
Let me pack mine.
I'm just trying to help.
Well, help your own stuff.
You have packing to do.
We don't even have room.
We're going in a little car...
Jesus...
You want her?
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
Will you look at the pair on her?
Get a look at that schmuck trying to keep up with her.
They're always with guys like that.
That guy must be 60 if he's a day.
Maybe he'll have a heart attack.
You could save his life.
Get her number and fuck her.
You bastard...
Bastard...
How's Susan?
Couldn't be better.
I always said it, and I say it now.
You found yourself a jewel.
She is a jewel.
Not bad, that one.
Listen, you must be getting more than your share.
I'd get married in a minute if I could find the right girl.
Bullshit artist.
You and your actress friends.
Are you kidding, Doctor?
You're the one that's got the deal.
I mean, what can I say?
"Take your clothes off, baby,
I wanna check your capital gains."
I just look.
Sure, you do.
I really do.
Susan's plenty enough woman for one man.
Hey, look at that.
Jonathan:
That's Sally Joyce.
Didn't I see her on Ed Sullivan?
I fucked her once.
Bullshit artist.
We used to do her taxes.
She's with another firm now.
Why don't you say hello?
She wouldn't remember me.
She's a real ball-buster, that one.
I've been through the mill with her kind.
Yeah?
You think a girl goes for you, and you find out she's after your money or your balls... or your money and your balls.
Women today are better hung than the men.
I should have your problems.
It's not as easy getting laid as it used to be.
I don't think I fuck more than a dozen new girls a year now.
Maybe I'm too much of a perfectionist.
This last one came so close to being what I wanted.
Good pair of tits on her--
Not a great pair.
Almost no ass at all, and that bothered me.
Sensational legs.
I would have settled for the legs, if she had just two more inches here and three more here.
Anyhow... that took two years out of my life.
You don't want a family?
I don't want to put it down, but who needs it?
You can't make fucking your life's work.
Don't tell me what I can and can't do.
You're so well-off?
Susan's a very good homemaker.
Very efficient.
I come home, everything is in its place... which I like, because it's tiring putting in a full day at the office, then Doctors' Hospital for a couple of hours.
So it's nice to have everything in its place when I get home.
A martini, dinner, the kids.
We don't watch much television.
We like to read aloud to each other.
We used to have more friends than we do, but we don't have that many anymore.
So, on weekends we might entertain a little or go over to see a friend.
Come into town, see a play or a good film.
It's not glamorous or anything.
There are other things besides glamour.
You have a long lifeline.
I like that.
The way you run your nail across my...
You're difficult to get along with.
Me?
- Mm-hmm.
- Bobbie...
You always know your own mind.
Right this minute, anyway.
You won't stop going after what you want until you get it.
Let me see your hand.
Ahh... mmm...
Well?
You are built.
You see that in my hand?
Even your hand is built.
I think you're a dirty old man.
I'm a dirty young man.
How old are you?
How old do you think I am?
19.
No... 20?
No.
21?
22?
No.
24?
You skipped 23.
23?
No.
24?
No.
25?
26?
No.
27?
You're getting warm.
28?
No.
29?
I like going out with older women.
Are you married?
Are you kidding?
You don't want to get married?
I'd marry you in a minute.
Can you cook?
Spaghetti.
I can cook spaghetti.
Good, you do the cooking.
What will you do?
What would you like me to do?
What would you like to do?
I asked you first.
Well, I'm not gonna answer you first.
Well...
I can sew.
Doesn't sound like much of a marriage.
Me cooking spaghetti, and you sewing.
You want a divorce?
I'll take you for every cent you got.
I didn't know I was marrying a gold digger.
Mm-hmm...
You won't take pity on me?
Only if you say you're sorry.
I'm sorry.
And you'll never do it again.
I'll never do it again.
And you'll always be a good boy.
Yes, Mama.
You like to be mothered?
I'd like to be smothered by you.
What else would you like me to do to you?
Well...
How do you like it?
How do I like what?
My, uh... you know.
What do I know?
You know everything.
I know you.
And I know you.
Mmm...
- * Dream
* When you're feeling blue
* Dream
* That's the thing to do
* Just
* Watch the smoke rings
* Rise in the air
* You'll find your share
* Of memories there
* So
* Dream
* When the day is through...
Wow...
I almost came that time.
Help!
Oh, nurse?
What is it, Mr. Weisenborn?
Will you come in here a minute, please?
Certainly, Mr. Weisenborn.
Why, Mr. Weisenborn!
Bobbie:
Most guys I know are pricks.
I don't know anymore what they want.
Jonathan:
I'll be happy to tell you.
They want...
the boodle.
But they ain't gonna get the boodle.
Goddamn right.
Because this kid here has got the boodle.
You're pretty sure of yourself, aren't you?
Mmm...
You're a nice man.
And you're a very lucky girl.
You know something, Sam?
What is it, sweetheart?
You think it would be a fatal mistake in our lives if we shacked up?
It's very difficult, Bobbie.
These last couple of weeks, we get along so well together.
The idea...
I like you very much.
So much... this idea... to be perfectly honest,
I mean, it sounds very good to me.
Let's both give it a couple of days to think about it.
It sounds, like... well, very good.
Very, very, uh... well... good.
Only, our eyes should be open.
If we should go into this, we should know exactly what we're getting into.
It's just a shack-up.
I'm not asking for your hand in marriage.
Yeah, well, as long as we both understand that.
We do.
I just thought it's better to get it all out on the table, so later, there can be no possibility of a misunderstanding.
I don't know how many business deals I've seen come to grief--
Okay...
Okay.
You're a real prick, you know that?
Prick?
I could very easily get serious about this girl.
She's a lot of fun to be with.
This is just between the two of us, but for the last year or so,
I've been having...
I don't know, a little trouble.
I wasn't worried, but still and all... a little trouble with... well, myself.
You know... getting hard.
It took a long time, and you know how girls are today, they judge you.
They judge you very quickly.
So, uh...
I had a real rough time a couple of times.
Some very nasty innuendos.
And, as I say,
I wasn't too worried, but...
I won't lie to you,
I was a little worried.
Then along comes this Bobbie.
I get one look at the size of the pair on her and I never had a doubt I'd ever be anything but okay again, and I was, I was.
With all our kidding, back and forth on our first night together,
I don't mind telling you I had tears in my eyes.
She's really the girl in the airline commercial?
You lucky son of a bitch.
I don't know.
I don't want to get in over my head.
I got in over my head three, four times already, and you have to be a real bastard.
I don't like being put in that position.
What would you do?
If she looks anything like she looks on television...
Size 38, with a D cup.
But looks aren't everything.
Believe me, looks are everything.
Maybe.
I'm hungry.
I'll get up.
Why do we always have to eat so late?
Because I work late, dumb-o.
Why do you work at all?
Brings in extra money.
I make enough.
You want me to quit working?
I thought you were bored with it.
I am.
So quit.
What'll I do?
What do other women do?
Have children.
Well, you asked me.
* So until the day that one comes along *
* I'll sing my song with you *
* For every little fault that you have *
* Say I've got three or four *
* The human little faults you do have *
* Just make me love you more *
* You may not be an angel
* But still I'm sure you'll do *
* So until the day that one comes along *
* I'll string along
* With you.
Voices on TV:
Hey, was that you?
- Yeah, that was me.
- No kidding.
What about my beer?
We're all out.
I really wanted a beer.
Do you want me to run out to the corner?
You're too tired.
I'm tired, but I don't mind.
I'll get it.
No, I'll get it.
It's my fault.
I knew I should have reminded you when I called this afternoon.
I'm sorry, honey.
You're more tired now than when you were working.
I'm in the house all day.
Did you get up at all today?
What do you do?
I mean, when you're not telephoning?
I'm not on the phone that much.
It took me 45 minutes to get through this afternoon.
I'll go get the beer.
No, I'll go.
I thought you were too tired.
I haven't been out all day.
Fresh air will do you good.
Will you walk with me?
Then I may as well go myself.
* To sing my love song too
* And until the day that one comes along *
* I'll sing my song with you *
* For every little fault that you have... *
Wanna make love?
We haven't in a week.
Is it a week?
It's funny.
Susan and I do all the right things.
We undress in front of each other.
We spend 15 minutes on foreplay.
We experiment, do it in different rooms.
It's a seven-room house.
We don't believe in making a ritual of it.
We do it when we feel like it.
We don't feel we have to be passionate all the time.
Sometimes it's even more fun necking.
We're considerate of each other's feelings.
I had a tendency-- men, I guess, have-- to be selfish.
But I stopped.
I don't do that now.
We try to be patient, and we are patient, gentle with each other.
Maybe it's just not meant to be enjoyable with women you love.
Sandy... do you want to get laid?
Please.
Sandy:
Very nice.
Jonathan:
Very nice indeed.
Indeed.
Watch out.
I almost had it.
Sure, you almost had it.
I almost had it.
Right, Cindy?
See that, Cindy?
He was lucky.
That's all.
Bastard, that was out!
- Bullshit it was!
- Oh, bullshit.
Let Cindy be the judge.
We'll do it over, all right?
All right.
Fair's fair.
Deuce!
You see that shot, Cindy?
Now we got some tennis.
Hey!
Game!
Luck!
Luck, my ass!
Whoo-hoo!
You want to take me on, Cindy?
It's my turn.
Oh, come on, Bobbie, you're so awful.
You serve.
Very nice.
Hey, you play well.
Hey, Sandy, will you look at this girl?
Terrific, Cindy.
Whoo!
Hey!
She's racking me up.
I'm not kidding.
Look at this.
She's racking me up.
Beautiful.
Boy, will you look at this?
40-love.
And I'm not taking it easy on her either.
You and Lord Taylor's are gonna have to work out a trial separation.
I had the water running.
What did you say?
You and Lord Taylor's are going to have to work out a trial separation.
Look at the date.
What do you mean?
Five months ago.
I'm sorry I cost you so much money.
I want to get married.
Are you tired of me, Jonathan?
Am I ever.
- The answer is yes.
- I didn't say yes.
You said, "Am I ever."
I need more in life than this.
Who put you up to this?
Your psychiatrist?
After a long, exhaustive bed hunt, you finally chose me.
Cindy's not a virgin either!
What?
Oh, I get it.
Is that what brought this on?
Your mind is unbelievable.
You have to have a low opinion of me thinking that I would do that to Sandy.
Oh, no, you wouldn't want to cheat on Sandy.
Oh, now it's Sandy.
Well, he spends half his life over here.
Wait a minute.
A second ago you had me screwing Cindy.
Who am I screwing now, Sandy?
You're going too fast for me.
I'm going too fast for you?
Your little mind operates like an IBM, like a pinball machine.
First Cindy.
Oh, no, not Cindy?
How about Sandy?
How about Cindy and Sandy?
Talk about the pot calling the kettle.
The day I got an earful of your checkered past, I felt like a celibate.
You made me tell you.
Sure, I twisted your arm.
It got you hot!
Something has to.
You have such contempt for me.
Kid, you worked hard for it.
It's yours.
The way you paw me at parties.
Now affection is contempt.
Upside down.
Everything upside down.
Feeling me up in public is not affection.
Will you come on?
I know I sleep all day.
I know I'm doing a terrible job, but you're not helping me any.
And who helps me?
I help you.
Your kind of help I can do without.
Can you?
Can you really?
Ahh!
You'll do anything you can to ruin my day, won't you?
I got up today feeling so good.
You couldn't leave us alone.
- We were doing so well.
- What?
At one time-- at one time, it was great what we had.
The kidding around.
It can't have a natural time span?
Affairs can't dissolve in a good way.
There's always got to be poison.
I don't see why.
I really don't see why!
Jonathan, do you want it over between us?
Why does it have to be one way or the other?
You don't want me to leave?
I want you right here where you belong!
And what about you?
When I'm here, I'm here.
When I'm not here, I'm there.
- Where?
- Wherever?
No.
I'm a man-eater or a ball-buster and a castrator.
I want to get married.
All right, where the fuck is my shoehorn?
This place is a mess!
There's not any food in the house!
Half the time, you look like you fell out of bed!
You spend more time in bed than any other human being past the age of six months than I ever heard of!
The reason I sleep all day is because I can't stand my life!
What life?
!
Sleeping all day!
You say that sort of thing,
I fall in love with you all over again.
Marry me, Jonathan.
Please, marry me.
You're trying to kill me.
Marriage isn't death.
Why now?
Because two years ago, I slept eight hours.
A year ago, it was 12.
It's up to 15 now.
Pretty soon, it's gonna be 24.
What are you trying to do, scare me?
- I need a life!
- Get a job!
I don't want a job.
I want you.
I'm taken, by me!
Get out of the house!
Do something useful, God damn it!
You wouldn't let me work when I wanted to.
That was a year ago.
You throw a tantrum every time you call and I'm not home.
Look, sister, I'm out there in the jungle eight hours a day!
You wouldn't even let me canvass for Kennedy.
You want a job?
I got a job for you!
Fix up this pigsty!
You get a pretty goddamn good salary for testing out this bed all day!
You want an extra $50 a week?
Try vacuuming!
You want an extra 100?
Make this goddamn bed!
Try opening some goddamn windows!
That's why you can't stand up in here!
The goddamn place smells like a coffin!
Oh...
Bobbie.
You don't need me.
Why do you let yourself in for this kind of abuse?
Walk out.
Leave me.
Please leave me.
God's sake, I'd almost marry you if you'd leave me.
You call that abuse?
You don't know what I'm used to.
With all your carrying on, to me you're a gift.
So what's it gonna be?
You sure know how to screw things up.
So where does that leave us?
Are you giving me an ultimatum?
Is this an ultimatum?
Answer me, you ball-busting, castrating, son-of-a-cunt bitch!
Is this an ultimatum or not?
!
Because if it is, I'm gonna tell you what you can do with your ultimatum!
I'm gonna tell you what you can do with it!
You can make this goddamn bed!
That's what you can do with it!
Goddamn clean these filthy sheets!
That's what you can do with it!
She's not ready.
We're a little early.
You're looking good, Cindy.
I do my best.
Will Bobbie be long?
Uh, no.
Hey, uh... do we have to go to this party?
How about it, Cindy?
Where's the powder room?
Uh, right there.
I'm going.
You do what you want.
Man, she's really something.
I'm so bored, I'm going out of my mind.
Bored?
With that?
You must be kidding.
You have to go to this party?
Stick around.
- No, it's better that I go.
Hey, I just did my hair.
I've got this at home.
How's your tennis game, Jonathan?
We'll have to have a rematch.
Anytime.
Is she always that way?
You know women.
Boy, is she competitive.
She is very competitive, but I find that attractive.
You know her problem?
She wants balls.
She's all right.
I'm not criticizing.
I wish she were more feminine.
She is a little masculine.
I just wish she wouldn't always demand her own way.
She's got a great body on her.
I have to treat her like a child, give her everything she wants.
I wouldn't mind giving her something.
You got Bobbie.
I should only have it that good.
Ohh...
Bobbie.
Bobbie, are you kidding?
I've never seen a body like that.
She could do with a little more of what Cindy's got.
She's so goddamn passive.
Yeah, I wouldn't mind Cindy just lying still once.
She's so busy handing out instructions in bed.
It's like close-order drill.
Yeah, I wouldn't mind a little of that, as long as she doesn't forget who's boss.
Hey, uh... you wouldn't want to swap sometime, would you?
Are you serious?
What do you say?
Might liven things up a bit.
She can miss one party.
Leave her to me.
What about Bobbie?
She's so mad at me, she'll jump all over you just for revenge.
Hey, you like that, huh?
Seriously?
She's in the bedroom.
If you're quiet, you can do it and she won't even know.
- You bastard.
Give me a minute.
Tell Sandy it's time to leave.
I hope you dance better than you play tennis.
Sandy won't mind.
What's Sandy got to do with it?
You're his girl.
He said it would be okay.
What did Sandy say?
That you and me, uh... you know.
That was his idea.
You had nothing to do with it?
A little.
A little or a lot?
This much.
I'm surprised it took you this long to get around to it.
Sandy and I have a party to go to.
Sandy's busy.
You wanna come around sometime by yourself, that's one thing.
I've been expecting that.
But you tell Sandy that if he lays one hand on that tub of lard in there, not to come home.
So you call me.
Jesus!
Sandy:
She's semicomatose.
Better send a resuscitation unit and an airway.
Be ready to give her an IV on admission.
It's on...
Tell him we'll put her in intensive care.
Bastard.
Very slick.
Very clever!
Well, it's not going to work, Bobbie!
Jonathan:
That's Bonnie, my first love.
She lived upstairs from us.
We started exposing ourselves to each other at 10.
We got caught on the roof one day by my mother who washed my mouth out with soap.
I never got the connection.
Here's Emily, my first steady.
Until she moved off the block at 11,
I never laid a hand on her.
Um, Mildred,
I think, this one's name was.
She followed me around at school.
The fellas kidded me about her.
I warned her if she didn't stop, I'd beat her up.
She picked up her skirt, dropped her drawers and shoved her ass at me.
So I got my first sight of ass at 12.
Marcia, 13 1/2 or thereabouts,
I kissed her one night at a spin-the-bottle party.
This one's Rosalie.
Rosalie looked just like Elizabeth Taylor in "National Velvet."
I had a crush on Rosalie from 14 to 15 and I never went near her.
In those days, we had illusions.
Here's Charlotte.
Not much on looks, but great tits for 15.
That's Lenny Hartman's sister.
My first French kiss, 16 years old.
Here's Gloria, the best-built girl at Evander Childs.
I took her to the Bronx Zoo once and on the bus, copped a cheap feel.
Here's Gwen.
I went with her for a year trying to get her to put out, but she thought I was too nice and was saving me for marriage.
Every guy at Evander must have gotten into her pants except me.
Here's my first-- no, that one was a mistake.
Here's Eileen, my very first fuck.
She was a modern dancer at Swarthmore.
Great body on her.
What a waste-- frigid.
Here's Nancy.
Sweet kid.
She went into biology.
Very frigid.
Here's Bobbie!
My wife.
The fastest tits in the West and king of the ball-busters.
She conned me into marrying her and now she's killing me with alimony.
Don't know how this one get in here?
This is my little girl, Wendy.
"Princess," I call her.
Isn't she a dreamboat?
Here's a real cunt.
I forget her name.
A Nazi.
I banged her in Berlin.
Here's something I went with for a couple of months.
First time I banged her was on a yacht race to Nassau.
This slob I went with for a year until I got so sick of her ball-busting,
I couldn't get it up anymore.
I can't remember her name.
This was my Jap in the sack.
I heard that Oriental girls were different.
Not in America, they're not.
Here's a 16-year-old I gave 20 bucks to one night in the village when I was drunk.
Maybe you know her, Jennifer.
She gave me a dose.
Th-th-th-that's all, folks.
What are you crying for?
It's not a Lassie movie.
Sorry about that.
Or something.
So, what else is new?
To tell you the truth,
I don't see anybody anymore.
Neither do we.
Well, you've got each other.
I thought she was your daughter when you first came in.
In a lot of ways, she's older than I am.
Yeah.
She knows worlds I can't even begin to touch yet.
Sandy, please.
I found out who I am.
You're in big trouble.
Same old Jonathan.
Indubitably.
Let me talk to her about you, John.
Talk to her about me?
I'm 40, she's nine.
You just don't get it, do you?
Oh, I get it, all right.
I've been getting it for a long time.
What's the point?
Sandy, you found a good piece of ass.
God bless you.
You're my friend, I'm happy for you.
As long as it lasts, I'm happy for you.
You deserve to be happy.
I mean it.
Why fight?
Okay?
All those games.
Jesus Christ!
You don't need those games, Jonathan.
I know.
I've played more games than anyone.
The obedient son game.
The bright student game.
- The cocksman's game.
- Some cocksman.
The respectable husband game.
The good father game.
- The specialist game.
- Good father?
Games don't impress Jennifer.
Just life, just love.
Yeah, well, I don't want to argue with you, Sandy.
So let's just agree to disagree, okay?
Don't make me mad, okay?
Jennifer knows more at 18 than Susan knows to this day.
You found yourself a real jewel, okay?
She's my love teacher.
Finally got it up, huh?
You give off such bad vibrations.
Bad vibrations?
Sandy, I love you, but you're a schmuck.
You were always young, Sandy, open.
You were schmucky a lot of the time, but maybe schmuckiness is what you need to stay young and open.
Listen...
don't listen to me.
You're doing great, and I'm making money.
You can find what I found, Jonathan.
Don't make me insult you.
Women...
All ball-busters, right?
You know it.
When you think of some of the things he has to dip into, any guy with a conscience has a right to turn soft.
Am I right, Louise?
You're always right, lover.
I don't think we're going to have any trouble tonight.
- You don't?
- No, I don't.
Are you sure?
You wanna bet?
How much?
The sky's the limit.
God damn it!
What did I do?
You're doing it all wrong.
I'm doing it like always.
You never said that before.
- Said what?
- "Sky's the limit."
Sure, I...
Never.
What do I say?
You forgot, didn't you?
A hundred.
I say a hundred.
Okay.
It just came out.
I just want it right, that's all.
I don't think we're going to have any trouble tonight.
- You don't?
- No, I don't.
Are you sure?
You wanna bet?
How much?
A hundred?
You sound pretty sure.
You're a kind of man... why shouldn't I be sure?
What kind of man am I?
A real man.
A kind man.
I'm not kind.
I don't mean weak kind, the way so many men are.
I mean the kindness that comes from an enormous strength, from an inner power so strong that every act, no matter what, is more proof of that power.
That's what all women resent.
That's why they try to cut you down.
Because your knowledge of yourself and them is so right, so true that it exposes the lies which they, every scheming one of them, live by.
It takes a true woman to understand that the purest form of love is to love a man who denies himself to her.
A man who inspires worship, because he has no need for any woman, because he has himself.
And who is better, more beautiful, more powerful, more perfect.
You're getting hard.
More strong, more masculine, more extraordinary, more robust...
It's rising.
It's rising.
More virile, domineering.
More irresistible...
It's up... in the air.
If you had a choice, would you rather love a girl, or have her love you?
- I want it mutual.
- If you couldn't have that.
Would I rather be the one who loves, or is loved?
It's not an easy question.
I think I'd rather be in love.
Me, too.
I wouldn't want to get hurt, though.
- You were in love with Gloria.
- I was starting to be.
Then she let me feel her up on the first date.
Turned me right off.
- You kept going with her.
- Well, she let me feel her up.
- What about Gwen?
- Her I could talk to.
- I never could talk to any girl.
- I was getting crazy about her.
But she wouldn't let me lay a hand on her.
- So I went back to Gloria.
- You want perfection.
- What do you want?
- She just has to be nice.
- Not beautiful?
- She doesn't have to be.
- I'd like her built, though.
- I want mine sexy.
- She shouldn't look like a tramp.
- Sexy doesn't mean like a tramp.
- There's a middle ground.
- I would want that.
Tall, very tall...
That would scare me.
She should be very understanding.
Start the same sentences together.
- I'd like that.
- Big tits...
- Yeah, but still a virgin.
- I don't care about that.
I wouldn't mind if she was a little ahead of me, with those big tits.
And knew hundreds of different ways.
I want a companion.
The other stuff I can get on the outside.
The first time I do it, I don't want to waste it on some beast.
I feel about getting laid the same way I feel about college.
I'm being pressured into it.
- You like that?
- Yeah.
I give her to you.
I'm a generous guy.
I'm grateful.
How do I break the news to her?
Go over there.
There's a way to talk to girls.
Tell her ajoke.
Tell her about your unhappy childhood.
- That's not bad.
- But don't make it like an act.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, schmuck.
If you don't, I will.
You can't even stand up.
- I fucked up.
- My turn.
- She's mine, you gave her to me.
- You struck out.
I get two more times at bat.
- This is my first college mixer.
- I hate them.
- It's so phony.
- Everybody puts on an act.
- You don't know who you meet.
- Because you're meeting the act.
- I'm not sure I agree.
- I don't either.
- You don't agree with yourself?
- How do you feel about it?
People like to think they put on an act, but it's really them.
- They think they can change it.
- They're kidding themselves?
- It is an act, but the act is them.
- Then how can it be an act?
- Because they're an act.
- They're also real.
So I'm not real?
- I'm an act?
- It's all right, so am I.
Don't you behave differently with different people?
- With your family?
- I thought you meant people.
- Sure, with my family...
- And with friends, another way.
And with your teachers, still another way.
So which one is you?
- You ought to be a lawyer.
- I'm gonna be a lawyer.
A lady lawyer.
You're from Smith, right?
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.
Do you like Amherst?
Sure.
My parents worked very hard to send me.
I'd better like it.
Do you have a name?
- Susan.
- I'm Sandy.
I think you can make out with her.
She's stuff.
- You think so?
- I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
- Shouldn't I try somebody else?
- Who?
She was the best-looking girl at the mixer.
Wasn't she?
- Her tits were too small.
- Yeah.
The hell with her.
- But her legs were great.
- I was standing too close.
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
- She's got funny ideas.
- I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
- Don't rush me.
- What is it?
I like you very much.
It's our third date.
You let me kiss you last week.
If I could kiss you once last week, I should kiss you twice tonight.
- You're the only boy I can talk to.
- I can't see you being quiet.
If somebody doesn't approve of what you are...
- Whatever that is.
- You just don't tell him.
If I want a boy to like me, and I'm brighter than him, -
- I can't show it or I'll lose him.
- I don't want anyone overly bright.
- You wouldn't feel threatened.
Not nearly as much as some people.
I want to write novels.
Later, when I have something to say.
Does that threaten you?
No.
Maybe a little.
Don't press so hard.
It's better when it's gentle.
See?
What are you grinning at?
- Did you feel her up yet?
- I don't want to ruin things.
Was I right about kissing her?
- You won?
- I don't know.
- You let yourself be pushed around.
- You're pushing me around.
I guess I won, she kissed me five times.
That's when you should've put your hand on her tit.
- I should do that to her?
- She's not doing you a favor.
When a girl lets you kiss her, and feel her up...
Go all the way and all the rest of it...
Isn't it a favor?
What's in it for her?
She's not getting paid.
Fuck you.
Okay, I'll feel her up.
Please take your hand off my breast.
I want you to.
- It can't be fun if I don't want it.
- I didn't say it was fun.
- Then why is your hand there?
- I should be feeling you up by now.
I don't feel that way about you.
I feel that way about you.
Don't you want me to feel something for you, too?
I do like you, but for other reasons.
If we went any further, there wouldn't be those reasons.
- We might have something else.
- What?
Something else.
You're the first girl I've ever done that to.
- I didn't know that.
- It doesn't show?
It's something we both have to go through.
Susan, are you a virgin?
What do I do with my other hand?
What are you gonna do with your hands?
Then she told me to take my hand off her breast.
I said I didn't want to.
She said how could it be fun for me if she didn't like it?
I said I thought she liked me.
She said, "for other reasons."
I told her I really needed this.
That it was my first time.
- What did you say exactly?
- I don't remember exactly.
That she was the first girl I ever tried to feel up.
Was that a mistake?
Then she got nicer to me.
- She put my hand on her breast.
- You mean she left it on.
- She picked it up and put it on.
- She took your hand?
- And put it on like this?
- Yes.
I didn't know what to think.
Suddenly she gets pretty aggressive.
Then I asked if she was a virgin.
Was that a mistake?
- Anyhow, she is.
- She says.
So you got one or two hands on her tits?
- She put the other hand on the other.
- Two hands?
I said, "What are you gonna do with your hands?"
- Then what?
- She unzipped my fly.
- Bullshit artist!
Then what?
- Then she did it.
Did what?
Bullshit artist!
She really did that to you?
Is this Susan?
I'm a friend of Sandy's.
His roommate.
Yeah, Jonathan.
He told you about me?
I'm here at Smith just for tonight, practically on campus.
I was just taking a drive and I found myself practically on campus.
Do you like Smith?
- Where did you go to high school?
- What do you do in the summer?
You always answer with a question?
You always date your best friend's girl?
- Sandy told me you were beautiful.
- He told me you were sexy.
- I guess he's a poorjudge.
- He meant you had personality.
- You have a special quality.
- I'm hardly that special.
Most girls I talk to it's like we're spies from foreign countries, speaking in code.
Everything means something else.
I say, "How about a walk?" And it means something else.
"No, I've got a French test tomorrow." And it means something else.
And you say, "I'll help you study."
You're sharp, I like that.
You're too sharp.
- Does that bother you?
- It interests me.
- We'd be good together.
- I'm dating your best friend.
- He won't mind.
I won't tell him.
- What if I mind?
- Want to go out Friday?
- I'm seeing Sandy.
- Saturday?
- I have a date.
- Sunday?
- I'm seeing my folks.
- Where do they live?
- Newton.
- Sunday night?
- I'll be too tired.
I'll help you get over your folks.
- What are you so afraid of?
- Not you.
I think I'm in love.
- Bullshit artist.
- I really think so.
- Did you get in yet?
- What's that got to do with it?
How do you know if you don't know how you are in bed together?
She tells me thoughts I didn't even know I had.
- I can talk to her.
- You can talk to me.
I can say things to her I wouldn't dare say to you.
- Things you'd laugh at.
- I'm laughing now.
She thinks I'm sensitive.
Sensitive?
Oh, boy!
- Do you talk about flowers?
- Books.
- I read more books than you do.
- I'm gonna start.
- I'm reading "The Fountainhead."
- What's that?
Her favorite book.
Ever hear of "Jean Christophe"?
It's a classic, you moron.
I'll read it after "The Fountainhead."
Ever read "Guadalcanal Diary" by Richard Tregaskis?
I read it.
Ever read "Gentleman's Agreement"?
Or "A Bell For Adano"?
- I'm gonna read everything.
- I read more than you.
So who's sensitive?
- I've had a messed-up childhood.
- What does your father do?
- He fails.
It's not funny.
- I'm sorry.
Were you very poor?
My father couldn't hold on to ajob.
He kept giving me advice.
The more he failed, the more advice.
He's a Communist.
We're Republicans.
Sometimes I think I'm a Communist.
Me, too.
We have so much, and other people have so little.
After I get set up as a lawyer, I really want to go into politics.
Public service.
It gets me that I was too young to fight in the war.
That was all about proving that, if everybody pitches in, plain people have a chance.
So although I'm the first in my family to get an education, -
- I don't ever want to forget where I came from.
- You're more serious than I thought.
- I know.
I'm another person with her.
The things I say...
- Boy!
Is she built?
- She has... a quality.
She doesn't talk much, but the things she says are sharp.
We should double-date.
I want to know her better before we double-date.
Isn't it great?
A month ago, neither of us even knew a girl.
- What's her name?
- Myrtle.
Bullshit artist!
You're not kidding me?
You really did it!
- Next it's my turn.
- I don't think she'll do it.
- Sandy, find somebody else.
- Are you crazy?
I'm on the verge.
I'll see her tomorrow night.
Sandy?
Do you ever talk to her about me?
Sometimes.
Do me a favor.
Don't tell her I got laid.
Please, Susan.
Sometimes I want to do it, and then I don't.
I don't know why you put up with me.
- I don't think I can do it.
- It really hurts, Susan.
- Let me.
- Not anymore.
Susan, let's do it.
I love you.
Do you have anything?
How long have you had that?
- Not a year or anything?
- I'm sure it's okay.
- I'm not taking any chances.
- These have to be okay.
It's okay.
I'm positive it's okay.
- You're not the first to get laid.
- It's my first time.
I don't crow about it.
There's such a thing as good taste.
After you started scoring, what did I get out of you?
"We did it standing, sitting, in the car, under the car.
Myrtle..."
I knew Susan before you knew Myrtle.
But you scored first.
It made me very jealous.
But I didn't try to shut you up.
- I'm your friend, I sat through it.
- Okay, you made your point.
I'm a better friend to you than you are to me.
Didn't you ever do that?
Of course, I knew what "misled" meant.
But when I saw it, I thought it was "myzeled"!
I kept wondering what it meant.
Anybody ever heard of "Round John Virgin"?
- Little John!
- What did you say?
- Round John Virgin.
- Round yon virgin mother and child.
All right:
Gunshee.
G-u-n-s-h-y.
Susan, do the one about the bear.
The hymn we used to sing about the bear with crossed eyes?
Whose name was Gladly.
Don't you know it?
Gladly the cross I'd bear.
Oh, Gladly the cross-eyed bear!
Pronounce this:
C-h-o-p-h-o-u-s-e.
Chophus...
Chop house.
- This has to stop.
- I don't know how to tell him.
- You tell him a lot of other things.
- What does that mean?
You never talk to me the way you talk to him.
- What way?
- I don't know.
- I don't want to hurt him.
- You're hurting me.
- He loves me.
- That's no reason to sleep with him.
You would have just gone on if he hadn't told me, wouldn't you?
- I would never have known.
- I don't know.
Maybe.
- You're really something.
- I don't feel like something.
I feel like nothing.
How much longer do you expect me to take this?
- I'm trying to tell him.
- I see how you're trying.
It's not my fault.
You're supposed to be in love with me.
I'm gonna tell him.
What?
No, Jonathan!
- Try understanding me for once.
- You're stronger.
- You tell him everything else.
- Who says so?
He tells me, he's my best friend.
Are you going to tell him?
He's so helpless.
Susan, I love you.
Why can't you be more with me like you are with Sandy?
She says she's no good for me.
Maybe she's trying to let you down easy.
Go ahead and laugh.
It adds up.
Go ahead and laugh.
You don't know every mood of mine like you know his.
How come?
You don't tell me thoughts I never knew I had.
- You can do it with me.
- I can't.
You can do it with him, you can do it with me.
- I can't with you.
- This has gone far enough.
- I can't stand any more ultimatums.
- Tell him tonight.
Or tomorrow I tell him.
Look at me!
Now tell me my goddamn thoughts!
- You didn't do it, did you?
- No.
- Why not?
- He looks at me with such trust.
- How do I look at you?
- With bitterness.
It used to be trust.
At least you know my thoughts.
- Did you tell him?
- What do you think?
What do we do now?
- I guess I get an ultimatum.
- Is there any sense in this?
- In what?
- In you and me.
- That's up to you.
- No, it's up to you.
I don't see any point in it.
I wish I were wrong.
I don't feel anything anymore.
Neither do I.
The reason I didn't say anything to Sandy I knew he wouldn't believe me.
And I'd go into details.
I knew he'd come running to you, you'd tell him it was all true, and then you'd go to bed with him.
That sounds like what would happen.
- So?
- So?
Jonathan...
- I'll always be your friend.
- Jesus, Susan, I hope not.
It's going to be buggy.
It's the tropics, the jungle.
- Just cover yourself.
- I'll get eaten alive.
You've never camped out.
Isn't he being silly, Jonathan?
- You're a real city boy.
- How about the cot?
- We've got a sleeping bag.
- Are we sleeping on the ground?
- This knapsack's heavy.
- Why did you pack a pillowcase?
- Put it back.
- Isn't he a nut, Jonathan?
- Let me pack my things.
- I'm just trying to help...
- Jesus...
- Do you want her?
- I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
- Look at the pair on her.
- That schmuck's trying to keep up.
- They're always with those guys.
- He must be 60.
- He might have a heart attack.
You could save his life.
Get her number and fuck her.
You bastard...
- How's Susan?
- Couldn't be better.
I always said it:
You found yourself ajewel.
- Not bad, that one.
- You get more than your share.
- I'd marry if I found the right girl.
- Bullshit.
You and your actresses...
You got the deal, Doctor.
What can I say?
"Take your clothes off, I wanna check your capital gains."
- I just look.
- Sure you do.
Susan is plenty enough woman for one man.
Look at that.
- That's Sally Joyce.
- I saw her on TV.
I fucked her once.
We used to do her taxes.
- She's with another firm now.
- Why not say hello?
She wouldn't remember me.
She's a real ball-buster.
I've been through the mill with her kind.
You think a girl goes for you, but it's your money or your balls...
And your balls.
Women today are better hung than the men.
- I should have your problems.
- It used to be easier to get laid.
I don't fuck more than a dozen new girls a year now.
I may be too much of a perfectionist.
This last one came so close.
Good tits.
Not great.
Almost no ass at all, and that bothered me.
Sensational legs.
I'd settle for the legs, if she had two more inches here and three here.
- That took two years out of my life.
- You don't want a family?
Who needs it?
- Fucking can't be your life's work.
- Don't tell me what I can't do.
You're so well-off?
Susan's a very good homemaker.
Very efficient.
I come home, everything is in its place.
I like that.
It's tiring, a full day at the office, then the hospital for a few hours.
So it's nice when everything's in its place.
Martini, dinner, the kids.
We don't watch much TV.
We read aloud to each other.
We used to have more friends.
On weekends we might entertain a little, or go to see a friend.
Come into town, see a play or a good film.
It's not glamorous or anything.
There are other things than glamor.
- You have a long lifeline.
- I like that.
The way you run your nail across my...
- You're difficult to get along with.
- Me?
Bobbie...
- You always know your own mind.
- Right this minute, anyway.
You won't stop until you get what you want.
Let me see your hand.
- Well?
- You are built.
- Do you see that in my hand?
- Even your hand is built.
- You're a dirty old man.
- I'm a dirty young man.
- How old are you?
- What do you think?
19... 20?
- 21?
22...
- No.
- 24.
- You skipped 23.
- 23?
- No.
24?
25?
- 26?
27?
- You're getting warm.
28?
29.
I like going out with older women.
Are you married?
You don't want to get married?
I'd marry you in a minute.
Can you cook?
- Spaghetti.
- I can cook spaghetti.
- Good, you do the cooking.
- What'll you do?
- What would you like me to do?
- What would you like to do?
- I asked you first.
- I'm not gonna answer.
- Well...
I can sew.
- Not much of a marriage.
- Me cooking, you sewing.
- Wanna divorce?
I'll take every cent.
I didn't know I was marrying a gold-digger.
- You won't take pity on me?
- Only if you say you're sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- And you'll never do it again.
- And you'll always be a good boy.
- Yes, Mama.
- Do you like to be mothered?
- I like to be smothered by you.
What else would you like me to do to you?
Well, how do you like it?
- How do I like what?
- My... you know.
- What do I know?
- You know everything.
- I know you.
- And I know you.
Well, I almost came that time.
- Nurse?
- What is it, Mr. Weisenborn?
- Come in here a minute, please.
- Certainly.
Why, Mr. Weisenborn!
Most guys I know are pricks.
I don't know what they want.
I'll tell you.
They want the boodle.
But they ain't gonna get the boodle.
Because this kid here has got it.
You're pretty sure of yourself.
- You're a nice man.
- And you're a very lucky girl.
- You know something, Sam?
- What is it, sweetheart?
Would it be a mistake if we shacked up?
It's very difficult, Bobbie.
These last weeks we got on so well.
The idea...
I like you very much.
So much that this idea...
To be perfectly honest, it sounds very good to me.
Let's give it a couple of days to think about it.
It sounds like... very good.
Very, very...
Good.
Only, our eyes should be open.
We should know exactly what we're getting into.
I'm not asking you for marriage.
- As long as we both understand that.
- We do.
It's better to get it all out on the table, so later there can be no misunderstanding.
Many business deals have come to grief...
Okay...
You're a real prick, you know that?
Prick?
I could get serious about this girl.
She's a lot of fun to be with.
Just between the two of us, for the last year, I've been having...
A little trouble.
I wasn't worried, but still...
A little trouble with... myself.
...Getting hard.
It took a long time.
Girls today judge you very quickly.
So I had a real rough time a couple of times.
Some very nasty innuendos.
As I say, I wasn't too worried...
I won't lie to you, I was worried.
Then along comes Bobbie.
One look at the pair on her and I never doubted that I'd be okay again.
And I was.
With all our kidding, I don't mind telling you I had tears in my eyes.
She's really the one in the airline commercial?
You lucky son of a bitch.
I don't want to get in over my head.
I did that already.
And you have to be a real bastard.
I don't like being put in that position.
- What would you do?
- If she looks like she does on TV...
- Size 38, with a D cup.
- Looks aren't everything.
Believe me, looks are everything.
Maybe.
- I'm hungry.
- I'll get up.
- Why do we always eat so late?
- Because I work late.
- Why do you work at all?
- Brings in extra money.
- I make enough.
- You want me to quit?
I thought you were bored with it.
So quit.
- What would I do?
- What do other women do?
Have children.
Well, you asked me.
- What about my beer?
- We're all out.
- I really wanted a beer.
- Should I run to the corner?
- You're too tired.
- I don't mind.
- I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.
It's my fault.
I should have reminded you when I called.
I'm sorry.
You're more tired now than when you were working.
I'm in the house all day.
Did you get up at all?
What do you do?
When you're not on the phone?
- I'm not on the phone that much.
- It took 45 minutes to get through.
- I'll get the beer.
- I'll go.
- I thought you were too tired.
- I haven't been out all day.
Fresh air will do you good.
- Will you walk with me?
- Then I may as well go myself.
You wanna make love?
We haven't in a week.
Is it a week?
It's funny.
Susan and I do all the right things.
We undress in front of each other, spend 15 minutes on foreplay.
We do it in different rooms.
It's a seven-room house.
We do it when we feel like it.
We don't feel we always need to be passionate.
Necking can be more fun.
We're considerate of each other.
I had a tendency to be selfish.
But I don't do that now.
We try to be patient, and we are.
Gentle with each other.
Maybe it's not meant to be enjoyable with women you love.
Do you want to get laid?
Please.
Very nice.
I almost had it.
Right, Cindy?
- See that, Cindy?
- He was lucky.
- Bastard, that was out.
- Bullshit.
- We'll do it over, all right?
- All right.
Deuce!
You see that shot, Cindy?
Now we got some tennis.
- Game!
Luck, my ass!
- You want to take me on, Cindy?
- It's my turn.
- Come on, Bobbie, you're so awful.
You serve.
Very nice.
You play well.
Look, Sandy!
Terrific, Cindy.
She's racking me up, I'm not kidding.
Look at this. 40-love.
And I'm not taking it easy.
You and Lord Taylor's have to work out a trial separation.
The water was running.
What did you say?
You and Lord Taylor's have to work out a trial separation.
Look at the date.
Five months ago.
I'm sorry I cost you so much money.
I want to get married.
Are you tired of me, Jonathan?
The answer is yes.
You said, "Am I ever." I need more in life than this.
After a long bed hunt, you finally chose me.
Cindy's not a virgin either!
Is that what brought this on?
You must have a low opinion of me to think I'd do that to Sandy.
No, you wouldn't cheat on Sandy.
He spends half his life here.
You just had me screwing Cindy.
Am I screwing Sandy now?
I'm going too fast?
Your mind works like an IBM.
First Cindy, then Sandy.
How about Cindy and Sandy?
When I heard about your checkered past, I felt like a celibate.
- You made me tell.
- Sure, I twisted your arm.
- It got you hot!
- Something has to.
- You have such contempt for me.
- You worked hard for it.
It's yours.
- The way you paw me at parties.
- Now affection is contempt.
Everything upside down.
Feeling me up in public is not affection.
I know I'm doing a terrible job, but you're not helping me.
- I help you.
- I can do without your kind of help.
Can you really?
You'll do anything to ruin my day.
I got up today feeling so good.
You couldn't leave us alone.
We were doing so well.
It was great what we had.
It can't have a natural time span?
Affairs can't dissolve in a good way?
- I really don't see why.
- Do you want it over?
Why must it be one or the other?
I want you here where you belong!
- What about you?
- When I'm here, I'm here.
Or there.
No.
I'm a man-eater and a ball-buster...
I want to get married.
Where the fuck is my shoehorn?
This place is a mess!
You look like you fell out of bed!
You're in bed longer than a baby!
I sleep all day because I can't stand my life...
Now I'll fall in love with you all over again.
- Marry me, Jonathan.
Please.
- You're trying to kill me.
- Marriage isn't death.
- Why now?
Two years ago I slept 8 hours, a year ago it was 12.
- Soon it'll be 24.
- Are you trying to scare me?
- I need a life!
- Get ajob!
- I want you.
- I'm taken, by me!
Go out!
- Do something useful!
- You wouldn't let me work.
You throw a tantrum if I'm out when you call.
I'm out there in the jungle eight hours a day!
- You even tell me who to vote for.
- You want ajob?
I got it!
Fix up this pigsty!
You get a pretty good salary for testing this bed.
You want $50 extra?
Try vacuuming!
An extra 100?
Make this bed!
Open some windows!
It smells like a coffin in here!
You don't need me.
Why do you take this kind of abuse?
Walk out.
Please leave me.
- I'd almost marry you if you'd leave.
- Abuse?
I'm used to worse.
With all your carrying on, to me you're a gift.
So what's it gonna be?
- You sure know how to ruin things.
- Where does that leave us?
Is this an ultimatum?
Is this an ultimatum?
Answer me, you ball-busting bitch!
If it is, I'm gonna tell you what you can do with your ultimatum!
You can make this goddamned bed!
That's what you can do...
Clean these filthy sheets...!
- She's not ready.
- We're a little early.
- You're looking good, Cindy.
- Will Bobbie be long?
No...
- Do we have to go to this party?
- How about it, Cindy?
Where's the powder room?
I'm going, you do what you want.
Man, she's really something.
- I'm bored out of my mind.
- With that?
You must be kidding.
Do you have to go to this party?
- Stick around.
- No, it's better that I go.
I just did my hair.
I've got this at home.
How's your tennis game, Jonathan?
- We'll have to have a rematch.
- Any time.
Is she always that way?
Boy, is she competitive.
She is.
I find that attractive.
You know her problem?
She wants balls.
- She's all right.
- It's no criticism.
- I wish she were more feminine.
- She is a little masculine.
- She always demands her way.
- She's got a great body.
I have to give her everything she wants.
I wouldn't mind giving her something.
You got Bobbie.
I should have it that good.
I've never seen a body like Bobbie's.
She could do with more of what Cindy's got.
She's so passive.
I wouldn't mind Cindy lying still.
Her instructions in bed are like a drill.
I wouldn't mind a little of that.
If she remembers who's boss.
You wouldn't want to swap?
- Are you serious?
- It might liven things up.
- She can miss one party.
- What about Bobbie?
She's so mad at me she'll jump on you just for revenge.
- Seriously?
- She's in the bedroom.
If you're quiet, you can do it and she won't even know.
Give me a minute.
Tell Sandy it's time to leave.
I hope you dance better than you play tennis.
- Sandy won't mind.
- What's he got to do with it?
You're his girl.
He said it would be okay.
- What did Sandy say?
- That you and me... you know.
- And you had nothing to do with it?
- A little.
- A little or a lot?
- This much.
I'm surprised it took you this long.
- Sandy and I have to go to a party.
- Sandy's busy.
You can come around, alone, that's one thing.
I've been expecting that.
But you tell Sandy that if he lays one hand on that tub of lard, not to come home.
So you call me.
Jesus!
She's semi-comatose.
Send a resuscitation unit and an airway.
Be ready to give her an IV.
We'll put her in intensive care.
Bastard.
Very slick.
Very clever!
Well, it's not going to work, Bobbie!
JONATHAN FUERST PRESENTS
A JONATHAN FUERST PRODUCTION
BALLBUSTERS ON PARADE!
That's Bonnie, my first love.
She lived upstairs from us.
We exposed ourselves to each other at ten.
My mother caught us.
She washed my mouth out with soap.
I never got the connection.
Here's Emily, my first steady.
I never laid a hand on her.
Mildred I think this one's name was.
She followed me around at school.
The fellas kidded me about her.
I told her to stop or I'd beat her up.
She dropped her drawers and shoved her ass at me.
So I got my first sight of ass at 12.
Marcia, 13½.
I kissed her at a spin-the-bottle party.
This was Rosalie.
She looked just like Elizabeth Taylor.
I had a crush on her and I never went near her.
In those days, we had illusions.
Here's Charlotte.
Not much on looks, but great tits for 15.
That's Lenny Hartman's sister.
My first French kiss, 16 years old.
Here's Gloria, the best-built girl in school.
I took her to the zoo and copped a cheap feel.
Here's Gwen.
I tried for a year to get her to put out, but she was saving me for marriage.
Every guy at Evander got into her pants except me.
Here's my first...
No, that's not it.
Here's Eileen, my very first fuck.
She was a modern dancer.
Great body, but a waste.
Frigid.
Here's Nancy.
Sweet kid.
She went into biology.
Very frigid.
Here's Bobbie!
My wife.
The fastest tits in the West.
And king of the ball-busters.
Conned me into marriage.
Now she's killing me with alimony.
How did this one get in here?
This is my little girl, Wendy.
"Princess," I call her.
Isn't she a dreamboat?
Here's a real cunt.
I forget her name.
A Nazi.
I banged her in Berlin.
This I went with for a few months.
Banged her on a yacht race.
This slob I went with a year.
I got sick of her and couldn't get it up.
Can't remember her name.
This was my Jap in the sack.
I heard Oriental girls were different.
Not in America, they're not.
Here's a 16-year-old I gave $20 to one night when I was drunk.
Maybe you know her, Jennifer.
She gave me a dose.
That's all, folks.
What are you crying for?
It's not a Lassie movie.
Sorry about that.
- So, what else is new?
- I don't see anybody anymore.
- Neither do we.
- You've got each other.
- I thought she was your daughter.
- She's older than I in many ways.
She knows worlds I can't even begin to touch yet.
- I found out who I am.
- You're in big trouble.
Same old Jonathan.
Let me talk to her about you.
Talk to her about me?
I'm forty, she's nine.
- You just don't get it.
- I've been getting it a long time.
What's the point?
You found a good piece of ass.
God bless you.
You're my friend, I'm happy for you, for as long as it lasts.
You deserve to be happy.
I mean it.
Why fight?
All those games.
You don't need them, Jonathan.
I've played more games than anyone.
The obedient son, bright student, the cocksman's game.
The good husband and father game.
Games don't impress Jennifer.
Just life, just love.
I don't want to argue, so let's just agree to disagree, okay?
Jennifer knows more at 18 than Susan knows to this day.
- You found yourself a real jewel.
- She's my love teacher.
- Finally got it up, huh?
- You give off such bad vibrations.
I love you, but you're a schmuck.
You were always young, open.
Maybe schmuckiness is what you need to stay young and open.
Don't listen to me.
You're doing great and I'm making money.
You can find what I found.
Don't make me insult you.
Women...
All ball-busters, right?
When you think of what he has to dip into, any guy with a conscience has a right to turn soft.
- Am I right, Louise?
- You're always right, lover.
I don't think we're going to have any trouble tonight.
- Are you sure?
- Want to bet?
- How much?
- The sky's the limit.
Goddammit!
- You're doing it all wrong.
- I'm doing it like always.
You never said that before.
"The sky's the limit."
- Never.
- What do I say?
You forgot, didn't you?
I say a hundred.
- Okay.
- Itjust came out.
I just want it right.
I don't think we're going to have any trouble tonight.
- Are you sure?
- Wanna bet?
- How much?
- A hundred.
- You sound pretty sure.
- With your kind, why shouldn't I be?
What kind of man am I?
A real man.
A kind man.
- I'm not kind.
- I don't mean weak, like many men.
I mean the kindness that comes from an inner power so strong that every act is more proof of that power.
Women resent that.
That's why they try to cut you down.
Because your knowledge is so true that it exposes the lies which every scheming one of them lives by.
It takes a true woman to understand the purest form of love:
To love a man who denies himself to her.
A man who inspires worship.
Because he has no need for any woman.
Because he has himself.
And who is better, more beautiful, more powerful, more perfect...
You're getting hard...
More masculine, extraordinary.
More robust...
It's rising.
More virile, domineering.
More irresistible...
It's up, in the air.

Right!
You can get up now.
Thank you very much.
You know, you really ought to keep this thing of yours under better control.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
He's only a mark three servo-robot.
He's not very bright.
What happened in here?
Well, I only wish I knew.
Something attacked this place late last night.
Is it your place?
No.
No, it belonged to two colonists.
Colonists?
According to Earth control, this planet hasn't been colonized.
It appears they we wrong, doesn't it?
Mmm.
May I ask what you're doing here?
IMC
- Interplanetary Mining Corporation.
We're doing a mineral survey.
How long have you been here?
We've just arrived.
Colonists, eh?
Well now we've got trouble.
Why?
Presumably you'll be moving to another planet?
Well, it isn't up to me.
They'll have to sort that out at Earth control.
Erm, what are you up to?
Erm, I, err, I'm, just making a few tests.
Are you some kind of scientist?
I'm every kind of scientist.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Look, I'm... on my way back to my spaceship.
How about you coming back with me?
Well, I'd like to, but erm...
I haven't really got the time.
In any case, I ought to get back and tell the colonists that you've arrived.
You have got plenty of time, you know.
Yes, well, I suppose I could spare you a few moments.
You know, it's lucky no one was hurt.
What gave you that impression?
Well, surely, didn't you say...?
No, I didn't say anything of the sort.
The two colonists that were living here have been killed!
Two people killed?
That's right.
Erm, we'd better get moving.
What are you doing?
Programming Charlie to go back to the spaceship.
Well, how far is your ship?
Only a few kilometers.
So no one from your colony survived?
The lizards killed most of them.
The primitives finished off the rest.
The primitives attacked you as well?
Well, after the lizards there were only a few survivors.
When the primitives saw how weak we were, they... they turned on us.
They killed my family, m... my friends - everyone!
Your primitives don't seem too hostile?
Mmm so did we - till we were defenseless.
Maybe now Robert Ashe will listen to me!
We must move on to another planet.
You're not just gonna give up, are you?
After all the work you've done here?
Well, there's a time to cut your losses!
We can't even grow our own food.
I'm sure the Doctor will be able to help you.
What Doctor?
They turned up out of nowhere - this girl and a man.
Who are they?
Where do they come from?
Well?
We don't really know much about you, you know?
We told you!
We're explorers!
But just the two of you?
With a spaceship all to yourselves?
That's right.
You work for the government?
No, we don't work for anybody, we just...
What are you doing?
They killed the survivors!
All of them!
Get out of the way!
He'll kill you.
All right.
Put that gun down!
Y... y... you don't understand!
You... you can't trust them!
I said put that gun down!
We have a truce with the primitives!
We mustn't be the first to break it!
We have a truce all right, Robert.
But only because you give them our food.
You need rest.
Show him where he can lie down, somebody.
One day you'll wish you'd listened to me.
Wait outside
- I will bring you food.
Robert, we can't keep feeding these savages!
We've got to keep on good terms with them - for our own safety!
While I'm leader of this colony, we'll treat the primitives in my way.
Even if we starve?
Get out of my way, David.
He's right, you know.
You ought to listen to him - he is your leader, isn't he?
Maybe that's been my mistake.
The TARDIS - it's gone!
I've just got the first survey results.
Well?
The computer predicts there's enough duralinium here to build one million living units on Earth.
Excellent.
The thing I can't understand is why this planet was assigned for colonization!
Does it matter?
Look
- Caldwell's found us a colonist.
Huh, I wonder why he's wearing fancy dress?
All colonists are eccentric, Morgan, otherwise they wouldn't be colonists.
Hmm, and what are you going to say to this "eccentric"?
The usual story - that we've just arrived and we're surprised and shocked that the place has been colonized.
Suppose they don't believe us?
It doesn't matter what they believe - they won't be here for long.
Please?
Thank you.
And would you mind staying in here, please, while I let my colleagues know?
Yes, of course.
Erm, look make yourself at home.
That's the entertainment console.
I shan't be long.
Right.
I've just brought a man in here.
So I saw.
He was at the wrecked dome and he tells me that two people have been killed!
Now, he's only supposed to scare people off - not slaughter them!
Do you know about this, Morgan?
Yes - it was an accident.
What do you mean - "accident"?
!
They found me!
They started shooting!
What was I supposed to do - let myself get killed?
You acted very foolishly, Morgan.
You should never have let yourself be seen.
Foolishly?
Dent, is that all you've got to say?
Believe me, Caldwell, I regret this just as much as you do.
Oh, he...
Look, there's no point in arguing about it!
Besides, once these colonists have left this planet, there will be no more "regrettable incidents".
Look, two people are dead and I want to know...
You may care to look at this report...
I want to know for certain...
Look at it!
It's going to make you rich.
This planet has enough duralinium to double the company's profits next year.
Your bonus will be big enough to retire on.
If we get rid of the colonists.
Yes, well all right, we can go ahead.
But there's no need for anyone else to be killed.
I think I'll have a chat with this colonist of yours.
Be interesting to know the state of morale.
Scientists have turned to new means for providing accommodation for our ever-increasing population.
These floating islands, rising to three hundred stories, will make living space for five hundred million people.
I'm Captain Dent - in charge of this survey team.
A great pleasure to meet you, Mister?
Not Mister
- Doctor.
How do you do?
Well Doctor, it seems a most unfortunate mistake has been made.
I'm glad you admit it.
I take it you're preparing to leave at once.
It's not necessarily out mistake.
As things have turned out, this planet doesn't seem very suitable for colonization.
Oh, why?
I understand it's still infested with hostile animal life?
The hostile animals - if they exist - can be found and destroyed, sir.
I admire your optimism.
Is it shared by the other colonists?
Hmm!
I'm not a colonist.
I'm a visitor.
I see, then you're not really concerned?
I'm very much concerned!
The colonists shouldn't be here.
My corporation has been assigned the mineral rights on this planet.
Our preliminary survey indicates a... very rich concentration of duralinium.
You know how the Earth needs that mineral.
Earth - or your corporation's profits?
What's good for IMC is good for Earth.
There are... one hundred thousand million people back on Earth and they desperately need all the minerals we can find.
What those people need my dear sir, are new worlds to live in like this one!
Worlds where they can live like human beings - not battery hens!
That's not my concern.
Minerals are needed - it's my job to find them.
Even if it means turning this planet into a slagheap?
I can see we're on opposite sides, Doctor.
Perhaps.
Your health, sir.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I've lost some very valuable equipment.
Perhaps one of your colleagues told you about it - a tall blue box.
He's probably enquiring about it now.
I'll go and check.
If you wouldn't mind waiting here, Doctor?
I'll detail someone to escort you back to your friends.
Air-sey prediction on section four-eight.
Where's Caldwell?
Oh, he's chasing up some lost equipment for your colonist friend.
He isn't a colonist... or at least, so he said.
Then what's he doing here?
I don't know, but I think he's dangerous.
Do you think he's been sent by Earth government, checking up on us?
Perhaps.
What do you propose to do about it?
You're going to take him back to his colonist friends.
You're not serious?
When Caldwell found him, he was investigating the wrecked dome.
Well?
If he were found in the ruins, it would be obvious the monsters had returned and killed him.
Leave it to me.
Oh by the way, you, erm... you will send the necessary machine?
It'll be waiting when you arrive.
Whatever that Doctor's lost, no one seems to have found it.
You'd better break the sad news, Morgan.
Who the blazes are you?
!
My name's Morgan.
Well, why was this door locked?
!
Was it?
Must have jammed.
I've been sent to take you back to your friends.
Well, where is the man who brought me here - and what happened to Captain Dent?
I'm sorry, the Captain's busy.
You've been handed over to me.
Oh, I see.
Well I take it that your Captain is coming to see Ashe?
Ashe?
The leader of the colonists!
Oh, yes, yes!
I'm to arrange the meeting.
How very formal.
Well shall we go?
After you... sir.
By the way Captain Dent wanted you to show me the dome that was wrecked.
Why?
Well, we're just as interested in these creatures as you are.
Who knows - they might attack us too?
Yes, that's a point.
Get out of the way!
No!
Let's drive slowly, shall we?
Can you get these ready, please Jo?
Yes, of course.
What do I do with them?
Just add water and serve... but be careful.
What do they taste like?
All exactly the same!
Hello, Mary, my dear.
How's it going?
She's getting on very well.
Have you seen the Doctor yet?
No, I haven't.
He's been gone a long time.
Now, don't worry.
If he's not back soon, I'll go and look for him.
Have you seen Winton?
Mmm, he's showing Norton round the dome.
Well, when you see him, tell him I want him.
I'll be in my quarters.
Norton's made a remarkable recovery.
This is our power supply junction box.
What's he doing?
Don't worry about him.
He's my assistant.
See what I mean?
He gets the right one every time.
Seems to know what's in my mind.
Weren't your primitives like that?
No.
We weren't so friendly with ours.
Where do you get your power from?
Well we tap the ships nuclear generator and then beam the power through to the domes, as they need it.
More trouble?
Naturally.
This stuff should have been junked years ago.
Don't worry, you'll manage.
You always do!
Must be that sunny nature of yours.
Thanks very much.
Well, shall we go back to the dining area?
Thanks!
Got you working, I see?
And what time's dinner?
Not long now.
How are you feeling?
Oh, much better.
Still hungry.
What do you think of our colony?
I think you're managing very well.
You mean considering how old the equipment is?
Well, some of it is getting on a bit.
Yes...
Was your colony better equipped?
Yes.
Didn't do us much good.
Err, that junction box of yours - it, err, looks dangerous.
That's what Jim Holden says.
But he manages to keep it going.
Is he your only electrician engineer?
He's the only one we could get to come with us.
We'd be lost without him.
Oh, my father was looking for you.
He said he'd be in his quarters.
Oh.
Err, look, can you look after yourself.
Well, yes, I...
I feel a bit tired.
I'll just go and lie down until dinner.
All right.
See you then.
I'm looking forward to this.
After a year of living off roots, you don't know how good that looks.
There.
That should hold it for another few days.
Put the tools away, will you?
I just want to check the circuit relay.
Are you crazy?
What do you think you're doing?
No!
Dinner's ready, father.
Oh.
Oh, here we go again.
Don't worry, Jim'll fix it.
You've got to come with me!
Don't worry.
It was only a power failure.
No, you don't understand.
Please, come with me!
What?
What happened?
I was just coming by.
I saw it all!
He didn't have a chance.
The primitive killed him?
He... he went for me too.
I grabbed a spanner and hit him.
It was self-defense
- I had to.
I don't understand it.
They were such friends.
They're all the same - treacherous.
They get your confidence and then they turn on you.
The relay circuits have been destroyed!
Your man must have caught him messing about with the controls.
But unless we get this repaired, the whole colony will come to a standstill!
He was the only one who could fix it!
Warp this message direct to IMC headquarters, Earth.
Put it on scramble.
Code two-nine-three.
Survey ship four-three to IMC headquarters, Earth.
Captain Dent speaking.
Preliminary survey confirms rich deposits of duralinium on this planet.
Complications occasioned by previously arrived colonists can be dealt with.
I've been checking out the survey results.
Well?
Well, you were right.
This is a big strike.
This biggest we've ever had... and I want you to radio Earth your requirements for radio equipment.
Right.
What about the colonists?
Oh, they'll have left by the time it gets here.
You can't be sure.
That Doctor seemed pretty determined, didn't he?
He can be dealt with.
How do you mean?
Where is he?
On his way back to his friends - with Morgan.
You're the Captain, why didn't you go?
He isn't going to get back to his friends, is he?
Morgan's completely reliable.
Yes, that's what I mean.
Where do you think you're going?
Look, scaring people is one thing and I don't my lying to Earth government but murder...
Stay where you are.
Now, get out of my way!
May I remind you that I am Captain of this ship and we are on an alien planet.
If you strike me, I can have you executed without trial.
We can persuade these people to go.
We've done it before.
That man you brought here was some kind of government spy.
He was suspicious.
Well, it's still murder!
Back on Earth, tens of thousands of people die every day - traffic accidents, suicides, pollution, epidemics...
They are not the same thing and you know it!
Caldwell!
The exploitation of this planet can make us both rich.
You can enjoy luxury for the rest of your life if you go along with the corporation.
I could exist without IMC.
You get on our blacklist, you'll never work again - for anyone.
You're up to your ears in debt
- I checked.
Don't worry about the colonists, Caldwell.
Just get on with your work - and let Morgan get on with his.
Well, here are are.
Though I must say I still don't quite understand why you wanted to come here.
I wanted to see how much damage these creatures can cause.
Well, you'll find some claw marks over there and some more over there.
And you say these same marks were found on the two colonists?
That's right.
Oh yes, it was all very efficiently done.
What do you mean?
Well, I think the whole thing was faked by somebody who wanted to frighten the colonists away.
These claw marks, I mean, something made them.
Yes, they could have been faked by some sort of mechanical device.
You mean with something like this?
Yes, yes - exactly like this!
By the time they've found you, the monster will have claimed another victim.
Keep back!
Purely business, you understand.
Nothing personal...
I can't pull it up...
Darn, darn, the wrong string...
HANDICAPPED FUTURE
THE SITUATION OF PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED CHILDREN
IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
There, now you almost have it, come on.
Real tight, tight Susanne, real tight!
There are a total of four and a half million handicapped people living in the FRG, of those, four hundred and seventy thousand are school age children.
According to surveys, the majority of the German citizens... don'twant to live with them.
How are they living?
And where?
And what do we know about them?
Which opportunities does society give them?
Or is our behavior towards them perhaps an additional handicap?
Dagmar, how old are you?
- Six.
And you go to school already?
- Preschool.
Well, I don't play too much, at home, a little bit.
But during sport in the afternoon...
I'm bored, and then I paint... or play something.
- Do you think about things a lot, or what do you do, for example in the afternoons?
In the afternoon, well, then I just imagine things for myself.
What do you imagine?
Well, something about...
also with Indians.
And... aboutwalking... if I could walk...
Yes, whatwould you do then?
What do you imagine?
Well, I would bring Richard down to school.
You would bring Richard to school?
- Yes.
Downstairs.
Yes.
- And then I would go walk up the stairs.
Because I'm afraid to use the elevator, alone.
So you would walk up the stairs?
And what else would you do?
- Well, go inside, then either paint something... or walk around, or listen to records.
Well,
I don't exactly know...
Do you dream a lot?
- Well, when my eyes are open, yes.
But afterwards, around five, I run out of ideas to dream of.
So you don't dream much at night, but during the day?
Yes but... yes but then...
I can't think of anything to dream of.
I don't notice it anyway.
And what do you dream about during the day?
- During the day?
Well, what I said before, from the Indians and such.
Do you have friends here?
- Yes.
Who, what's his name?
- I think his name is Thomas.
What makes him different from you?
- Hm...
He doesn't have any arms or feet.
Is what he has bad, or?
- Yes, it's bad.
- Yes, they're disadvantaged.
But for you, he is just as much of a friend as someone whose arms are long, or is he someone completely different for you?
- It's hard to say, but... he looks different.
But actually he's the same, except for the arms, the short ones...
- What do you say?
He... he is almost the same as us, only at birth he became different.
- Do you think that that's bad, or that it gives your friendship a different meaning?
Yes, it's bad, because they can't eat so well.
I see.
- And they can't play well.
Have you had a lot of interaction with physically handicapped children?
Yes.
- Can you tell us something about it, about your thoughts?
Yes, I even sit next to one at school.
And she is quite good... at gymnastics.
But our teacher always does things, gives us things to do, where she can't participate.
Sometimes yes, but not most of the time.
And she is very, very good atwriting.
If I want to, I can write too, but I don'twrite as well.
And dressing, well, she needs to be helped a bit.
And otherwise... she is quite good, actually roundabout.
Are you her friend?
- Yes.
In 1968, the Pfennigparade established a community facility here in Munich, where for the first time an attemptwas made to house physically handicapped people... together with the healthy members of their families in specially furnished apartments... instead of isolating them in institutional homes, as was up until then the case.
The complex includes an elementary school and a secondary school, medical facilities, a gym... and a workplace with computer facilities from the Siemens Company.
A second such house is being constructed adjacent to the first.
Gymnastic exercises are done here to train balance.
Then without arms, the perception of the body and of balance are completely different than we know it.
Turn around...
Mhm...
You stay seated, OK...
Then I have to jump off...
- That's very good.
But I never did it before, did I?
- Oh, I think you did.
Uh-uh...
- When you were smaller,
I'm sure you did it.
- Oh yes, in... in the Kapuziner Street.
We try to stimulate the children at least as much as in other schools, actually I try to stimulate them even more, so that they are not later... employed on the basis of pity, but on the basis of their qualifications, and therefore have a better chance... to somehow enter into an occupation.
And we have to see to it... that all of the children learn an occupation, because they can't just rely on pity... their...
life long.
Hey, stop it... you jerk.
Dagmar, why would you like to go to America?
Because I want to see the Indians.
- Why the Indians?
Because I want to see them in real life.
- Aha.
Where have you seen them before?
In movies.
- And what did they do?
They captured Shatterhand.
- Really?
And the Sohn from Winnetou too.
- Imagine that, imagine that...
And what happened then?
Um... then there was the time... where Winnetou was supposed to die.
- Aha.
Yes and... and uh... who is your favorite Indian?
I would say Winnetou.
- Really?
And what else do you want to do in America besides look at Indians?
Hm...
Whatwould you do if you saw an Indian?
Not much.
- Not much?
What do you think that the Indians look like today?
What I think?
Yes, what you think.
- They still have a headdress and feathers, but they are just dressed like the white people.
Aha!
So...
Today we have...
I have brought you some more nice things.
No, he, he is a, he's "Kalbste", or his name is something like that "Kalbe" or something...
Many practical things are difficult to access... for the children due to their restricted freedom of movement.
Therefore there is a class especially for general knowledge in the school.
When asked, where the potatoes come from, one girl said:
From the potato mine.
They have to first learn what a pine cone, a horseshoe or a bank note is.
Oh, it's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the tip of my tongue...
That's a pine cone, a fir cone.
- Oh yes!
Ho... ho... horseshoe from a horse!
Wow, Günter is right.
- I knew that too.
You knew that?
- That's what I meant... you have to...
Give it to me, I know where to put it!
- Well, then!
That, that has to go down there on the feet, like that.
Like that...
And then you heat it up and it gets welded, they weld it, and then something gets put on it, and when it's finished, then they put it, they put it, uh, down someplace,
and then they put it, on the hands, and, I mean on the horses, over them, but actually, that hurts them... to walk around barefoot...
Good!
Do you think that that is a hundred mark bill?
That... that... yes...
Is this a hundred mark bill?
- Yes!
And can you buy something with it?
- Not, no.
No, you can only buy something with it in English.
- Only in English?
Or in Africa, you can do it there...
- In Africa?
Do you think, that that...
Justwho is that there?
Do you think that this is our President?
Yes.
- Yes?
Yes, that's him.
Look, he has a round face!
He isn't for real!
- I have another one here, what could that be?
A five hundred, a five hundred!
A six hundred!
- Whatwas that?
A six hundred.
- Hundreds of?
- Marks.
Is that so, you think that that is so much money...
Can you tell us what you do to take Monika out in public?
Yes, first of all, we go shopping with her, besides thatwe take her wherever we go, we drive up to the mountains... or to the lakes with her or take her into restaurants for lunch.
And above all, we maintain... contact to families... that have children with normal limbs so that she grows up amongst normal people.
Now she's going again, uh, recently to a swimming course and uh, they were also in a skiing course, Moni and Hansi... and Helma, three of the children from the house, the other children didn't participate in the ski course.
Well, uh, how do people react if you ski without poles, what do the people say to you then?
Mostly the small children around seven or six, they come over and ask, for example, why don'twe have any poles and such.
And then we stand up for ourselves and just say that that's the way it is... and try to get rid of them.
Because they just bother us.
Can you tell us a little bit more about the misconduct of outsiders?
Yes, especially when we go for a walk or even in a shop, the people stare.
I think it's more the older ones, the oldest generation even, like around sixty or seventy, not the forty year olds, and that is of course always very painful.
Yesterday I was, for example, taking a walk with the two of them.
They didn't notice that Monika didn't have any arms... because she was wearing al little cape, but Andrea was wearing a cape too... but she had her arms out.
And I could notice... that the people were constantly staring at Andrea, although Andrea... is really such a nice, healthy girl.
Well, and maybe they think that Monika can't do anything,
I know that from one of our neighbors, who has often been asked what Monika does all day long.
And she always said that she can do this and that and whatever.
People maybe have the idea that the children sit around the apartment... and can't play nor eat nor write.
So, does anyone need anything else?
OK, the first self-portrait is hanging on the wall.
Who did that?
Rudi?
- Shh, now we've hung it up.
Afterwards we'll think aboutwho it is...
Mrs. Gartenberg, what should I paint now, I'm finished with my picture.
Oh, I've forgotten my hair.
Do you remember that we drew ourselves... already once last year?
- Mhm.
- The carnival picture?
Yes?
How did you draw yourself there?
Today's picture is completely different.
In that picture I have, I have a very, I drew a very colorful patchwork skirt.
Yes and how did you look, how did you draw yourself?
I think that this picture is very different from last year's picture.
I've painted it a bit more clearly now, and the face,
I've done that very differently, and I've made the hair very messy.
Mhm.
Well the greatest difference to last year, is that it is more differentiated.
Last year she drew herself more babyish, but with normally developed limbs and she didn't leave out her toes.
In the meantime, she is more conscious about her type of handicap... and the toes have taken on a greater importance.
The first self-portrait is hanging, everybody look here now!
- Nice.
Who knows who this is?
- I...
I...
I know it...
Who is it, Robert?
- Rudi.
Rudi, what do you think is very characteristic of yourself?
- The hands.
Well, what is it especially that you notice there?
Well, I only have three fingers on one hand and four on the other.
Exactly.
That's how I would have recognized you too, right.
Good.
Gitti, look at me.
Listen, you painted pictures of yourselves today in art right?
This girl painted a picture of herself... and then wanted the finished picture back so that she could paint in some tears...
Do you like it?
- Not bad.
- You think it's not bad.
Do you think that the picture looks like you?
Yes?
The face is pink, I can see that, yes.
And brown eyes, that's right too, butwhat is the blue there?
Those are the tears.
- Oh, those are the tears.
First you gave me the picture without the blue.
Do you remember?
And then you wanted it back, right?
Why did you paint tears on it?
- I don't know.
Why did you paint tears on it?
Is there a reason?
When you go away from home, then you cry sometimes.
Did you go away from home recently?
Were you home on the weekend?
- Mmh...
- No, not.
Were you thinking about it?
I have some of the pictures from the children here, from some of the children... here in front of me, where a big problem is noticeable, namely the problem of isolation, that the children feel of course.
For example here, this picture, this is from an eleven year old girl.
She draws herself down here, incidentally not handicapped, but rather completely healthy, but isolated from... these are three fish here, from life around her, around which she draws a circle to encapsulate it.
And I have... a very interesting picture here... from a ten year old boy, he draws himself, well not himself, but a snake behind bars, in prison.
And he told me, when I asked him what the meaning was, he said:
Well, that is a boy that the snake just gave birth to.
And the bars in front show how he feels.
He just feels as if he is imprisoned through his physical handicap... and he feels isolated from the other playmates, from the environment.
And the same child painted here, as well, a prison in the rocky overhang, this here should depict a rocky overhang, and this is the prison, and there's nothing other than that on the picture except his name, Robert.
His name, Robert is up here.
It is always the same image... that is communicated by the children, the isolation, the loneliness.
Hey Bodo, wait, catch me.
Bodo, too bad that I have this apparatus on, because if I didn't I could show you my handstand.
Yeah?
Oh, too bad.
No, thatwon'twork, I can't.
Or should I try it with the apparatus...
itworks, no, it doesn't... uah...
The problem of isolation is not terribly noticeable on the playground.
The question remains, if the construction of the community facility... can eliminate the isolation at all.
How old are you, Kurti?
- I'm ten now.
Ten years old, yes.
He turned ten in August.
- On August twenty-first.
And how is it here, how do your pals treat you?
Well, none of my pals are here.
- Badly, from those his own age.
Only from the little ones, from the little ones, the second, third grade, it's alright with them.
With those... who are in his class, they don't accept him at all.
They call him the little mashed guy, or the electronic dwarf... and give him other such names.
And that makes me angry.
He comes home namely often during the week and tells me about these things.
And it makes me angry.
- Do you go out, for example, with Kurti... maybe to a restaurant?
- Oh, I haven't done that often.
Why not?
- Well, I'd rather avoid the excitement.
I'm a nervous wreck... and I just can't take it, it's too much excitement, so if I can avoid it, I avoid it.
And why do you do that?
- Well, like I said, the excitement, the, the, the staring, the whispering.
You notice thatwhen you're sitting at a table... and the whole restaurant is staring at you.
And then they whisper and gossip and you know exactly why.
That upsets me.
Then I have to get up and go.
So I don't go there in the first place.
I'll say, "Let's go for a walk this afternoon, today is a lovely day", but he rejects it every time... because he says, "no", he says to me, "No Mama, I won't go with you... because you get yourself much too upset".
He goes with his sister and with his brother.
He goes with them, but not with me.
Because he wants to keep me from getting upset, he understands that, you know.
So he doesn't...
With me he doesn't go anywhere.
- Do you suffer as a result?
Yes... terribly, terribly, I'm already emotionally distressed.
Emotionally I'm... it's ruined me.
Emotionally it has brought me... to my wit's end, the way they react, the...
So, when you're out with Kurt in the department store, for example?
Well of course they could, and there are some, if they had enough tact, then they do it too, but some of them, they have none whatsoever.
And how is that situation?
- How the situation is?
First of all, they stare at you directly, and then they say something stupid to you.
Some of them come to you with the stupidest things.
They say something dumb.
Well, is that a Thalidomide child and why did you take that stuff, that's what I have to listen to.
I didn't take anything while I was pregnant and this child will blame you some day... and so on, that's the kind of thing you have to listen to.
- In front of Kurt?
In front of Kurt.
They say it in front of Kurt.
Of course they say it.
Just don't listen to them. - "Don't listen to them"...
Of course I don't listen to them.
I have to plug my ears shut outside.
Well and then...
- What about during the birth?
- During the birth?
How he was born?
Well, I didn't see him at all.
They didn't show him to me at all.
They only told me briefly, "The child is not properly developed."
I couldn't imagine what they meant.
Then, they took him away from the clinic.
And then he stayed ten weeks long, until he was there every day, in the Lachner Institutional Home, and then I said, now I'll just try to see if I can take the child myself.
The treatment will be quite difficult, then you can still do it.
But everything went just marvellously, just marvellously.
And then the winter came...
- And why were you so shocked?
When I picked the child up from the children's clinic to take him home, and I hadn't seen him once before then, and I was all alone, abandoned, completely alone, and then... you should take the child out of the baby carriage, and you should unbundle it,
and you should look at it or not, and I thought hard, should you or shouldn't you, but there was no other choice.
I can't leave it in the baby carriage the whole year long.
I have to take it out.
Then I took it out and unbundled it on the couch... in the living room, and I saw what happened to him.
Without anyone telling me anything before or showing me the child.
I hadn't seen the child before and itwas a terrible shock.
And then I was happy that itwas winter, now the child can lie in the baby carriage, now you can cover it up, now nobody can sie anything, but then, when the spring came and the child, then itwas,
then you can't cover it up to its neck.
Did you try to hide him?
- Yes, I did,
I never took him out.
I only had him in the bedroom, towards the window, and then there was the social worker, she came to visit me... every two weeks, she looked after me very well.
And what about now?
Do you still try to hide Kurt?
Well, of course if I have to take him someplace, then I am terribly excited, shopping, because of the way... the people stare and whisper.
Do you like to go on walks with your mother... or to a department store or something?
Alone, yes.
I once went alone to Rewe.
He goes alone to Rewe...
- But with Mama, well... first of all, it's a long way if I have to walk, and second,
I don't like to go with the stroller because the people stare and think,
"Oh!
Such a big lad sitting in a stroller..."
He sits in a baby carriage and then they stare, right. ...and they stare.
And if I walk, then they can see it...
then they can see with their own eyes... that I can walk.
- And then they once said, aren't you ashamed, such a big lad like you sitting in a baby carriage?
Thatwas in wintertime and he was covered, they didn't see the legs, and someone said these dumb things to us in passing.
Aren't you ashamed such a big lad and you let yourself be pushed in a baby carriage.
He was shocked.
He pulled back his head and closed his eyes, he was so shocked atwhat the man had said.
And I thought to myself, my God, what a stupid idiot, I thought, if you only knew why, you wouldn't be asking me.
I can'twear a sign... around my neck that explains why.
And that's why, if I can, I just avoid going out with him.
Mrs Hennes, can you tell us a little bit about Dagmar?
Yes, Dagmar was born with a double femur fracture... and was brought directly to the clinic, to the respective children's clinic.
And Dagmar came home, quite a while ago, when she was two and a half or almost three, and was completely frightened, spoke very little, was afraid of strangers and screamed during the night without any apparent reason,
and it cost my husband and I quite a lot of patience and effort... to slowly explain to the child that itwas now in an environment... where itwouldn't have any more pain, where she would be cared for gently,
where she would also be loved... and not only tended to, which was also very important.
We told both children, Richard and Dagmar, as soon as they were consciously aware of their handicap, immediately whatwas wrong with them, how the chances are, so that they were able to learn quickly to live with their handicap.
Especially in order... to give them a positive outlook on life, so that they learn to get around in spite of their handicap.
They have family duties, they help me, they wash the dishes by themselves, it's possible here, dry them and help clean up, they keep their rooms tidy, and we think that it is absolutely necessary that they have duties... and responsibilities within the family,
because, if you don't demand anything of them, then I would say that you would raise them to be apathy in a wheelchair.
We have just spoken about the handicapped environment.
It seems... as if the handicapped practically belong to a group.
Yes, it shouldn't be like that.
The illness should be, in my opinion, treated as a secondary matter.
Moreso, because the illness in itself... well, it debilitates one, in that it isn't possible to run so quickly or that you have to take care of your health more than others, perhaps, but I think that is completely secondary,
because a physically handicapped person, in my opinion, is just as capable atwork or in life as anyone else.
And that should... and the education should be done accordingly, should lead there.
And what is being done wrong here?
It's miserable for the physically handicapped in other places as well...
But I think that it's the same everywhere, because I was in another institution, and I'd say itwas almostworse there.
Ludwig, can you tell us about this film project, please?
Yes, we had the idea, rather, I had the idea and suggested it to the others, thatwe should steal something from Wertkauf or some other department store... and simultaneously film it.
And we wanted to show... how people react to the physically handicapped.
Like, that they aren't considerate, at best stare at them and say:
Look at the poor fools, or other stupid comments.
And why didn't you make the film?
Well, I can't film and steal at the same time, and the others wouldn't do it.
Well, even if the people had noticed our little theft action,
I don't think that they would come over to us and say, what did you take there or something.
They are constantly surrounded by an invisible barrier, and they have to somehow overcome themselves... before they can speak with us at all.
And I think, that with cheaper things that could be stolen, they would, should they notice, disregard it completely.
With more expensive things, they would get caught up... in a moral dilemma with themselves.
Pity might play a role, but it's not only pity.
They just don't know enough about us or they think thatwe're abnormal.
Since we're always kept in institutions.
That's why we seem abnormal, because it's so seldom thatwe get out.
It's like when the crazies are on leave.
"Why don't you address the chemical factory that sold Thalidomide... without having tested it beforehand.
Here's where the real guilty ones are, for whom the taxpayers have to fork over money for now.
Besides:
Euthanasia would be a blessing for the poor creatures that have been affected, they would be released from their suffering... that can not be considered a life worth living.
A friend of humanity."
What do you think about that?
- A great friend of humanity...
How does that have anything to do with being a friend of humanity... if you murder another human being...
or kill them in a humane fashion.
...a release, right.
Have you come up against something like this often, an attitude like this?
Yes, oftentimes.
Hansi has a good example, he was there...
- Yes, thatwas at Sonnenzug,
Georg had a respirator, but some difficulties.
And there was a paramedic standing in the doorway and he says to a nurse:
Oh, those poor ones, itwould be better if they met a quick end... before they have to suffer so much.
And he said it so loud... that Georg could hear it.
He did, too.
In order to find a future that isn't made more difficult by society, a physically handicapped person must perhaps go sometimes as far as California.
Living there is the young German scientist, Adolf Ratzka, who contracted polio at seventeen and spent several months in an iron lung.
Even today he uses an artificial respirator during the night.
However, he is able to work as a Scientific Assistant specialized in Social Sciences... at the State University of California... due to the difference ofwilling acceptance of the people here... and through the use of technical aids.
Presently, he works in the state redevelopment programs.
The handicapped have been integrated here, and all of the public buildings are accessible with ramps.
The doorways have no thresholds, and there are small ramps throughout all of the sidewalks.
This is Adolf Ratzkas room in a student dormitory.
His roommate overtakes the work of washing and dressing him.
Otherwise, Adolf Ratzka is practically independent.
The attitude towards a physically handicapped person here... is substantially more unprejudiced as in Germany.
A handicapped person is accepted here, and he lives together with others... just like someone who might have broken a leg in our country.
This is the respirator that is hooked up during the night.
During the day, breathing is a conscious activity.
Purely structurally, I would say... that maybe because the country here and the city is younger, as for example Munich, where I was previously,
that there is an absence of architectural obstructions... like those I found in Munich.
The houses here don't have any pompous stairways for the most part public buildings all have elevators... and in publicly sponsored buildings, facilities for wheelchair users are mandatory.
What I noticed here, was that the Americans, as far as I have gotten to know them, confront the matter of disability with a much more objective attitude.
You don't sense pity... or Christian mercy here - thank God.
In this achievement-oriented society... one is judged by what one can do.
In my opinion - besides the purely... physical things like therapy... and technical aids such as wheelchairs, electric wheelchairs and above all cars - the most important thing is to give the handicapped a goal that they can achieve.
Another case, that I am not familiar with personally, but through my work, is a professor on the University ofWisconsin... who is so crippled... that he has to turn the pages of his books... with a long wooden stick... that he holds in his mouth.
And I've been told... that it looks pretty wild when, surrounded by his assistants, he swirls through the pages with this wooden stick.
He teaches, he is active in research, appears often at conferences and in addition, he is a businessman... who runs a successful building company.
If the integration in an achievement-oriented society... should be the only worthwhile goal, is questionable, of course, because there are many who cannot or will not achieve this.
This is Adolf Ratzka's car.
A technology class reconstructed... a normal delivery car for him as their semester project... and it is now simple to rebuild it from the applied basic concept.
Now I buckle my wheelchair into my car, so that I don't slide while I'm driving.
I drive the car completely with my hands, all of the controls are up here.
And my left hand is somewhatweaker, that's why I drive with the right hand.
I have very sensitive power steering.
With the left hand I control the brakes, this turning movement is the brake.
Here, on the manometer, I can read the respective pressure level... that still remains.
This here is the gas.
I have an automatic clutch, very simple.
Up here is the horn.
Down here is a short wave radio, just in case... the car breaks down and I need help...
I can contact radio hams... on the same channel.
Well, and here is the key.
On the Los Angeles Highway, Adolf Ratzka... is no different from any other driver on the road.
Here in California he has been granted mobility and social participation.
In ten years, this girl will be twenty years old.
Only, the way things are, her future prospects look rather bleak.
It will probably take a long time until the Federal Republic of Germany... attains a status that is generally achieved in the USA, because it is less an issue of means and more an issue of alternative thinking.
Until then, we will only be able to offer handicapped children... a handicapped future.
We've got two tons of potatoes.
Tom!
I'll drink to that.
Did you know the subject, Thomas Grunemann?
Yes.
Very well.
He was my best friend.
We grew up together.
Can you account for his disappearance in anyway?
Mrs. Grunemann?
No.
Did he recently appear to be agitated or depressed in any way?
No.
Mr. Cable, at the plant did he voice any grievance or discontent about his work there?
Not at all.
As a matter of fact, Tom operated best when he was under pressure.
Please forgive me, Mrs. Grunemann, but I have to ask.
Did your husband ever show any moral or sexual problems or peculiarities?
No.
Any marital problems in general, that is?
We were very happy.
Did he ever mention specifically, a girl or a woman in New York City?
No.
No.
Why?
We recovered in his desk at the plant in one of the drawers a typewritten letter that was evidently written on the Friday before he disappeared.
It was written to a girl in New York City and we contacted the police.
They brought her in, questioned her and she said that she had received six or seven letters of this kind.
Can I see it?
Well, it's an obscene letter, Mrs. Grunemann.
I would like to see it.
I would like you to remember that it was written by a very disturbed man.
I don't believe it.
I'd like you to know that situations of this kind are not unique.
A man will lead a double life.
A Jekyll-and-Hyde existence and his wife has no idea what's going on.
Has anybody talked to you about the financial arrangements?
Well, that depends, naturally, on how long you want me for and what you want to do.
I know you.
It will be very nice.
I'd like to spend the evening with you if it's...
If you'd like that.
Have you ever been with a woman before?
Paying her?
Do you like it?
I mean, I have the feeling that that turns you on very particularly.
What turns me on is because I have a good imagination and I like pleasing.
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?
I think in the confines of one's house, one should be free of clothing and inhibitions.
Inhibitions are always nice because they're so nice to overcome.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not.
As long as you don't hurt me more than I like to be hurt I will do anything you ask.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
You mustn't be.
You know, there's nothing wrong.
Nothing is wrong.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
All right.
Would you stand up, please?
Hello.
Hi.
Hi, can I see your eyes?
Let me see your hair.
Take your hat off.
Take my hat off?
Yeah.
Okay.
Too pretty.
Too pretty.
Now, that's the color.
The coloring is great.
I don't know.
It's not quite it though.
No, not really.
Hello.
Can I see your hands?
Thank you.
She's got funny hands.
Hi.
She is great.
Beautiful eyes.
Yes.
All right.
That's the coloring.
Yeah, let me see you smile.
I think she has that cross between...
She's great.
But I've seen you before.
I think so.
Have you done any cosmetic ads?
Yes, I have.
You have?
How do they send people with a conflict?
It's got to be a new face.
Call that agency.
Irene Dunne would've had it.
That would be perfect.
C minus.
C minus.
Got to find her today.
That's it.
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm exhausted.
One more day of this and I'll plop.
Hello.
Hi.
Just have a seat, please.
It's been six months.
Tom Grunemann has been missing for half a year.
And all the FBI has to offer is a report that must bore even you.
There are thousands of honest, decent men who simply disappear every year.
Neither Mrs. Grunemann nor I are willing to just dismiss this case.
And therefore we feel entitled to investigate on our own.
You're entitled.
There are some very competent...
John Klute offered us his services, and we've accepted.
Klute knew Tom, and he has many ideas about the case.
Have you ever done missing persons work before?
No.
Have you spent any time in the city?
No.
Well, speaking frankly...
You're wondering why we thought of Klute?
Frankly he's interested.
And he cares.
Why didn't you ever find out anything from that girl?
We held her under surveillance expecting your boy Grunemann to show up there.
He didn't.
We arrested her on a C.P. Charge.
Convicted.
Two months women's city prison.
Offered to reduce sentence.
She cooperated.
She thought she remembered him from those letters from before.
She made that connection.
But she hadn't seen him since then and couldn't identify his photograph.
A good call girl, she'll turn 600 or 700 tricks a year.
Faces get blurred.
And since then, she's reported several incidents like breather calls, anonymous phone calls.
Also, somebody may be following her, watching her.
Things like that.
So I guess it's conceivable that Grunemann's still around there.
Still bugging her.
Hey, Trina!
Bree.
Listen, I could use a quick $50.
You got a commuter for me?
Terrific.
Right.
Terrific.
Yeah. 'Bye.
Hi.
I'm Bree.
Yeah.
Come in, please.
I'm glad to know you, Bree.
I'm glad you could come.
Sit down, please.
Where are you from?
Can I get you a drink?
Yeah, I'd like a ginger ale.
Thank you.
I'm from Chicago.
You come to New York often?
No, I don't come to New York too often.
Too bad.
Three times a year maybe.
What kind of party did you have in mind?
We could have a nice half-and-half party for $50.
We could have a good time for $50.
Or if you wanted something extra, it would be a little more.
Maybe a nice...
Listen, would it be all right...
Tell me what you want.
Tell me what you want.
That sounds fantastic.
That's so exciting.
But it's going to cost you more.
That's fantastic.
That's going to be $100.
Sure, fine.
Yeah.
Yes, very good.
$100.
Very good.
I like to get business done at the beginning.
That way we don't have to think about it, then we can just have a good time.
I like your mind.
Yes.
So.
Chicago.
This is the bed?
This is the bed.
Very nice.
There's the bed in operating position.
You're so nice.
Come here.
Angel.
My angel!
"We gather together
"to ask the Lord's blessing
"He hastens
"and chastens his wisdom divine
"and from the beginning
"the fight we were winning
"Lord, be at our side...
"divine"
It's 12:00 a.m. This is Jim Donnelly, WNEW News.
Con Edison has again resorted to a cutback in voltage to conserve generating capacity.
At three percent...
Hello?
Hello?
Who is it?
Miss Daniels, my name is Klute.
John Klute.
And I'd like to talk to you.
What do you want?
My name is John Klute.
You said that.
I'm an investigator.
I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
Who?
Tom Grunemann.
He wrote you some letters.
Wow.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania.
He disappeared from there last December.
I've been hired to look for him.
Why?
You know what I'm talking about, Miss Daniels.
Honest.
Can I ask you some questions please?
Do you have any identification?
You're not a cop?
You're not FBI?
You're a private detective?
And you just want to ask me some questions?
They're not very recent.
That's last year.
They're quite good.
What have you done that I might have seen on Broadway or off-Broadway?
- Well, I study with George Tainter.
- George?
George is very good.
He's a good man to begin with.
I've been in two of his productions.
Two of his workshop productions.
Workshop.
Well, they're very nice.
How do you feel about being an actress?
I like it very much.
You think you know yourself?
As much as anybody.
Do you really know yourself?
No.
That's very important.
I forget myself when I act.
You can't forget yourself.
You have to know yourself and kind of like yourself.
You have to relate.
Relate to people.
I had an identity crisis two years ago and since then I've been working to know myself.
That's very important.
Don't hide your face.
You have a nice face, you shouldn't hide it.
Excuse me just a second.
Julian?
Yes, okay, send her in.
Well, I'm very busy.
Thank you for stopping by.
If you're in anything off-off-Broadway...
How are you today?
I won't be able to come back anymore.
I'm sorry.
Because I just can't afford it.
Did I fail you, Bree?
I come here all the time, I pay you all this money and why do I still want to trick?
Why do I still walk by a phone and want to pick up the phone and call?
Did you think I had some magic potion?
You'd come in and tell me your problem and I would just take it away?
What's the difference between going on a call as a model or an actress, as a call girl?
You're successful as a call girl...
Because when you're a call girl you control it, that's why.
Because someone wants you.
Not me.
I mean, there are some johns that I have regularly that want me and that's terrific.
But they want a woman and I know I'm good.
I arrive at their hotel or their apartment and they're usually nervous, which is fine, because I'm not.
I know what I'm doing.
For an hour I'm the best actress in the world.
I'm the best fuck in the world.
And...
Why did you say you're the best actress in the world?
At that time?
Because it's an act.
That's what's nice about it.
You don't have to feel anything.
You don't have to care about anything.
You don't have to like anybody.
You just lead them by the ring in their nose in the direction they think they want to go.
You get a lot of money out of them in as short period of time as possible.
You control it and you call the shots and I always feel just great afterwards.
And you enjoyed it?
No.
Why not?
You say there's nothing wrong.
Why not?
You said...
There's a difference.
I don't think there's anything wrong with it morally.
I didn't enjoy it physically.
I came to enjoy it because it made me feel good.
It made me feel like I wasn't alone.
It made me feel that I had some control over myself, that I had some control over my life.
That I could determine things for myself.
I don't know.
I don't know why I'm here.
It's just so silly to think that somebody else can help anybody, isn't it?
I could come over tonight.
Are you alone?
In about an hour.
Okay.
See you in an hour.
Bree.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Enjoy.
It's good to see you again.
Likewise.
I've just got back from Cannes, you know.
And I...
Well I have something rather exciting to tell you.
Yes?
Cannes was very amusing.
We played baccarat and chemin de fer.
A very nice little Italian marquis was rather enthusiastic about me.
But a young man can be so silly.
Then one night at the gambling tables I saw him.
A stranger, he was looking at me.
He was standing very still on the other side of the room and his eyes were looking right into me.
And I knew that for the first time in my life...
Please.
Not young.
He wasn't young.
He had gray sideburns.
- Actually, he looked rather like you.
- Yes?
No one could tell me who he was.
Was he an exiled prince or a mercenary?
But there was a feeling stirring inside me, a pagan feeling.
The next day on the beach in my beach pavilion...
It was so warm on the sand and I saw him again.
He was staring at me.
His eyes were burning into me.
I was helpless.
He didn't even have to say anything, and I knew.
I knew that somehow...
You know, I've never liked young men.
And I knew that he would awaken something in me that no young man had ever awakened.
He was so wise and he taught me so many things with his hands.
In his eyes I felt so beautiful.
Miss Daniel.
Can I come upstairs and ask you some questions now?
You bastard!
Is this the shakedown, hon?
You picked a loser.
I don't have it!
I'm looking for Tom...
You think I'd live in this kip if I were taking calls full-time?
I'd be back on Park Avenue.
Can I ask you some questions?
Or you'll get me thrown back in the brig, you mean?
Have a seat.
Would you like some wine?
Or some beer?
No, thank you.
There isn't any beer anyway.
I've already told the police everything I know.
I don't even remember the schlub!
They showed me that already.
I understand this is Grunemann.
I told them, I don't remember.
Family-type man.
It figures.
Look will you please just try to get it from my side?
A year ago I was in the life full-time.
Living on Park Avenue.
This very nice apartment, leather furniture.
And then the cops dropped on me.
They caged me.
Started asking me about a guy that I'm supposed to have seen a year before that!
Two years ago!
He could be in Yemen!
Grunemann, what does that mean?
It's a name, I don't know him!
And they start showing me these pictures, and they don't mean anything to me.
Then they started asking me if I'd been getting letters from some guy out in Cabbageville.
Tuscarora.
Yeah, all right, I had been.
Very sick letters.
So they said, "Well, that's, Grunemann.
"So would you please tell us when you and he..."
Well, there was a guy once.
A freak.
Could've been him.
Apparently Grunemann liked to beat up on girls.
Well, this guy hired me and then he tried to kill me and that was about two years ago.
Tommy, allie allie in free, kid.
I got the gumdrops.
You remind me of my uncle.
What else do you remember about the man who beat you up?
Nothing.
Except that he wasn't kidding, that's all.
See, usually it's a fake out.
You probably know about that.
They pretend to tie you up and whip you while you wear a dress with a cloth belt.
Hell, it's their money, I don't care.
I'll swing from a shower rod and whistle Maytime.
Except this guy really freaked out on it.
But you cannot identify this man as Tom Grunemann?
I can't identify him as anybody!
So, is that it?
Listen why don't you go downstairs...
You have such a nice mouth.
...and get those tapes?
Bring them back up here and we'll have a party you and I.
- Wouldn't that be nice?
What about afterwards, the telephone calls?
Just phone calls, right?
What is it?
The phone rings, you answer it, there's no one there.
Kids having fun, burglars finding empty apartments.
It happens all the time.
It doesn't mean anything.
But you reported that you had been followed.
Look, I'm sorry.
I've been leading everybody astray.
It doesn't...
Okay, I get these feelings, but they're just feelings.
That's just me.
I'm sure you'll find this amusing, but I'm afraid of the dark.
Sometimes I get spooked.
I think I see people and hear things.
I go out in the morning and I think somebody's opened my mailbox.
If there's trash in front of my door I think somebody's trying to freak me out.
It's just nerves.
I'm a nervous broad.
It doesn't mean anything.
Bree Daniels.
How is Ted?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'd love to.
Maybe the next time you're in town?
I'd like to meet you very much.
You've got a nice voice.
I'm having a conversation with a very nice cop.
He's not a cop actually, he's a private...
Is that how you get most of your dates?
Someone gives your name to somebody.
Most of them, yes.
And that's how you met the man who beat you up?
I don't remember.
It was two years ago.
God!
How else do you get dates then, pimps?
You're very square, cookie.
No, pimps don't get dates for you, they just take your money.
The police have given me a list of names.
I'd like to ask you about them.
Frank Ligourin?
I'm sure this is going to amuse you, too.
But I'm really trying to get away from all that.
What about this evening, the old man?
You saw that?
Goddamn you!
He's 70 years old!
His wife's dead.
He's cut garments since he was 14.
He's maybe in his whole life had one week vacation and I'm all he's got!
He never lays a hand on me!
What harm is there in that?
What's your bag, Klute?
What do you like?
You a talker?
A button freak?
Like to have your chest walked around with high-heel shoes?
You like to have us watch you tinkle?
Okay.
Or do you get it off wearing women's clothes?
Goddamn hypocrite squares!
Okay.
I hope this isn't going to make my cold any worse.
Now tell me about Frank Ligourin.
He was my old man.
We broke up.
When?
When did you break up?
About eight months ago.
Would you mind not doing that?
What?
Okay?
Well, I thought I could trade you for those tapes.
Doesn't it get lonely down there in your little room?
Maybe I could bring some friends.
I've got some terrific friends.
No, thank you.
Men have paid $200 for me and here you are turning down a freebie.
You could get a perfectly good dishwasher for that.
What are you doing with my keys?
Give me your hand.
I knew it.
Don't be afraid.
I'm going to sit you down on the bed.
There's someone on the roof.
Sit.
Sit!
Tom?
Tom?
You didn't get him?
No.
Was it Grunemann?
I didn't see him.
Who sent you on that date?
Frankie Ligourin.
You and I will go talk to Frank Ligourin tomorrow.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not.
Would you like me to hold you?
I'm just trying to figure you out.
I may say not many people have been very successful at that.
That's all right.
I'll figure you out before the evening is over.
I hope you do, and in a way, I hope you don't.
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
Inhibitions are always nice because they're so nice to overcome.
Because I'm very bad, you know.
- In what way?
How are you bad?
In my head.
I have very wicked ideas.
Lots of them.
I'm sure that as you're sitting at your desk you've all kinds of strange things going through your mind.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
Nothing is wrong.
You know that I will do anything you ask.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
I was just finishing up some work.
Mocking up a few photographs.
I used to be a photographer.
Did Bree tell you?
Before I got into publishing.
He knows you're a pimp, Frankie.
He knows you were my pimp.
Excuse me.
Bree, why don't you wait outside?
I always respected Bree.
I'd like to make something clear.
I just got a couple of questions.
I want to make something clear.
I don't go after a girl.
Girl comes to me.
Her choice.
Right?
I'm looking for a man, Tom Grunemann.
Miss Daniel tells me that the date that beat her two years ago might've been that man, and you sent her on that date.
Two years ago?
Sorry.
I understand you use narcotics.
Maybe I could have someone come over and look at your arms.
You know, I may stand better with the cops than you do.
Why don't you sit down and relax?
It was a family matter.
Between the girls.
Had two other girls then.
Two other girls besides Bree.
One of them, Jane McKenna she blows a little jealous of Bree.
Bree comes first.
Evidently she knew this freak who beats up on women.
She cons me into passing him on to Bree so Bree would get hurt.
I didn't know until afterwards.
You can't tell them one of their own in-laws laid a freak on them.
Peace in the family.
Beyond that I don't know.
That's all she wrote.
Did you see the man?
No.
How can I get hold of Jane McKenna?
Baby, would I be telling you all this?
She copped out long ago.
She committed suicide, Baxter.
And the other girl, what's her name?
- Arlyn?
- Page.
How do I find her?
I don't know.
She's a junkie.
Make that scene, you could be anywhere.
Here, San Francisco, they just drop out.
Anything else?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
Not very much.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
Where can I find Arlyn Page?
You're not going to find Arlyn Page, she's a junkie.
Didn't he tell you that he sent me that guy?
Jane McKenna sent you that guy.
Well, she's dead.
Your tapes.
Golly gee, just what I've always wanted.
Dirty phone calls.
What for?
I'm through with your part of it.
You told me what you could.
Tell me, Klute did we get you a little?
Just a little bit?
Us city folk.
The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
All that's so pathetic.
Fuck off!
I'll tell you something, Jack.
It is in the bells that I hear my voices.
Not today when they all rang, that was nothing but jangling.
But here, in this corner where the bells come down from heaven and the echoes linger or in the fields where they come across the quiet of the countryside my voices are in them.
Hark!
Do you hear?
"Dear child of God."
That's just what you said.
At the half-hour they will say, "Be brave, go on."
At the three-quarters they will say, "I am thy help."
When is it the hour.
When the great bell goes after:
"God will save France."
It is then that St. Margaret...
Thank you very much.
The script please.
Very interesting accent.
Booth!
Thank you.
All right, so what do you want, cop?
I can't find Arlyn Page without your help.
I told you you wouldn't find her.
If I can't find her, I can't find him, and if I can't find him then you're in trouble.
So what do you say?
Okay?
It's going to cost.
Time is money.
Okay.
Well, I can pay you $100.
I can make $100 in a lunch break.
$100 is all I've got.
You were very good upstairs.
Kid, will you buy me a coffee?
Buy you lunch.
Do you want lunch?
Come on.
Whenever it suits you.
No, make it Monday at 8:00 p.m.
I said Monday, 8:00 p.m. Now don't be naughty!
He's a lovely man.
Comes here spends a bundle of money, and never even touches the girls.
Comes from Grosse Pointe, has a big house, eight servants but all he wants to do is come here and scrub out my bathroom.
8:00 p.m., Monday Mr. Clean.
Arlyn Page I had let her go.
With the kind of people I get I couldn't have a gal who was zonked out all the time.
You know, I get the crème de la crème.
No, she was trouble and I don't allow any trouble here.
Che si può fare?
Honni soit qui mal y pense.
Do you have any idea where I can look for her?
Try Mama Reese's.
Bree if you get lonely or have no place to go, you come here.
You'll always have a home here.
Why?
She's a junkie.
She was with you after she left Frankie, wasn't she?
Well, she's not now.
I tried to do everything for her.
I took her into my own place, my own little flat on First.
You know that sweet place?
We could of had everything together.
Then the bitch sold my mink!
Do you know anybody that's seen her?
As far as I'm concerned, she's dead!
Who is it?
Bree Daniels.
I couldn't sleep.
I keep thinking I hear noises.
Can I come in?
Come in.
It was probably just my imagination.
Sit down.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
I just...
I don't think he's going to come back again.
I just don't want to be alone right now.
Do you mind if I stay here a while?
If you'd like to go back upstairs, I'd come...
I'd really rather not go upstairs.
Why don't you lie down here?
Sleep here.
Where are you going to sleep?
I'll pull that out.
Lie down.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
What's the matter?
You were terrific.
A real tiger.
Are you upset because you didn't make me come?
I never come with a john.
Don't feel bad about losing your virtue, I sort of knew you would.
Everybody always does.
Arlyn Page?
Yes, she was with me about three months.
She was lucky I kept her that long.
She was out of it.
Somebody said she was streetwalking over on Lexington Avenue.
Or was it Eighth?
You might take a look.
Or try Bill Azure, if you can find him.
Yes, she used to dress the way you do.
The whore?
Yes, I threw her out.
Do you know where she went from here?
Live like animals, her and the man.
Out!
She was living with a man?
He was worse than the whore!
Cappy!
Arlyn Page?
Arlyn, it's Bree!
Cappy, is that you?
It's all right.
Cappy, we got a radio...
Arlyn, it's okay.
Bree, honey I'm waiting for someone.
You've got to help us.
Can't you see I'm strung out?
It'll only take you a couple of minutes.
A couple years ago, Jane sent me a guy that beat me.
If he sees you, he won't come.
Was she seeing a freak, one of her regular johns?
Was he a freak?
Yes.
What about it?
Did he come around a lot?
No, he was an older guy.
It's very important.
- Arlyn, get them out of here!
- I'm begging you!
It's very important, please.
Can you give me a description of him?
Cappy?
Cappy, listen.
No!
Cappy, don't run!
Cappy, don't run!
I've got a radio, Cappy!
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow.
A narcotics addict.
I believed her.
I believed her absolutely.
The man who did those beatings was not Tom Grunemann.
Suppose it wasn't Tom.
Where does that get you?
Tom is still connected because of the letters, whether he wrote them or not.
The only way that I'm going to find him is to find the man who did do the beatings.
The only way I'm going to find him is to pursue Arlyn Page and try to secure from her some kind of identification.
I'll be flying back to Pennsylvania on Friday and I'll fill them in on things.
How is it back there?
I think you're homesick.
I'll be back on Thursday.
John, I want to tell you how much I respect your dedication.
Thank you.
Because I'm very bad, you know.
I have very wicked ideas.
As you're sitting at your desk you have strange things running through your mind.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
Nothing is wrong.
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?
I like to sort of walk around here with no clothes on.
I think people wear clothes much too often, don't you?
I think in the confines of one's house, one should be free of clothing and inhibitions.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
I was trying to get away from a world that I had known, because I don't think it was very good for me, and I found myself looking up its ass...
...and seeing people that I used to know and that I liked a lot that were my friends.
Sort of.
Girls and that could have been me.
I mean, I know I'm not stupid.
I guess I just realized that I don't really give a damn.
What I would really like to do is be faceless and bodiless and be... .. left alone.
You're lucky they're still here.
We don't keep unclaimed possessions in suicide cases more than a year.
Number 497.
Jane McKenna.
I thought there would be more.
Well, there's this man, this detective... .. and I don't know exactly what is...
.. happening or what he wants out of me, or anything like that.
But he took care of me.
Did you feel threatened by it?
I don't know.
When you're used to being lonely and somebody comes in and moves that around, it's sort of scary I guess.
How do you feel when you feel scared?
Angry.
- At whom?
Whoever is making me feel that way.
- Do you feel angry at him?
Half of the time, yes.
How do you feel angry?
What do you want to do?
I want to...
.. manipulate him.
How?
In all the ways that I can manipulate people.
I mean, it's easy to manipulate men.
Right?
They were bringing a freighter down through Kill Van Kull.
Propellers washed it up on top.
Arlyn Page was probably an alias.
Sorry.
Man, can you help me out?
Yes.
What?
I mean, can you help me out?
I mean that's my baby, dead.
I have to get up.
You know what it means, my baby dead.
Got to get up.
Okay?
Lt. Trask, please.
John Klute.
I think we should run down and check on everybody who knew Tom Grunemann.
I don't think the man who wrote the letters was Tom.
Just run down and check on everything.
Talk to you.
You're up, are you?
How are you?
Trask wants you to call him.
He told me about Arlyn.
It probably doesn't have anything to do with anything but just as a precaution when you go out, if you tell me where you're going to go a phone number where I can find you.
Just so I can always keep in touch with you.
Okay?
Sure.
I'm all right.
I know.
I feel physically, that's what's different.
I mean, I feel.
My body feels.
I enjoy making love with him.
Which is a very baffling and bewildering thing, because I've never felt that before.
I wish that I could let things happen and enjoy it, you know for what it is and while it lasts and relax about it.
But all the time, I keep feeling the need to destroy it.
To break it off.
To go back to the comfort of being numb again.
I keep hoping, in a way, that it's going to end.
Because I had more control before, when I was with tricks.
I knew what I was doing and I was setting everything up.
And that's what's so strange:
It's that I'm not setting anything up.
That something is...
You know what this is like, but I've never felt it before.
It's a new thing and it's so strange.
The sensation that something that is flowing from me naturally to somebody else without it's being prettied up or...
I mean, he's seen me horrible!
He's seen me ugly!
He's seen me mean.
He's seen me whorey and it doesn't seem to matter.
He seems to accept me.
I guess having sex with somebody and feeling those sort of feelings towards them is very new to me.
I wish that I didn't keep wanting to destroy it.
You know, I'm trying to stay out of it.
Yes.
I'd love to party with you, but I...
Yes.
Marta, try to get somebody else and if I change my mind I'll call you, okay?
You're not going to get hung up on me, are you?
Yes, sir, can I help you?
Yes, can I have a bag please?
Yes.
A couple of bags please.
Well, let me see how much those weigh.
A pound and a quarter.
I'll have some of those small tomatoes.
No mushy ones.
Okay, thanks.
What do you have in your bag?
What?
What have you got in your bag?
Can I have a cantaloupe, please?
Wait.
He cut up my clothes...
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Hello?
I can be a very bad girl, you know.
I sometimes need a spanking.
I have very wicked ideas.
I will do anything you ask.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
You mustn't be.
You know, there's nothing wrong.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
She can't remember.
Well, it could have been it could have been hidden in his pocket, I've seen one of those.
All right.
I'll wait for you here.
Bree?
Trask and some officers are coming to examine your apartment.
I want you to stay here today and tomorrow.
You'll be safe here.
I'll only be gone for a few minutes tomorrow.
Bree?
Bree?
Well, you look like you've been with many women, but I didn't know... .. if you'd ever paid for a woman before.
I mean, you wouldn't need to.
So if you do, it's obviously because it excites you.
Because you're not a man that would have to pay for a woman.
You could have any woman you wanted.
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
I will do anything you ask or want.
Since you know that there are no limits to my imagination.
I place no moral judgments on anything.
We checked out 42 letters of Tom Grunemann's friends.
And we only came up with one with any similarity to the obscene letter.
All right, there's Tom Grunemann.
Different margins, different spacings.
That's mine.
You said to check out everybody.
Same margins, top and sides.
He does best with his middle fingers.
We get fainter registrations on outside keys.
Notice how he invariably does that with the "T" and the "H."
Who is it?
Peter Cable.
But you have no case.
There's not even a body.
I'm sorry we have to meet here, but I'm pretty rushed for time.
I have a business meeting tonight in Chicago.
Any developments?
I think I can close the case. ...if I can have $500 to purchase Jane McKenna's address book.
I don't understand what you mean.
Well, I've found a contact who will sell me the book.
A little black book containing the name of the client that beat up Bree Daniel.
He is also the man who came into Bree Daniel's apartment yesterday and wrecked it.
We know that now because of the semen that he left in her underwear.
The blood type is AB, and Tom's was type A. It wasn't Tom.
I think this man killed Jane McKenna and Arlyn Page.
I think he drowned them.
I you should prepare yourself for the fact that Tom is possibly dead.
The only way I'll find out is to find him.
I need the money before tomorrow night.
You're meeting him tomorrow night?
Yes.
- He's bringing the book to my apartment.
- At what time?
8:30.
I'll notify the board as soon as I get to Chicago and have them wire you the money immediately.
Thank you, John.
I certainly hope you're wrong about Tom.
Thank you, sir.
Good luck.
I don't want you to do this.
Bree.
I'm just going to a girlfriend's apartment.
I can't stay here, obviously.
Please.
Not with him.
This other girl has a very big apartment, lots of room.
But it's not necessarily how it looks.
Look we all respect each other, right?
I respect you.
Bree respects you.
But you have to respect her, too.
Her best interests.
Mrs. Daniels, I have to close up now.
Leave your name and number with the service and she'll get back to you.
I can't.
Well, I have to close up now.
I almost killed somebody.
Well, I'm certain the doctor would like to speak with you about it.
As a matter of fact, I'll have her call you as soon as she gets home.
I promise.
- Can I use your phone?
- Sure.
Is Mr. Goldfarb there?
Mr. Goldfarb Sr.
I have to talk to somebody.
I'm just a little way across town.
Can I come over?
About half an hour?
Detective Trask, please.
Hi, John Klute.
He didn't take the plane, he cancelled out.
I'm at home in my apartment.
I don't know where she is.
I'll find her.
Okay.
I'll leave word if I go out.
Okay.
I have an appointment with Mr. Goldfarb.
Mr. Goldfarb!
Mr. Goldfarb!
Hello.
What can I do for you?
I'm sorry.
I mean Mr. Goldfarb Sr.
My father left about 15 minutes ago.
He didn't feel so good.
Can I help you?
He's working himself to death, poor man.
You sure I can't help you?
It's not important.
No, really.
I don't mind.
You're going to miss your train, Mr. Goldfarb.
Excuse me.
Did he leave a message for me?
Bree Daniels.
I thought that was for tomorrow!
Mr. Goldfarb's wire.
Yes, Mama, I'm coming right now.
I know you don't like to get in in the middle of the picture!
Yes, right away.
Bye-bye.
We're closing now, Miss.
May I leave Mr. Goldfarb a message?
Poor man, everybody's friend.
Hello?
Hello?
This is Bree Daniels.
Has the doctor checked in yet?
When she does, tell her I'm at 246-1383.
I'll wait five minutes.
How I can reach the doctor?
The doctor hasn't checked in yet.
I'm trying to locate a Miss Bree Daniels.
I'm sorry sir, but we only take messages for the doctor.
Has she called in or anything?
Has she called the doctor at all today?
She left a forwarding number.
- Can I have that number, please?
I'm not allowed to give that out.
I'm a police officer.
Please don't make me prove this.
You must understand my position.
I must comply with the rules.
I understand all that.
Will you just give me the number, please?
Can we talk about this reasonably?
I know you're expecting some kind of extravagant behavior but do you believe me?
Yes.
We can talk?
Well, it's just an ordinary matter.
I'm a very well-off man.
I have a position to respect I would feel personally, very uncomfortable to be connected with a certain kind of woman.
I'm sure you understand what I mean.
Look, John Klute works for me.
I know you're his contact.
I know he's trying to acquire Jane McKenna's book.
I'm in a position to offer more for it than he can.
You don't understand what I'm talking about, do you?
Yes.
Jane McKenna's book.
And I'll try to get it for you.
No.
Obviously you're frightened and you're lying.
No, I'm not.
I will, I'll try to get it for you.
Is this something Klute's invented.
Is this a trap for me?
Klute knows about me, doesn't he?
Knows what about you?
Then everybody knows about me.
So, it doesn't make any difference what I do anymore, does it?
I've no idea what I'm going to do and I'm so deeply puzzled.
I've done terrible things.
I've killed three people.
And yet, I don't consider myself a terrible man.
No more than others.
See, Tom Grunemann discovered me.
We were here on business together and he found me and Jane McKenna in my hotel room.
She had become hysterical and she started screaming and I guess I hit her.
I don't actually recall how it all happened so quickly.
Anyway, she fell and hit her head, and that's when Tom came in the room.
I guess he must've heard her screaming.
But I never understood why she did that.
She had never screamed before.
It was the revulsion and the contempt that I saw on his face and the certainty that sooner or later he would use it against me within the company.
I tried to endure that as long as I possibly could.
You just want me to keep on talking, don't you?
No, I don't.
I do understand.
I really do.
Well, that's what you all do.
You make a man think that he's accepted.
It's all just a great big game to you.
You're all obviously too lazy and too warped to do anything meaningful with your life, so you prey upon the sexual fantasies of others.
I'm sure it comes as no great surprise to you when I say that there are little corners in everyone which were better off left alone.
Little sicknesses, weaknesses, which should never be exposed.
That's your stock in trade, isn't it, a man's weakness?
I was never really fully aware of mine until you brought them out.
How far out of town are we?
Five miles outside of New York.
- Do you mind if I turn the lights down?
No, it's up to you.
Turn the light out if you'd like.
My name is Peter Cable.
I work for the Tole American Corporation which is situated in Pennsylvania and in New York.
I would not be telling you these things if my intentions weren't honorable.
You look familiar to me.
- In what way?
I don't know.
Your face looks familiar to me.
I guess I have a confession to make.
We did meet before.
About two years ago.
I often wondered whatever happened to Arlyn Page and here you are.
Yeah, I remember.
Listen... .. l've got get out of here.
I mean I can't...
I remember you.
Well, what do you remember?
- You beat me up, that's what you did!
It's okay.
Just freaked me out for a minute, that's all.
I promise to drive you back afterwards.
Okay.
Why don't you just tell me what you'd like, and then after you tell me what you'd like...
- I'd like to spend some time with you.
I have been looking for you for two years.
- Why?
That's my business.
I will say that you gave me a great deal of pleasure.
I saw in you things that I had not seen in other women of your profession.
I will not harm you at all physically.
It's all right.
No, it's not all right, and you know it's not all right.
No, it is all right.
If that's what you...
But, you have to tell me first.
If that's what you want that's fine.
- Arlyn why don't you lie down on the bed and make yourself comfortable.
I'll not strap you in, I'll not tie you down.
Just lie down on the bed, please.
Be comfortable.
Nothing's going to happen.
Nothing's going to happen.
Okay.
Why don't you make yourself comfortable?
- I am perfectly comfortable.
Just put your head down.
You have such lovely long blonde hair.
Turn your head.
Like that.
Don't!
Don't!
I've explained to him what I have to do and I think he understands.
What could ever happen for us?
I mean, we're so different.
I know enough about myself to know that whatever lies in store for me it's not going to be setting up housekeeping with somebody in Tuscarora and darning socks and doing all that.
I'd go out of my mind.
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I don't know how I feel about him.
It's so hard for me to say it!
God!
To say what?
- I'm going to miss him.
Bree Daniels.
How is Roy?
Well, I'm leaving town right now and I don't expect to be back.
You're very nice.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
I have no idea what's going to happen.
I just can't stay in the city, you know?
Maybe I'll come back.
You'll probably see me next week.
We've got two tons of potatoes.
Tom!
I'll drink to that.
Did you know the subject, Thomas Grunemann?
- Yes.
- Very well.
He was my best friend.
We grew up together.
Can you account for his disappearance in anyway?
- Mrs. Grunemann?
- No.
Did he recently appear to be agitated or depressed in any way?
No.
Mr. Cable, at the plant did he voice any grievance or discontent about his work there?
Not at all.
As a matter of fact, Tom operated best when he was under pressure.
Please forgive me, Mrs. Grunemann, but I have to ask.
Did your husband ever show any moral or sexual problems or peculiarities?
No.
Any marital problems in general, that is?
We were very happy.
Did he ever mention specifically, a girl or a woman in New York City?
No.
- No.
- Why?
We recovered in his desk at the plant in one of the drawers a typewritten letter that was evidently written on the Friday before he disappeared.
It was written to a girl in New York City and we contacted the police.
They brought her in, questioned her and she said that she had received six or seven letters of this kind.
Can I see it?
Well, it's an obscene letter, Mrs. Grunemann.
I would like to see it.
I would like you to remember that it was written by a very disturbed man.
I don't believe it.
I'd like you to know that situations of this kind are not unique.
A man will lead a double life.
A Jekyll-and-Hyde existence and his wife has no idea what's going on.
Has anybody talked to you about the financial arrangements?
Well, that depends, naturally, on how long you want me for and what you want to do.
I know you.
It will be very nice.
I'd like to spend the evening with you if it's...
If you'd like that.
Have you ever been with a woman before?
Paying her?
Do you like it?
I mean, I have the feeling that that turns you on very particularly.
What turns me on is because I have a good imagination and I like pleasing.
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?
I think in the confines of one's house, one should be free of clothing and inhibitions.
Inhibitions are always nice because they're so nice to overcome.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not.
As long as you don't hurt me more than I like to be hurt I will do anything you ask.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
You mustn't be.
You know, there's nothing wrong.
Nothing is wrong.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
All right.
Would you stand up, please?
- Hello.
- Hi.
Hi, can I see your eyes?
Let me see your hair.
- Take your hat off.
- Take my hat off?
Yeah.
Okay.
- Too pretty.
- Too pretty.
Now, that's the color.
The coloring is great.
I don't know.
- It's not quite it though.
- No, not really.
Hello.
Can I see your hands?
- Thank you.
- She's got funny hands.
- Hi.
- She is great.
- Beautiful eyes.
- Yes.
- All right.
That's the coloring.
- Yeah, let me see you smile.
- I think she has that cross between...
- She's great.
But I've seen you before.
- I think so.
- Have you done any cosmetic ads?
- Yes, I have.
- You have?
- How do they send people with a conflict?
- It's got to be a new face.
Call that agency.
- Irene Dunne would've had it.
- That would be perfect.
- C minus.
- C minus.
- Got to find her today.
- That's it.
Thank you, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
I'm exhausted.
One more day of this and I'll plop.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Just have a seat, please.
It's been six months.
Tom Grunemann has been missing for half a year.
And all the FBI has to offer is a report that must bore even you.
There are thousands of honest, decent men who simply disappear every year.
Neither Mrs. Grunemann nor I are willing to just dismiss this case.
And therefore we feel entitled to investigate on our own.
You're entitled.
There are some very competent...
John Klute offered us his services, and we've accepted.
Klute knew Tom, and he has many ideas about the case.
Have you ever done missing persons work before?
No.
- Have you spent any time in the city?
- No.
Well, speaking frankly...
You're wondering why we thought of Klute?
Frankly he's interested.
And he cares.
Why didn't you ever find out anything from that girl?
We held her under surveillance expecting your boy Grunemann to show up there.
He didn't.
We arrested her on a C.P. Charge.
Convicted.
Two months women's city prison.
Offered to reduce sentence.
She cooperated.
She thought she remembered him from those letters from before.
She made that connection.
But she hadn't seen him since then and couldn't identify his photograph.
A good call girl, she'll turn 600 or 700 tricks a year.
Faces get blurred.
And since then, she's reported several incidents like breather calls, anonymous phone calls.
Also, somebody may be following her, watching her.
Things like that.
So I guess it's conceivable that Grunemann's still around there.
Still bugging her.
Hey, Trina!
Bree.
Listen, I could use a quick $50.
You got a commuter for me?
Terrific.
Right.
Terrific.
Yeah. 'Bye.
Hi.
I'm Bree.
Yeah.
Come in, please.
I'm glad to know you, Bree.
I'm glad you could come.
Sit down, please.
Where are you from?
Can I get you a drink?
Yeah, I'd like a ginger ale.
Thank you.
I'm from Chicago.
You come to New York often?
No, I don't come to New York too often.
- Too bad.
- Three times a year maybe.
What kind of party did you have in mind?
We could have a nice half-and-half party for $50.
We could have a good time for $50.
Or if you wanted something extra, it would be a little more.
- Maybe a nice...
- Listen, would it be all right...
Tell me what you want.
Tell me what you want.
That sounds fantastic.
That's so exciting.
But it's going to cost you more.
That's fantastic.
That's going to be $100.
- Sure, fine.
- Yeah.
- Yes, very good.
- $100.
Very good.
I like to get business done at the beginning.
That way we don't have to think about it, then we can just have a good time.
I like your mind.
Yes.
So.
Chicago.
This is the bed?
This is the bed.
Very nice.
There's the bed in operating position.
You're so nice.
Come here.
Angel.
My angel!
"We gather together
"to ask the Lord's blessing
"He hastens
"and chastens his wisdom divine
"and from the beginning
"the fight we were winning
"Lord, be at our side...
"divine"
It's 12:00 a.m. This is Jim Donnelly, WNEW News.
Con Edison has again resorted to a cutback in voltage to conserve generating capacity.
At three percent...
Hello?
Hello?
- Who is it?
- Miss Daniel, my name is Klute.
John Klute.
And I'd like to talk to you.
- What do you want?
- My name is John Klute.
You said that.
I'm an investigator.
I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
- Who?
- Tom Grunemann.
He wrote you some letters.
Wow.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania.
He disappeared from there last December.
- I've been hired to look for him.
- Why?
You know what I'm talking about, Miss Daniel.
Honest.
Can I ask you some questions please?
Do you have any identification?
You're not a cop?
You're not FBI?
You're a private detective?
And you just want to ask me some questions?
- They're not very recent.
That's last year.
- They're quite good.
What have you done that I might have seen on Broadway or off-Broadway?
- Well, I study with George Tainter.
- George?
George is very good.
He's a good man to begin with.
I've been in two of his productions.
- Two of his workshop productions.
- Workshop.
Well, they're very nice.
How do you feel about being an actress?
- I like it very much.
- You think you know yourself?
- As much as anybody.
- Do you really know yourself?
- No.
- That's very important.
- I forget myself when I act.
- You can't forget yourself.
You have to know yourself and kind of like yourself.
You have to relate.
Relate to people.
I had an identity crisis two years ago and since then I've been working to know myself.
That's very important.
Don't hide your face.
You have a nice face, you shouldn't hide it.
Excuse me just a second.
Julian?
Yes, okay, send her in.
Well, I'm very busy.
Thank you for stopping by.
If you're in anything off-off-Broadway...
How are you today?
I won't be able to come back anymore.
I'm sorry.
Because I just can't afford it.
Did I fail you, Bree?
I come here all the time, I pay you all this money and why do I still want to trick?
Why do I still walk by a phone and want to pick up the phone and call?
Did you think I had some magic potion?
You'd come in and tell me your problem and I would just take it away?
What's the difference between going on a call as a model or an actress, as a call girl?
You're successful as a call girl...
Because when you're a call girl you control it, that's why.
Because someone wants you.
Not me.
I mean, there are some johns that I have regularly that want me and that's terrific.
But they want a woman and I know I'm good.
I arrive at their hotel or their apartment and they're usually nervous, which is fine, because I'm not.
I know what I'm doing.
For an hour I'm the best actress in the world.
I'm the best fuck in the world.
And...
Why did you say you're the best actress in the world?
- At that time?
- Because it's an act.
That's what's nice about it.
You don't have to feel anything.
You don't have to care about anything.
You don't have to like anybody.
You just lead them by the ring in their nose in the direction they think they want to go.
You get a lot of money out of them in as short period of time as possible.
You control it and you call the shots and I always feel just great afterwards.
- And you enjoyed it?
- No.
Why not?
You say there's nothing wrong.
Why not?
You said...
There's a difference.
I don't think there's anything wrong with it morally.
I didn't enjoy it physically.
I came to enjoy it because it made me feel good.
It made me feel like I wasn't alone.
It made me feel that I had some control over myself, that I had some control over my life.
That I could determine things for myself.
I don't know.
I don't know why I'm here.
It's just so silly to think that somebody else can help anybody, isn't it?
I could come over tonight.
Are you alone?
In about an hour.
Okay.
See you in an hour.
Bree.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Enjoy.
- It's good to see you again.
- Likewise.
I've just got back from Cannes, you know.
And I...
Well I have something rather exciting to tell you.
Yes?
Cannes was very amusing.
We played baccarat and chemin de fer.
A very nice little Italian marquis was rather enthusiastic about me.
But a young man can be so silly.
Then one night at the gambling tables I saw him.
A stranger, he was looking at me.
He was standing very still on the other side of the room and his eyes were looking right into me.
And I knew that for the first time in my life...
Please.
Not young.
He wasn't young.
He had gray sideburns.
- Actually, he looked rather like you.
- Yes?
No one could tell me who he was.
Was he an exiled prince or a mercenary?
But there was a feeling stirring inside me, a pagan feeling.
The next day on the beach in my beach pavilion...
It was so warm on the sand and I saw him again.
He was staring at me.
His eyes were burning into me.
I was helpless.
He didn't even have to say anything, and I knew.
I knew that somehow...
You know, I've never liked young men.
And I knew that he would awaken something in me that no young man had ever awakened.
He was so wise and he taught me so many things with his hands.
In his eyes I felt so beautiful.
Miss Daniel.
Can I come upstairs and ask you some questions now?
You bastard!
Is this the shakedown, hon?
You picked a loser.
I don't have it!
I'm looking for Tom...
You think I'd live in this kip if I were taking calls full-time?
- I'd be back on Park Avenue.
- Can I ask you some questions?
Or you'll get me thrown back in the brig, you mean?
Have a seat.
Would you like some wine?
- Or some beer?
- No, thank you.
There isn't any beer anyway.
I've already told the police everything I know.
I don't even remember the schlub!
They showed me that already.
I understand this is Grunemann.
I told them, I don't remember.
Family-type man.
It figures.
Look will you please just try to get it from my side?
A year ago I was in the life full-time.
Living on Park Avenue.
This very nice apartment, leather furniture.
And then the cops dropped on me.
They caged me.
Started asking me about a guy that I'm supposed to have seen a year before that!
Two years ago!
He could be in Yemen!
Grunemann, what does that mean?
It's a name, I don't know him!
And they start showing me these pictures, and they don't mean anything to me.
Then they started asking me if I'd been getting letters from some guy out in Cabbageville.
Tuscarora.
Yeah, all right, I had been.
Very sick letters.
So they said, "Well, that's, Grunemann.
"So would you please tell us when you and he..."
Well, there was a guy once.
A freak.
Could've been him.
Apparently Grunemann liked to beat up on girls.
Well, this guy hired me and then he tried to kill me and that was about two years ago.
Tommy, allie allie in free, kid.
I got the gumdrops.
You remind me of my uncle.
What else do you remember about the man who beat you up?
Nothing.
Except that he wasn't kidding, that's all.
See, usually it's a fake out.
You probably know about that.
They pretend to tie you up and whip you while you wear a dress with a cloth belt.
Hell, it's their money, I don't care.
I'll swing from a shower rod and whistle Maytime.
Except this guy really freaked out on it.
But you cannot identify this man as Tom Grunemann?
I can't identify him as anybody!
So, is that it?
Listen why don't you go downstairs...
You have such a nice mouth.
...and get those tapes?
Bring them back up here and we'll have a party you and I.
- Wouldn't that be nice?
What about afterwards, the telephone calls?
Just phone calls, right?
What is it?
The phone rings, you answer it, there's no one there.
Kids having fun, burglars finding empty apartments.
It happens all the time.
It doesn't mean anything.
But you reported that you had been followed.
Look, I'm sorry.
I've been leading everybody astray.
It doesn't...
Okay, I get these feelings, but they're just feelings.
That's just me.
I'm sure you'll find this amusing, but I'm afraid of the dark.
Sometimes I get spooked.
I think I see people and hear things.
I go out in the morning and I think somebody's opened my mailbox.
If there's trash in front of my door I think somebody's trying to freak me out.
It's just nerves.
I'm a nervous broad.
It doesn't mean anything.
Bree Daniel.
How is Ted?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'd love to.
Maybe the next time you're in town?
I'd like to meet you very much.
You've got a nice voice.
I'm having a conversation with a very nice cop.
He's not a cop actually, he's a private...
Is that how you get most of your dates?
Someone gives your name to somebody.
Most of them, yes.
And that's how you met the man who beat you up?
I don't remember.
It was two years ago.
God!
How else do you get dates then, pimps?
You're very square, cookie.
No, pimps don't get dates for you, they just take your money.
The police have given me a list of names.
I'd like to ask you about them.
Frank Ligourin?
I'm sure this is going to amuse you, too.
But I'm really trying to get away from all that.
What about this evening, the old man?
You saw that?
Goddamn you!
He's 70 years old!
His wife's dead.
He's cut garments since he was 14.
He's maybe in his whole life had one week vacation and I'm all he's got!
He never lays a hand on me!
What harm is there in that?
What's your bag, Klute?
What do you like?
You a talker?
A button freak?
Like to have your chest walked around with high-heel shoes?
- You like to have us watch you tinkle?
- Okay.
Or do you get it off wearing women's clothes?
- Goddamn hypocrite squares!
- Okay.
I hope this isn't going to make my cold any worse.
- Now tell me about Frank Ligourin.
- He was my old man.
We broke up.
When?
- When did you break up?
- About eight months ago.
Would you mind not doing that?
What?
Okay?
Well, I thought I could trade you for those tapes.
Doesn't it get lonely down there in your little room?
Maybe I could bring some friends.
I've got some terrific friends.
No, thank you.
Men have paid $200 for me and here you are turning down a freebie.
You could get a perfectly good dishwasher for that.
What are you doing with my keys?
Give me your hand.
I knew it.
Don't be afraid.
I'm going to sit you down on the bed.
There's someone on the roof.
Sit.
Sit!
Tom?
Tom?
- You didn't get him?
- No.
Was it Grunemann?
I didn't see him.
Who sent you on that date?
Frankie Ligourin.
You and I will go talk to Frank Ligourin tomorrow.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not.
Would you like me to hold you?
I'm just trying to figure you out.
I may say not many people have been very successful at that.
That's all right.
I'll figure you out before the evening is over.
I hope you do, and in a way, I hope you don't.
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
Inhibitions are always nice because they're so nice to overcome.
- Because I'm very bad, you know.
- In what way?
How are you bad?
In my head.
I have very wicked ideas.
Lots of them.
I'm sure that as you're sitting at your desk you've all kinds of strange things going through your mind.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
Nothing is wrong.
You know that I will do anything you ask.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
I was just finishing up some work.
Mocking up a few photographs.
I used to be a photographer.
Did Bree tell you?
Before I got into publishing.
He knows you're a pimp, Frankie.
He knows you were my pimp.
Excuse me.
Bree, why don't you wait outside?
I always respected Bree.
I'd like to make something clear.
- I just got a couple of questions.
- I want to make something clear.
I don't go after a girl.
Girl comes to me.
Her choice.
Right?
I'm looking for a man, Tom Grunemann.
Miss Daniel tells me that the date that beat her two years ago might've been that man, and you sent her on that date.
Two years ago?
Sorry.
I understand you use narcotics.
Maybe I could have someone come over and look at your arms.
You know, I may stand better with the cops than you do.
Why don't you sit down and relax?
It was a family matter.
Between the girls.
Had two other girls then.
Two other girls besides Bree.
One of them, Jane McKenna she blows a little jealous of Bree.
Bree comes first.
Evidently she knew this freak who beats up on women.
She cons me into passing him on to Bree so Bree would get hurt.
I didn't know until afterwards.
You can't tell them one of their own in-laws laid a freak on them.
Peace in the family.
Beyond that I don't know.
That's all she wrote.
Did you see the man?
No.
How can I get hold of Jane McKenna?
Baby, would I be telling you all this?
She copped out long ago.
She committed suicide, Baxter.
And the other girl, what's her name?
- Arlyn?
- Page.
How do I find her?
I don't know.
She's a junkie.
Make that scene, you could be anywhere.
Here, San Francisco, they just drop out.
Anything else?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
Not very much.
- Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
- Where can I find Arlyn Page?
You're not going to find Arlyn Page, she's a junkie.
Didn't he tell you that he sent me that guy?
Jane McKenna sent you that guy.
Well, she's dead.
Your tapes.
Golly gee, just what I've always wanted.
Dirty phone calls.
What for?
I'm through with your part of it.
You told me what you could.
Tell me, Klute did we get you a little?
Just a little bit?
Us city folk.
The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
All that's so pathetic.
Fuck off!
I'll tell you something, Jack.
It is in the bells that I hear my voices.
Not today when they all rang, that was nothing but jangling.
But here, in this corner where the bells come down from heaven and the echoes linger or in the fields where they come across the quiet of the countryside my voices are in them.
Hark!
Do you hear?
"Dear child of God."
That's just what you said.
At the half-hour they will say, "Be brave, go on."
At the three-quarters they will say, "I am thy help."
When is it the hour.
When the great bell goes after:
"God will save France."
- It is then that St. Margaret...
- Thank you very much.
The script please.
Very interesting accent.
Booth!
Thank you.
All right, so what do you want, cop?
- I can't find Arlyn Page without your help.
- I told you you wouldn't find her.
If I can't find her, I can't find him, and if I can't find him then you're in trouble.
So what do you say?
Okay?
It's going to cost.
Time is money.
Okay.
Well, I can pay you $100.
- I can make $100 in a lunch break.
- $100 is all I've got.
You were very good upstairs.
Kid, will you buy me a coffee?
Buy you lunch.
Do you want lunch?
Come on.
Whenever it suits you.
No, make it Monday at 8:00 p.m.
I said Monday, 8:00 p.m. Now don't be naughty!
He's a lovely man.
Comes here spends a bundle of money, and never even touches the girls.
Comes from Grosse Pointe, has a big house, eight servants but all he wants to do is come here and scrub out my bathroom.
8:00 p.m., Monday Mr. Clean.
Arlyn Page I had let her go.
With the kind of people I get I couldn't have a gal who was zonked out all the time.
You know, I get the crème de la crème.
No, she was trouble and I don't allow any trouble here.
Che si può fare?
Honni soit qui mal y pense.
Do you have any idea where I can look for her?
Try Mama Reese's.
Bree if you get lonely or have no place to go, you come here.
You'll always have a home here.
Why?
She's a junkie.
She was with you after she left Frankie, wasn't she?
Well, she's not now.
I tried to do everything for her.
I took her into my own place, my own little flat on First.
You know that sweet place?
We could of had everything together.
Then the bitch sold my mink!
- Do you know anybody that's seen her?
- As far as I'm concerned, she's dead!
Who is it?
Bree Daniel.
I couldn't sleep.
I keep thinking I hear noises.
Can I come in?
Come in.
It was probably just my imagination.
Sit down.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
I just...
I don't think he's going to come back again.
I just don't want to be alone right now.
Do you mind if I stay here a while?
- Lf you'd like to go back upstairs, I'd come...
- I'd really rather not go upstairs.
Why don't you lie down here?
Sleep here.
- Where are you going to sleep?
- I'll pull that out.
Lie down.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
What's the matter?
You were terrific.
A real tiger.
Are you upset because you didn't make me come?
I never come with a john.
Don't feel bad about losing your virtue, I sort of knew you would.
Everybody always does.
Arlyn Page?
Yes, she was with me about three months.
She was lucky I kept her that long.
She was out of it.
Somebody said she was streetwalking over on Lexington Avenue.
Or was it Eighth?
You might take a look.
Or try Bill Azure, if you can find him.
Yes, she used to dress the way you do.
The whore?
Yes, I threw her out.
Do you know where she went from here?
Live like animals, her and the man.
Out!
She was living with a man?
He was worse than the whore!
Cappy!
- Arlyn Page?
- Arlyn, it's Bree!
Cappy, is that you?
- It's all right.
- Cappy, we got a radio...
Arlyn, it's okay.
Bree, honey I'm waiting for someone.
You've got to help us.
Can't you see I'm strung out?
It'll only take you a couple of minutes.
A couple years ago, Jane sent me a guy that beat me.
If he sees you, he won't come.
Was she seeing a freak, one of her regular johns?
Was he a freak?
Yes.
What about it?
Did he come around a lot?
No, he was an older guy.
It's very important.
- Arlyn, get them out of here!
- I'm begging you!
It's very important, please.
- Can you give me a description of him?
- Cappy?
- Cappy, listen.
No!
- Cappy, don't run!
Cappy, don't run!
I've got a radio, Cappy!
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow.
A narcotics addict.
I believed her.
I believed her absolutely.
The man who did those beatings was not Tom Grunemann.
Suppose it wasn't Tom.
Where does that get you?
Tom is still connected because of the letters, whether he wrote them or not.
The only way that I'm going to find him is to find the man who did do the beatings.
The only way I'm going to find him is to pursue Arlyn Page and try to secure from her some kind of identification.
I'll be flying back to Pennsylvania on Friday and I'll fill them in on things.
How is it back there?
I think you're homesick.
I'll be back on Thursday.
John, I want to tell you how much I respect your dedication.
Thank you.
Because I'm very bad, you know.
I have very wicked ideas.
As you're sitting at your desk you have strange things running through your mind.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
Nothing is wrong.
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?
I like to sort of walk around here with no clothes on.
I think people wear clothes much too often, don't you?
I think in the confines of one's house, one should be free of clothing and inhibitions.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
I was trying to get away from a world that I had known, because I don't think it was very good for me, and I found myself looking up its ass...
...and seeing people that I used to know and that I liked a lot that were my friends.
Sort of.
Girls and that could have been me.
I mean, I know I'm not stupid.
I guess I just realized that I don't really give a damn.
What I would really like to do is be faceless and bodiless and be left alone.
You're lucky they're still here.
We don't keep unclaimed possessions in suicide cases more than a year.
Number 497.
Jane McKenna.
I thought there would be more.
Well, there's this man, this detective and I don't know exactly what is happening or what he wants out of me, or anything like that.
But he took care of me.
Did you feel threatened by it?
I don't know.
When you're used to being lonely and somebody comes in and moves that around, it's sort of scary I guess.
How do you feel when you feel scared?
- Angry.
- At whom?
- Whoever is making me feel that way.
- Do you feel angry at him?
Half of the time, yes.
How do you feel angry?
What do you want to do?
I want to manipulate him.
How?
In all the ways that I can manipulate people.
I mean, it's easy to manipulate men.
Right?
They were bringing a freighter down through Kill Van Kull.
Propellers washed it up on top.
Arlyn Page was probably an alias.
- Sorry.
- Man, can you help me out?
Yes.
What?
I mean, can you help me out?
I mean that's my baby, dead.
I have to get up.
- You know what it means, my baby dead.
- Got to get up.
Okay?
Lt. Trask, please.
John Klute.
I think we should run down and check on everybody who knew Tom Grunemann.
I don't think the man who wrote the letters was Tom.
Just run down and check on everything.
Talk to you.
You're up, are you?
How are you?
Trask wants you to call him.
He told me about Arlyn.
It probably doesn't have anything to do with anything but just as a precaution when you go out, if you tell me where you're going to go a phone number where I can find you.
Just so I can always keep in touch with you.
Okay?
Sure.
I'm all right.
I know.
I feel physically, that's what's different.
I mean, I feel.
My body feels.
I enjoy making love with him.
Which is a very baffling and bewildering thing, because I've never felt that before.
I wish that I could let things happen and enjoy it, you know for what it is and while it lasts and relax about it.
But all the time, I keep feeling the need to destroy it.
To break it off.
To go back to the comfort of being numb again.
I keep hoping, in a way, that it's going to end.
Because I had more control before, when I was with tricks.
I knew what I was doing and I was setting everything up.
And that's what's so strange:
It's that I'm not setting anything up.
That something is...
You know what this is like, but I've never felt it before.
It's a new thing and it's so strange.
The sensation that something that is flowing from me naturally to somebody else without it's being prettied up or...
I mean, he's seen me horrible!
He's seen me ugly!
He's seen me mean.
He's seen me whorey and it doesn't seem to matter.
He seems to accept me.
I guess having sex with somebody and feeling those sort of feelings towards them is very new to me.
I wish that I didn't keep wanting to destroy it.
You know, I'm trying to stay out of it.
Yes.
I'd love to party with you, but I...
Yes.
Marta, try to get somebody else and if I change my mind I'll call you, okay?
You're not going to get hung up on me, are you?
- Yes, sir, can I help you?
- Yes, can I have a bag please?
- Yes.
- A couple of bags please.
Well, let me see how much those weigh.
- A pound and a quarter.
- I'll have some of those small tomatoes.
- No mushy ones.
- Okay, thanks.
- What do you have in your bag?
- What?
What have you got in your bag?
Can I have a cantaloupe, please?
Wait.
He cut up my clothes...
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Hello?
I can be a very bad girl, you know.
I sometimes need a spanking.
I have very wicked ideas.
I will do anything you ask.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
You mustn't be.
You know, there's nothing wrong.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
She can't remember.
Well, it could have been it could have been hidden in his pocket, I've seen one of those.
All right.
I'll wait for you here.
Bree?
Trask and some officers are coming to examine your apartment.
I want you to stay here today and tomorrow.
You'll be safe here.
I'll only be gone for a few minutes tomorrow.
Bree?
Bree?
Well, you look like you've been with many women, but I didn't know if you'd ever paid for a woman before.
I mean, you wouldn't need to.
So if you do, it's obviously because it excites you.
Because you're not a man that would have to pay for a woman.
You could have any woman you wanted.
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
I will do anything you ask or want.
Since you know that there are no limits to my imagination.
I place no moral judgments on anything.
We checked out 42 letters of Tom Grunemann's friends.
And we only came up with one with any similarity to the obscene letter.
All right, there's Tom Grunemann.
Different margins, different spacings.
That's mine.
You said to check out everybody.
Same margins, top and sides.
He does best with his middle fingers.
We get fainter registrations on outside keys.
Notice how he invariably does that with the "T" and the "H."
Who is it?
Peter Cable.
But you have no case.
There's not even a body.
I'm sorry we have to meet here, but I'm pretty rushed for time.
I have a business meeting tonight in Chicago.
Any developments?
I think I can close the case. ...if I can have $500 to purchase Jane McKenna's address book.
I don't understand what you mean.
Well, I've found a contact who will sell me the book.
A little black book containing the name of the client that beat up Bree Daniel.
He is also the man who came into Bree Daniel's apartment yesterday and wrecked it.
We know that now because of the semen that he left in her underwear.
The blood type is AB, and Tom's was type A. It wasn't Tom.
I think this man killed Jane McKenna and Arlyn Page.
I think he drowned them.
I you should prepare yourself for the fact that Tom is possibly dead.
The only way I'll find out is to find him.
I need the money before tomorrow night.
- You're meeting him tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- He's bringing the book to my apartment.
- At what time?
8:30.
I'll notify the board as soon as I get to Chicago and have them wire you the money immediately.
Thank you, John.
I certainly hope you're wrong about Tom.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.
I don't want you to do this.
Bree.
I'm just going to a girlfriend's apartment.
I can't stay here, obviously.
Please.
Not with him.
This other girl has a very big apartment, lots of room.
But it's not necessarily how it looks.
Look we all respect each other, right?
I respect you.
Bree respects you.
But you have to respect her, too.
Her best interests.
Mrs. Daniel, I have to close up now.
Leave your name and number with the service and she'll get back to you.
I can't.
Well, I have to close up now.
I almost killed somebody.
Well, I'm certain the doctor would like to speak with you about it.
As a matter of fact, I'll have her call you as soon as she gets home.
I promise.
- Can I use your phone?
- Sure.
Is Mr. Goldfarb there?
Mr. Goldfarb Sr.
I have to talk to somebody.
I'm just a little way across town.
Can I come over?
About half an hour?
Detective Trask, please.
Hi, John Klute.
He didn't take the plane, he cancelled out.
I'm at home in my apartment.
I don't know where she is.
I'll find her.
Okay.
I'll leave word if I go out.
Okay.
I have an appointment with Mr. Goldfarb.
Mr. Goldfarb!
Mr. Goldfarb!
Hello.
What can I do for you?
I'm sorry.
I mean Mr. Goldfarb Sr.
My father left about 15 minutes ago.
He didn't feel so good.
- Can I help you?
- He's working himself to death, poor man.
- You sure I can't help you?
- It's not important.
No, really.
I don't mind.
You're going to miss your train, Mr. Goldfarb.
Excuse me.
Did he leave a message for me?
Bree Daniel.
I thought that was for tomorrow!
Mr. Goldfarb's wire.
Yes, Mama, I'm coming right now.
I know you don't like to get in in the middle of the picture!
Yes, right away.
Bye-bye.
We're closing now, Miss.
May I leave Mr. Goldfarb a message?
Poor man, everybody's friend.
Hello?
Hello?
This is Bree Daniel.
Has the doctor checked in yet?
When she does, tell her I'm at 246-1383.
I'll wait five minutes.
How I can reach the doctor?
The doctor hasn't checked in yet.
I'm trying to locate a Miss Bree Daniel.
I'm sorry sir, but we only take messages for the doctor.
Has she called in or anything?
Has she called the doctor at all today?
- She left a forwarding number.
- Can I have that number, please?
I'm not allowed to give that out.
I'm a police officer.
Please don't make me prove this.
You must understand my position.
I must comply with the rules.
I understand all that.
Will you just give me the number, please?
Can we talk about this reasonably?
I know you're expecting some kind of extravagant behavior but do you believe me?
Yes.
We can talk?
Well, it's just an ordinary matter.
I'm a very well-off man.
I have a position to respect I would feel personally, very uncomfortable to be connected with a certain kind of woman.
I'm sure you understand what I mean.
Look, John Klute works for me.
I know you're his contact.
I know he's trying to acquire Jane McKenna's book.
I'm in a position to offer more for it than he can.
You don't understand what I'm talking about, do you?
Yes.
Jane McKenna's book.
- And I'll try to get it for you.
- No.
Obviously you're frightened and you're lying.
No, I'm not.
I will, I'll try to get it for you.
Is this something Klute's invented.
Is this a trap for me?
- Klute knows about me, doesn't he?
- Knows what about you?
Then everybody knows about me.
So, it doesn't make any difference what I do anymore, does it?
I've no idea what I'm going to do and I'm so deeply puzzled.
I've done terrible things.
I've killed three people.
And yet, I don't consider myself a terrible man.
No more than others.
See, Tom Grunemann discovered me.
We were here on business together and he found me and Jane McKenna in my hotel room.
She had become hysterical and she started screaming and I guess I hit her.
I don't actually recall how it all happened so quickly.
Anyway, she fell and hit her head, and that's when Tom came in the room.
I guess he must've heard her screaming.
But I never understood why she did that.
She had never screamed before.
It was the revulsion and the contempt that I saw on his face and the certainty that sooner or later he would use it against me within the company.
I tried to endure that as long as I possibly could.
You just want me to keep on talking, don't you?
No, I don't.
I do understand.
I really do.
Well, that's what you all do.
You make a man think that he's accepted.
It's all just a great big game to you.
You're all obviously too lazy and too warped to do anything meaningful with your life, so you prey upon the sexual fantasies of others.
I'm sure it comes as no great surprise to you when I say that there are little corners in everyone which were better off left alone.
Little sicknesses, weaknesses, which should never be exposed.
That's your stock in trade, isn't it, a man's weakness?
I was never really fully aware of mine until you brought them out.
How far out of town are we?
- Five miles outside of New York.
- Do you mind if I turn the lights down?
No, it's up to you.
Turn the light out if you'd like.
My name is Peter Cable.
I work for the Tole American Corporation which is situated in Pennsylvania and in New York.
I would not be telling you these things if my intentions weren't honorable.
- You look familiar to me.
- In what way?
I don't know.
Your face looks familiar to me.
I guess I have a confession to make.
We did meet before.
About two years ago.
I often wondered whatever happened to Arlyn Page and here you are.
Yeah, I remember.
Listen I've got get out of here.
I mean I can't...
I remember you.
- Well, what do you remember?
- You beat me up, that's what you did!
It's okay.
Just freaked me out for a minute, that's all.
I promise to drive you back afterwards.
Okay.
Why don't you just tell me what you'd like, and then...
- ... after you tell me what you'd like...
- I'd like to spend some time with you.
- I have been looking for you for two years.
- Why?
That's my business.
I will say that you gave me a great deal of pleasure.
I saw in you things that I had not seen in other women of your profession.
I will not harm you at all physically.
It's all right.
No, it's not all right, and you know it's not all right.
No, it is all right.
If that's what you...
But, you have to tell me first.
If that's what you want...
- ... that's fine.
- Arlyn why don't you lie down on the bed and make yourself comfortable.
I'll not strap you in, I'll not tie you down.
Just lie down on the bed, please.
Be comfortable.
Nothing's going to happen.
Nothing's going to happen.
Okay.
- Why don't you make yourself comfortable?
- I am perfectly comfortable.
Just put your head down.
You have such lovely long blonde hair.
Turn your head.
Like that.
Don't!
Don't!
I've explained to him what I have to do and I think he understands.
What could ever happen for us?
I mean, we're so different.
I know enough about myself to know that whatever lies in store for me it's not going to be setting up housekeeping with somebody in Tuscarora and darning socks and doing all that.
I'd go out of my mind.
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I don't know how I feel about him.
It's so hard for me to say it!
God!
- To say what?
- I'm going to miss him.
Bree Daniel.
How is Roy?
Well, I'm leaving town right now and I don't expect to be back.
You're very nice.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
I have no idea what's going to happen.
I just can't stay in the city, you know?
Maybe I'll come back.
You'll probably see me next week.
We've got two tons of potatoes.
Tom!
I'll drink to that.
Did you know the subject, Thomas Grunemann?
Yes.
Very well.
He was my best friend.
We grew up together.
Can you account for his disappearance in anyway?
Mrs. Grunemann?
No.
Did he recently appear to be agitated or depressed in any way?
No.
Mr. Cable, at the plant did he voice any grievance or discontent about his work there?
Not at all.
As a matter of fact, Tom operated best when he was under pressure.
Please forgive me, Mrs. Grunemann, but I have to ask.
Did your husband ever show any moral or sexual problems or peculiarities?
No.
Any marital problems in general, that is?
We were very happy.
Did he ever mention specifically, a girl or a woman in New York City?
No.
No.
Why?
We recovered in his desk at the plant in one of the drawers a typewritten letter that was evidently written on the Friday before he disappeared.
It was written to a girl in New York City and we contacted the police.
They brought her in, questioned her and she said that she had received six or seven letters of this kind.
Can I see it?
Well, it's an obscene letter, Mrs. Grunemann.
I would like to see it.
I would like you to remember that it was written by a very disturbed man.
I don't believe it.
I'd like you to know that situations of this kind are not unique.
A man will lead a double life.
A Jekyll-and-Hyde existence and his wife has no idea what's going on.
Has anybody talked to you about the financial arrangements?
Well, that depends, naturally, on how long you want me for and what you want to do.
I know you.
It will be very nice.
I'd like to spend the evening with you if it's...
If you'd like that.
Have you ever been with a woman before?
Paying her?
Do you like it?
I mean, I have the feeling that that turns you on very particularly.
What turns me on is because I have a good imagination and I like pleasing.
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?
I think in the confines of one's house, one should be free of clothing and inhibitions.
Inhibitions are always nice because they're so nice to overcome.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not.
As long as you don't hurt me more than I like to be hurt I will do anything you ask.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
You mustn't be.
You know, there's nothing wrong.
Nothing is wrong.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
All right.
Would you stand up, please?
Hello.
Hi.
Hi, can I see your eyes?
Let me see your hair.
Take your hat off.
Take my hat off?
Yeah.
Okay.
Too pretty.
Too pretty.
Now, that's the color.
The coloring is great.
I don't know.
It's not quite it though.
No, not really.
Hello.
Can I see your hands?
Thank you.
She's got funny hands.
Hi.
She is great.
Beautiful eyes.
Yes.
All right.
That's the coloring.
Yeah, let me see you smile.
I think she has that cross between...
She's great.
But I've seen you before.
I think so.
Have you done any cosmetic ads?
Yes, I have.
You have?
How do they send people with a conflict?
It's got to be a new face.
Call that agency.
Irene Dunne would've had it.
That would be perfect.
C minus.
C minus.
Got to find her today.
That's it.
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm exhausted.
One more day of this and I'll plop.
Hello.
Hi.
Just have a seat, please.
It's been six months.
Tom Grunemann has been missing for half a year.
And all the FBI has to offer is a report that must bore even you.
There are thousands of honest, decent men who simply disappear every year.
Neither Mrs. Grunemann nor I are willing to just dismiss this case.
And therefore we feel entitled to investigate on our own.
You're entitled.
There are some very competent...
John Klute offered us his services, and we've accepted.
Klute knew Tom, and he has many ideas about the case.
Have you ever done missing persons work before?
No.
Have you spent any time in the city?
No.
Well, speaking frankly...
You're wondering why we thought of Klute?
Frankly he's interested.
And he cares.
Why didn't you ever find out anything from that girl?
We held her under surveillance expecting your boy Grunemann to show up there.
He didn't.
We arrested her on a C.P. Charge.
Convicted.
Two months women's city prison.
Offered to reduce sentence.
She cooperated.
She thought she remembered him from those letters from before.
She made that connection.
But she hadn't seen him since then and couldn't identify his photograph.
A good call girl, she'll turn 600 or 700 tricks a year.
Faces get blurred.
And since then, she's reported several incidents like breather calls, anonymous phone calls.
Also, somebody may be following her, watching her.
Things like that.
So I guess it's conceivable that Grunemann's still around there.
Still bugging her.
Hey, Trina!
Bree.
Listen, I could use a quick $50.
You got a commuter for me?
Terrific.
Right.
Terrific.
Yeah. 'Bye.
Hi.
I'm Bree.
Yeah.
Come in, please.
I'm glad to know you, Bree.
I'm glad you could come.
Sit down, please.
Where are you from?
Can I get you a drink?
Yeah, I'd like a ginger ale.
Thank you.
I'm from Chicago.
You come to New York often?
No, I don't come to New York too often.
Too bad.
Three times a year maybe.
What kind of party did you have in mind?
We could have a nice half-and-half party for $50.
We could have a good time for $50.
Or if you wanted something extra, it would be a little more.
Maybe a nice...
Listen, would it be all right...
Tell me what you want.
Tell me what you want.
That sounds fantastic.
That's so exciting.
But it's going to cost you more.
That's fantastic.
That's going to be $100.
Sure, fine.
Yeah.
Yes, very good.
$100.
Very good.
I like to get business done at the beginning.
That way we don't have to think about it, then we can just have a good time.
I like your mind.
Yes.
So.
Chicago.
This is the bed?
This is the bed.
Very nice.
There's the bed in operating position.
You're so nice.
Come here.
Angel.
My angel!
"We gather together
"to ask the Lord's blessing
"He hastens
"and chastens his wisdom divine
"and from the beginning
"the fight we were winning
"Lord, be at our side...
"divine"
It's 12:00 a.m. This is Jim Donnelly, WNEW News.
Con Edison has again resorted to a cutback in voltage to conserve generating capacity.
At three percent...
Hello?
Hello?
Who is it?
Miss Daniels, my name is Klute.
John Klute.
And I'd like to talk to you.
What do you want?
My name is John Klute.
You said that.
I'm an investigator.
I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
Who?
Tom Grunemann.
He wrote you some letters.
Wow.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania.
He disappeared from there last December.
I've been hired to look for him.
Why?
You know what I'm talking about, Miss Daniels.
Honest.
Can I ask you some questions please?
Do you have any identification?
You're not a cop?
You're not FBI?
You're a private detective?
And you just want to ask me some questions?
They're not very recent.
That's last year.
They're quite good.
What have you done that I might have seen on Broadway or off-Broadway?
- Well, I study with George Tainter.
- George?
George is very good.
He's a good man to begin with.
I've been in two of his productions.
Two of his workshop productions.
Workshop.
Well, they're very nice.
How do you feel about being an actress?
I like it very much.
You think you know yourself?
As much as anybody.
Do you really know yourself?
No.
That's very important.
I forget myself when I act.
You can't forget yourself.
You have to know yourself and kind of like yourself.
You have to relate.
Relate to people.
I had an identity crisis two years ago and since then I've been working to know myself.
That's very important.
Don't hide your face.
You have a nice face, you shouldn't hide it.
Excuse me just a second.
Julian?
Yes, okay, send her in.
Well, I'm very busy.
Thank you for stopping by.
If you're in anything off-off-Broadway...
How are you today?
I won't be able to come back anymore.
I'm sorry.
Because I just can't afford it.
Did I fail you, Bree?
I come here all the time, I pay you all this money and why do I still want to trick?
Why do I still walk by a phone and want to pick up the phone and call?
Did you think I had some magic potion?
You'd come in and tell me your problem and I would just take it away?
What's the difference between going on a call as a model or an actress, as a call girl?
You're successful as a call girl...
Because when you're a call girl you control it, that's why.
Because someone wants you.
Not me.
I mean, there are some johns that I have regularly that want me and that's terrific.
But they want a woman and I know I'm good.
I arrive at their hotel or their apartment and they're usually nervous, which is fine, because I'm not.
I know what I'm doing.
For an hour I'm the best actress in the world.
I'm the best fuck in the world.
And...
Why did you say you're the best actress in the world?
At that time?
Because it's an act.
That's what's nice about it.
You don't have to feel anything.
You don't have to care about anything.
You don't have to like anybody.
You just lead them by the ring in their nose in the direction they think they want to go.
You get a lot of money out of them in as short period of time as possible.
You control it and you call the shots and I always feel just great afterwards.
And you enjoyed it?
No.
Why not?
You say there's nothing wrong.
Why not?
You said...
There's a difference.
I don't think there's anything wrong with it morally.
I didn't enjoy it physically.
I came to enjoy it because it made me feel good.
It made me feel like I wasn't alone.
It made me feel that I had some control over myself, that I had some control over my life.
That I could determine things for myself.
I don't know.
I don't know why I'm here.
It's just so silly to think that somebody else can help anybody, isn't it?
I could come over tonight.
Are you alone?
In about an hour.
Okay.
See you in an hour.
Bree.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Enjoy.
It's good to see you again.
Likewise.
I've just got back from Cannes, you know.
And I...
Well I have something rather exciting to tell you.
Yes?
Cannes was very amusing.
We played baccarat and chemin de fer.
A very nice little Italian marquis was rather enthusiastic about me.
But a young man can be so silly.
Then one night at the gambling tables I saw him.
A stranger, he was looking at me.
He was standing very still on the other side of the room and his eyes were looking right into me.
And I knew that for the first time in my life...
Please.
Not young.
He wasn't young.
He had gray sideburns.
- Actually, he looked rather like you.
- Yes?
No one could tell me who he was.
Was he an exiled prince or a mercenary?
But there was a feeling stirring inside me, a pagan feeling.
The next day on the beach in my beach pavilion...
It was so warm on the sand and I saw him again.
He was staring at me.
His eyes were burning into me.
I was helpless.
He didn't even have to say anything, and I knew.
I knew that somehow...
You know, I've never liked young men.
And I knew that he would awaken something in me that no young man had ever awakened.
He was so wise and he taught me so many things with his hands.
In his eyes I felt so beautiful.
Miss Daniel.
Can I come upstairs and ask you some questions now?
You bastard!
Is this the shakedown, hon?
You picked a loser.
I don't have it!
I'm looking for Tom...
You think I'd live in this kip if I were taking calls full-time?
I'd be back on Park Avenue.
Can I ask you some questions?
Or you'll get me thrown back in the brig, you mean?
Have a seat.
Would you like some wine?
Or some beer?
No, thank you.
There isn't any beer anyway.
I've already told the police everything I know.
I don't even remember the schlub!
They showed me that already.
I understand this is Grunemann.
I told them, I don't remember.
Family-type man.
It figures.
Look will you please just try to get it from my side?
A year ago I was in the life full-time.
Living on Park Avenue.
This very nice apartment, leather furniture.
And then the cops dropped on me.
They caged me.
Started asking me about a guy that I'm supposed to have seen a year before that!
Two years ago!
He could be in Yemen!
Grunemann, what does that mean?
It's a name, I don't know him!
And they start showing me these pictures, and they don't mean anything to me.
Then they started asking me if I'd been getting letters from some guy out in Cabbageville.
Tuscarora.
Yeah, all right, I had been.
Very sick letters.
So they said, "Well, that's, Grunemann.
"So would you please tell us when you and he..."
Well, there was a guy once.
A freak.
Could've been him.
Apparently Grunemann liked to beat up on girls.
Well, this guy hired me and then he tried to kill me and that was about two years ago.
Tommy, allie allie in free, kid.
I got the gumdrops.
You remind me of my uncle.
What else do you remember about the man who beat you up?
Nothing.
Except that he wasn't kidding, that's all.
See, usually it's a fake out.
You probably know about that.
They pretend to tie you up and whip you while you wear a dress with a cloth belt.
Hell, it's their money, I don't care.
I'll swing from a shower rod and whistle Maytime.
Except this guy really freaked out on it.
But you cannot identify this man as Tom Grunemann?
I can't identify him as anybody!
So, is that it?
Listen why don't you go downstairs...
You have such a nice mouth.
...and get those tapes?
Bring them back up here and we'll have a party you and I.
- Wouldn't that be nice?
What about afterwards, the telephone calls?
Just phone calls, right?
What is it?
The phone rings, you answer it, there's no one there.
Kids having fun, burglars finding empty apartments.
It happens all the time.
It doesn't mean anything.
But you reported that you had been followed.
Look, I'm sorry.
I've been leading everybody astray.
It doesn't...
Okay, I get these feelings, but they're just feelings.
That's just me.
I'm sure you'll find this amusing, but I'm afraid of the dark.
Sometimes I get spooked.
I think I see people and hear things.
I go out in the morning and I think somebody's opened my mailbox.
If there's trash in front of my door I think somebody's trying to freak me out.
It's just nerves.
I'm a nervous broad.
It doesn't mean anything.
Bree Daniels.
How is Ted?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'd love to.
Maybe the next time you're in town?
I'd like to meet you very much.
You've got a nice voice.
I'm having a conversation with a very nice cop.
He's not a cop actually, he's a private...
Is that how you get most of your dates?
Someone gives your name to somebody.
Most of them, yes.
And that's how you met the man who beat you up?
I don't remember.
It was two years ago.
God!
How else do you get dates then, pimps?
You're very square, cookie.
No, pimps don't get dates for you, they just take your money.
The police have given me a list of names.
I'd like to ask you about them.
Frank Ligourin?
I'm sure this is going to amuse you, too.
But I'm really trying to get away from all that.
What about this evening, the old man?
You saw that?
Goddamn you!
He's 70 years old!
His wife's dead.
He's cut garments since he was 14.
He's maybe in his whole life had one week vacation and I'm all he's got!
He never lays a hand on me!
What harm is there in that?
What's your bag, Klute?
What do you like?
You a talker?
A button freak?
Like to have your chest walked around with high-heel shoes?
You like to have us watch you tinkle?
Okay.
Or do you get it off wearing women's clothes?
Goddamn hypocrite squares!
Okay.
I hope this isn't going to make my cold any worse.
Now tell me about Frank Ligourin.
He was my old man.
We broke up.
When?
When did you break up?
About eight months ago.
Would you mind not doing that?
What?
Okay?
Well, I thought I could trade you for those tapes.
Doesn't it get lonely down there in your little room?
Maybe I could bring some friends.
I've got some terrific friends.
No, thank you.
Men have paid $200 for me and here you are turning down a freebie.
You could get a perfectly good dishwasher for that.
What are you doing with my keys?
Give me your hand.
I knew it.
Don't be afraid.
I'm going to sit you down on the bed.
There's someone on the roof.
Sit.
Sit!
Tom?
Tom?
You didn't get him?
No.
Was it Grunemann?
I didn't see him.
Who sent you on that date?
Frankie Ligourin.
You and I will go talk to Frank Ligourin tomorrow.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not.
Would you like me to hold you?
I'm just trying to figure you out.
I may say not many people have been very successful at that.
That's all right.
I'll figure you out before the evening is over.
I hope you do, and in a way, I hope you don't.
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
Inhibitions are always nice because they're so nice to overcome.
Because I'm very bad, you know.
- In what way?
How are you bad?
In my head.
I have very wicked ideas.
Lots of them.
I'm sure that as you're sitting at your desk you've all kinds of strange things going through your mind.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
Nothing is wrong.
You know that I will do anything you ask.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
I was just finishing up some work.
Mocking up a few photographs.
I used to be a photographer.
Did Bree tell you?
Before I got into publishing.
He knows you're a pimp, Frankie.
He knows you were my pimp.
Excuse me.
Bree, why don't you wait outside?
I always respected Bree.
I'd like to make something clear.
I just got a couple of questions.
I want to make something clear.
I don't go after a girl.
Girl comes to me.
Her choice.
Right?
I'm looking for a man, Tom Grunemann.
Miss Daniel tells me that the date that beat her two years ago might've been that man, and you sent her on that date.
Two years ago?
Sorry.
I understand you use narcotics.
Maybe I could have someone come over and look at your arms.
You know, I may stand better with the cops than you do.
Why don't you sit down and relax?
It was a family matter.
Between the girls.
Had two other girls then.
Two other girls besides Bree.
One of them, Jane McKenna she blows a little jealous of Bree.
Bree comes first.
Evidently she knew this freak who beats up on women.
She cons me into passing him on to Bree so Bree would get hurt.
I didn't know until afterwards.
You can't tell them one of their own in-laws laid a freak on them.
Peace in the family.
Beyond that I don't know.
That's all she wrote.
Did you see the man?
No.
How can I get hold of Jane McKenna?
Baby, would I be telling you all this?
She copped out long ago.
She committed suicide, Baxter.
And the other girl, what's her name?
- Arlyn?
- Page.
How do I find her?
I don't know.
She's a junkie.
Make that scene, you could be anywhere.
Here, San Francisco, they just drop out.
Anything else?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
Not very much.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
Where can I find Arlyn Page?
You're not going to find Arlyn Page, she's a junkie.
Didn't he tell you that he sent me that guy?
Jane McKenna sent you that guy.
Well, she's dead.
Your tapes.
Golly gee, just what I've always wanted.
Dirty phone calls.
What for?
I'm through with your part of it.
You told me what you could.
Tell me, Klute did we get you a little?
Just a little bit?
Us city folk.
The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
All that's so pathetic.
Fuck off!
I'll tell you something, Jack.
It is in the bells that I hear my voices.
Not today when they all rang, that was nothing but jangling.
But here, in this corner where the bells come down from heaven and the echoes linger or in the fields where they come across the quiet of the countryside my voices are in them.
Hark!
Do you hear?
"Dear child of God."
That's just what you said.
At the half-hour they will say, "Be brave, go on."
At the three-quarters they will say, "I am thy help."
When is it the hour.
When the great bell goes after:
"God will save France."
It is then that St. Margaret...
Thank you very much.
The script please.
Very interesting accent.
Booth!
Thank you.
All right, so what do you want, cop?
I can't find Arlyn Page without your help.
I told you you wouldn't find her.
If I can't find her, I can't find him, and if I can't find him then you're in trouble.
So what do you say?
Okay?
It's going to cost.
Time is money.
Okay.
Well, I can pay you $100.
I can make $100 in a lunch break.
$100 is all I've got.
You were very good upstairs.
Kid, will you buy me a coffee?
Buy you lunch.
Do you want lunch?
Come on.
Whenever it suits you.
No, make it Monday at 8:00 p.m.
I said Monday, 8:00 p.m. Now don't be naughty!
He's a lovely man.
Comes here spends a bundle of money, and never even touches the girls.
Comes from Grosse Pointe, has a big house, eight servants but all he wants to do is come here and scrub out my bathroom.
8:00 p.m., Monday Mr. Clean.
Arlyn Page I had let her go.
With the kind of people I get I couldn't have a gal who was zonked out all the time.
You know, I get the crème de la crème.
No, she was trouble and I don't allow any trouble here.
Che si può fare?
Honni soit qui mal y pense.
Do you have any idea where I can look for her?
Try Mama Reese's.
Bree if you get lonely or have no place to go, you come here.
You'll always have a home here.
Why?
She's a junkie.
She was with you after she left Frankie, wasn't she?
Well, she's not now.
I tried to do everything for her.
I took her into my own place, my own little flat on First.
You know that sweet place?
We could of had everything together.
Then the bitch sold my mink!
Do you know anybody that's seen her?
As far as I'm concerned, she's dead!
Who is it?
Bree Daniels.
I couldn't sleep.
I keep thinking I hear noises.
Can I come in?
Come in.
It was probably just my imagination.
Sit down.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
I just...
I don't think he's going to come back again.
I just don't want to be alone right now.
Do you mind if I stay here a while?
If you'd like to go back upstairs, I'd come...
I'd really rather not go upstairs.
Why don't you lie down here?
Sleep here.
Where are you going to sleep?
I'll pull that out.
Lie down.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
What's the matter?
You were terrific.
A real tiger.
Are you upset because you didn't make me come?
I never come with a john.
Don't feel bad about losing your virtue, I sort of knew you would.
Everybody always does.
Arlyn Page?
Yes, she was with me about three months.
She was lucky I kept her that long.
She was out of it.
Somebody said she was streetwalking over on Lexington Avenue.
Or was it Eighth?
You might take a look.
Or try Bill Azure, if you can find him.
Yes, she used to dress the way you do.
The whore?
Yes, I threw her out.
Do you know where she went from here?
Live like animals, her and the man.
Out!
She was living with a man?
He was worse than the whore!
Cappy!
Arlyn Page?
Arlyn, it's Bree!
Cappy, is that you?
It's all right.
Cappy, we got a radio...
Arlyn, it's okay.
Bree, honey I'm waiting for someone.
You've got to help us.
Can't you see I'm strung out?
It'll only take you a couple of minutes.
A couple years ago, Jane sent me a guy that beat me.
If he sees you, he won't come.
Was she seeing a freak, one of her regular johns?
Was he a freak?
Yes.
What about it?
Did he come around a lot?
No, he was an older guy.
It's very important.
- Arlyn, get them out of here!
- I'm begging you!
It's very important, please.
Can you give me a description of him?
Cappy?
Cappy, listen.
No!
Cappy, don't run!
Cappy, don't run!
I've got a radio, Cappy!
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow.
A narcotics addict.
I believed her.
I believed her absolutely.
The man who did those beatings was not Tom Grunemann.
Suppose it wasn't Tom.
Where does that get you?
Tom is still connected because of the letters, whether he wrote them or not.
The only way that I'm going to find him is to find the man who did do the beatings.
The only way I'm going to find him is to pursue Arlyn Page and try to secure from her some kind of identification.
I'll be flying back to Pennsylvania on Friday and I'll fill them in on things.
How is it back there?
I think you're homesick.
I'll be back on Thursday.
John, I want to tell you how much I respect your dedication.
Thank you.
Because I'm very bad, you know.
I have very wicked ideas.
As you're sitting at your desk you have strange things running through your mind.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
Nothing is wrong.
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?
I like to sort of walk around here with no clothes on.
I think people wear clothes much too often, don't you?
I think in the confines of one's house, one should be free of clothing and inhibitions.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
I was trying to get away from a world that I had known, because I don't think it was very good for me, and I found myself looking up its ass...
...and seeing people that I used to know and that I liked a lot that were my friends.
Sort of.
Girls and that could have been me.
I mean, I know I'm not stupid.
I guess I just realized that I don't really give a damn.
What I would really like to do is be faceless and bodiless and be... .. left alone.
You're lucky they're still here.
We don't keep unclaimed possessions in suicide cases more than a year.
Number 497.
Jane McKenna.
I thought there would be more.
Well, there's this man, this detective... .. and I don't know exactly what is...
.. happening or what he wants out of me, or anything like that.
But he took care of me.
Did you feel threatened by it?
I don't know.
When you're used to being lonely and somebody comes in and moves that around, it's sort of scary I guess.
How do you feel when you feel scared?
Angry.
- At whom?
Whoever is making me feel that way.
- Do you feel angry at him?
Half of the time, yes.
How do you feel angry?
What do you want to do?
I want to...
.. manipulate him.
How?
In all the ways that I can manipulate people.
I mean, it's easy to manipulate men.
Right?
They were bringing a freighter down through Kill Van Kull.
Propellers washed it up on top.
Arlyn Page was probably an alias.
Sorry.
Man, can you help me out?
Yes.
What?
I mean, can you help me out?
I mean that's my baby, dead.
I have to get up.
You know what it means, my baby dead.
Got to get up.
Okay?
Lt. Trask, please.
John Klute.
I think we should run down and check on everybody who knew Tom Grunemann.
I don't think the man who wrote the letters was Tom.
Just run down and check on everything.
Talk to you.
You're up, are you?
How are you?
Trask wants you to call him.
He told me about Arlyn.
It probably doesn't have anything to do with anything but just as a precaution when you go out, if you tell me where you're going to go a phone number where I can find you.
Just so I can always keep in touch with you.
Okay?
Sure.
I'm all right.
I know.
I feel physically, that's what's different.
I mean, I feel.
My body feels.
I enjoy making love with him.
Which is a very baffling and bewildering thing, because I've never felt that before.
I wish that I could let things happen and enjoy it, you know for what it is and while it lasts and relax about it.
But all the time, I keep feeling the need to destroy it.
To break it off.
To go back to the comfort of being numb again.
I keep hoping, in a way, that it's going to end.
Because I had more control before, when I was with tricks.
I knew what I was doing and I was setting everything up.
And that's what's so strange:
It's that I'm not setting anything up.
That something is...
You know what this is like, but I've never felt it before.
It's a new thing and it's so strange.
The sensation that something that is flowing from me naturally to somebody else without it's being prettied up or...
I mean, he's seen me horrible!
He's seen me ugly!
He's seen me mean.
He's seen me whorey and it doesn't seem to matter.
He seems to accept me.
I guess having sex with somebody and feeling those sort of feelings towards them is very new to me.
I wish that I didn't keep wanting to destroy it.
You know, I'm trying to stay out of it.
Yes.
I'd love to party with you, but I...
Yes.
Marta, try to get somebody else and if I change my mind I'll call you, okay?
You're not going to get hung up on me, are you?
Yes, sir, can I help you?
Yes, can I have a bag please?
Yes.
A couple of bags please.
Well, let me see how much those weigh.
A pound and a quarter.
I'll have some of those small tomatoes.
No mushy ones.
Okay, thanks.
What do you have in your bag?
What?
What have you got in your bag?
Can I have a cantaloupe, please?
Wait.
He cut up my clothes...
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Hello?
I can be a very bad girl, you know.
I sometimes need a spanking.
I have very wicked ideas.
I will do anything you ask.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
You mustn't be.
You know, there's nothing wrong.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
She can't remember.
Well, it could have been it could have been hidden in his pocket, I've seen one of those.
All right.
I'll wait for you here.
Bree?
Trask and some officers are coming to examine your apartment.
I want you to stay here today and tomorrow.
You'll be safe here.
I'll only be gone for a few minutes tomorrow.
Bree?
Bree?
Well, you look like you've been with many women, but I didn't know... .. if you'd ever paid for a woman before.
I mean, you wouldn't need to.
So if you do, it's obviously because it excites you.
Because you're not a man that would have to pay for a woman.
You could have any woman you wanted.
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
I will do anything you ask or want.
Since you know that there are no limits to my imagination.
I place no moral judgments on anything.
We checked out 42 letters of Tom Grunemann's friends.
And we only came up with one with any similarity to the obscene letter.
All right, there's Tom Grunemann.
Different margins, different spacings.
That's mine.
You said to check out everybody.
Same margins, top and sides.
He does best with his middle fingers.
We get fainter registrations on outside keys.
Notice how he invariably does that with the "T" and the "H."
Who is it?
Peter Cable.
But you have no case.
There's not even a body.
I'm sorry we have to meet here, but I'm pretty rushed for time.
I have a business meeting tonight in Chicago.
Any developments?
I think I can close the case. ...if I can have $500 to purchase Jane McKenna's address book.
I don't understand what you mean.
Well, I've found a contact who will sell me the book.
A little black book containing the name of the client that beat up Bree Daniel.
He is also the man who came into Bree Daniel's apartment yesterday and wrecked it.
We know that now because of the semen that he left in her underwear.
The blood type is AB, and Tom's was type A. It wasn't Tom.
I think this man killed Jane McKenna and Arlyn Page.
I think he drowned them.
I you should prepare yourself for the fact that Tom is possibly dead.
The only way I'll find out is to find him.
I need the money before tomorrow night.
You're meeting him tomorrow night?
Yes.
- He's bringing the book to my apartment.
- At what time?
8:30.
I'll notify the board as soon as I get to Chicago and have them wire you the money immediately.
Thank you, John.
I certainly hope you're wrong about Tom.
Thank you, sir.
Good luck.
I don't want you to do this.
Bree.
I'm just going to a girlfriend's apartment.
I can't stay here, obviously.
Please.
Not with him.
This other girl has a very big apartment, lots of room.
But it's not necessarily how it looks.
Look we all respect each other, right?
I respect you.
Bree respects you.
But you have to respect her, too.
Her best interests.
Mrs. Daniels, I have to close up now.
Leave your name and number with the service and she'll get back to you.
I can't.
Well, I have to close up now.
I almost killed somebody.
Well, I'm certain the doctor would like to speak with you about it.
As a matter of fact, I'll have her call you as soon as she gets home.
I promise.
- Can I use your phone?
- Sure.
Is Mr. Goldfarb there?
Mr. Goldfarb Sr.
I have to talk to somebody.
I'm just a little way across town.
Can I come over?
About half an hour?
Detective Trask, please.
Hi, John Klute.
He didn't take the plane, he cancelled out.
I'm at home in my apartment.
I don't know where she is.
I'll find her.
Okay.
I'll leave word if I go out.
Okay.
I have an appointment with Mr. Goldfarb.
Mr. Goldfarb!
Mr. Goldfarb!
Hello.
What can I do for you?
I'm sorry.
I mean Mr. Goldfarb Sr.
My father left about 15 minutes ago.
He didn't feel so good.
Can I help you?
He's working himself to death, poor man.
You sure I can't help you?
It's not important.
No, really.
I don't mind.
You're going to miss your train, Mr. Goldfarb.
Excuse me.
Did he leave a message for me?
Bree Daniels.
I thought that was for tomorrow!
Mr. Goldfarb's wire.
Yes, Mama, I'm coming right now.
I know you don't like to get in in the middle of the picture!
Yes, right away.
Bye-bye.
We're closing now, Miss.
May I leave Mr. Goldfarb a message?
Poor man, everybody's friend.
Hello?
Hello?
This is Bree Daniels.
Has the doctor checked in yet?
When she does, tell her I'm at 246-1383.
I'll wait five minutes.
How I can reach the doctor?
The doctor hasn't checked in yet.
I'm trying to locate a Miss Bree Daniels.
I'm sorry sir, but we only take messages for the doctor.
Has she called in or anything?
Has she called the doctor at all today?
She left a forwarding number.
- Can I have that number, please?
I'm not allowed to give that out.
I'm a police officer.
Please don't make me prove this.
You must understand my position.
I must comply with the rules.
I understand all that.
Will you just give me the number, please?
Can we talk about this reasonably?
I know you're expecting some kind of extravagant behavior but do you believe me?
Yes.
We can talk?
Well, it's just an ordinary matter.
I'm a very well-off man.
I have a position to respect I would feel personally, very uncomfortable to be connected with a certain kind of woman.
I'm sure you understand what I mean.
Look, John Klute works for me.
I know you're his contact.
I know he's trying to acquire Jane McKenna's book.
I'm in a position to offer more for it than he can.
You don't understand what I'm talking about, do you?
Yes.
Jane McKenna's book.
And I'll try to get it for you.
No.
Obviously you're frightened and you're lying.
No, I'm not.
I will, I'll try to get it for you.
Is this something Klute's invented.
Is this a trap for me?
Klute knows about me, doesn't he?
Knows what about you?
Then everybody knows about me.
So, it doesn't make any difference what I do anymore, does it?
I've no idea what I'm going to do and I'm so deeply puzzled.
I've done terrible things.
I've killed three people.
And yet, I don't consider myself a terrible man.
No more than others.
See, Tom Grunemann discovered me.
We were here on business together and he found me and Jane McKenna in my hotel room.
She had become hysterical and she started screaming and I guess I hit her.
I don't actually recall how it all happened so quickly.
Anyway, she fell and hit her head, and that's when Tom came in the room.
I guess he must've heard her screaming.
But I never understood why she did that.
She had never screamed before.
It was the revulsion and the contempt that I saw on his face and the certainty that sooner or later he would use it against me within the company.
I tried to endure that as long as I possibly could.
You just want me to keep on talking, don't you?
No, I don't.
I do understand.
I really do.
Well, that's what you all do.
You make a man think that he's accepted.
It's all just a great big game to you.
You're all obviously too lazy and too warped to do anything meaningful with your life, so you prey upon the sexual fantasies of others.
I'm sure it comes as no great surprise to you when I say that there are little corners in everyone which were better off left alone.
Little sicknesses, weaknesses, which should never be exposed.
That's your stock in trade, isn't it, a man's weakness?
I was never really fully aware of mine until you brought them out.
How far out of town are we?
Five miles outside of New York.
- Do you mind if I turn the lights down?
No, it's up to you.
Turn the light out if you'd like.
My name is Peter Cable.
I work for the Tole American Corporation which is situated in Pennsylvania and in New York.
I would not be telling you these things if my intentions weren't honorable.
You look familiar to me.
- In what way?
I don't know.
Your face looks familiar to me.
I guess I have a confession to make.
We did meet before.
About two years ago.
I often wondered whatever happened to Arlyn Page and here you are.
Yeah, I remember.
Listen... .. l've got get out of here.
I mean I can't...
I remember you.
Well, what do you remember?
- You beat me up, that's what you did!
It's okay.
Just freaked me out for a minute, that's all.
I promise to drive you back afterwards.
Okay.
Why don't you just tell me what you'd like, and then after you tell me what you'd like...
- I'd like to spend some time with you.
I have been looking for you for two years.
- Why?
That's my business.
I will say that you gave me a great deal of pleasure.
I saw in you things that I had not seen in other women of your profession.
I will not harm you at all physically.
It's all right.
No, it's not all right, and you know it's not all right.
No, it is all right.
If that's what you...
But, you have to tell me first.
If that's what you want that's fine.
- Arlyn why don't you lie down on the bed and make yourself comfortable.
I'll not strap you in, I'll not tie you down.
Just lie down on the bed, please.
Be comfortable.
Nothing's going to happen.
Nothing's going to happen.
Okay.
Why don't you make yourself comfortable?
- I am perfectly comfortable.
Just put your head down.
You have such lovely long blonde hair.
Turn your head.
Like that.
Don't!
Don't!
I've explained to him what I have to do and I think he understands.
What could ever happen for us?
I mean, we're so different.
I know enough about myself to know that whatever lies in store for me it's not going to be setting up housekeeping with somebody in Tuscarora and darning socks and doing all that.
I'd go out of my mind.
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I don't know how I feel about him.
It's so hard for me to say it!
God!
To say what?
- I'm going to miss him.
Bree Daniels.
How is Roy?
Well, I'm leaving town right now and I don't expect to be back.
You're very nice.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
I have no idea what's going to happen.
I just can't stay in the city, you know?
Maybe I'll come back.
You'll probably see me next week.
We've got two tons of potatoes.
Tom!
I'll drink to that.
Did you know the subject, Thomas Grunemann?
- Yes.
- Very well.
He was my best friend.
We grew up together.
Can you account for his disappearance in anyway?
- Mrs. Grunemann?
- No.
Did he recently appear to be agitated or depressed in any way?
No.
Mr. Cable, at the plant did he voice any grievance or discontent about his work there?
Not at all.
As a matter of fact, Tom operated best when he was under pressure.
Please forgive me, Mrs. Grunemann, but I have to ask.
Did your husband ever show any moral or sexual problems or peculiarities?
No.
Any marital problems in general, that is?
We were very happy.
Did he ever mention specifically, a girl or a woman in New York City?
No.
- No.
- Why?
We recovered in his desk at the plant in one of the drawers a typewritten letter that was evidently written on the Friday before he disappeared.
It was written to a girl in New York City and we contacted the police.
They brought her in, questioned her and she said that she had received six or seven letters of this kind.
Can I see it?
Well, it's an obscene letter, Mrs. Grunemann.
I would like to see it.
I would like you to remember that it was written by a very disturbed man.
I don't believe it.
I'd like you to know that situations of this kind are not unique.
A man will lead a double life.
A Jekyll-and-Hyde existence and his wife has no idea what's going on.
Has anybody talked to you about the financial arrangements?
Well, that depends, naturally, on how long you want me for and what you want to do.
I know you.
It will be very nice.
I'd like to spend the evening with you if it's...
If you'd like that.
Have you ever been with a woman before?
Paying her?
Do you like it?
I mean, I have the feeling that that turns you on very particularly.
What turns me on is because I have a good imagination and I like pleasing.
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?
I think in the confines of one's house, one should be free of clothing and inhibitions.
Inhibitions are always nice because they're so nice to overcome.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not.
As long as you don't hurt me more than I like to be hurt I will do anything you ask.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
You mustn't be.
You know, there's nothing wrong.
Nothing is wrong.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
All right.
Would you stand up, please?
- Hello.
- Hi.
Hi, can I see your eyes?
Let me see your hair.
- Take your hat off.
- Take my hat off?
Yeah.
Okay.
- Too pretty.
- Too pretty.
Now, that's the color.
The coloring is great.
I don't know.
- It's not quite it though.
- No, not really.
Hello.
Can I see your hands?
- Thank you.
- She's got funny hands.
- Hi.
- She is great.
- Beautiful eyes.
- Yes.
- All right.
That's the coloring.
- Yeah, let me see you smile.
- I think she has that cross between...
- She's great.
But I've seen you before.
- I think so.
- Have you done any cosmetic ads?
- Yes, I have.
- You have?
- How do they send people with a conflict?
- It's got to be a new face.
Call that agency.
- Irene Dunne would've had it.
- That would be perfect.
- C minus.
- C minus.
- Got to find her today.
- That's it.
Thank you, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
I'm exhausted.
One more day of this and I'll plop.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Just have a seat, please.
It's been six months.
Tom Grunemann has been missing for half a year.
And all the FBI has to offer is a report that must bore even you.
There are thousands of honest, decent men who simply disappear every year.
Neither Mrs. Grunemann nor I are willing to just dismiss this case.
And therefore we feel entitled to investigate on our own.
You're entitled.
There are some very competent...
John Klute offered us his services, and we've accepted.
Klute knew Tom, and he has many ideas about the case.
Have you ever done missing persons work before?
No.
- Have you spent any time in the city?
- No.
Well, speaking frankly...
You're wondering why we thought of Klute?
Frankly he's interested.
And he cares.
Why didn't you ever find out anything from that girl?
We held her under surveillance expecting your boy Grunemann to show up there.
He didn't.
We arrested her on a C.P. Charge.
Convicted.
Two months women's city prison.
Offered to reduce sentence.
She cooperated.
She thought she remembered him from those letters from before.
She made that connection.
But she hadn't seen him since then and couldn't identify his photograph.
A good call girl, she'll turn 600 or 700 tricks a year.
Faces get blurred.
And since then, she's reported several incidents like breather calls, anonymous phone calls.
Also, somebody may be following her, watching her.
Things like that.
So I guess it's conceivable that Grunemann's still around there.
Still bugging her.
Hey, Trina!
Bree.
Listen, I could use a quick $50.
You got a commuter for me?
Terrific.
Right.
Terrific.
Yeah. 'Bye.
Hi.
I'm Bree.
Yeah.
Come in, please.
I'm glad to know you, Bree.
I'm glad you could come.
Sit down, please.
Where are you from?
Can I get you a drink?
Yeah, I'd like a ginger ale.
Thank you.
I'm from Chicago.
You come to New York often?
No, I don't come to New York too often.
- Too bad.
- Three times a year maybe.
What kind of party did you have in mind?
We could have a nice half-and-half party for $50.
We could have a good time for $50.
Or if you wanted something extra, it would be a little more.
- Maybe a nice...
- Listen, would it be all right...
Tell me what you want.
Tell me what you want.
That sounds fantastic.
That's so exciting.
But it's going to cost you more.
That's fantastic.
That's going to be $100.
- Sure, fine.
- Yeah.
- Yes, very good.
- $100.
Very good.
I like to get business done at the beginning.
That way we don't have to think about it, then we can just have a good time.
I like your mind.
Yes.
So.
Chicago.
This is the bed?
This is the bed.
Very nice.
There's the bed in operating position.
You're so nice.
Come here.
Angel.
My angel!
"We gather together
"to ask the Lord's blessing
"He hastens
"and chastens his wisdom divine
"and from the beginning
"the fight we were winning
"Lord, be at our side...
"divine"
It's 12:00 a.m. This is Jim Donnelly, WNEW News.
Con Edison has again resorted to a cutback in voltage to conserve generating capacity.
At three percent...
Hello?
Hello?
- Who is it?
- Miss Daniel, my name is Klute.
John Klute.
And I'd like to talk to you.
- What do you want?
- My name is John Klute.
You said that.
I'm an investigator.
I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
- Who?
- Tom Grunemann.
He wrote you some letters.
Wow.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania.
He disappeared from there last December.
- I've been hired to look for him.
- Why?
You know what I'm talking about, Miss Daniel.
Honest.
Can I ask you some questions please?
Do you have any identification?
You're not a cop?
You're not FBI?
You're a private detective?
And you just want to ask me some questions?
- They're not very recent.
That's last year.
- They're quite good.
What have you done that I might have seen on Broadway or off-Broadway?
- Well, I study with George Tainter.
- George?
George is very good.
He's a good man to begin with.
I've been in two of his productions.
- Two of his workshop productions.
- Workshop.
Well, they're very nice.
How do you feel about being an actress?
- I like it very much.
- You think you know yourself?
- As much as anybody.
- Do you really know yourself?
- No.
- That's very important.
- I forget myself when I act.
- You can't forget yourself.
You have to know yourself and kind of like yourself.
You have to relate.
Relate to people.
I had an identity crisis two years ago and since then I've been working to know myself.
That's very important.
Don't hide your face.
You have a nice face, you shouldn't hide it.
Excuse me just a second.
Julian?
Yes, okay, send her in.
Well, I'm very busy.
Thank you for stopping by.
If you're in anything off-off-Broadway...
How are you today?
I won't be able to come back anymore.
I'm sorry.
Because I just can't afford it.
Did I fail you, Bree?
I come here all the time, I pay you all this money and why do I still want to trick?
Why do I still walk by a phone and want to pick up the phone and call?
Did you think I had some magic potion?
You'd come in and tell me your problem and I would just take it away?
What's the difference between going on a call as a model or an actress, as a call girl?
You're successful as a call girl...
Because when you're a call girl you control it, that's why.
Because someone wants you.
Not me.
I mean, there are some johns that I have regularly that want me and that's terrific.
But they want a woman and I know I'm good.
I arrive at their hotel or their apartment and they're usually nervous, which is fine, because I'm not.
I know what I'm doing.
For an hour I'm the best actress in the world.
I'm the best fuck in the world.
And...
Why did you say you're the best actress in the world?
- At that time?
- Because it's an act.
That's what's nice about it.
You don't have to feel anything.
You don't have to care about anything.
You don't have to like anybody.
You just lead them by the ring in their nose in the direction they think they want to go.
You get a lot of money out of them in as short period of time as possible.
You control it and you call the shots and I always feel just great afterwards.
- And you enjoyed it?
- No.
Why not?
You say there's nothing wrong.
Why not?
You said...
There's a difference.
I don't think there's anything wrong with it morally.
I didn't enjoy it physically.
I came to enjoy it because it made me feel good.
It made me feel like I wasn't alone.
It made me feel that I had some control over myself, that I had some control over my life.
That I could determine things for myself.
I don't know.
I don't know why I'm here.
It's just so silly to think that somebody else can help anybody, isn't it?
I could come over tonight.
Are you alone?
In about an hour.
Okay.
See you in an hour.
Bree.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Enjoy.
- It's good to see you again.
- Likewise.
I've just got back from Cannes, you know.
And I...
Well I have something rather exciting to tell you.
Yes?
Cannes was very amusing.
We played baccarat and chemin de fer.
A very nice little Italian marquis was rather enthusiastic about me.
But a young man can be so silly.
Then one night at the gambling tables I saw him.
A stranger, he was looking at me.
He was standing very still on the other side of the room and his eyes were looking right into me.
And I knew that for the first time in my life...
Please.
Not young.
He wasn't young.
He had gray sideburns.
- Actually, he looked rather like you.
- Yes?
No one could tell me who he was.
Was he an exiled prince or a mercenary?
But there was a feeling stirring inside me, a pagan feeling.
The next day on the beach in my beach pavilion...
It was so warm on the sand and I saw him again.
He was staring at me.
His eyes were burning into me.
I was helpless.
He didn't even have to say anything, and I knew.
I knew that somehow...
You know, I've never liked young men.
And I knew that he would awaken something in me that no young man had ever awakened.
He was so wise and he taught me so many things with his hands.
In his eyes I felt so beautiful.
Miss Daniel.
Can I come upstairs and ask you some questions now?
You bastard!
Is this the shakedown, hon?
You picked a loser.
I don't have it!
I'm looking for Tom...
You think I'd live in this kip if I were taking calls full-time?
- I'd be back on Park Avenue.
- Can I ask you some questions?
Or you'll get me thrown back in the brig, you mean?
Have a seat.
Would you like some wine?
- Or some beer?
- No, thank you.
There isn't any beer anyway.
I've already told the police everything I know.
I don't even remember the schlub!
They showed me that already.
I understand this is Grunemann.
I told them, I don't remember.
Family-type man.
It figures.
Look will you please just try to get it from my side?
A year ago I was in the life full-time.
Living on Park Avenue.
This very nice apartment, leather furniture.
And then the cops dropped on me.
They caged me.
Started asking me about a guy that I'm supposed to have seen a year before that!
Two years ago!
He could be in Yemen!
Grunemann, what does that mean?
It's a name, I don't know him!
And they start showing me these pictures, and they don't mean anything to me.
Then they started asking me if I'd been getting letters from some guy out in Cabbageville.
Tuscarora.
Yeah, all right, I had been.
Very sick letters.
So they said, "Well, that's, Grunemann.
"So would you please tell us when you and he..."
Well, there was a guy once.
A freak.
Could've been him.
Apparently Grunemann liked to beat up on girls.
Well, this guy hired me and then he tried to kill me and that was about two years ago.
Tommy, allie allie in free, kid.
I got the gumdrops.
You remind me of my uncle.
What else do you remember about the man who beat you up?
Nothing.
Except that he wasn't kidding, that's all.
See, usually it's a fake out.
You probably know about that.
They pretend to tie you up and whip you while you wear a dress with a cloth belt.
Hell, it's their money, I don't care.
I'll swing from a shower rod and whistle Maytime.
Except this guy really freaked out on it.
But you cannot identify this man as Tom Grunemann?
I can't identify him as anybody!
So, is that it?
Listen why don't you go downstairs...
You have such a nice mouth.
...and get those tapes?
Bring them back up here and we'll have a party you and I.
- Wouldn't that be nice?
What about afterwards, the telephone calls?
Just phone calls, right?
What is it?
The phone rings, you answer it, there's no one there.
Kids having fun, burglars finding empty apartments.
It happens all the time.
It doesn't mean anything.
But you reported that you had been followed.
Look, I'm sorry.
I've been leading everybody astray.
It doesn't...
Okay, I get these feelings, but they're just feelings.
That's just me.
I'm sure you'll find this amusing, but I'm afraid of the dark.
Sometimes I get spooked.
I think I see people and hear things.
I go out in the morning and I think somebody's opened my mailbox.
If there's trash in front of my door I think somebody's trying to freak me out.
It's just nerves.
I'm a nervous broad.
It doesn't mean anything.
Bree Daniel.
How is Ted?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'd love to.
Maybe the next time you're in town?
I'd like to meet you very much.
You've got a nice voice.
I'm having a conversation with a very nice cop.
He's not a cop actually, he's a private...
Is that how you get most of your dates?
Someone gives your name to somebody.
Most of them, yes.
And that's how you met the man who beat you up?
I don't remember.
It was two years ago.
God!
How else do you get dates then, pimps?
You're very square, cookie.
No, pimps don't get dates for you, they just take your money.
The police have given me a list of names.
I'd like to ask you about them.
Frank Ligourin?
I'm sure this is going to amuse you, too.
But I'm really trying to get away from all that.
What about this evening, the old man?
You saw that?
Goddamn you!
He's 70 years old!
His wife's dead.
He's cut garments since he was 14.
He's maybe in his whole life had one week vacation and I'm all he's got!
He never lays a hand on me!
What harm is there in that?
What's your bag, Klute?
What do you like?
You a talker?
A button freak?
Like to have your chest walked around with high-heel shoes?
- You like to have us watch you tinkle?
- Okay.
Or do you get it off wearing women's clothes?
- Goddamn hypocrite squares!
- Okay.
I hope this isn't going to make my cold any worse.
- Now tell me about Frank Ligourin.
- He was my old man.
We broke up.
When?
- When did you break up?
- About eight months ago.
Would you mind not doing that?
What?
Okay?
Well, I thought I could trade you for those tapes.
Doesn't it get lonely down there in your little room?
Maybe I could bring some friends.
I've got some terrific friends.
No, thank you.
Men have paid $200 for me and here you are turning down a freebie.
You could get a perfectly good dishwasher for that.
What are you doing with my keys?
Give me your hand.
I knew it.
Don't be afraid.
I'm going to sit you down on the bed.
There's someone on the roof.
Sit.
Sit!
Tom?
Tom?
- You didn't get him?
- No.
Was it Grunemann?
I didn't see him.
Who sent you on that date?
Frankie Ligourin.
You and I will go talk to Frank Ligourin tomorrow.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not.
Would you like me to hold you?
I'm just trying to figure you out.
I may say not many people have been very successful at that.
That's all right.
I'll figure you out before the evening is over.
I hope you do, and in a way, I hope you don't.
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
Inhibitions are always nice because they're so nice to overcome.
- Because I'm very bad, you know.
- In what way?
How are you bad?
In my head.
I have very wicked ideas.
Lots of them.
I'm sure that as you're sitting at your desk you've all kinds of strange things going through your mind.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
Nothing is wrong.
You know that I will do anything you ask.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
I was just finishing up some work.
Mocking up a few photographs.
I used to be a photographer.
Did Bree tell you?
Before I got into publishing.
He knows you're a pimp, Frankie.
He knows you were my pimp.
Excuse me.
Bree, why don't you wait outside?
I always respected Bree.
I'd like to make something clear.
- I just got a couple of questions.
- I want to make something clear.
I don't go after a girl.
Girl comes to me.
Her choice.
Right?
I'm looking for a man, Tom Grunemann.
Miss Daniel tells me that the date that beat her two years ago might've been that man, and you sent her on that date.
Two years ago?
Sorry.
I understand you use narcotics.
Maybe I could have someone come over and look at your arms.
You know, I may stand better with the cops than you do.
Why don't you sit down and relax?
It was a family matter.
Between the girls.
Had two other girls then.
Two other girls besides Bree.
One of them, Jane McKenna she blows a little jealous of Bree.
Bree comes first.
Evidently she knew this freak who beats up on women.
She cons me into passing him on to Bree so Bree would get hurt.
I didn't know until afterwards.
You can't tell them one of their own in-laws laid a freak on them.
Peace in the family.
Beyond that I don't know.
That's all she wrote.
Did you see the man?
No.
How can I get hold of Jane McKenna?
Baby, would I be telling you all this?
She copped out long ago.
She committed suicide, Baxter.
And the other girl, what's her name?
- Arlyn?
- Page.
How do I find her?
I don't know.
She's a junkie.
Make that scene, you could be anywhere.
Here, San Francisco, they just drop out.
Anything else?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
Not very much.
- Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
- Where can I find Arlyn Page?
You're not going to find Arlyn Page, she's a junkie.
Didn't he tell you that he sent me that guy?
Jane McKenna sent you that guy.
Well, she's dead.
Your tapes.
Golly gee, just what I've always wanted.
Dirty phone calls.
What for?
I'm through with your part of it.
You told me what you could.
Tell me, Klute did we get you a little?
Just a little bit?
Us city folk.
The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
All that's so pathetic.
Fuck off!
I'll tell you something, Jack.
It is in the bells that I hear my voices.
Not today when they all rang, that was nothing but jangling.
But here, in this corner where the bells come down from heaven and the echoes linger or in the fields where they come across the quiet of the countryside my voices are in them.
Hark!
Do you hear?
"Dear child of God."
That's just what you said.
At the half-hour they will say, "Be brave, go on."
At the three-quarters they will say, "I am thy help."
When is it the hour.
When the great bell goes after:
"God will save France."
- It is then that St. Margaret...
- Thank you very much.
The script please.
Very interesting accent.
Booth!
Thank you.
All right, so what do you want, cop?
- I can't find Arlyn Page without your help.
- I told you you wouldn't find her.
If I can't find her, I can't find him, and if I can't find him then you're in trouble.
So what do you say?
Okay?
It's going to cost.
Time is money.
Okay.
Well, I can pay you $100.
- I can make $100 in a lunch break.
- $100 is all I've got.
You were very good upstairs.
Kid, will you buy me a coffee?
Buy you lunch.
Do you want lunch?
Come on.
Whenever it suits you.
No, make it Monday at 8:00 p.m.
I said Monday, 8:00 p.m. Now don't be naughty!
He's a lovely man.
Comes here spends a bundle of money, and never even touches the girls.
Comes from Grosse Pointe, has a big house, eight servants but all he wants to do is come here and scrub out my bathroom.
8:00 p.m., Monday Mr. Clean.
Arlyn Page I had let her go.
With the kind of people I get I couldn't have a gal who was zonked out all the time.
You know, I get the crème de la crème.
No, she was trouble and I don't allow any trouble here.
Che si può fare?
Honni soit qui mal y pense.
Do you have any idea where I can look for her?
Try Mama Reese's.
Bree if you get lonely or have no place to go, you come here.
You'll always have a home here.
Why?
She's a junkie.
She was with you after she left Frankie, wasn't she?
Well, she's not now.
I tried to do everything for her.
I took her into my own place, my own little flat on First.
You know that sweet place?
We could of had everything together.
Then the bitch sold my mink!
- Do you know anybody that's seen her?
- As far as I'm concerned, she's dead!
Who is it?
Bree Daniel.
I couldn't sleep.
I keep thinking I hear noises.
Can I come in?
Come in.
It was probably just my imagination.
Sit down.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
I just...
I don't think he's going to come back again.
I just don't want to be alone right now.
Do you mind if I stay here a while?
- Lf you'd like to go back upstairs, I'd come...
- I'd really rather not go upstairs.
Why don't you lie down here?
Sleep here.
- Where are you going to sleep?
- I'll pull that out.
Lie down.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
What's the matter?
You were terrific.
A real tiger.
Are you upset because you didn't make me come?
I never come with a john.
Don't feel bad about losing your virtue, I sort of knew you would.
Everybody always does.
Arlyn Page?
Yes, she was with me about three months.
She was lucky I kept her that long.
She was out of it.
Somebody said she was streetwalking over on Lexington Avenue.
Or was it Eighth?
You might take a look.
Or try Bill Azure, if you can find him.
Yes, she used to dress the way you do.
The whore?
Yes, I threw her out.
Do you know where she went from here?
Live like animals, her and the man.
Out!
She was living with a man?
He was worse than the whore!
Cappy!
- Arlyn Page?
- Arlyn, it's Bree!
Cappy, is that you?
- It's all right.
- Cappy, we got a radio...
Arlyn, it's okay.
Bree, honey I'm waiting for someone.
You've got to help us.
Can't you see I'm strung out?
It'll only take you a couple of minutes.
A couple years ago, Jane sent me a guy that beat me.
If he sees you, he won't come.
Was she seeing a freak, one of her regular johns?
Was he a freak?
Yes.
What about it?
Did he come around a lot?
No, he was an older guy.
It's very important.
- Arlyn, get them out of here!
- I'm begging you!
It's very important, please.
- Can you give me a description of him?
- Cappy?
- Cappy, listen.
No!
- Cappy, don't run!
Cappy, don't run!
I've got a radio, Cappy!
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow.
A narcotics addict.
I believed her.
I believed her absolutely.
The man who did those beatings was not Tom Grunemann.
Suppose it wasn't Tom.
Where does that get you?
Tom is still connected because of the letters, whether he wrote them or not.
The only way that I'm going to find him is to find the man who did do the beatings.
The only way I'm going to find him is to pursue Arlyn Page and try to secure from her some kind of identification.
I'll be flying back to Pennsylvania on Friday and I'll fill them in on things.
How is it back there?
I think you're homesick.
I'll be back on Thursday.
John, I want to tell you how much I respect your dedication.
Thank you.
Because I'm very bad, you know.
I have very wicked ideas.
As you're sitting at your desk you have strange things running through your mind.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
Nothing is wrong.
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?
I like to sort of walk around here with no clothes on.
I think people wear clothes much too often, don't you?
I think in the confines of one's house, one should be free of clothing and inhibitions.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
I was trying to get away from a world that I had known, because I don't think it was very good for me, and I found myself looking up its ass...
...and seeing people that I used to know and that I liked a lot that were my friends.
Sort of.
Girls and that could have been me.
I mean, I know I'm not stupid.
I guess I just realized that I don't really give a damn.
What I would really like to do is be faceless and bodiless and be left alone.
You're lucky they're still here.
We don't keep unclaimed possessions in suicide cases more than a year.
Number 497.
Jane McKenna.
I thought there would be more.
Well, there's this man, this detective and I don't know exactly what is happening or what he wants out of me, or anything like that.
But he took care of me.
Did you feel threatened by it?
I don't know.
When you're used to being lonely and somebody comes in and moves that around, it's sort of scary I guess.
How do you feel when you feel scared?
- Angry.
- At whom?
- Whoever is making me feel that way.
- Do you feel angry at him?
Half of the time, yes.
How do you feel angry?
What do you want to do?
I want to manipulate him.
How?
In all the ways that I can manipulate people.
I mean, it's easy to manipulate men.
Right?
They were bringing a freighter down through Kill Van Kull.
Propellers washed it up on top.
Arlyn Page was probably an alias.
- Sorry.
- Man, can you help me out?
Yes.
What?
I mean, can you help me out?
I mean that's my baby, dead.
I have to get up.
- You know what it means, my baby dead.
- Got to get up.
Okay?
Lt. Trask, please.
John Klute.
I think we should run down and check on everybody who knew Tom Grunemann.
I don't think the man who wrote the letters was Tom.
Just run down and check on everything.
Talk to you.
You're up, are you?
How are you?
Trask wants you to call him.
He told me about Arlyn.
It probably doesn't have anything to do with anything but just as a precaution when you go out, if you tell me where you're going to go a phone number where I can find you.
Just so I can always keep in touch with you.
Okay?
Sure.
I'm all right.
I know.
I feel physically, that's what's different.
I mean, I feel.
My body feels.
I enjoy making love with him.
Which is a very baffling and bewildering thing, because I've never felt that before.
I wish that I could let things happen and enjoy it, you know for what it is and while it lasts and relax about it.
But all the time, I keep feeling the need to destroy it.
To break it off.
To go back to the comfort of being numb again.
I keep hoping, in a way, that it's going to end.
Because I had more control before, when I was with tricks.
I knew what I was doing and I was setting everything up.
And that's what's so strange:
It's that I'm not setting anything up.
That something is...
You know what this is like, but I've never felt it before.
It's a new thing and it's so strange.
The sensation that something that is flowing from me naturally to somebody else without it's being prettied up or...
I mean, he's seen me horrible!
He's seen me ugly!
He's seen me mean.
He's seen me whorey and it doesn't seem to matter.
He seems to accept me.
I guess having sex with somebody and feeling those sort of feelings towards them is very new to me.
I wish that I didn't keep wanting to destroy it.
You know, I'm trying to stay out of it.
Yes.
I'd love to party with you, but I...
Yes.
Marta, try to get somebody else and if I change my mind I'll call you, okay?
You're not going to get hung up on me, are you?
- Yes, sir, can I help you?
- Yes, can I have a bag please?
- Yes.
- A couple of bags please.
Well, let me see how much those weigh.
- A pound and a quarter.
- I'll have some of those small tomatoes.
- No mushy ones.
- Okay, thanks.
- What do you have in your bag?
- What?
What have you got in your bag?
Can I have a cantaloupe, please?
Wait.
He cut up my clothes...
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Hello?
I can be a very bad girl, you know.
I sometimes need a spanking.
I have very wicked ideas.
I will do anything you ask.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
You mustn't be.
You know, there's nothing wrong.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
She can't remember.
Well, it could have been it could have been hidden in his pocket, I've seen one of those.
All right.
I'll wait for you here.
Bree?
Trask and some officers are coming to examine your apartment.
I want you to stay here today and tomorrow.
You'll be safe here.
I'll only be gone for a few minutes tomorrow.
Bree?
Bree?
Well, you look like you've been with many women, but I didn't know if you'd ever paid for a woman before.
I mean, you wouldn't need to.
So if you do, it's obviously because it excites you.
Because you're not a man that would have to pay for a woman.
You could have any woman you wanted.
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
I will do anything you ask or want.
Since you know that there are no limits to my imagination.
I place no moral judgments on anything.
We checked out 42 letters of Tom Grunemann's friends.
And we only came up with one with any similarity to the obscene letter.
All right, there's Tom Grunemann.
Different margins, different spacings.
That's mine.
You said to check out everybody.
Same margins, top and sides.
He does best with his middle fingers.
We get fainter registrations on outside keys.
Notice how he invariably does that with the "T" and the "H."
Who is it?
Peter Cable.
But you have no case.
There's not even a body.
I'm sorry we have to meet here, but I'm pretty rushed for time.
I have a business meeting tonight in Chicago.
Any developments?
I think I can close the case. ...if I can have $500 to purchase Jane McKenna's address book.
I don't understand what you mean.
Well, I've found a contact who will sell me the book.
A little black book containing the name of the client that beat up Bree Daniel.
He is also the man who came into Bree Daniel's apartment yesterday and wrecked it.
We know that now because of the semen that he left in her underwear.
The blood type is AB, and Tom's was type A. It wasn't Tom.
I think this man killed Jane McKenna and Arlyn Page.
I think he drowned them.
I you should prepare yourself for the fact that Tom is possibly dead.
The only way I'll find out is to find him.
I need the money before tomorrow night.
- You're meeting him tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- He's bringing the book to my apartment.
- At what time?
8:30.
I'll notify the board as soon as I get to Chicago and have them wire you the money immediately.
Thank you, John.
I certainly hope you're wrong about Tom.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.
I don't want you to do this.
Bree.
I'm just going to a girlfriend's apartment.
I can't stay here, obviously.
Please.
Not with him.
This other girl has a very big apartment, lots of room.
But it's not necessarily how it looks.
Look we all respect each other, right?
I respect you.
Bree respects you.
But you have to respect her, too.
Her best interests.
Mrs. Daniel, I have to close up now.
Leave your name and number with the service and she'll get back to you.
I can't.
Well, I have to close up now.
I almost killed somebody.
Well, I'm certain the doctor would like to speak with you about it.
As a matter of fact, I'll have her call you as soon as she gets home.
I promise.
- Can I use your phone?
- Sure.
Is Mr. Goldfarb there?
Mr. Goldfarb Sr.
I have to talk to somebody.
I'm just a little way across town.
Can I come over?
About half an hour?
Detective Trask, please.
Hi, John Klute.
He didn't take the plane, he cancelled out.
I'm at home in my apartment.
I don't know where she is.
I'll find her.
Okay.
I'll leave word if I go out.
Okay.
I have an appointment with Mr. Goldfarb.
Mr. Goldfarb!
Mr. Goldfarb!
Hello.
What can I do for you?
I'm sorry.
I mean Mr. Goldfarb Sr.
My father left about 15 minutes ago.
He didn't feel so good.
- Can I help you?
- He's working himself to death, poor man.
- You sure I can't help you?
- It's not important.
No, really.
I don't mind.
You're going to miss your train, Mr. Goldfarb.
Excuse me.
Did he leave a message for me?
Bree Daniel.
I thought that was for tomorrow!
Mr. Goldfarb's wire.
Yes, Mama, I'm coming right now.
I know you don't like to get in in the middle of the picture!
Yes, right away.
Bye-bye.
We're closing now, Miss.
May I leave Mr. Goldfarb a message?
Poor man, everybody's friend.
Hello?
Hello?
This is Bree Daniel.
Has the doctor checked in yet?
When she does, tell her I'm at 246-1383.
I'll wait five minutes.
How I can reach the doctor?
The doctor hasn't checked in yet.
I'm trying to locate a Miss Bree Daniel.
I'm sorry sir, but we only take messages for the doctor.
Has she called in or anything?
Has she called the doctor at all today?
- She left a forwarding number.
- Can I have that number, please?
I'm not allowed to give that out.
I'm a police officer.
Please don't make me prove this.
You must understand my position.
I must comply with the rules.
I understand all that.
Will you just give me the number, please?
Can we talk about this reasonably?
I know you're expecting some kind of extravagant behavior but do you believe me?
Yes.
We can talk?
Well, it's just an ordinary matter.
I'm a very well-off man.
I have a position to respect I would feel personally, very uncomfortable to be connected with a certain kind of woman.
I'm sure you understand what I mean.
Look, John Klute works for me.
I know you're his contact.
I know he's trying to acquire Jane McKenna's book.
I'm in a position to offer more for it than he can.
You don't understand what I'm talking about, do you?
Yes.
Jane McKenna's book.
- And I'll try to get it for you.
- No.
Obviously you're frightened and you're lying.
No, I'm not.
I will, I'll try to get it for you.
Is this something Klute's invented.
Is this a trap for me?
- Klute knows about me, doesn't he?
- Knows what about you?
Then everybody knows about me.
So, it doesn't make any difference what I do anymore, does it?
I've no idea what I'm going to do and I'm so deeply puzzled.
I've done terrible things.
I've killed three people.
And yet, I don't consider myself a terrible man.
No more than others.
See, Tom Grunemann discovered me.
We were here on business together and he found me and Jane McKenna in my hotel room.
She had become hysterical and she started screaming and I guess I hit her.
I don't actually recall how it all happened so quickly.
Anyway, she fell and hit her head, and that's when Tom came in the room.
I guess he must've heard her screaming.
But I never understood why she did that.
She had never screamed before.
It was the revulsion and the contempt that I saw on his face and the certainty that sooner or later he would use it against me within the company.
I tried to endure that as long as I possibly could.
You just want me to keep on talking, don't you?
No, I don't.
I do understand.
I really do.
Well, that's what you all do.
You make a man think that he's accepted.
It's all just a great big game to you.
You're all obviously too lazy and too warped to do anything meaningful with your life, so you prey upon the sexual fantasies of others.
I'm sure it comes as no great surprise to you when I say that there are little corners in everyone which were better off left alone.
Little sicknesses, weaknesses, which should never be exposed.
That's your stock in trade, isn't it, a man's weakness?
I was never really fully aware of mine until you brought them out.
How far out of town are we?
- Five miles outside of New York.
- Do you mind if I turn the lights down?
No, it's up to you.
Turn the light out if you'd like.
My name is Peter Cable.
I work for the Tole American Corporation which is situated in Pennsylvania and in New York.
I would not be telling you these things if my intentions weren't honorable.
- You look familiar to me.
- In what way?
I don't know.
Your face looks familiar to me.
I guess I have a confession to make.
We did meet before.
About two years ago.
I often wondered whatever happened to Arlyn Page and here you are.
Yeah, I remember.
Listen I've got get out of here.
I mean I can't...
I remember you.
- Well, what do you remember?
- You beat me up, that's what you did!
It's okay.
Just freaked me out for a minute, that's all.
I promise to drive you back afterwards.
Okay.
Why don't you just tell me what you'd like, and then...
- ... after you tell me what you'd like...
- I'd like to spend some time with you.
- I have been looking for you for two years.
- Why?
That's my business.
I will say that you gave me a great deal of pleasure.
I saw in you things that I had not seen in other women of your profession.
I will not harm you at all physically.
It's all right.
No, it's not all right, and you know it's not all right.
No, it is all right.
If that's what you...
But, you have to tell me first.
If that's what you want...
- ... that's fine.
- Arlyn why don't you lie down on the bed and make yourself comfortable.
I'll not strap you in, I'll not tie you down.
Just lie down on the bed, please.
Be comfortable.
Nothing's going to happen.
Nothing's going to happen.
Okay.
- Why don't you make yourself comfortable?
- I am perfectly comfortable.
Just put your head down.
You have such lovely long blonde hair.
Turn your head.
Like that.
Don't!
Don't!
I've explained to him what I have to do and I think he understands.
What could ever happen for us?
I mean, we're so different.
I know enough about myself to know that whatever lies in store for me it's not going to be setting up housekeeping with somebody in Tuscarora and darning socks and doing all that.
I'd go out of my mind.
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I don't know how I feel about him.
It's so hard for me to say it!
God!
- To say what?
- I'm going to miss him.
Bree Daniel.
How is Roy?
Well, I'm leaving town right now and I don't expect to be back.
You're very nice.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
I have no idea what's going to happen.
I just can't stay in the city, you know?
Maybe I'll come back.
You'll probably see me next week.
We've got two tons of potatoes.
Tom!
I'll drink to that.
Did you know the subject, Thomas Grunemann?
- Yes.
- Very well.
He was my best friend.
We grew up together.
Can you account for his disappearance in anyway?
- Mrs. Grunemann?
- No.
Did he recently appear to be agitated or depressed in any way?
No.
Mr. Cable, at the plant did he voice any grievance or discontent about his work there?
Not at all.
As a matter of fact, Tom operated best when he was under pressure.
Please forgive me, Mrs. Grunemann, but I have to ask.
Did your husband ever show any moral or sexual problems or peculiarities?
No.
Any marital problems in general, that is?
We were very happy.
Did he ever mention specifically, a girl or a woman in New York City?
No.
- No.
- Why?
We recovered in his desk at the plant in one of the drawers a typewritten letter that was evidently written on the Friday before he disappeared.
It was written to a girl in New York City and we contacted the police.
They brought her in, questioned her and she said that she had received six or seven letters of this kind.
Can I see it?
Well, it's an obscene letter, Mrs. Grunemann.
I would like to see it.
I would like you to remember that it was written by a very disturbed man.
I don't believe it.
I'd like you to know that situations of this kind are not unique.
A man will lead a double life.
A Jekyll-and-Hyde existence and his wife has no idea what's going on.
Has anybody talked to you about the financial arrangements?
Well, that depends, naturally, on how long you want me for and what you want to do.
I know you.
It will be very nice.
I'd like to spend the evening with you if it's...
If you'd like that.
Have you ever been with a woman before?
Paying her?
Do you like it?
I mean, I have the feeling that that turns you on very particularly.
What turns me on is because I have a good imagination and I like pleasing.
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?
I think in the confines of one's house, one should be free of clothing and inhibitions.
Inhibitions are always nice because they're so nice to overcome.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not.
As long as you don't hurt me more than I like to be hurt I will do anything you ask.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
You mustn't be.
You know, there's nothing wrong.
Nothing is wrong.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
All right.
Would you stand up, please?
- Hello.
- Hi.
Hi, can I see your eyes?
Let me see your hair.
- Take your hat off.
- Take my hat off?
Yeah.
Okay.
- Too pretty.
- Too pretty.
Now, that's the color.
The coloring is great.
I don't know.
- It's not quite it though.
- No, not really.
Hello.
Can I see your hands?
- Thank you.
- She's got funny hands.
- Hi.
- She is great.
- Beautiful eyes.
- Yes.
- All right.
That's the coloring.
- Yeah, let me see you smile.
- I think she has that cross between...
- She's great.
But I've seen you before.
- I think so.
- Have you done any cosmetic ads?
- Yes, I have.
- You have?
- How do they send people with a conflict?
- It's got to be a new face.
Call that agency.
- Irene Dunne would've had it.
- That would be perfect.
- C minus.
- C minus.
- Got to find her today.
- That's it.
Thank you, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
I'm exhausted.
One more day of this and I'll plop.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Just have a seat, please.
It's been six months.
Tom Grunemann has been missing for half a year.
And all the FBI has to offer is a report that must bore even you.
There are thousands of honest, decent men who simply disappear every year.
Neither Mrs. Grunemann nor I are willing to just dismiss this case.
And therefore we feel entitled to investigate on our own.
You're entitled.
There are some very competent...
John Klute offered us his services, and we've accepted.
Klute knew Tom, and he has many ideas about the case.
Have you ever done missing persons work before?
No.
- Have you spent any time in the city?
- No.
Well, speaking frankly...
You're wondering why we thought of Klute?
Frankly he's interested.
And he cares.
Why didn't you ever find out anything from that girl?
We held her under surveillance expecting your boy Grunemann to show up there.
He didn't.
We arrested her on a C.P. Charge.
Convicted.
Two months women's city prison.
Offered to reduce sentence.
She cooperated.
She thought she remembered him from those letters from before.
She made that connection.
But she hadn't seen him since then and couldn't identify his photograph.
A good call girl, she'll turn 600 or 700 tricks a year.
Faces get blurred.
And since then, she's reported several incidents like breather calls, anonymous phone calls.
Also, somebody may be following her, watching her.
Things like that.
So I guess it's conceivable that Grunemann's still around there.
Still bugging her.
Hey, Trina!
Bree.
Listen, I could use a quick $50.
You got a commuter for me?
Terrific.
Right.
Terrific.
Yeah. 'Bye.
Hi.
I'm Bree.
Yeah.
Come in, please.
I'm glad to know you, Bree.
I'm glad you could come.
Sit down, please.
Where are you from?
Can I get you a drink?
Yeah, I'd like a ginger ale.
Thank you.
I'm from Chicago.
You come to New York often?
No, I don't come to New York too often.
- Too bad.
- Three times a year maybe.
What kind of party did you have in mind?
We could have a nice half-and-half party for $50.
We could have a good time for $50.
Or if you wanted something extra, it would be a little more.
- Maybe a nice...
- Listen, would it be all right...
Tell me what you want.
Tell me what you want.
That sounds fantastic.
That's so exciting.
But it's going to cost you more.
That's fantastic.
That's going to be $100.
- Sure, fine.
- Yeah.
- Yes, very good.
- $100.
Very good.
I like to get business done at the beginning.
That way we don't have to think about it, then we can just have a good time.
I like your mind.
Yes.
So.
Chicago.
This is the bed?
This is the bed.
Very nice.
There's the bed in operating position.
You're so nice.
Come here.
Angel.
My angel!
"We gather together
"to ask the Lord's blessing
"He hastens
"and chastens his wisdom divine
"and from the beginning
"the fight we were winning
"Lord, be at our side...
"divine"
It's 12:00 a.m. This is Jim Donnelly, WNEW News.
Con Edison has again resorted to a cutback in voltage to conserve generating capacity.
At three percent...
Hello?
Hello?
- Who is it?
- Miss Daniel, my name is Klute.
John Klute.
And I'd like to talk to you.
- What do you want?
- My name is John Klute.
You said that.
I'm an investigator.
I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
- Who?
- Tom Grunemann.
He wrote you some letters.
Wow.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania.
He disappeared from there last December.
- I've been hired to look for him.
- Why?
You know what I'm talking about, Miss Daniel.
Honest.
Can I ask you some questions please?
Do you have any identification?
You're not a cop?
You're not FBI?
You're a private detective?
And you just want to ask me some questions?
- They're not very recent.
That's last year.
- They're quite good.
What have you done that I might have seen on Broadway or off-Broadway?
- Well, I study with George Tainter.
- George?
George is very good.
He's a good man to begin with.
I've been in two of his productions.
- Two of his workshop productions.
- Workshop.
Well, they're very nice.
How do you feel about being an actress?
- I like it very much.
- You think you know yourself?
- As much as anybody.
- Do you really know yourself?
- No.
- That's very important.
- I forget myself when I act.
- You can't forget yourself.
You have to know yourself and kind of like yourself.
You have to relate.
Relate to people.
I had an identity crisis two years ago and since then I've been working to know myself.
That's very important.
Don't hide your face.
You have a nice face, you shouldn't hide it.
Excuse me just a second.
Julian?
Yes, okay, send her in.
Well, I'm very busy.
Thank you for stopping by.
If you're in anything off-off-Broadway...
How are you today?
I won't be able to come back anymore.
I'm sorry.
Because I just can't afford it.
Did I fail you, Bree?
I come here all the time, I pay you all this money and why do I still want to trick?
Why do I still walk by a phone and want to pick up the phone and call?
Did you think I had some magic potion?
You'd come in and tell me your problem and I would just take it away?
What's the difference between going on a call as a model or an actress, as a call girl?
You're successful as a call girl...
Because when you're a call girl you control it, that's why.
Because someone wants you.
Not me.
I mean, there are some johns that I have regularly that want me and that's terrific.
But they want a woman and I know I'm good.
I arrive at their hotel or their apartment and they're usually nervous, which is fine, because I'm not.
I know what I'm doing.
For an hour I'm the best actress in the world.
I'm the best fuck in the world.
And...
Why did you say you're the best actress in the world?
- At that time?
- Because it's an act.
That's what's nice about it.
You don't have to feel anything.
You don't have to care about anything.
You don't have to like anybody.
You just lead them by the ring in their nose in the direction they think they want to go.
You get a lot of money out of them in as short period of time as possible.
You control it and you call the shots and I always feel just great afterwards.
- And you enjoyed it?
- No.
Why not?
You say there's nothing wrong.
Why not?
You said...
There's a difference.
I don't think there's anything wrong with it morally.
I didn't enjoy it physically.
I came to enjoy it because it made me feel good.
It made me feel like I wasn't alone.
It made me feel that I had some control over myself, that I had some control over my life.
That I could determine things for myself.
I don't know.
I don't know why I'm here.
It's just so silly to think that somebody else can help anybody, isn't it?
I could come over tonight.
Are you alone?
In about an hour.
Okay.
See you in an hour.
Bree.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Enjoy.
- It's good to see you again.
- Likewise.
I've just got back from Cannes, you know.
And I...
Well I have something rather exciting to tell you.
Yes?
Cannes was very amusing.
We played baccarat and chemin de fer.
A very nice little Italian marquis was rather enthusiastic about me.
But a young man can be so silly.
Then one night at the gambling tables I saw him.
A stranger, he was looking at me.
He was standing very still on the other side of the room and his eyes were looking right into me.
And I knew that for the first time in my life...
Please.
Not young.
He wasn't young.
He had gray sideburns.
- Actually, he looked rather like you.
- Yes?
No one could tell me who he was.
Was he an exiled prince or a mercenary?
But there was a feeling stirring inside me, a pagan feeling.
The next day on the beach in my beach pavilion...
It was so warm on the sand and I saw him again.
He was staring at me.
His eyes were burning into me.
I was helpless.
He didn't even have to say anything, and I knew.
I knew that somehow...
You know, I've never liked young men.
And I knew that he would awaken something in me that no young man had ever awakened.
He was so wise and he taught me so many things with his hands.
In his eyes I felt so beautiful.
Miss Daniel.
Can I come upstairs and ask you some questions now?
You bastard!
Is this the shakedown, hon?
You picked a loser.
I don't have it!
I'm looking for Tom...
You think I'd live in this kip if I were taking calls full-time?
- I'd be back on Park Avenue.
- Can I ask you some questions?
Or you'll get me thrown back in the brig, you mean?
Have a seat.
Would you like some wine?
- Or some beer?
- No, thank you.
There isn't any beer anyway.
I've already told the police everything I know.
I don't even remember the schlub!
They showed me that already.
I understand this is Grunemann.
I told them, I don't remember.
Family-type man.
It figures.
Look will you please just try to get it from my side?
A year ago I was in the life full-time.
Living on Park Avenue.
This very nice apartment, leather furniture.
And then the cops dropped on me.
They caged me.
Started asking me about a guy that I'm supposed to have seen a year before that!
Two years ago!
He could be in Yemen!
Grunemann, what does that mean?
It's a name, I don't know him!
And they start showing me these pictures, and they don't mean anything to me.
Then they started asking me if I'd been getting letters from some guy out in Cabbageville.
Tuscarora.
Yeah, all right, I had been.
Very sick letters.
So they said, "Well, that's, Grunemann.
"So would you please tell us when you and he..."
Well, there was a guy once.
A freak.
Could've been him.
Apparently Grunemann liked to beat up on girls.
Well, this guy hired me and then he tried to kill me and that was about two years ago.
Tommy, allie allie in free, kid.
I got the gumdrops.
You remind me of my uncle.
What else do you remember about the man who beat you up?
Nothing.
Except that he wasn't kidding, that's all.
See, usually it's a fake out.
You probably know about that.
They pretend to tie you up and whip you while you wear a dress with a cloth belt.
Hell, it's their money, I don't care.
I'll swing from a shower rod and whistle Maytime.
Except this guy really freaked out on it.
But you cannot identify this man as Tom Grunemann?
I can't identify him as anybody!
So, is that it?
Listen why don't you go downstairs...
You have such a nice mouth.
...and get those tapes?
Bring them back up here and we'll have a party you and I.
- Wouldn't that be nice?
What about afterwards, the telephone calls?
Just phone calls, right?
What is it?
The phone rings, you answer it, there's no one there.
Kids having fun, burglars finding empty apartments.
It happens all the time.
It doesn't mean anything.
But you reported that you had been followed.
Look, I'm sorry.
I've been leading everybody astray.
It doesn't...
Okay, I get these feelings, but they're just feelings.
That's just me.
I'm sure you'll find this amusing, but I'm afraid of the dark.
Sometimes I get spooked.
I think I see people and hear things.
I go out in the morning and I think somebody's opened my mailbox.
If there's trash in front of my door I think somebody's trying to freak me out.
It's just nerves.
I'm a nervous broad.
It doesn't mean anything.
Bree Daniel.
How is Ted?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'd love to.
Maybe the next time you're in town?
I'd like to meet you very much.
You've got a nice voice.
I'm having a conversation with a very nice cop.
He's not a cop actually, he's a private...
Is that how you get most of your dates?
Someone gives your name to somebody.
Most of them, yes.
And that's how you met the man who beat you up?
I don't remember.
It was two years ago.
God!
How else do you get dates then, pimps?
You're very square, cookie.
No, pimps don't get dates for you, they just take your money.
The police have given me a list of names.
I'd like to ask you about them.
Frank Ligourin?
I'm sure this is going to amuse you, too.
But I'm really trying to get away from all that.
What about this evening, the old man?
You saw that?
Goddamn you!
He's 70 years old!
His wife's dead.
He's cut garments since he was 14.
He's maybe in his whole life had one week vacation and I'm all he's got!
He never lays a hand on me!
What harm is there in that?
What's your bag, Klute?
What do you like?
You a talker?
A button freak?
Like to have your chest walked around with high-heel shoes?
- You like to have us watch you tinkle?
- Okay.
Or do you get it off wearing women's clothes?
- Goddamn hypocrite squares!
- Okay.
I hope this isn't going to make my cold any worse.
- Now tell me about Frank Ligourin.
- He was my old man.
We broke up.
When?
- When did you break up?
- About eight months ago.
Would you mind not doing that?
What?
Okay?
Well, I thought I could trade you for those tapes.
Doesn't it get lonely down there in your little room?
Maybe I could bring some friends.
I've got some terrific friends.
No, thank you.
Men have paid $200 for me and here you are turning down a freebie.
You could get a perfectly good dishwasher for that.
What are you doing with my keys?
Give me your hand.
I knew it.
Don't be afraid.
I'm going to sit you down on the bed.
There's someone on the roof.
Sit.
Sit!
Tom?
Tom?
- You didn't get him?
- No.
Was it Grunemann?
I didn't see him.
Who sent you on that date?
Frankie Ligourin.
You and I will go talk to Frank Ligourin tomorrow.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not.
Would you like me to hold you?
I'm just trying to figure you out.
I may say not many people have been very successful at that.
That's all right.
I'll figure you out before the evening is over.
I hope you do, and in a way, I hope you don't.
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
Inhibitions are always nice because they're so nice to overcome.
- Because I'm very bad, you know.
- In what way?
How are you bad?
In my head.
I have very wicked ideas.
Lots of them.
I'm sure that as you're sitting at your desk you've all kinds of strange things going through your mind.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
Nothing is wrong.
You know that I will do anything you ask.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
I was just finishing up some work.
Mocking up a few photographs.
I used to be a photographer.
Did Bree tell you?
Before I got into publishing.
He knows you're a pimp, Frankie.
He knows you were my pimp.
Excuse me.
Bree, why don't you wait outside?
I always respected Bree.
I'd like to make something clear.
- I just got a couple of questions.
- I want to make something clear.
I don't go after a girl.
Girl comes to me.
Her choice.
Right?
I'm looking for a man, Tom Grunemann.
Miss Daniel tells me that the date that beat her two years ago might've been that man, and you sent her on that date.
Two years ago?
Sorry.
I understand you use narcotics.
Maybe I could have someone come over and look at your arms.
You know, I may stand better with the cops than you do.
Why don't you sit down and relax?
It was a family matter.
Between the girls.
Had two other girls then.
Two other girls besides Bree.
One of them, Jane McKenna she blows a little jealous of Bree.
Bree comes first.
Evidently she knew this freak who beats up on women.
She cons me into passing him on to Bree so Bree would get hurt.
I didn't know until afterwards.
You can't tell them one of their own in-laws laid a freak on them.
Peace in the family.
Beyond that I don't know.
That's all she wrote.
Did you see the man?
No.
How can I get hold of Jane McKenna?
Baby, would I be telling you all this?
She copped out long ago.
She committed suicide, Baxter.
And the other girl, what's her name?
- Arlyn?
- Page.
How do I find her?
I don't know.
She's a junkie.
Make that scene, you could be anywhere.
Here, San Francisco, they just drop out.
Anything else?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
Not very much.
- Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
- Where can I find Arlyn Page?
You're not going to find Arlyn Page, she's a junkie.
Didn't he tell you that he sent me that guy?
Jane McKenna sent you that guy.
Well, she's dead.
Your tapes.
Golly gee, just what I've always wanted.
Dirty phone calls.
What for?
I'm through with your part of it.
You told me what you could.
Tell me, Klute did we get you a little?
Just a little bit?
Us city folk.
The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
All that's so pathetic.
Fuck off!
I'll tell you something, Jack.
It is in the bells that I hear my voices.
Not today when they all rang, that was nothing but jangling.
But here, in this corner where the bells come down from heaven and the echoes linger or in the fields where they come across the quiet of the countryside my voices are in them.
Hark!
Do you hear?
"Dear child of God."
That's just what you said.
At the half-hour they will say, "Be brave, go on."
At the three-quarters they will say, "I am thy help."
When is it the hour.
When the great bell goes after:
"God will save France."
- It is then that St. Margaret...
- Thank you very much.
The script please.
Very interesting accent.
Booth!
Thank you.
All right, so what do you want, cop?
- I can't find Arlyn Page without your help.
- I told you you wouldn't find her.
If I can't find her, I can't find him, and if I can't find him then you're in trouble.
So what do you say?
Okay?
It's going to cost.
Time is money.
Okay.
Well, I can pay you $100.
- I can make $100 in a lunch break.
- $100 is all I've got.
You were very good upstairs.
Kid, will you buy me a coffee?
Buy you lunch.
Do you want lunch?
Come on.
Whenever it suits you.
No, make it Monday at 8:00 p.m.
I said Monday, 8:00 p.m. Now don't be naughty!
He's a lovely man.
Comes here spends a bundle of money, and never even touches the girls.
Comes from Grosse Pointe, has a big house, eight servants but all he wants to do is come here and scrub out my bathroom.
8:00 p.m., Monday Mr. Clean.
Arlyn Page I had let her go.
With the kind of people I get I couldn't have a gal who was zonked out all the time.
You know, I get the crème de la crème.
No, she was trouble and I don't allow any trouble here.
Che si può fare?
Honni soit qui mal y pense.
Do you have any idea where I can look for her?
Try Mama Reese's.
Bree if you get lonely or have no place to go, you come here.
You'll always have a home here.
Why?
She's a junkie.
She was with you after she left Frankie, wasn't she?
Well, she's not now.
I tried to do everything for her.
I took her into my own place, my own little flat on First.
You know that sweet place?
We could of had everything together.
Then the bitch sold my mink!
- Do you know anybody that's seen her?
- As far as I'm concerned, she's dead!
Who is it?
Bree Daniel.
I couldn't sleep.
I keep thinking I hear noises.
Can I come in?
Come in.
It was probably just my imagination.
Sit down.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
I just...
I don't think he's going to come back again.
I just don't want to be alone right now.
Do you mind if I stay here a while?
- Lf you'd like to go back upstairs, I'd come...
- I'd really rather not go upstairs.
Why don't you lie down here?
Sleep here.
- Where are you going to sleep?
- I'll pull that out.
Lie down.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
What's the matter?
You were terrific.
A real tiger.
Are you upset because you didn't make me come?
I never come with a john.
Don't feel bad about losing your virtue, I sort of knew you would.
Everybody always does.
Arlyn Page?
Yes, she was with me about three months.
She was lucky I kept her that long.
She was out of it.
Somebody said she was streetwalking over on Lexington Avenue.
Or was it Eighth?
You might take a look.
Or try Bill Azure, if you can find him.
Yes, she used to dress the way you do.
The whore?
Yes, I threw her out.
Do you know where she went from here?
Live like animals, her and the man.
Out!
She was living with a man?
He was worse than the whore!
Cappy!
- Arlyn Page?
- Arlyn, it's Bree!
Cappy, is that you?
- It's all right.
- Cappy, we got a radio...
Arlyn, it's okay.
Bree, honey I'm waiting for someone.
You've got to help us.
Can't you see I'm strung out?
It'll only take you a couple of minutes.
A couple years ago, Jane sent me a guy that beat me.
If he sees you, he won't come.
Was she seeing a freak, one of her regular johns?
Was he a freak?
Yes.
What about it?
Did he come around a lot?
No, he was an older guy.
It's very important.
- Arlyn, get them out of here!
- I'm begging you!
It's very important, please.
- Can you give me a description of him?
- Cappy?
- Cappy, listen.
No!
- Cappy, don't run!
Cappy, don't run!
I've got a radio, Cappy!
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow.
A narcotics addict.
I believed her.
I believed her absolutely.
The man who did those beatings was not Tom Grunemann.
Suppose it wasn't Tom.
Where does that get you?
Tom is still connected because of the letters, whether he wrote them or not.
The only way that I'm going to find him is to find the man who did do the beatings.
The only way I'm going to find him is to pursue Arlyn Page and try to secure from her some kind of identification.
I'll be flying back to Pennsylvania on Friday and I'll fill them in on things.
How is it back there?
I think you're homesick.
I'll be back on Thursday.
John, I want to tell you how much I respect your dedication.
Thank you.
Because I'm very bad, you know.
I have very wicked ideas.
As you're sitting at your desk you have strange things running through your mind.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
Nothing is wrong.
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?
I like to sort of walk around here with no clothes on.
I think people wear clothes much too often, don't you?
I think in the confines of one's house, one should be free of clothing and inhibitions.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
I was trying to get away from a world that I had known, because I don't think it was very good for me, and I found myself looking up its ass...
...and seeing people that I used to know and that I liked a lot that were my friends.
Sort of.
Girls and that could have been me.
I mean, I know I'm not stupid.
I guess I just realized that I don't really give a damn.
What I would really like to do is be faceless and bodiless and be left alone.
You're lucky they're still here.
We don't keep unclaimed possessions in suicide cases more than a year.
Number 497.
Jane McKenna.
I thought there would be more.
Well, there's this man, this detective and I don't know exactly what is happening or what he wants out of me, or anything like that.
But he took care of me.
Did you feel threatened by it?
I don't know.
When you're used to being lonely and somebody comes in and moves that around, it's sort of scary I guess.
How do you feel when you feel scared?
- Angry.
- At whom?
- Whoever is making me feel that way.
- Do you feel angry at him?
Half of the time, yes.
How do you feel angry?
What do you want to do?
I want to manipulate him.
How?
In all the ways that I can manipulate people.
I mean, it's easy to manipulate men.
Right?
They were bringing a freighter down through Kill Van Kull.
Propellers washed it up on top.
Arlyn Page was probably an alias.
- Sorry.
- Man, can you help me out?
Yes.
What?
I mean, can you help me out?
I mean that's my baby, dead.
I have to get up.
- You know what it means, my baby dead.
- Got to get up.
Okay?
Lt. Trask, please.
John Klute.
I think we should run down and check on everybody who knew Tom Grunemann.
I don't think the man who wrote the letters was Tom.
Just run down and check on everything.
Talk to you.
You're up, are you?
How are you?
Trask wants you to call him.
He told me about Arlyn.
It probably doesn't have anything to do with anything but just as a precaution when you go out, if you tell me where you're going to go a phone number where I can find you.
Just so I can always keep in touch with you.
Okay?
Sure.
I'm all right.
I know.
I feel physically, that's what's different.
I mean, I feel.
My body feels.
I enjoy making love with him.
Which is a very baffling and bewildering thing, because I've never felt that before.
I wish that I could let things happen and enjoy it, you know for what it is and while it lasts and relax about it.
But all the time, I keep feeling the need to destroy it.
To break it off.
To go back to the comfort of being numb again.
I keep hoping, in a way, that it's going to end.
Because I had more control before, when I was with tricks.
I knew what I was doing and I was setting everything up.
And that's what's so strange:
It's that I'm not setting anything up.
That something is...
You know what this is like, but I've never felt it before.
It's a new thing and it's so strange.
The sensation that something that is flowing from me naturally to somebody else without it's being prettied up or...
I mean, he's seen me horrible!
He's seen me ugly!
He's seen me mean.
He's seen me whorey and it doesn't seem to matter.
He seems to accept me.
I guess having sex with somebody and feeling those sort of feelings towards them is very new to me.
I wish that I didn't keep wanting to destroy it.
You know, I'm trying to stay out of it.
Yes.
I'd love to party with you, but I...
Yes.
Marta, try to get somebody else and if I change my mind I'll call you, okay?
You're not going to get hung up on me, are you?
- Yes, sir, can I help you?
- Yes, can I have a bag please?
- Yes.
- A couple of bags please.
Well, let me see how much those weigh.
- A pound and a quarter.
- I'll have some of those small tomatoes.
- No mushy ones.
- Okay, thanks.
- What do you have in your bag?
- What?
What have you got in your bag?
Can I have a cantaloupe, please?
Wait.
He cut up my clothes...
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Hello?
I can be a very bad girl, you know.
I sometimes need a spanking.
I have very wicked ideas.
I will do anything you ask.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
You mustn't be.
You know, there's nothing wrong.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
She can't remember.
Well, it could have been it could have been hidden in his pocket, I've seen one of those.
All right.
I'll wait for you here.
Bree?
Trask and some officers are coming to examine your apartment.
I want you to stay here today and tomorrow.
You'll be safe here.
I'll only be gone for a few minutes tomorrow.
Bree?
Bree?
Well, you look like you've been with many women, but I didn't know if you'd ever paid for a woman before.
I mean, you wouldn't need to.
So if you do, it's obviously because it excites you.
Because you're not a man that would have to pay for a woman.
You could have any woman you wanted.
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
I will do anything you ask or want.
Since you know that there are no limits to my imagination.
I place no moral judgments on anything.
We checked out 42 letters of Tom Grunemann's friends.
And we only came up with one with any similarity to the obscene letter.
All right, there's Tom Grunemann.
Different margins, different spacings.
That's mine.
You said to check out everybody.
Same margins, top and sides.
He does best with his middle fingers.
We get fainter registrations on outside keys.
Notice how he invariably does that with the "T" and the "H."
Who is it?
Peter Cable.
But you have no case.
There's not even a body.
I'm sorry we have to meet here, but I'm pretty rushed for time.
I have a business meeting tonight in Chicago.
Any developments?
I think I can close the case. ...if I can have $500 to purchase Jane McKenna's address book.
I don't understand what you mean.
Well, I've found a contact who will sell me the book.
A little black book containing the name of the client that beat up Bree Daniel.
He is also the man who came into Bree Daniel's apartment yesterday and wrecked it.
We know that now because of the semen that he left in her underwear.
The blood type is AB, and Tom's was type A. It wasn't Tom.
I think this man killed Jane McKenna and Arlyn Page.
I think he drowned them.
I you should prepare yourself for the fact that Tom is possibly dead.
The only way I'll find out is to find him.
I need the money before tomorrow night.
- You're meeting him tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- He's bringing the book to my apartment.
- At what time?
8:30.
I'll notify the board as soon as I get to Chicago and have them wire you the money immediately.
Thank you, John.
I certainly hope you're wrong about Tom.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.
I don't want you to do this.
Bree.
I'm just going to a girlfriend's apartment.
I can't stay here, obviously.
Please.
Not with him.
This other girl has a very big apartment, lots of room.
But it's not necessarily how it looks.
Look we all respect each other, right?
I respect you.
Bree respects you.
But you have to respect her, too.
Her best interests.
Mrs. Daniel, I have to close up now.
Leave your name and number with the service and she'll get back to you.
I can't.
Well, I have to close up now.
I almost killed somebody.
Well, I'm certain the doctor would like to speak with you about it.
As a matter of fact, I'll have her call you as soon as she gets home.
I promise.
- Can I use your phone?
- Sure.
Is Mr. Goldfarb there?
Mr. Goldfarb Sr.
I have to talk to somebody.
I'm just a little way across town.
Can I come over?
About half an hour?
Detective Trask, please.
Hi, John Klute.
He didn't take the plane, he cancelled out.
I'm at home in my apartment.
I don't know where she is.
I'll find her.
Okay.
I'll leave word if I go out.
Okay.
I have an appointment with Mr. Goldfarb.
Mr. Goldfarb!
Mr. Goldfarb!
Hello.
What can I do for you?
I'm sorry.
I mean Mr. Goldfarb Sr.
My father left about 15 minutes ago.
He didn't feel so good.
- Can I help you?
- He's working himself to death, poor man.
- You sure I can't help you?
- It's not important.
No, really.
I don't mind.
You're going to miss your train, Mr. Goldfarb.
Excuse me.
Did he leave a message for me?
Bree Daniel.
I thought that was for tomorrow!
Mr. Goldfarb's wire.
Yes, Mama, I'm coming right now.
I know you don't like to get in in the middle of the picture!
Yes, right away.
Bye-bye.
We're closing now, Miss.
May I leave Mr. Goldfarb a message?
Poor man, everybody's friend.
Hello?
Hello?
This is Bree Daniel.
Has the doctor checked in yet?
When she does, tell her I'm at 246-1383.
I'll wait five minutes.
How I can reach the doctor?
The doctor hasn't checked in yet.
I'm trying to locate a Miss Bree Daniel.
I'm sorry sir, but we only take messages for the doctor.
Has she called in or anything?
Has she called the doctor at all today?
- She left a forwarding number.
- Can I have that number, please?
I'm not allowed to give that out.
I'm a police officer.
Please don't make me prove this.
You must understand my position.
I must comply with the rules.
I understand all that.
Will you just give me the number, please?
Can we talk about this reasonably?
I know you're expecting some kind of extravagant behavior but do you believe me?
Yes.
We can talk?
Well, it's just an ordinary matter.
I'm a very well-off man.
I have a position to respect I would feel personally, very uncomfortable to be connected with a certain kind of woman.
I'm sure you understand what I mean.
Look, John Klute works for me.
I know you're his contact.
I know he's trying to acquire Jane McKenna's book.
I'm in a position to offer more for it than he can.
You don't understand what I'm talking about, do you?
Yes.
Jane McKenna's book.
- And I'll try to get it for you.
- No.
Obviously you're frightened and you're lying.
No, I'm not.
I will, I'll try to get it for you.
Is this something Klute's invented.
Is this a trap for me?
- Klute knows about me, doesn't he?
- Knows what about you?
Then everybody knows about me.
So, it doesn't make any difference what I do anymore, does it?
I've no idea what I'm going to do and I'm so deeply puzzled.
I've done terrible things.
I've killed three people.
And yet, I don't consider myself a terrible man.
No more than others.
See, Tom Grunemann discovered me.
We were here on business together and he found me and Jane McKenna in my hotel room.
She had become hysterical and she started screaming and I guess I hit her.
I don't actually recall how it all happened so quickly.
Anyway, she fell and hit her head, and that's when Tom came in the room.
I guess he must've heard her screaming.
But I never understood why she did that.
She had never screamed before.
It was the revulsion and the contempt that I saw on his face and the certainty that sooner or later he would use it against me within the company.
I tried to endure that as long as I possibly could.
You just want me to keep on talking, don't you?
No, I don't.
I do understand.
I really do.
Well, that's what you all do.
You make a man think that he's accepted.
It's all just a great big game to you.
You're all obviously too lazy and too warped to do anything meaningful with your life, so you prey upon the sexual fantasies of others.
I'm sure it comes as no great surprise to you when I say that there are little corners in everyone which were better off left alone.
Little sicknesses, weaknesses, which should never be exposed.
That's your stock in trade, isn't it, a man's weakness?
I was never really fully aware of mine until you brought them out.
How far out of town are we?
- Five miles outside of New York.
- Do you mind if I turn the lights down?
No, it's up to you.
Turn the light out if you'd like.
My name is Peter Cable.
I work for the Tole American Corporation which is situated in Pennsylvania and in New York.
I would not be telling you these things if my intentions weren't honorable.
- You look familiar to me.
- In what way?
I don't know.
Your face looks familiar to me.
I guess I have a confession to make.
We did meet before.
About two years ago.
I often wondered whatever happened to Arlyn Page and here you are.
Yeah, I remember.
Listen I've got get out of here.
I mean I can't...
I remember you.
- Well, what do you remember?
- You beat me up, that's what you did!
It's okay.
Just freaked me out for a minute, that's all.
I promise to drive you back afterwards.
Okay.
Why don't you just tell me what you'd like, and then...
- ... after you tell me what you'd like...
- I'd like to spend some time with you.
- I have been looking for you for two years.
- Why?
That's my business.
I will say that you gave me a great deal of pleasure.
I saw in you things that I had not seen in other women of your profession.
I will not harm you at all physically.
It's all right.
No, it's not all right, and you know it's not all right.
No, it is all right.
If that's what you...
But, you have to tell me first.
If that's what you want...
- ... that's fine.
- Arlyn why don't you lie down on the bed and make yourself comfortable.
I'll not strap you in, I'll not tie you down.
Just lie down on the bed, please.
Be comfortable.
Nothing's going to happen.
Nothing's going to happen.
Okay.
- Why don't you make yourself comfortable?
- I am perfectly comfortable.
Just put your head down.
You have such lovely long blonde hair.
Turn your head.
Like that.
Don't!
Don't!
I've explained to him what I have to do and I think he understands.
What could ever happen for us?
I mean, we're so different.
I know enough about myself to know that whatever lies in store for me it's not going to be setting up housekeeping with somebody in Tuscarora and darning socks and doing all that.
I'd go out of my mind.
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I don't know how I feel about him.
It's so hard for me to say it!
God!
- To say what?
- I'm going to miss him.
Bree Daniel.
How is Roy?
Well, I'm leaving town right now and I don't expect to be back.
You're very nice.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
I have no idea what's going to happen.
I just can't stay in the city, you know?
Maybe I'll come back.
You'll probably see me next week.
We've got two tons of potatoes.
Tom!
I'll drink to that.
Did you know the subject, Thomas Grunemann?
- Yes.
- Very well.
He was my best friend.
We grew up together.
Can you account for his disappearance in anyway?
- Mrs. Grunemann?
- No.
Did he recently appear to be agitated or depressed in any way?
No.
Mr. Cable, at the plant did he voice any grievance or discontent about his work there?
Not at all.
As a matter of fact, Tom operated best when he was under pressure.
Please forgive me, Mrs. Grunemann, but I have to ask.
Did your husband ever show any moral or sexual problems or peculiarities?
No.
Any marital problems in general, that is?
We were very happy.
Did he ever mention specifically, a girl or a woman in New York City?
No.
- No.
- Why?
We recovered in his desk at the plant in one of the drawers a typewritten letter that was evidently written on the Friday before he disappeared.
It was written to a girl in New York City and we contacted the police.
They brought her in, questioned her and she said that she had received six or seven letters of this kind.
Can I see it?
Well, it's an obscene letter, Mrs. Grunemann.
I would like to see it.
I would like you to remember that it was written by a very disturbed man.
I don't believe it.
I'd like you to know that situations of this kind are not unique.
A man will lead a double life.
A Jekyll-and-Hyde existence and his wife has no idea what's going on.
Has anybody talked to you about the financial arrangements?
Well, that depends, naturally, on how long you want me for and what you want to do.
I know you.
It will be very nice.
I'd like to spend the evening with you if it's...
If you'd like that.
Have you ever been with a woman before?
Paying her?
Do you like it?
I mean, I have the feeling that that turns you on very particularly.
What turns me on is because I have a good imagination and I like pleasing.
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?
I think in the confines of one's house, one should be free of clothing and inhibitions.
Inhibitions are always nice because they're so nice to overcome.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not.
As long as you don't hurt me more than I like to be hurt I will do anything you ask.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
You mustn't be.
You know, there's nothing wrong.
Nothing is wrong.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
All right.
Would you stand up, please?
- Hello.
- Hi.
Hi, can I see your eyes?
Let me see your hair.
- Take your hat off.
- Take my hat off?
Yeah.
Okay.
- Too pretty.
- Too pretty.
Now, that's the color.
The coloring is great.
I don't know.
- It's not quite it though.
- No, not really.
Hello.
Can I see your hands?
- Thank you.
- She's got funny hands.
- Hi.
- She is great.
- Beautiful eyes.
- Yes.
- All right.
That's the coloring.
- Yeah, let me see you smile.
- I think she has that cross between...
- She's great.
But I've seen you before.
- I think so.
- Have you done any cosmetic ads?
- Yes, I have.
- You have?
- How do they send people with a conflict?
- It's got to be a new face.
Call that agency.
- Irene Dunne would've had it.
- That would be perfect.
- C minus.
- C minus.
- Got to find her today.
- That's it.
Thank you, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
I'm exhausted.
One more day of this and I'll plop.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Just have a seat, please.
It's been six months.
Tom Grunemann has been missing for half a year.
And all the FBI has to offer is a report that must bore even you.
There are thousands of honest, decent men who simply disappear every year.
Neither Mrs. Grunemann nor I are willing to just dismiss this case.
And therefore we feel entitled to investigate on our own.
You're entitled.
There are some very competent...
John Klute offered us his services, and we've accepted.
Klute knew Tom, and he has many ideas about the case.
Have you ever done missing persons work before?
No.
- Have you spent any time in the city?
- No.
Well, speaking frankly...
You're wondering why we thought of Klute?
Frankly he's interested.
And he cares.
Why didn't you ever find out anything from that girl?
We held her under surveillance expecting your boy Grunemann to show up there.
He didn't.
We arrested her on a C.P. Charge.
Convicted.
Two months women's city prison.
Offered to reduce sentence.
She cooperated.
She thought she remembered him from those letters from before.
She made that connection.
But she hadn't seen him since then and couldn't identify his photograph.
A good call girl, she'll turn 600 or 700 tricks a year.
Faces get blurred.
And since then, she's reported several incidents like breather calls, anonymous phone calls.
Also, somebody may be following her, watching her.
Things like that.
So I guess it's conceivable that Grunemann's still around there.
Still bugging her.
Hey, Trina!
Bree.
Listen, I could use a quick $50.
You got a commuter for me?
Terrific.
Right.
Terrific.
Yeah. 'Bye.
Hi.
I'm Bree.
Yeah.
Come in, please.
I'm glad to know you, Bree.
I'm glad you could come.
Sit down, please.
Where are you from?
Can I get you a drink?
Yeah, I'd like a ginger ale.
Thank you.
I'm from Chicago.
You come to New York often?
No, I don't come to New York too often.
- Too bad.
- Three times a year maybe.
What kind of party did you have in mind?
We could have a nice half-and-half party for $50.
We could have a good time for $50.
Or if you wanted something extra, it would be a little more.
- Maybe a nice...
- Listen, would it be all right...
Tell me what you want.
Tell me what you want.
That sounds fantastic.
That's so exciting.
But it's going to cost you more.
That's fantastic.
That's going to be $100.
- Sure, fine.
- Yeah.
- Yes, very good.
- $100.
Very good.
I like to get business done at the beginning.
That way we don't have to think about it, then we can just have a good time.
I like your mind.
Yes.
So.
Chicago.
This is the bed?
This is the bed.
Very nice.
There's the bed in operating position.
You're so nice.
Come here.
Angel.
My angel!
"We gather together
"to ask the Lord's blessing
"He hastens
"and chastens his wisdom divine
"and from the beginning
"the fight we were winning
"Lord, be at our side...
"divine"
It's 12:00 a.m. This is Jim Donnelly, WNEW News.
Con Edison has again resorted to a cutback in voltage to conserve generating capacity.
At three percent...
Hello?
Hello?
- Who is it?
- Miss Daniel, my name is Klute.
John Klute.
And I'd like to talk to you.
- What do you want?
- My name is John Klute.
You said that.
I'm an investigator.
I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
- Who?
- Tom Grunemann.
He wrote you some letters.
Wow.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania.
He disappeared from there last December.
- I've been hired to look for him.
- Why?
You know what I'm talking about, Miss Daniel.
Honest.
Can I ask you some questions please?
Do you have any identification?
You're not a cop?
You're not FBI?
You're a private detective?
And you just want to ask me some questions?
- They're not very recent.
That's last year.
- They're quite good.
What have you done that I might have seen on Broadway or off-Broadway?
- Well, I study with George Tainter.
- George?
George is very good.
He's a good man to begin with.
I've been in two of his productions.
- Two of his workshop productions.
- Workshop.
Well, they're very nice.
How do you feel about being an actress?
- I like it very much.
- You think you know yourself?
- As much as anybody.
- Do you really know yourself?
- No.
- That's very important.
- I forget myself when I act.
- You can't forget yourself.
You have to know yourself and kind of like yourself.
You have to relate.
Relate to people.
I had an identity crisis two years ago and since then I've been working to know myself.
That's very important.
Don't hide your face.
You have a nice face, you shouldn't hide it.
Excuse me just a second.
Julian?
Yes, okay, send her in.
Well, I'm very busy.
Thank you for stopping by.
If you're in anything off-off-Broadway...
How are you today?
I won't be able to come back anymore.
I'm sorry.
Because I just can't afford it.
Did I fail you, Bree?
I come here all the time, I pay you all this money and why do I still want to trick?
Why do I still walk by a phone and want to pick up the phone and call?
Did you think I had some magic potion?
You'd come in and tell me your problem and I would just take it away?
What's the difference between going on a call as a model or an actress, as a call girl?
You're successful as a call girl...
Because when you're a call girl you control it, that's why.
Because someone wants you.
Not me.
I mean, there are some johns that I have regularly that want me and that's terrific.
But they want a woman and I know I'm good.
I arrive at their hotel or their apartment and they're usually nervous, which is fine, because I'm not.
I know what I'm doing.
For an hour I'm the best actress in the world.
I'm the best fuck in the world.
And...
Why did you say you're the best actress in the world?
- At that time?
- Because it's an act.
That's what's nice about it.
You don't have to feel anything.
You don't have to care about anything.
You don't have to like anybody.
You just lead them by the ring in their nose in the direction they think they want to go.
You get a lot of money out of them in as short period of time as possible.
You control it and you call the shots and I always feel just great afterwards.
- And you enjoyed it?
- No.
Why not?
You say there's nothing wrong.
Why not?
You said...
There's a difference.
I don't think there's anything wrong with it morally.
I didn't enjoy it physically.
I came to enjoy it because it made me feel good.
It made me feel like I wasn't alone.
It made me feel that I had some control over myself, that I had some control over my life.
That I could determine things for myself.
I don't know.
I don't know why I'm here.
It's just so silly to think that somebody else can help anybody, isn't it?
I could come over tonight.
Are you alone?
In about an hour.
Okay.
See you in an hour.
Bree.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Enjoy.
- It's good to see you again.
- Likewise.
I've just got back from Cannes, you know.
And I...
Well I have something rather exciting to tell you.
Yes?
Cannes was very amusing.
We played baccarat and chemin de fer.
A very nice little Italian marquis was rather enthusiastic about me.
But a young man can be so silly.
Then one night at the gambling tables I saw him.
A stranger, he was looking at me.
He was standing very still on the other side of the room and his eyes were looking right into me.
And I knew that for the first time in my life...
Please.
Not young.
He wasn't young.
He had gray sideburns.
- Actually, he looked rather like you.
- Yes?
No one could tell me who he was.
Was he an exiled prince or a mercenary?
But there was a feeling stirring inside me, a pagan feeling.
The next day on the beach in my beach pavilion...
It was so warm on the sand and I saw him again.
He was staring at me.
His eyes were burning into me.
I was helpless.
He didn't even have to say anything, and I knew.
I knew that somehow...
You know, I've never liked young men.
And I knew that he would awaken something in me that no young man had ever awakened.
He was so wise and he taught me so many things with his hands.
In his eyes I felt so beautiful.
Miss Daniel.
Can I come upstairs and ask you some questions now?
You bastard!
Is this the shakedown, hon?
You picked a loser.
I don't have it!
I'm looking for Tom...
You think I'd live in this kip if I were taking calls full-time?
- I'd be back on Park Avenue.
- Can I ask you some questions?
Or you'll get me thrown back in the brig, you mean?
Have a seat.
Would you like some wine?
- Or some beer?
- No, thank you.
There isn't any beer anyway.
I've already told the police everything I know.
I don't even remember the schlub!
They showed me that already.
I understand this is Grunemann.
I told them, I don't remember.
Family-type man.
It figures.
Look will you please just try to get it from my side?
A year ago I was in the life full-time.
Living on Park Avenue.
This very nice apartment, leather furniture.
And then the cops dropped on me.
They caged me.
Started asking me about a guy that I'm supposed to have seen a year before that!
Two years ago!
He could be in Yemen!
Grunemann, what does that mean?
It's a name, I don't know him!
And they start showing me these pictures, and they don't mean anything to me.
Then they started asking me if I'd been getting letters from some guy out in Cabbageville.
Tuscarora.
Yeah, all right, I had been.
Very sick letters.
So they said, "Well, that's, Grunemann.
"So would you please tell us when you and he..."
Well, there was a guy once.
A freak.
Could've been him.
Apparently Grunemann liked to beat up on girls.
Well, this guy hired me and then he tried to kill me and that was about two years ago.
Tommy, allie allie in free, kid.
I got the gumdrops.
You remind me of my uncle.
What else do you remember about the man who beat you up?
Nothing.
Except that he wasn't kidding, that's all.
See, usually it's a fake out.
You probably know about that.
They pretend to tie you up and whip you while you wear a dress with a cloth belt.
Hell, it's their money, I don't care.
I'll swing from a shower rod and whistle Maytime.
Except this guy really freaked out on it.
But you cannot identify this man as Tom Grunemann?
I can't identify him as anybody!
So, is that it?
Listen why don't you go downstairs...
You have such a nice mouth.
...and get those tapes?
Bring them back up here and we'll have a party you and I.
- Wouldn't that be nice?
What about afterwards, the telephone calls?
Just phone calls, right?
What is it?
The phone rings, you answer it, there's no one there.
Kids having fun, burglars finding empty apartments.
It happens all the time.
It doesn't mean anything.
But you reported that you had been followed.
Look, I'm sorry.
I've been leading everybody astray.
It doesn't...
Okay, I get these feelings, but they're just feelings.
That's just me.
I'm sure you'll find this amusing, but I'm afraid of the dark.
Sometimes I get spooked.
I think I see people and hear things.
I go out in the morning and I think somebody's opened my mailbox.
If there's trash in front of my door I think somebody's trying to freak me out.
It's just nerves.
I'm a nervous broad.
It doesn't mean anything.
Bree Daniel.
How is Ted?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'd love to.
Maybe the next time you're in town?
I'd like to meet you very much.
You've got a nice voice.
I'm having a conversation with a very nice cop.
He's not a cop actually, he's a private...
Is that how you get most of your dates?
Someone gives your name to somebody.
Most of them, yes.
And that's how you met the man who beat you up?
I don't remember.
It was two years ago.
God!
How else do you get dates then, pimps?
You're very square, cookie.
No, pimps don't get dates for you, they just take your money.
The police have given me a list of names.
I'd like to ask you about them.
Frank Ligourin?
I'm sure this is going to amuse you, too.
But I'm really trying to get away from all that.
What about this evening, the old man?
You saw that?
Goddamn you!
He's 70 years old!
His wife's dead.
He's cut garments since he was 14.
He's maybe in his whole life had one week vacation and I'm all he's got!
He never lays a hand on me!
What harm is there in that?
What's your bag, Klute?
What do you like?
You a talker?
A button freak?
Like to have your chest walked around with high-heel shoes?
- You like to have us watch you tinkle?
- Okay.
Or do you get it off wearing women's clothes?
- Goddamn hypocrite squares!
- Okay.
I hope this isn't going to make my cold any worse.
- Now tell me about Frank Ligourin.
- He was my old man.
We broke up.
When?
- When did you break up?
- About eight months ago.
Would you mind not doing that?
What?
Okay?
Well, I thought I could trade you for those tapes.
Doesn't it get lonely down there in your little room?
Maybe I could bring some friends.
I've got some terrific friends.
No, thank you.
Men have paid $200 for me and here you are turning down a freebie.
You could get a perfectly good dishwasher for that.
What are you doing with my keys?
Give me your hand.
I knew it.
Don't be afraid.
I'm going to sit you down on the bed.
There's someone on the roof.
Sit.
Sit!
Tom?
Tom?
- You didn't get him?
- No.
Was it Grunemann?
I didn't see him.
Who sent you on that date?
Frankie Ligourin.
You and I will go talk to Frank Ligourin tomorrow.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not.
Would you like me to hold you?
I'm just trying to figure you out.
I may say not many people have been very successful at that.
That's all right.
I'll figure you out before the evening is over.
I hope you do, and in a way, I hope you don't.
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
Inhibitions are always nice because they're so nice to overcome.
- Because I'm very bad, you know.
- In what way?
How are you bad?
In my head.
I have very wicked ideas.
Lots of them.
I'm sure that as you're sitting at your desk you've all kinds of strange things going through your mind.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
Nothing is wrong.
You know that I will do anything you ask.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
I was just finishing up some work.
Mocking up a few photographs.
I used to be a photographer.
Did Bree tell you?
Before I got into publishing.
He knows you're a pimp, Frankie.
He knows you were my pimp.
Excuse me.
Bree, why don't you wait outside?
I always respected Bree.
I'd like to make something clear.
- I just got a couple of questions.
- I want to make something clear.
I don't go after a girl.
Girl comes to me.
Her choice.
Right?
I'm looking for a man, Tom Grunemann.
Miss Daniel tells me that the date that beat her two years ago might've been that man, and you sent her on that date.
Two years ago?
Sorry.
I understand you use narcotics.
Maybe I could have someone come over and look at your arms.
You know, I may stand better with the cops than you do.
Why don't you sit down and relax?
It was a family matter.
Between the girls.
Had two other girls then.
Two other girls besides Bree.
One of them, Jane McKenna she blows a little jealous of Bree.
Bree comes first.
Evidently she knew this freak who beats up on women.
She cons me into passing him on to Bree so Bree would get hurt.
I didn't know until afterwards.
You can't tell them one of their own in-laws laid a freak on them.
Peace in the family.
Beyond that I don't know.
That's all she wrote.
Did you see the man?
No.
How can I get hold of Jane McKenna?
Baby, would I be telling you all this?
She copped out long ago.
She committed suicide, Baxter.
And the other girl, what's her name?
- Arlyn?
- Page.
How do I find her?
I don't know.
She's a junkie.
Make that scene, you could be anywhere.
Here, San Francisco, they just drop out.
Anything else?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
Not very much.
- Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
- Where can I find Arlyn Page?
You're not going to find Arlyn Page, she's a junkie.
Didn't he tell you that he sent me that guy?
Jane McKenna sent you that guy.
Well, she's dead.
Your tapes.
Golly gee, just what I've always wanted.
Dirty phone calls.
What for?
I'm through with your part of it.
You told me what you could.
Tell me, Klute did we get you a little?
Just a little bit?
Us city folk.
The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
All that's so pathetic.
Fuck off!
I'll tell you something, Jack.
It is in the bells that I hear my voices.
Not today when they all rang, that was nothing but jangling.
But here, in this corner where the bells come down from heaven and the echoes linger or in the fields where they come across the quiet of the countryside my voices are in them.
Hark!
Do you hear?
"Dear child of God."
That's just what you said.
At the half-hour they will say, "Be brave, go on."
At the three-quarters they will say, "I am thy help."
When is it the hour.
When the great bell goes after:
"God will save France."
- It is then that St. Margaret...
- Thank you very much.
The script please.
Very interesting accent.
Booth!
Thank you.
All right, so what do you want, cop?
- I can't find Arlyn Page without your help.
- I told you you wouldn't find her.
If I can't find her, I can't find him, and if I can't find him then you're in trouble.
So what do you say?
Okay?
It's going to cost.
Time is money.
Okay.
Well, I can pay you $100.
- I can make $100 in a lunch break.
- $100 is all I've got.
You were very good upstairs.
Kid, will you buy me a coffee?
Buy you lunch.
Do you want lunch?
Come on.
Whenever it suits you.
No, make it Monday at 8:00 p.m.
I said Monday, 8:00 p.m. Now don't be naughty!
He's a lovely man.
Comes here spends a bundle of money, and never even touches the girls.
Comes from Grosse Pointe, has a big house, eight servants but all he wants to do is come here and scrub out my bathroom.
8:00 p.m., Monday Mr. Clean.
Arlyn Page I had let her go.
With the kind of people I get I couldn't have a gal who was zonked out all the time.
You know, I get the crème de la crème.
No, she was trouble and I don't allow any trouble here.
Che si può fare?
Honni soit qui mal y pense.
Do you have any idea where I can look for her?
Try Mama Reese's.
Bree if you get lonely or have no place to go, you come here.
You'll always have a home here.
Why?
She's a junkie.
She was with you after she left Frankie, wasn't she?
Well, she's not now.
I tried to do everything for her.
I took her into my own place, my own little flat on First.
You know that sweet place?
We could of had everything together.
Then the bitch sold my mink!
- Do you know anybody that's seen her?
- As far as I'm concerned, she's dead!
Who is it?
Bree Daniel.
I couldn't sleep.
I keep thinking I hear noises.
Can I come in?
Come in.
It was probably just my imagination.
Sit down.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
I just...
I don't think he's going to come back again.
I just don't want to be alone right now.
Do you mind if I stay here a while?
- Lf you'd like to go back upstairs, I'd come...
- I'd really rather not go upstairs.
Why don't you lie down here?
Sleep here.
- Where are you going to sleep?
- I'll pull that out.
Lie down.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
What's the matter?
You were terrific.
A real tiger.
Are you upset because you didn't make me come?
I never come with a john.
Don't feel bad about losing your virtue, I sort of knew you would.
Everybody always does.
Arlyn Page?
Yes, she was with me about three months.
She was lucky I kept her that long.
She was out of it.
Somebody said she was streetwalking over on Lexington Avenue.
Or was it Eighth?
You might take a look.
Or try Bill Azure, if you can find him.
Yes, she used to dress the way you do.
The whore?
Yes, I threw her out.
Do you know where she went from here?
Live like animals, her and the man.
Out!
She was living with a man?
He was worse than the whore!
Cappy!
- Arlyn Page?
- Arlyn, it's Bree!
Cappy, is that you?
- It's all right.
- Cappy, we got a radio...
Arlyn, it's okay.
Bree, honey I'm waiting for someone.
You've got to help us.
Can't you see I'm strung out?
It'll only take you a couple of minutes.
A couple years ago, Jane sent me a guy that beat me.
If he sees you, he won't come.
Was she seeing a freak, one of her regular johns?
Was he a freak?
Yes.
What about it?
Did he come around a lot?
No, he was an older guy.
It's very important.
- Arlyn, get them out of here!
- I'm begging you!
It's very important, please.
- Can you give me a description of him?
- Cappy?
- Cappy, listen.
No!
- Cappy, don't run!
Cappy, don't run!
I've got a radio, Cappy!
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow.
A narcotics addict.
I believed her.
I believed her absolutely.
The man who did those beatings was not Tom Grunemann.
Suppose it wasn't Tom.
Where does that get you?
Tom is still connected because of the letters, whether he wrote them or not.
The only way that I'm going to find him is to find the man who did do the beatings.
The only way I'm going to find him is to pursue Arlyn Page and try to secure from her some kind of identification.
I'll be flying back to Pennsylvania on Friday and I'll fill them in on things.
How is it back there?
I think you're homesick.
I'll be back on Thursday.
John, I want to tell you how much I respect your dedication.
Thank you.
Because I'm very bad, you know.
I have very wicked ideas.
As you're sitting at your desk you have strange things running through your mind.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
Nothing is wrong.
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?
I like to sort of walk around here with no clothes on.
I think people wear clothes much too often, don't you?
I think in the confines of one's house, one should be free of clothing and inhibitions.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
I was trying to get away from a world that I had known, because I don't think it was very good for me, and I found myself looking up its ass...
...and seeing people that I used to know and that I liked a lot that were my friends.
Sort of.
Girls and that could have been me.
I mean, I know I'm not stupid.
I guess I just realized that I don't really give a damn.
What I would really like to do is be faceless and bodiless and be left alone.
You're lucky they're still here.
We don't keep unclaimed possessions in suicide cases more than a year.
Number 497.
Jane McKenna.
I thought there would be more.
Well, there's this man, this detective and I don't know exactly what is happening or what he wants out of me, or anything like that.
But he took care of me.
Did you feel threatened by it?
I don't know.
When you're used to being lonely and somebody comes in and moves that around, it's sort of scary I guess.
How do you feel when you feel scared?
- Angry.
- At whom?
- Whoever is making me feel that way.
- Do you feel angry at him?
Half of the time, yes.
How do you feel angry?
What do you want to do?
I want to manipulate him.
How?
In all the ways that I can manipulate people.
I mean, it's easy to manipulate men.
Right?
They were bringing a freighter down through Kill Van Kull.
Propellers washed it up on top.
Arlyn Page was probably an alias.
- Sorry.
- Man, can you help me out?
Yes.
What?
I mean, can you help me out?
I mean that's my baby, dead.
I have to get up.
- You know what it means, my baby dead.
- Got to get up.
Okay?
Lt. Trask, please.
John Klute.
I think we should run down and check on everybody who knew Tom Grunemann.
I don't think the man who wrote the letters was Tom.
Just run down and check on everything.
Talk to you.
You're up, are you?
How are you?
Trask wants you to call him.
He told me about Arlyn.
It probably doesn't have anything to do with anything but just as a precaution when you go out, if you tell me where you're going to go a phone number where I can find you.
Just so I can always keep in touch with you.
Okay?
Sure.
I'm all right.
I know.
I feel physically, that's what's different.
I mean, I feel.
My body feels.
I enjoy making love with him.
Which is a very baffling and bewildering thing, because I've never felt that before.
I wish that I could let things happen and enjoy it, you know for what it is and while it lasts and relax about it.
But all the time, I keep feeling the need to destroy it.
To break it off.
To go back to the comfort of being numb again.
I keep hoping, in a way, that it's going to end.
Because I had more control before, when I was with tricks.
I knew what I was doing and I was setting everything up.
And that's what's so strange:
It's that I'm not setting anything up.
That something is...
You know what this is like, but I've never felt it before.
It's a new thing and it's so strange.
The sensation that something that is flowing from me naturally to somebody else without it's being prettied up or...
I mean, he's seen me horrible!
He's seen me ugly!
He's seen me mean.
He's seen me whorey and it doesn't seem to matter.
He seems to accept me.
I guess having sex with somebody and feeling those sort of feelings towards them is very new to me.
I wish that I didn't keep wanting to destroy it.
You know, I'm trying to stay out of it.
Yes.
I'd love to party with you, but I...
Yes.
Marta, try to get somebody else and if I change my mind I'll call you, okay?
You're not going to get hung up on me, are you?
- Yes, sir, can I help you?
- Yes, can I have a bag please?
- Yes.
- A couple of bags please.
Well, let me see how much those weigh.
- A pound and a quarter.
- I'll have some of those small tomatoes.
- No mushy ones.
- Okay, thanks.
- What do you have in your bag?
- What?
What have you got in your bag?
Can I have a cantaloupe, please?
Wait.
He cut up my clothes...
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Hello?
I can be a very bad girl, you know.
I sometimes need a spanking.
I have very wicked ideas.
I will do anything you ask.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
You mustn't be.
You know, there's nothing wrong.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
She can't remember.
Well, it could have been it could have been hidden in his pocket, I've seen one of those.
All right.
I'll wait for you here.
Bree?
Trask and some officers are coming to examine your apartment.
I want you to stay here today and tomorrow.
You'll be safe here.
I'll only be gone for a few minutes tomorrow.
Bree?
Bree?
Well, you look like you've been with many women, but I didn't know if you'd ever paid for a woman before.
I mean, you wouldn't need to.
So if you do, it's obviously because it excites you.
Because you're not a man that would have to pay for a woman.
You could have any woman you wanted.
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
I will do anything you ask or want.
Since you know that there are no limits to my imagination.
I place no moral judgments on anything.
We checked out 42 letters of Tom Grunemann's friends.
And we only came up with one with any similarity to the obscene letter.
All right, there's Tom Grunemann.
Different margins, different spacings.
That's mine.
You said to check out everybody.
Same margins, top and sides.
He does best with his middle fingers.
We get fainter registrations on outside keys.
Notice how he invariably does that with the "T" and the "H."
Who is it?
Peter Cable.
But you have no case.
There's not even a body.
I'm sorry we have to meet here, but I'm pretty rushed for time.
I have a business meeting tonight in Chicago.
Any developments?
I think I can close the case. ...if I can have $500 to purchase Jane McKenna's address book.
I don't understand what you mean.
Well, I've found a contact who will sell me the book.
A little black book containing the name of the client that beat up Bree Daniel.
He is also the man who came into Bree Daniel's apartment yesterday and wrecked it.
We know that now because of the semen that he left in her underwear.
The blood type is AB, and Tom's was type A. It wasn't Tom.
I think this man killed Jane McKenna and Arlyn Page.
I think he drowned them.
I you should prepare yourself for the fact that Tom is possibly dead.
The only way I'll find out is to find him.
I need the money before tomorrow night.
- You're meeting him tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- He's bringing the book to my apartment.
- At what time?
8:30.
I'll notify the board as soon as I get to Chicago and have them wire you the money immediately.
Thank you, John.
I certainly hope you're wrong about Tom.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.
I don't want you to do this.
Bree.
I'm just going to a girlfriend's apartment.
I can't stay here, obviously.
Please.
Not with him.
This other girl has a very big apartment, lots of room.
But it's not necessarily how it looks.
Look we all respect each other, right?
I respect you.
Bree respects you.
But you have to respect her, too.
Her best interests.
Mrs. Daniel, I have to close up now.
Leave your name and number with the service and she'll get back to you.
I can't.
Well, I have to close up now.
I almost killed somebody.
Well, I'm certain the doctor would like to speak with you about it.
As a matter of fact, I'll have her call you as soon as she gets home.
I promise.
- Can I use your phone?
- Sure.
Is Mr. Goldfarb there?
Mr. Goldfarb Sr.
I have to talk to somebody.
I'm just a little way across town.
Can I come over?
About half an hour?
Detective Trask, please.
Hi, John Klute.
He didn't take the plane, he cancelled out.
I'm at home in my apartment.
I don't know where she is.
I'll find her.
Okay.
I'll leave word if I go out.
Okay.
I have an appointment with Mr. Goldfarb.
Mr. Goldfarb!
Mr. Goldfarb!
Hello.
What can I do for you?
I'm sorry.
I mean Mr. Goldfarb Sr.
My father left about 15 minutes ago.
He didn't feel so good.
- Can I help you?
- He's working himself to death, poor man.
- You sure I can't help you?
- It's not important.
No, really.
I don't mind.
You're going to miss your train, Mr. Goldfarb.
Excuse me.
Did he leave a message for me?
Bree Daniel.
I thought that was for tomorrow!
Mr. Goldfarb's wire.
Yes, Mama, I'm coming right now.
I know you don't like to get in in the middle of the picture!
Yes, right away.
Bye-bye.
We're closing now, Miss.
May I leave Mr. Goldfarb a message?
Poor man, everybody's friend.
Hello?
Hello?
This is Bree Daniel.
Has the doctor checked in yet?
When she does, tell her I'm at 246-1383.
I'll wait five minutes.
How I can reach the doctor?
The doctor hasn't checked in yet.
I'm trying to locate a Miss Bree Daniel.
I'm sorry sir, but we only take messages for the doctor.
Has she called in or anything?
Has she called the doctor at all today?
- She left a forwarding number.
- Can I have that number, please?
I'm not allowed to give that out.
I'm a police officer.
Please don't make me prove this.
You must understand my position.
I must comply with the rules.
I understand all that.
Will you just give me the number, please?
Can we talk about this reasonably?
I know you're expecting some kind of extravagant behavior but do you believe me?
Yes.
We can talk?
Well, it's just an ordinary matter.
I'm a very well-off man.
I have a position to respect I would feel personally, very uncomfortable to be connected with a certain kind of woman.
I'm sure you understand what I mean.
Look, John Klute works for me.
I know you're his contact.
I know he's trying to acquire Jane McKenna's book.
I'm in a position to offer more for it than he can.
You don't understand what I'm talking about, do you?
Yes.
Jane McKenna's book.
- And I'll try to get it for you.
- No.
Obviously you're frightened and you're lying.
No, I'm not.
I will, I'll try to get it for you.
Is this something Klute's invented.
Is this a trap for me?
- Klute knows about me, doesn't he?
- Knows what about you?
Then everybody knows about me.
So, it doesn't make any difference what I do anymore, does it?
I've no idea what I'm going to do and I'm so deeply puzzled.
I've done terrible things.
I've killed three people.
And yet, I don't consider myself a terrible man.
No more than others.
See, Tom Grunemann discovered me.
We were here on business together and he found me and Jane McKenna in my hotel room.
She had become hysterical and she started screaming and I guess I hit her.
I don't actually recall how it all happened so quickly.
Anyway, she fell and hit her head, and that's when Tom came in the room.
I guess he must've heard her screaming.
But I never understood why she did that.
She had never screamed before.
It was the revulsion and the contempt that I saw on his face and the certainty that sooner or later he would use it against me within the company.
I tried to endure that as long as I possibly could.
You just want me to keep on talking, don't you?
No, I don't.
I do understand.
I really do.
Well, that's what you all do.
You make a man think that he's accepted.
It's all just a great big game to you.
You're all obviously too lazy and too warped to do anything meaningful with your life, so you prey upon the sexual fantasies of others.
I'm sure it comes as no great surprise to you when I say that there are little corners in everyone which were better off left alone.
Little sicknesses, weaknesses, which should never be exposed.
That's your stock in trade, isn't it, a man's weakness?
I was never really fully aware of mine until you brought them out.
How far out of town are we?
- Five miles outside of New York.
- Do you mind if I turn the lights down?
No, it's up to you.
Turn the light out if you'd like.
My name is Peter Cable.
I work for the Tole American Corporation which is situated in Pennsylvania and in New York.
I would not be telling you these things if my intentions weren't honorable.
- You look familiar to me.
- In what way?
I don't know.
Your face looks familiar to me.
I guess I have a confession to make.
We did meet before.
About two years ago.
I often wondered whatever happened to Arlyn Page and here you are.
Yeah, I remember.
Listen I've got get out of here.
I mean I can't...
I remember you.
- Well, what do you remember?
- You beat me up, that's what you did!
It's okay.
Just freaked me out for a minute, that's all.
I promise to drive you back afterwards.
Okay.
Why don't you just tell me what you'd like, and then...
- ... after you tell me what you'd like...
- I'd like to spend some time with you.
- I have been looking for you for two years.
- Why?
That's my business.
I will say that you gave me a great deal of pleasure.
I saw in you things that I had not seen in other women of your profession.
I will not harm you at all physically.
It's all right.
No, it's not all right, and you know it's not all right.
No, it is all right.
If that's what you...
But, you have to tell me first.
If that's what you want...
- ... that's fine.
- Arlyn why don't you lie down on the bed and make yourself comfortable.
I'll not strap you in, I'll not tie you down.
Just lie down on the bed, please.
Be comfortable.
Nothing's going to happen.
Nothing's going to happen.
Okay.
- Why don't you make yourself comfortable?
- I am perfectly comfortable.
Just put your head down.
You have such lovely long blonde hair.
Turn your head.
Like that.
Don't!
Don't!
I've explained to him what I have to do and I think he understands.
What could ever happen for us?
I mean, we're so different.
I know enough about myself to know that whatever lies in store for me it's not going to be setting up housekeeping with somebody in Tuscarora and darning socks and doing all that.
I'd go out of my mind.
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I don't know how I feel about him.
It's so hard for me to say it!
God!
- To say what?
- I'm going to miss him.
Bree Daniel.
How is Roy?
Well, I'm leaving town right now and I don't expect to be back.
You're very nice.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
I have no idea what's going to happen.
I just can't stay in the city, you know?
Maybe I'll come back.
You'll probably see me next week.
We've got two tons of potatoes.
Tom!
I'll drink to that.
Did you know the subject, Thomas Grunemann?
- Yes.
- Very well.
He was my best friend.
We grew up together.
Can you account for his disappearance in anyway?
- Mrs. Grunemann?
- No.
Did he recently appear to be agitated or depressed in any way?
No.
Mr. Cable, at the plant did he voice any grievance or discontent about his work there?
Not at all.
As a matter of fact, Tom operated best when he was under pressure.
Please forgive me, Mrs. Grunemann, but I have to ask.
Did your husband ever show any moral or sexual problems or peculiarities?
No.
Any marital problems in general, that is?
We were very happy.
Did he ever mention specifically, a girl or a woman in New York City?
No.
- No.
- Why?
We recovered in his desk at the plant in one of the drawers a typewritten letter that was evidently written on the Friday before he disappeared.
It was written to a girl in New York City and we contacted the police.
They brought her in, questioned her and she said that she had received six or seven letters of this kind.
Can I see it?
Well, it's an obscene letter, Mrs. Grunemann.
I would like to see it.
I would like you to remember that it was written by a very disturbed man.
I don't believe it.
I'd like you to know that situations of this kind are not unique.
A man will lead a double life.
A Jekyll-and-Hyde existence and his wife has no idea what's going on.
Has anybody talked to you about the financial arrangements?
Well, that depends, naturally, on how long you want me for and what you want to do.
I know you.
It will be very nice.
I'd like to spend the evening with you if it's...
If you'd like that.
Have you ever been with a woman before?
Paying her?
Do you like it?
I mean, I have the feeling that that turns you on very particularly.
What turns me on is because I have a good imagination and I like pleasing.
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?
I think in the confines of one's house, one should be free of clothing and inhibitions.
Inhibitions are always nice because they're so nice to overcome.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not.
As long as you don't hurt me more than I like to be hurt I will do anything you ask.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
You mustn't be.
You know, there's nothing wrong.
Nothing is wrong.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
All right.
Would you stand up, please?
- Hello.
- Hi.
Hi, can I see your eyes?
Let me see your hair.
- Take your hat off.
- Take my hat off?
Yeah.
Okay.
- Too pretty.
- Too pretty.
Now, that's the color.
The coloring is great.
I don't know.
- It's not quite it though.
- No, not really.
Hello.
Can I see your hands?
- Thank you.
- She's got funny hands.
- Hi.
- She is great.
- Beautiful eyes.
- Yes.
- All right.
That's the coloring.
- Yeah, let me see you smile.
- I think she has that cross between...
- She's great.
But I've seen you before.
- I think so.
- Have you done any cosmetic ads?
- Yes, I have.
- You have?
- How do they send people with a conflict?
- It's got to be a new face.
Call that agency.
- Irene Dunne would've had it.
- That would be perfect.
- C minus.
- C minus.
- Got to find her today.
- That's it.
Thank you, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
I'm exhausted.
One more day of this and I'll plop.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Just have a seat, please.
It's been six months.
Tom Grunemann has been missing for half a year.
And all the FBI has to offer is a report that must bore even you.
There are thousands of honest, decent men who simply disappear every year.
Neither Mrs. Grunemann nor I are willing to just dismiss this case.
And therefore we feel entitled to investigate on our own.
You're entitled.
There are some very competent...
John Klute offered us his services, and we've accepted.
Klute knew Tom, and he has many ideas about the case.
Have you ever done missing persons work before?
No.
- Have you spent any time in the city?
- No.
Well, speaking frankly...
You're wondering why we thought of Klute?
Frankly he's interested.
And he cares.
Why didn't you ever find out anything from that girl?
We held her under surveillance expecting your boy Grunemann to show up there.
He didn't.
We arrested her on a C.P. Charge.
Convicted.
Two months women's city prison.
Offered to reduce sentence.
She cooperated.
She thought she remembered him from those letters from before.
She made that connection.
But she hadn't seen him since then and couldn't identify his photograph.
A good call girl, she'll turn 600 or 700 tricks a year.
Faces get blurred.
And since then, she's reported several incidents like breather calls, anonymous phone calls.
Also, somebody may be following her, watching her.
Things like that.
So I guess it's conceivable that Grunemann's still around there.
Still bugging her.
Hey, Trina!
Bree.
Listen, I could use a quick $50.
You got a commuter for me?
Terrific.
Right.
Terrific.
Yeah. 'Bye.
Hi.
I'm Bree.
Yeah.
Come in, please.
I'm glad to know you, Bree.
I'm glad you could come.
Sit down, please.
Where are you from?
Can I get you a drink?
Yeah, I'd like a ginger ale.
Thank you.
I'm from Chicago.
You come to New York often?
No, I don't come to New York too often.
- Too bad.
- Three times a year maybe.
What kind of party did you have in mind?
We could have a nice half-and-half party for $50.
We could have a good time for $50.
Or if you wanted something extra, it would be a little more.
- Maybe a nice...
- Listen, would it be all right...
Tell me what you want.
Tell me what you want.
That sounds fantastic.
That's so exciting.
But it's going to cost you more.
That's fantastic.
That's going to be $100.
- Sure, fine.
- Yeah.
- Yes, very good.
- $100.
Very good.
I like to get business done at the beginning.
That way we don't have to think about it, then we can just have a good time.
I like your mind.
Yes.
So.
Chicago.
This is the bed?
This is the bed.
Very nice.
There's the bed in operating position.
You're so nice.
Come here.
Angel.
My angel!
"We gather together
"to ask the Lord's blessing
"He hastens
"and chastens his wisdom divine
"and from the beginning
"the fight we were winning
"Lord, be at our side...
"divine"
It's 12:00 a.m. This is Jim Donnelly, WNEW News.
Con Edison has again resorted to a cutback in voltage to conserve generating capacity.
At three percent...
Hello?
Hello?
- Who is it?
- Miss Daniel, my name is Klute.
John Klute.
And I'd like to talk to you.
- What do you want?
- My name is John Klute.
You said that.
I'm an investigator.
I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
- Who?
- Tom Grunemann.
He wrote you some letters.
Wow.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania.
He disappeared from there last December.
- I've been hired to look for him.
- Why?
You know what I'm talking about, Miss Daniel.
Honest.
Can I ask you some questions please?
Do you have any identification?
You're not a cop?
You're not FBI?
You're a private detective?
And you just want to ask me some questions?
- They're not very recent.
That's last year.
- They're quite good.
What have you done that I might have seen on Broadway or off-Broadway?
- Well, I study with George Tainter.
- George?
George is very good.
He's a good man to begin with.
I've been in two of his productions.
- Two of his workshop productions.
- Workshop.
Well, they're very nice.
How do you feel about being an actress?
- I like it very much.
- You think you know yourself?
- As much as anybody.
- Do you really know yourself?
- No.
- That's very important.
- I forget myself when I act.
- You can't forget yourself.
You have to know yourself and kind of like yourself.
You have to relate.
Relate to people.
I had an identity crisis two years ago and since then I've been working to know myself.
That's very important.
Don't hide your face.
You have a nice face, you shouldn't hide it.
Excuse me just a second.
Julian?
Yes, okay, send her in.
Well, I'm very busy.
Thank you for stopping by.
If you're in anything off-off-Broadway...
How are you today?
I won't be able to come back anymore.
I'm sorry.
Because I just can't afford it.
Did I fail you, Bree?
I come here all the time, I pay you all this money and why do I still want to trick?
Why do I still walk by a phone and want to pick up the phone and call?
Did you think I had some magic potion?
You'd come in and tell me your problem and I would just take it away?
What's the difference between going on a call as a model or an actress, as a call girl?
You're successful as a call girl...
Because when you're a call girl you control it, that's why.
Because someone wants you.
Not me.
I mean, there are some johns that I have regularly that want me and that's terrific.
But they want a woman and I know I'm good.
I arrive at their hotel or their apartment and they're usually nervous, which is fine, because I'm not.
I know what I'm doing.
For an hour I'm the best actress in the world.
I'm the best fuck in the world.
And...
Why did you say you're the best actress in the world?
- At that time?
- Because it's an act.
That's what's nice about it.
You don't have to feel anything.
You don't have to care about anything.
You don't have to like anybody.
You just lead them by the ring in their nose in the direction they think they want to go.
You get a lot of money out of them in as short period of time as possible.
You control it and you call the shots and I always feel just great afterwards.
- And you enjoyed it?
- No.
Why not?
You say there's nothing wrong.
Why not?
You said...
There's a difference.
I don't think there's anything wrong with it morally.
I didn't enjoy it physically.
I came to enjoy it because it made me feel good.
It made me feel like I wasn't alone.
It made me feel that I had some control over myself, that I had some control over my life.
That I could determine things for myself.
I don't know.
I don't know why I'm here.
It's just so silly to think that somebody else can help anybody, isn't it?
I could come over tonight.
Are you alone?
In about an hour.
Okay.
See you in an hour.
Bree.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Enjoy.
- It's good to see you again.
- Likewise.
I've just got back from Cannes, you know.
And I...
Well I have something rather exciting to tell you.
Yes?
Cannes was very amusing.
We played baccarat and chemin de fer.
A very nice little Italian marquis was rather enthusiastic about me.
But a young man can be so silly.
Then one night at the gambling tables I saw him.
A stranger, he was looking at me.
He was standing very still on the other side of the room and his eyes were looking right into me.
And I knew that for the first time in my life...
Please.
Not young.
He wasn't young.
He had gray sideburns.
- Actually, he looked rather like you.
- Yes?
No one could tell me who he was.
Was he an exiled prince or a mercenary?
But there was a feeling stirring inside me, a pagan feeling.
The next day on the beach in my beach pavilion...
It was so warm on the sand and I saw him again.
He was staring at me.
His eyes were burning into me.
I was helpless.
He didn't even have to say anything, and I knew.
I knew that somehow...
You know, I've never liked young men.
And I knew that he would awaken something in me that no young man had ever awakened.
He was so wise and he taught me so many things with his hands.
In his eyes I felt so beautiful.
Miss Daniel.
Can I come upstairs and ask you some questions now?
You bastard!
Is this the shakedown, hon?
You picked a loser.
I don't have it!
I'm looking for Tom...
You think I'd live in this kip if I were taking calls full-time?
- I'd be back on Park Avenue.
- Can I ask you some questions?
Or you'll get me thrown back in the brig, you mean?
Have a seat.
Would you like some wine?
- Or some beer?
- No, thank you.
There isn't any beer anyway.
I've already told the police everything I know.
I don't even remember the schlub!
They showed me that already.
I understand this is Grunemann.
I told them, I don't remember.
Family-type man.
It figures.
Look will you please just try to get it from my side?
A year ago I was in the life full-time.
Living on Park Avenue.
This very nice apartment, leather furniture.
And then the cops dropped on me.
They caged me.
Started asking me about a guy that I'm supposed to have seen a year before that!
Two years ago!
He could be in Yemen!
Grunemann, what does that mean?
It's a name, I don't know him!
And they start showing me these pictures, and they don't mean anything to me.
Then they started asking me if I'd been getting letters from some guy out in Cabbageville.
Tuscarora.
Yeah, all right, I had been.
Very sick letters.
So they said, "Well, that's, Grunemann.
"So would you please tell us when you and he..."
Well, there was a guy once.
A freak.
Could've been him.
Apparently Grunemann liked to beat up on girls.
Well, this guy hired me and then he tried to kill me and that was about two years ago.
Tommy, allie allie in free, kid.
I got the gumdrops.
You remind me of my uncle.
What else do you remember about the man who beat you up?
Nothing.
Except that he wasn't kidding, that's all.
See, usually it's a fake out.
You probably know about that.
They pretend to tie you up and whip you while you wear a dress with a cloth belt.
Hell, it's their money, I don't care.
I'll swing from a shower rod and whistle Maytime.
Except this guy really freaked out on it.
But you cannot identify this man as Tom Grunemann?
I can't identify him as anybody!
So, is that it?
Listen why don't you go downstairs...
You have such a nice mouth.
...and get those tapes?
Bring them back up here and we'll have a party you and I.
- Wouldn't that be nice?
What about afterwards, the telephone calls?
Just phone calls, right?
What is it?
The phone rings, you answer it, there's no one there.
Kids having fun, burglars finding empty apartments.
It happens all the time.
It doesn't mean anything.
But you reported that you had been followed.
Look, I'm sorry.
I've been leading everybody astray.
It doesn't...
Okay, I get these feelings, but they're just feelings.
That's just me.
I'm sure you'll find this amusing, but I'm afraid of the dark.
Sometimes I get spooked.
I think I see people and hear things.
I go out in the morning and I think somebody's opened my mailbox.
If there's trash in front of my door I think somebody's trying to freak me out.
It's just nerves.
I'm a nervous broad.
It doesn't mean anything.
Bree Daniel.
How is Ted?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'd love to.
Maybe the next time you're in town?
I'd like to meet you very much.
You've got a nice voice.
I'm having a conversation with a very nice cop.
He's not a cop actually, he's a private...
Is that how you get most of your dates?
Someone gives your name to somebody.
Most of them, yes.
And that's how you met the man who beat you up?
I don't remember.
It was two years ago.
God!
How else do you get dates then, pimps?
You're very square, cookie.
No, pimps don't get dates for you, they just take your money.
The police have given me a list of names.
I'd like to ask you about them.
Frank Ligourin?
I'm sure this is going to amuse you, too.
But I'm really trying to get away from all that.
What about this evening, the old man?
You saw that?
Goddamn you!
He's 70 years old!
His wife's dead.
He's cut garments since he was 14.
He's maybe in his whole life had one week vacation and I'm all he's got!
He never lays a hand on me!
What harm is there in that?
What's your bag, Klute?
What do you like?
You a talker?
A button freak?
Like to have your chest walked around with high-heel shoes?
- You like to have us watch you tinkle?
- Okay.
Or do you get it off wearing women's clothes?
- Goddamn hypocrite squares!
- Okay.
I hope this isn't going to make my cold any worse.
- Now tell me about Frank Ligourin.
- He was my old man.
We broke up.
When?
- When did you break up?
- About eight months ago.
Would you mind not doing that?
What?
Okay?
Well, I thought I could trade you for those tapes.
Doesn't it get lonely down there in your little room?
Maybe I could bring some friends.
I've got some terrific friends.
No, thank you.
Men have paid $200 for me and here you are turning down a freebie.
You could get a perfectly good dishwasher for that.
What are you doing with my keys?
Give me your hand.
I knew it.
Don't be afraid.
I'm going to sit you down on the bed.
There's someone on the roof.
Sit.
Sit!
Tom?
Tom?
- You didn't get him?
- No.
Was it Grunemann?
I didn't see him.
Who sent you on that date?
Frankie Ligourin.
You and I will go talk to Frank Ligourin tomorrow.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not.
Would you like me to hold you?
I'm just trying to figure you out.
I may say not many people have been very successful at that.
That's all right.
I'll figure you out before the evening is over.
I hope you do, and in a way, I hope you don't.
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
Inhibitions are always nice because they're so nice to overcome.
- Because I'm very bad, you know.
- In what way?
How are you bad?
In my head.
I have very wicked ideas.
Lots of them.
I'm sure that as you're sitting at your desk you've all kinds of strange things going through your mind.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
Nothing is wrong.
You know that I will do anything you ask.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
I was just finishing up some work.
Mocking up a few photographs.
I used to be a photographer.
Did Bree tell you?
Before I got into publishing.
He knows you're a pimp, Frankie.
He knows you were my pimp.
Excuse me.
Bree, why don't you wait outside?
I always respected Bree.
I'd like to make something clear.
- I just got a couple of questions.
- I want to make something clear.
I don't go after a girl.
Girl comes to me.
Her choice.
Right?
I'm looking for a man, Tom Grunemann.
Miss Daniel tells me that the date that beat her two years ago might've been that man, and you sent her on that date.
Two years ago?
Sorry.
I understand you use narcotics.
Maybe I could have someone come over and look at your arms.
You know, I may stand better with the cops than you do.
Why don't you sit down and relax?
It was a family matter.
Between the girls.
Had two other girls then.
Two other girls besides Bree.
One of them, Jane McKenna she blows a little jealous of Bree.
Bree comes first.
Evidently she knew this freak who beats up on women.
She cons me into passing him on to Bree so Bree would get hurt.
I didn't know until afterwards.
You can't tell them one of their own in-laws laid a freak on them.
Peace in the family.
Beyond that I don't know.
That's all she wrote.
Did you see the man?
No.
How can I get hold of Jane McKenna?
Baby, would I be telling you all this?
She copped out long ago.
She committed suicide, Baxter.
And the other girl, what's her name?
- Arlyn?
- Page.
How do I find her?
I don't know.
She's a junkie.
Make that scene, you could be anywhere.
Here, San Francisco, they just drop out.
Anything else?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
Not very much.
- Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
- Where can I find Arlyn Page?
You're not going to find Arlyn Page, she's a junkie.
Didn't he tell you that he sent me that guy?
Jane McKenna sent you that guy.
Well, she's dead.
Your tapes.
Golly gee, just what I've always wanted.
Dirty phone calls.
What for?
I'm through with your part of it.
You told me what you could.
Tell me, Klute did we get you a little?
Just a little bit?
Us city folk.
The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
All that's so pathetic.
Fuck off!
I'll tell you something, Jack.
It is in the bells that I hear my voices.
Not today when they all rang, that was nothing but jangling.
But here, in this corner where the bells come down from heaven and the echoes linger or in the fields where they come across the quiet of the countryside my voices are in them.
Hark!
Do you hear?
"Dear child of God."
That's just what you said.
At the half-hour they will say, "Be brave, go on."
At the three-quarters they will say, "I am thy help."
When is it the hour.
When the great bell goes after:
"God will save France."
- It is then that St. Margaret...
- Thank you very much.
The script please.
Very interesting accent.
Booth!
Thank you.
All right, so what do you want, cop?
- I can't find Arlyn Page without your help.
- I told you you wouldn't find her.
If I can't find her, I can't find him, and if I can't find him then you're in trouble.
So what do you say?
Okay?
It's going to cost.
Time is money.
Okay.
Well, I can pay you $100.
- I can make $100 in a lunch break.
- $100 is all I've got.
You were very good upstairs.
Kid, will you buy me a coffee?
Buy you lunch.
Do you want lunch?
Come on.
Whenever it suits you.
No, make it Monday at 8:00 p.m.
I said Monday, 8:00 p.m. Now don't be naughty!
He's a lovely man.
Comes here spends a bundle of money, and never even touches the girls.
Comes from Grosse Pointe, has a big house, eight servants but all he wants to do is come here and scrub out my bathroom.
8:00 p.m., Monday Mr. Clean.
Arlyn Page I had let her go.
With the kind of people I get I couldn't have a gal who was zonked out all the time.
You know, I get the crème de la crème.
No, she was trouble and I don't allow any trouble here.
Che si può fare?
Honni soit qui mal y pense.
Do you have any idea where I can look for her?
Try Mama Reese's.
Bree if you get lonely or have no place to go, you come here.
You'll always have a home here.
Why?
She's a junkie.
She was with you after she left Frankie, wasn't she?
Well, she's not now.
I tried to do everything for her.
I took her into my own place, my own little flat on First.
You know that sweet place?
We could of had everything together.
Then the bitch sold my mink!
- Do you know anybody that's seen her?
- As far as I'm concerned, she's dead!
Who is it?
Bree Daniel.
I couldn't sleep.
I keep thinking I hear noises.
Can I come in?
Come in.
It was probably just my imagination.
Sit down.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
I just...
I don't think he's going to come back again.
I just don't want to be alone right now.
Do you mind if I stay here a while?
- Lf you'd like to go back upstairs, I'd come...
- I'd really rather not go upstairs.
Why don't you lie down here?
Sleep here.
- Where are you going to sleep?
- I'll pull that out.
Lie down.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
What's the matter?
You were terrific.
A real tiger.
Are you upset because you didn't make me come?
I never come with a john.
Don't feel bad about losing your virtue, I sort of knew you would.
Everybody always does.
Arlyn Page?
Yes, she was with me about three months.
She was lucky I kept her that long.
She was out of it.
Somebody said she was streetwalking over on Lexington Avenue.
Or was it Eighth?
You might take a look.
Or try Bill Azure, if you can find him.
Yes, she used to dress the way you do.
The whore?
Yes, I threw her out.
Do you know where she went from here?
Live like animals, her and the man.
Out!
She was living with a man?
He was worse than the whore!
Cappy!
- Arlyn Page?
- Arlyn, it's Bree!
Cappy, is that you?
- It's all right.
- Cappy, we got a radio...
Arlyn, it's okay.
Bree, honey I'm waiting for someone.
You've got to help us.
Can't you see I'm strung out?
It'll only take you a couple of minutes.
A couple years ago, Jane sent me a guy that beat me.
If he sees you, he won't come.
Was she seeing a freak, one of her regular johns?
Was he a freak?
Yes.
What about it?
Did he come around a lot?
No, he was an older guy.
It's very important.
- Arlyn, get them out of here!
- I'm begging you!
It's very important, please.
- Can you give me a description of him?
- Cappy?
- Cappy, listen.
No!
- Cappy, don't run!
Cappy, don't run!
I've got a radio, Cappy!
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow.
A narcotics addict.
I believed her.
I believed her absolutely.
The man who did those beatings was not Tom Grunemann.
Suppose it wasn't Tom.
Where does that get you?
Tom is still connected because of the letters, whether he wrote them or not.
The only way that I'm going to find him is to find the man who did do the beatings.
The only way I'm going to find him is to pursue Arlyn Page and try to secure from her some kind of identification.
I'll be flying back to Pennsylvania on Friday and I'll fill them in on things.
How is it back there?
I think you're homesick.
I'll be back on Thursday.
John, I want to tell you how much I respect your dedication.
Thank you.
Because I'm very bad, you know.
I have very wicked ideas.
As you're sitting at your desk you have strange things running through your mind.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
Nothing is wrong.
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?
I like to sort of walk around here with no clothes on.
I think people wear clothes much too often, don't you?
I think in the confines of one's house, one should be free of clothing and inhibitions.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
I was trying to get away from a world that I had known, because I don't think it was very good for me, and I found myself looking up its ass...
...and seeing people that I used to know and that I liked a lot that were my friends.
Sort of.
Girls and that could have been me.
I mean, I know I'm not stupid.
I guess I just realized that I don't really give a damn.
What I would really like to do is be faceless and bodiless and be left alone.
You're lucky they're still here.
We don't keep unclaimed possessions in suicide cases more than a year.
Number 497.
Jane McKenna.
I thought there would be more.
Well, there's this man, this detective and I don't know exactly what is happening or what he wants out of me, or anything like that.
But he took care of me.
Did you feel threatened by it?
I don't know.
When you're used to being lonely and somebody comes in and moves that around, it's sort of scary I guess.
How do you feel when you feel scared?
- Angry.
- At whom?
- Whoever is making me feel that way.
- Do you feel angry at him?
Half of the time, yes.
How do you feel angry?
What do you want to do?
I want to manipulate him.
How?
In all the ways that I can manipulate people.
I mean, it's easy to manipulate men.
Right?
They were bringing a freighter down through Kill Van Kull.
Propellers washed it up on top.
Arlyn Page was probably an alias.
- Sorry.
- Man, can you help me out?
Yes.
What?
I mean, can you help me out?
I mean that's my baby, dead.
I have to get up.
- You know what it means, my baby dead.
- Got to get up.
Okay?
Lt. Trask, please.
John Klute.
I think we should run down and check on everybody who knew Tom Grunemann.
I don't think the man who wrote the letters was Tom.
Just run down and check on everything.
Talk to you.
You're up, are you?
How are you?
Trask wants you to call him.
He told me about Arlyn.
It probably doesn't have anything to do with anything but just as a precaution when you go out, if you tell me where you're going to go a phone number where I can find you.
Just so I can always keep in touch with you.
Okay?
Sure.
I'm all right.
I know.
I feel physically, that's what's different.
I mean, I feel.
My body feels.
I enjoy making love with him.
Which is a very baffling and bewildering thing, because I've never felt that before.
I wish that I could let things happen and enjoy it, you know for what it is and while it lasts and relax about it.
But all the time, I keep feeling the need to destroy it.
To break it off.
To go back to the comfort of being numb again.
I keep hoping, in a way, that it's going to end.
Because I had more control before, when I was with tricks.
I knew what I was doing and I was setting everything up.
And that's what's so strange:
It's that I'm not setting anything up.
That something is...
You know what this is like, but I've never felt it before.
It's a new thing and it's so strange.
The sensation that something that is flowing from me naturally to somebody else without it's being prettied up or...
I mean, he's seen me horrible!
He's seen me ugly!
He's seen me mean.
He's seen me whorey and it doesn't seem to matter.
He seems to accept me.
I guess having sex with somebody and feeling those sort of feelings towards them is very new to me.
I wish that I didn't keep wanting to destroy it.
You know, I'm trying to stay out of it.
Yes.
I'd love to party with you, but I...
Yes.
Marta, try to get somebody else and if I change my mind I'll call you, okay?
You're not going to get hung up on me, are you?
- Yes, sir, can I help you?
- Yes, can I have a bag please?
- Yes.
- A couple of bags please.
Well, let me see how much those weigh.
- A pound and a quarter.
- I'll have some of those small tomatoes.
- No mushy ones.
- Okay, thanks.
- What do you have in your bag?
- What?
What have you got in your bag?
Can I have a cantaloupe, please?
Wait.
He cut up my clothes...
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Hello?
I can be a very bad girl, you know.
I sometimes need a spanking.
I have very wicked ideas.
I will do anything you ask.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
You mustn't be.
You know, there's nothing wrong.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
She can't remember.
Well, it could have been it could have been hidden in his pocket, I've seen one of those.
All right.
I'll wait for you here.
Bree?
Trask and some officers are coming to examine your apartment.
I want you to stay here today and tomorrow.
You'll be safe here.
I'll only be gone for a few minutes tomorrow.
Bree?
Bree?
Well, you look like you've been with many women, but I didn't know if you'd ever paid for a woman before.
I mean, you wouldn't need to.
So if you do, it's obviously because it excites you.
Because you're not a man that would have to pay for a woman.
You could have any woman you wanted.
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
I will do anything you ask or want.
Since you know that there are no limits to my imagination.
I place no moral judgments on anything.
We checked out 42 letters of Tom Grunemann's friends.
And we only came up with one with any similarity to the obscene letter.
All right, there's Tom Grunemann.
Different margins, different spacings.
That's mine.
You said to check out everybody.
Same margins, top and sides.
He does best with his middle fingers.
We get fainter registrations on outside keys.
Notice how he invariably does that with the "T" and the "H."
Who is it?
Peter Cable.
But you have no case.
There's not even a body.
I'm sorry we have to meet here, but I'm pretty rushed for time.
I have a business meeting tonight in Chicago.
Any developments?
I think I can close the case. ...if I can have $500 to purchase Jane McKenna's address book.
I don't understand what you mean.
Well, I've found a contact who will sell me the book.
A little black book containing the name of the client that beat up Bree Daniel.
He is also the man who came into Bree Daniel's apartment yesterday and wrecked it.
We know that now because of the semen that he left in her underwear.
The blood type is AB, and Tom's was type A. It wasn't Tom.
I think this man killed Jane McKenna and Arlyn Page.
I think he drowned them.
I you should prepare yourself for the fact that Tom is possibly dead.
The only way I'll find out is to find him.
I need the money before tomorrow night.
- You're meeting him tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- He's bringing the book to my apartment.
- At what time?
8:30.
I'll notify the board as soon as I get to Chicago and have them wire you the money immediately.
Thank you, John.
I certainly hope you're wrong about Tom.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.
I don't want you to do this.
Bree.
I'm just going to a girlfriend's apartment.
I can't stay here, obviously.
Please.
Not with him.
This other girl has a very big apartment, lots of room.
But it's not necessarily how it looks.
Look we all respect each other, right?
I respect you.
Bree respects you.
But you have to respect her, too.
Her best interests.
Mrs. Daniel, I have to close up now.
Leave your name and number with the service and she'll get back to you.
I can't.
Well, I have to close up now.
I almost killed somebody.
Well, I'm certain the doctor would like to speak with you about it.
As a matter of fact, I'll have her call you as soon as she gets home.
I promise.
- Can I use your phone?
- Sure.
Is Mr. Goldfarb there?
Mr. Goldfarb Sr.
I have to talk to somebody.
I'm just a little way across town.
Can I come over?
About half an hour?
Detective Trask, please.
Hi, John Klute.
He didn't take the plane, he cancelled out.
I'm at home in my apartment.
I don't know where she is.
I'll find her.
Okay.
I'll leave word if I go out.
Okay.
I have an appointment with Mr. Goldfarb.
Mr. Goldfarb!
Mr. Goldfarb!
Hello.
What can I do for you?
I'm sorry.
I mean Mr. Goldfarb Sr.
My father left about 15 minutes ago.
He didn't feel so good.
- Can I help you?
- He's working himself to death, poor man.
- You sure I can't help you?
- It's not important.
No, really.
I don't mind.
You're going to miss your train, Mr. Goldfarb.
Excuse me.
Did he leave a message for me?
Bree Daniel.
I thought that was for tomorrow!
Mr. Goldfarb's wire.
Yes, Mama, I'm coming right now.
I know you don't like to get in in the middle of the picture!
Yes, right away.
Bye-bye.
We're closing now, Miss.
May I leave Mr. Goldfarb a message?
Poor man, everybody's friend.
Hello?
Hello?
This is Bree Daniel.
Has the doctor checked in yet?
When she does, tell her I'm at 246-1383.
I'll wait five minutes.
How I can reach the doctor?
The doctor hasn't checked in yet.
I'm trying to locate a Miss Bree Daniel.
I'm sorry sir, but we only take messages for the doctor.
Has she called in or anything?
Has she called the doctor at all today?
- She left a forwarding number.
- Can I have that number, please?
I'm not allowed to give that out.
I'm a police officer.
Please don't make me prove this.
You must understand my position.
I must comply with the rules.
I understand all that.
Will you just give me the number, please?
Can we talk about this reasonably?
I know you're expecting some kind of extravagant behavior but do you believe me?
Yes.
We can talk?
Well, it's just an ordinary matter.
I'm a very well-off man.
I have a position to respect I would feel personally, very uncomfortable to be connected with a certain kind of woman.
I'm sure you understand what I mean.
Look, John Klute works for me.
I know you're his contact.
I know he's trying to acquire Jane McKenna's book.
I'm in a position to offer more for it than he can.
You don't understand what I'm talking about, do you?
Yes.
Jane McKenna's book.
- And I'll try to get it for you.
- No.
Obviously you're frightened and you're lying.
No, I'm not.
I will, I'll try to get it for you.
Is this something Klute's invented.
Is this a trap for me?
- Klute knows about me, doesn't he?
- Knows what about you?
Then everybody knows about me.
So, it doesn't make any difference what I do anymore, does it?
I've no idea what I'm going to do and I'm so deeply puzzled.
I've done terrible things.
I've killed three people.
And yet, I don't consider myself a terrible man.
No more than others.
See, Tom Grunemann discovered me.
We were here on business together and he found me and Jane McKenna in my hotel room.
She had become hysterical and she started screaming and I guess I hit her.
I don't actually recall how it all happened so quickly.
Anyway, she fell and hit her head, and that's when Tom came in the room.
I guess he must've heard her screaming.
But I never understood why she did that.
She had never screamed before.
It was the revulsion and the contempt that I saw on his face and the certainty that sooner or later he would use it against me within the company.
I tried to endure that as long as I possibly could.
You just want me to keep on talking, don't you?
No, I don't.
I do understand.
I really do.
Well, that's what you all do.
You make a man think that he's accepted.
It's all just a great big game to you.
You're all obviously too lazy and too warped to do anything meaningful with your life, so you prey upon the sexual fantasies of others.
I'm sure it comes as no great surprise to you when I say that there are little corners in everyone which were better off left alone.
Little sicknesses, weaknesses, which should never be exposed.
That's your stock in trade, isn't it, a man's weakness?
I was never really fully aware of mine until you brought them out.
How far out of town are we?
- Five miles outside of New York.
- Do you mind if I turn the lights down?
No, it's up to you.
Turn the light out if you'd like.
My name is Peter Cable.
I work for the Tole American Corporation which is situated in Pennsylvania and in New York.
I would not be telling you these things if my intentions weren't honorable.
- You look familiar to me.
- In what way?
I don't know.
Your face looks familiar to me.
I guess I have a confession to make.
We did meet before.
About two years ago.
I often wondered whatever happened to Arlyn Page and here you are.
Yeah, I remember.
Listen I've got get out of here.
I mean I can't...
I remember you.
- Well, what do you remember?
- You beat me up, that's what you did!
It's okay.
Just freaked me out for a minute, that's all.
I promise to drive you back afterwards.
Okay.
Why don't you just tell me what you'd like, and then...
- ... after you tell me what you'd like...
- I'd like to spend some time with you.
- I have been looking for you for two years.
- Why?
That's my business.
I will say that you gave me a great deal of pleasure.
I saw in you things that I had not seen in other women of your profession.
I will not harm you at all physically.
It's all right.
No, it's not all right, and you know it's not all right.
No, it is all right.
If that's what you...
But, you have to tell me first.
If that's what you want...
- ... that's fine.
- Arlyn why don't you lie down on the bed and make yourself comfortable.
I'll not strap you in, I'll not tie you down.
Just lie down on the bed, please.
Be comfortable.
Nothing's going to happen.
Nothing's going to happen.
Okay.
- Why don't you make yourself comfortable?
- I am perfectly comfortable.
Just put your head down.
You have such lovely long blonde hair.
Turn your head.
Like that.
Don't!
Don't!
I've explained to him what I have to do and I think he understands.
What could ever happen for us?
I mean, we're so different.
I know enough about myself to know that whatever lies in store for me it's not going to be setting up housekeeping with somebody in Tuscarora and darning socks and doing all that.
I'd go out of my mind.
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I don't know how I feel about him.
It's so hard for me to say it!
God!
- To say what?
- I'm going to miss him.
Bree Daniel.
How is Roy?
Well, I'm leaving town right now and I don't expect to be back.
You're very nice.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
I have no idea what's going to happen.
I just can't stay in the city, you know?
Maybe I'll come back.
You'll probably see me next week.
We've got two tons of potatoes.
Tom!
I'll drink to that.
Did you know the subject, Thomas Grunemann?
- Yes.
- Very well.
He was my best friend.
We grew up together.
Can you account for his disappearance in anyway?
- Mrs. Grunemann?
- No.
Did he recently appear to be agitated or depressed in any way?
No.
Mr. Cable, at the plant did he voice any grievance or discontent about his work there?
Not at all.
As a matter of fact, Tom operated best when he was under pressure.
Please forgive me, Mrs. Grunemann, but I have to ask.
Did your husband ever show any moral or sexual problems or peculiarities?
No.
Any marital problems in general, that is?
We were very happy.
Did he ever mention specifically, a girl or a woman in New York City?
No.
- No.
- Why?
We recovered in his desk at the plant in one of the drawers a typewritten letter that was evidently written on the Friday before he disappeared.
It was written to a girl in New York City and we contacted the police.
They brought her in, questioned her and she said that she had received six or seven letters of this kind.
Can I see it?
Well, it's an obscene letter, Mrs. Grunemann.
I would like to see it.
I would like you to remember that it was written by a very disturbed man.
I don't believe it.
I'd like you to know that situations of this kind are not unique.
A man will lead a double life.
A Jekyll-and-Hyde existence and his wife has no idea what's going on.
Has anybody talked to you about the financial arrangements?
Well, that depends, naturally, on how long you want me for and what you want to do.
I know you.
It will be very nice.
I'd like to spend the evening with you if it's...
If you'd like that.
Have you ever been with a woman before?
Paying her?
Do you like it?
I mean, I have the feeling that that turns you on very particularly.
What turns me on is because I have a good imagination and I like pleasing.
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?
I think in the confines of one's house, one should be free of clothing and inhibitions.
Inhibitions are always nice because they're so nice to overcome.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not.
As long as you don't hurt me more than I like to be hurt I will do anything you ask.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
You mustn't be.
You know, there's nothing wrong.
Nothing is wrong.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
All right.
Would you stand up, please?
- Hello.
- Hi.
Hi, can I see your eyes?
Let me see your hair.
- Take your hat off.
- Take my hat off?
Yeah.
Okay.
- Too pretty.
- Too pretty.
Now, that's the color.
The coloring is great.
I don't know.
- It's not quite it though.
- No, not really.
Hello.
Can I see your hands?
- Thank you.
- She's got funny hands.
- Hi.
- She is great.
- Beautiful eyes.
- Yes.
- All right.
That's the coloring.
- Yeah, let me see you smile.
- I think she has that cross between...
- She's great.
But I've seen you before.
- I think so.
- Have you done any cosmetic ads?
- Yes, I have.
- You have?
- How do they send people with a conflict?
- It's got to be a new face.
Call that agency.
- Irene Dunne would've had it.
- That would be perfect.
- C minus.
- C minus.
- Got to find her today.
- That's it.
Thank you, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
I'm exhausted.
One more day of this and I'll plop.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Just have a seat, please.
It's been six months.
Tom Grunemann has been missing for half a year.
And all the FBI has to offer is a report that must bore even you.
There are thousands of honest, decent men who simply disappear every year.
Neither Mrs. Grunemann nor I are willing to just dismiss this case.
And therefore we feel entitled to investigate on our own.
You're entitled.
There are some very competent...
John Klute offered us his services, and we've accepted.
Klute knew Tom, and he has many ideas about the case.
Have you ever done missing persons work before?
No.
- Have you spent any time in the city?
- No.
Well, speaking frankly...
You're wondering why we thought of Klute?
Frankly he's interested.
And he cares.
Why didn't you ever find out anything from that girl?
We held her under surveillance expecting your boy Grunemann to show up there.
He didn't.
We arrested her on a C.P. Charge.
Convicted.
Two months women's city prison.
Offered to reduce sentence.
She cooperated.
She thought she remembered him from those letters from before.
She made that connection.
But she hadn't seen him since then and couldn't identify his photograph.
A good call girl, she'll turn 600 or 700 tricks a year.
Faces get blurred.
And since then, she's reported several incidents like breather calls, anonymous phone calls.
Also, somebody may be following her, watching her.
Things like that.
So I guess it's conceivable that Grunemann's still around there.
Still bugging her.
Hey, Trina!
Bree.
Listen, I could use a quick $50.
You got a commuter for me?
Terrific.
Right.
Terrific.
Yeah. 'Bye.
Hi.
I'm Bree.
Yeah.
Come in, please.
I'm glad to know you, Bree.
I'm glad you could come.
Sit down, please.
Where are you from?
Can I get you a drink?
Yeah, I'd like a ginger ale.
Thank you.
I'm from Chicago.
You come to New York often?
No, I don't come to New York too often.
- Too bad.
- Three times a year maybe.
What kind of party did you have in mind?
We could have a nice half-and-half party for $50.
We could have a good time for $50.
Or if you wanted something extra, it would be a little more.
- Maybe a nice...
- Listen, would it be all right...
Tell me what you want.
Tell me what you want.
That sounds fantastic.
That's so exciting.
But it's going to cost you more.
That's fantastic.
That's going to be $100.
- Sure, fine.
- Yeah.
- Yes, very good.
- $100.
Very good.
I like to get business done at the beginning.
That way we don't have to think about it, then we can just have a good time.
I like your mind.
Yes.
So.
Chicago.
This is the bed?
This is the bed.
Very nice.
There's the bed in operating position.
You're so nice.
Come here.
Angel.
My angel!
"We gather together
"to ask the Lord's blessing
"He hastens
"and chastens his wisdom divine
"and from the beginning
"the fight we were winning
"Lord, be at our side...
"divine"
It's 12:00 a. m.
This is Jim Donnelly, WNEW News.
Con Edison has again resorted to a cutback in voltage to conserve generating capacity.
At three percent...
Hello?
Hello?
- Who is it?
- Miss Daniel, my name is Klute.
John Klute.
And I'd like to talk to you.
- What do you want?
- My name is John Klute.
You said that.
I'm an investigator.
I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
- Who?
- Tom Grunemann.
He wrote you some letters.
Wow.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania.
He disappeared from there last December.
- I've been hired to look for him.
- Why?
You know what I'm talking about, Miss Daniel.
Honest.
Can I ask you some questions please?
Do you have any identification?
You're not a cop?
You're not FBI?
You're a private detective?
And you just want to ask me some questions?
- They're not very recent.
That's last year.
- They're quite good.
What have you done that I might have seen on Broadway or off-Broadway?
- Well, I study with George Tainter.
- George?
George is very good.
He's a good man to begin with.
I've been in two of his productions.
- Two of his workshop productions.
- Workshop.
Well, they're very nice.
How do you feel about being an actress?
- I like it very much.
- You think you know yourself?
- As much as anybody.
- Do you really know yourself?
- No.
- That's very important.
- I forget myself when I act.
- You can't forget yourself.
You have to know yourself and kind of like yourself.
You have to relate.
Relate to people.
I had an identity crisis two years ago and since then I've been working to know myself.
That's very important.
Don't hide your face.
You have a nice face, you shouldn't hide it.
Excuse me just a second.
Julian?
Yes, okay, send her in.
Well, I'm very busy.
Thank you for stopping by.
If you're in anything off-off-Broadway...
How are you today?
I won't be able to come back anymore.
I'm sorry.
Because I just can't afford it.
Did I fail you, Bree?
I come here all the time, I pay you all this money and why do I still want to trick?
Why do I still walk by a phone and want to pick up the phone and call?
Did you think I had some magic potion?
You'd come in and tell me your problem and I would just take it away?
What's the difference between going on a call as a model or an actress, as a call girl?
You're successful as a call girl...
Because when you're a call girl you control it, that's why.
Because someone wants you.
Not me.
I mean, there are some johns that I have regularly that want me and that's terrific.
But they want a woman and I know I'm good.
I arrive at their hotel or their apartment and they're usually nervous, which is fine, because I'm not.
I know what I'm doing.
For an hour I'm the best actress in the world.
I'm the best fuck in the world.
And...
Why did you say you're the best actress in the world?
- At that time?
- Because it's an act.
That's what's nice about it.
You don't have to feel anything.
You don't have to care about anything.
You don't have to like anybody.
You just lead them by the ring in their nose in the direction they think they want to go.
You get a lot of money out of them in as short period of time as possible.
You control it and you call the shots and I always feel just great afterwards.
- And you enjoyed it?
- No.
Why not?
You say there's nothing wrong.
Why not?
You said...
There's a difference.
I don't think there's anything wrong with it morally.
I didn't enjoy it physically.
I came to enjoy it because it made me feel good.
It made me feel like I wasn't alone.
It made me feel that I had some control over myself, that I had some control over my life.
That I could determine things for myself.
I don't know.
I don't know why I'm here.
It's just so silly to think that somebody else can help anybody, isn't it?
I could come over tonight.
Are you alone?
In about an hour.
Okay.
See you in an hour.
Bree.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Enjoy.
- It's good to see you again.
- Likewise.
I've just got back from Cannes, you know.
And I...
Well I have something rather exciting to tell you.
Yes?
Cannes was very amusing.
We played baccarat and chemin de fer.
A very nice little Italian marquis was rather enthusiastic about me.
But a young man can be so silly.
Then one night at the gambling tables I saw him.
A stranger, he was looking at me.
He was standing very still on the other side of the room and his eyes were looking right into me.
And I knew that for the first time in my life...
Please.
Not young.
He wasn't young.
He had gray sideburns.
- Actually, he looked rather like you.
- Yes?
No one could tell me who he was.
Was he an exiled prince or a mercenary?
But there was a feeling stirring inside me, a pagan feeling.
The next day on the beach in my beach pavilion...
It was so warm on the sand and I saw him again.
He was staring at me.
His eyes were burning into me.
I was helpless.
He didn't even have to say anything, and I knew.
I knew that somehow...
You know, I've never liked young men.
And I knew that he would awaken something in me that no young man had ever awakened.
He was so wise and he taught me so many things with his hands.
In his eyes I felt so beautiful.
Miss Daniel.
Can I come upstairs and ask you some questions now?
You bastard!
Is this the shakedown, hon?
You picked a loser.
I don't have it!
I'm looking for Tom...
You think I'd live in this kip if I were taking calls full-time?
- I'd be back on Park Avenue.
- Can I ask you some questions?
Or you'll get me thrown back in the brig, you mean?
Have a seat.
Would you like some wine?
- Or some beer?
- No, thank you.
There isn't any beer anyway.
I've already told the police everything I know.
I don't even remember the schlub!
They showed me that already.
I understand this is Grunemann.
I told them, I don't remember.
Family-type man.
It figures.
Look will you please just try to get it from my side?
A year ago I was in the life full-time.
Living on Park Avenue.
This very nice apartment, leather furniture.
And then the cops dropped on me.
They caged me.
Started asking me about a guy that I'm supposed to have seen a year before that!
Two years ago!
He could be in Yemen!
Grunemann, what does that mean?
It's a name, I don't know him!
And they start showing me these pictures, and they don't mean anything to me.
Then they started asking me if I'd been getting letters from some guy out in Cabbageville.
Tuscarora.
Yeah, all right, I had been.
Very sick letters.
So they said, "Well, that's, Grunemann.
"So would you please tell us when you and he..."
Well, there was a guy once.
A freak.
Could've been him.
Apparently Grunemann liked to beat up on girls.
Well, this guy hired me and then he tried to kill me and that was about two years ago.
Tommy, allie allie in free, kid.
I got the gumdrops.
You remind me of my uncle.
What else do you remember about the man who beat you up?
Nothing.
Except that he wasn't kidding, that's all.
See, usually it's a fake out.
You probably know about that.
They pretend to tie you up and whip you while you wear a dress with a cloth belt.
Hell, it's their money, I don't care.
I'll swing from a shower rod and whistle Maytime.
Except this guy really freaked out on it.
But you cannot identify this man as Tom Grunemann?
I can't identify him as anybody!
So, is that it?
Listen why don't you go downstairs...
You have such a nice mouth.
... and get those tapes?
Bring them back up here and we'll have a party you and I.
- Wouldn't that be nice?
What about afterwards, the telephone calls?
Just phone calls, right?
What is it?
The phone rings, you answer it, there's no one there.
Kids having fun, burglars finding empty apartments.
It happens all the time.
It doesn't mean anything.
But you reported that you had been followed.
Look, I'm sorry.
I've been leading everybody astray.
It doesn't...
Okay, I get these feelings, but they're just feelings.
That's just me.
I'm sure you'll find this amusing, but I'm afraid of the dark.
Sometimes I get spooked.
I think I see people and hear things.
I go out in the morning and I think somebody's opened my mailbox.
If there's trash in front of my door I think somebody's trying to freak me out.
It's just nerves.
I'm a nervous broad.
It doesn't mean anything.
Bree Daniel.
How is Ted?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'd love to.
Maybe the next time you're in town?
I'd like to meet you very much.
You've got a nice voice.
I'm having a conversation with a very nice cop.
He's not a cop actually, he's a private...
Is that how you get most of your dates?
Someone gives your name to somebody.
Most of them, yes.
And that's how you met the man who beat you up?
I don't remember.
It was two years ago.
God!
How else do you get dates then, pimps?
You're very square, cookie.
No, pimps don't get dates for you, they just take your money.
The police have given me a list of names.
I'd like to ask you about them.
Frank Ligourin?
I'm sure this is going to amuse you, too.
But I'm really trying to get away from all that.
What about this evening, the old man?
You saw that?
Goddamn you!
He's 70 years old!
His wife's dead.
He's cut garments since he was 14.
He's maybe in his whole life had one week vacation and I'm all he's got!
He never lays a hand on me!
What harm is there in that?
What's your bag, Klute?
What do you like?
You a talker?
A button freak?
Like to have your chest walked around with high-heel shoes?
- You like to have us watch you tinkle?
- Okay.
Or do you get it off wearing women's clothes?
- Goddamn hypocrite squares!
- Okay.
I hope this isn't going to make my cold any worse.
- Now tell me about Frank Ligourin.
- He was my old man.
We broke up.
When?
- When did you break up?
- About eight months ago.
Would you mind not doing that?
What?
Okay?
Well, I thought I could trade you for those tapes.
Doesn't it get lonely down there in your little room?
Maybe I could bring some friends.
I've got some terrific friends.
No, thank you.
Men have paid $200 for me and here you are turning down a freebie.
You could get a perfectly good dishwasher for that.
What are you doing with my keys?
Give me your hand.
I knew it.
Don't be afraid.
I'm going to sit you down on the bed.
There's someone on the roof.
Sit.
Sit!
Tom?
Tom?
- You didn't get him?
- No.
Was it Grunemann?
I didn't see him.
Who sent you on that date?
Frankie Ligourin.
You and I will go talk to Frank Ligourin tomorrow.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not.
Would you like me to hold you?
I'm just trying to figure you out.
I may say not many people have been very successful at that.
That's all right.
I'll figure you out before the evening is over.
I hope you do, and in a way, I hope you don't.
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
Inhibitions are always nice because they're so nice to overcome.
- Because I'm very bad, you know.
- In what way?
How are you bad?
In my head.
I have very wicked ideas.
Lots of them.
I'm sure that as you're sitting at your desk you've all kinds of strange things going through your mind.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
Nothing is wrong.
You know that I will do anything you ask.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
I was just finishing up some work.
Mocking up a few photographs.
I used to be a photographer.
Did Bree tell you?
Before I got into publishing.
He knows you're a pimp, Frankie.
He knows you were my pimp.
Excuse me.
Bree, why don't you wait outside?
I always respected Bree.
I'd like to make something clear.
- I just got a couple of questions.
- I want to make something clear.
I don't go after a girl.
Girl comes to me.
Her choice.
Right?
I'm looking for a man, Tom Grunemann.
Miss Daniel tells me that the date that beat her two years ago might've been that man, and you sent her on that date.
Two years ago?
Sorry.
I understand you use narcotics.
Maybe I could have someone come over and look at your arms.
You know, I may stand better with the cops than you do.
Why don't you sit down and relax?
It was a family matter.
Between the girls.
Had two other girls then.
Two other girls besides Bree.
One of them, Jane McKenna she blows a little jealous of Bree.
Bree comes first.
Evidently she knew this freak who beats up on women.
She cons me into passing him on to Bree so Bree would get hurt.
I didn't know until afterwards.
You can't tell them one of their own in-laws laid a freak on them.
Peace in the family.
Beyond that I don't know.
That's all she wrote.
Did you see the man?
No.
How can I get hold of Jane McKenna?
Baby, would I be telling you all this?
She copped out long ago.
She committed suicide, Baxter.
And the other girl, what's her name?
- Arlyn?
- Page.
How do I find her?
I don't know.
She's a junkie.
Make that scene, you could be anywhere.
Here, San Francisco, they just drop out.
Anything else?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
Not very much.
- Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
- Where can I find Arlyn Page?
You're not going to find Arlyn Page, she's a junkie.
Didn't he tell you that he sent me that guy?
Jane McKenna sent you that guy.
Well, she's dead.
Your tapes.
Golly gee, just what I've always wanted.
Dirty phone calls.
What for?
I'm through with your part of it.
You told me what you could.
Tell me, Klute did we get you a little?
Just a little bit?
Us city folk.
The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
All that's so pathetic.
Fuck off!
I'll tell you something, Jack.
It is in the bells that I hear my voices.
Not today when they all rang, that was nothing but jangling.
But here, in this corner where the bells come down from heaven and the echoes linger or in the fields where they come across the quiet of the countryside my voices are in them.
Hark!
Do you hear?
"Dear child of God."
That's just what you said.
At the half-hour they will say, "Be brave, go on."
At the three-quarters they will say, "I am thy help."
When is it the hour.
When the great bell goes after:
"God will save France."
- It is then that St. Margaret...
- Thank you very much.
The script please.
Very interesting accent.
Booth!
Thank you.
All right, so what do you want, cop?
- I can't find Arlyn Page without your help.
- I told you you wouldn't find her.
If I can't find her, I can't find him, and if I can't find him then you're in trouble.
So what do you say?
Okay?
It's going to cost.
Time is money.
Okay.
Well, I can pay you $100.
- I can make $100 in a lunch break.
- $100 is all I've got.
You were very good upstairs.
Kid, will you buy me a coffee?
Buy you lunch.
Do you want lunch?
Come on.
Whenever it suits you.
No, make it Monday at 8:00 p. m.
I said Monday, 8:00 p. m.
Now don't be naughty!
He's a lovely man.
Comes here spends a bundle of money, and never even touches the girls.
Comes from Grosse Pointe, has a big house, eight servants but all he wants to do is come here and scrub out my bathroom.
8:00 p. m., Monday Mr. Clean.
Arlyn Page I had let her go.
With the kind of people I get I couldn't have a gal who was zonked out all the time.
You know, I get the crème de la crème.
No, she was trouble and I don't allow any trouble here.
Che si può fare?
Honni soit qui mal y pense.
Do you have any idea where I can look for her?
Try Mama Reese's.
Bree if you get lonely or have no place to go, you come here.
You'll always have a home here.
Why?
She's a junkie.
She was with you after she left Frankie, wasn't she?
Well, she's not now.
I tried to do everything for her.
I took her into my own place, my own little flat on First.
You know that sweet place?
We could of had everything together.
Then the bitch sold my mink!
- Do you know anybody that's seen her?
- As far as I'm concerned, she's dead!
Who is it?
Bree Daniel.
I couldn't sleep.
I keep thinking I hear noises.
Can I come in?
Come in.
It was probably just my imagination.
Sit down.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
I just...
I don't think he's going to come back again.
I just don't want to be alone right now.
Do you mind if I stay here a while?
- Lf you'd like to go back upstairs, I'd come...
- I'd really rather not go upstairs.
Why don't you lie down here?
Sleep here.
- Where are you going to sleep?
- I'll pull that out.
Lie down.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
What's the matter?
You were terrific.
A real tiger.
Are you upset because you didn't make me come?
I never come with a john.
Don't feel bad about losing your virtue, I sort of knew you would.
Everybody always does.
Arlyn Page?
Yes, she was with me about three months.
She was lucky I kept her that long.
She was out of it.
Somebody said she was streetwalking over on Lexington Avenue.
Or was it Eighth?
You might take a look.
Or try Bill Azure, if you can find him.
Yes, she used to dress the way you do.
The whore?
Yes, I threw her out.
Do you know where she went from here?
Live like animals, her and the man.
Out!
She was living with a man?
He was worse than the whore!
Cappy!
- Arlyn Page?
- Arlyn, it's Bree!
Cappy, is that you?
- It's all right.
- Cappy, we got a radio...
Arlyn, it's okay.
Bree, honey I'm waiting for someone.
You've got to help us.
Can't you see I'm strung out?
It'll only take you a couple of minutes.
A couple years ago, Jane sent me a guy that beat me.
If he sees you, he won't come.
Was she seeing a freak, one of her regular johns?
Was he a freak?
Yes.
What about it?
Did he come around a lot?
No, he was an older guy.
It's very important.
- Arlyn, get them out of here!
- I'm begging you!
It's very important, please.
- Can you give me a description of him?
- Cappy?
- Cappy, listen.
No!
- Cappy, don't run!
Cappy, don't run!
I've got a radio, Cappy!
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow.
A narcotics addict.
I believed her.
I believed her absolutely.
The man who did those beatings was not Tom Grunemann.
Suppose it wasn't Tom.
Where does that get you?
Tom is still connected because of the letters, whether he wrote them or not.
The only way that I'm going to find him is to find the man who did do the beatings.
The only way I'm going to find him is to pursue Arlyn Page and try to secure from her some kind of identification.
I'll be flying back to Pennsylvania on Friday and I'll fill them in on things.
How is it back there?
I think you're homesick.
I'll be back on Thursday.
John, I want to tell you how much I respect your dedication.
Thank you.
Because I'm very bad, you know.
I have very wicked ideas.
As you're sitting at your desk you have strange things running through your mind.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
Nothing is wrong.
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?
I like to sort of walk around here with no clothes on.
I think people wear clothes much too often, don't you?
I think in the confines of one's house, one should be free of clothing and inhibitions.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
I was trying to get away from a world that I had known, because I don't think it was very good for me, and I found myself looking up its ass...
...and seeing people that I used to know and that I liked a lot that were my friends.
Sort of.
Girls and that could have been me.
I mean, I know I'm not stupid.
I guess I just realized that I don't really give a damn.
What I would really like to do is be faceless and bodiless and be left alone.
You're lucky they're still here.
We don't keep unclaimed possessions in suicide cases more than a year.
Number 497.
Jane McKenna.
I thought there would be more.
Well, there's this man, this detective and I don't know exactly what is happening or what he wants out of me, or anything like that.
But he took care of me.
Did you feel threatened by it?
I don't know.
When you're used to being lonely and somebody comes in and moves that around, it's sort of scary I guess.
How do you feel when you feel scared?
- Angry.
- At whom?
- Whoever is making me feel that way.
- Do you feel angry at him?
Half of the time, yes.
How do you feel angry?
What do you want to do?
I want to manipulate him.
How?
In all the ways that I can manipulate people.
I mean, it's easy to manipulate men.
Right?
They were bringing a freighter down through Kill Van Kull.
Propellers washed it up on top.
Arlyn Page was probably an alias.
- Sorry.
- Man, can you help me out?
Yes.
What?
I mean, can you help me out?
I mean that's my baby, dead.
I have to get up.
- You know what it means, my baby dead.
- Got to get up.
Okay?
Lt. Trask, please.
John Klute.
I think we should run down and check on everybody who knew Tom Grunemann.
I don't think the man who wrote the letters was Tom.
Just run down and check on everything.
Talk to you.
You're up, are you?
How are you?
Trask wants you to call him.
He told me about Arlyn.
It probably doesn't have anything to do with anything but just as a precaution when you go out, if you tell me where you're going to go a phone number where I can find you.
Just so I can always keep in touch with you.
Okay?
Sure.
I'm all right.
I know.
I feel physically, that's what's different.
I mean, I feel.
My body feels.
I enjoy making love with him.
Which is a very baffling and bewildering thing, because I've never felt that before.
I wish that I could let things happen and enjoy it, you know for what it is and while it lasts and relax about it.
But all the time, I keep feeling the need to destroy it.
To break it off.
To go back to the comfort of being numb again.
I keep hoping, in a way, that it's going to end.
Because I had more control before, when I was with tricks.
I knew what I was doing and I was setting everything up.
And that's what's so strange:
It's that I'm not setting anything up.
That something is...
You know what this is like, but I've never felt it before.
It's a new thing and it's so strange.
The sensation that something that is flowing from me naturally to somebody else without it's being prettied up or...
I mean, he's seen me horrible!
He's seen me ugly!
He's seen me mean.
He's seen me whorey and it doesn't seem to matter.
He seems to accept me.
I guess having sex with somebody and feeling those sort of feelings towards them is very new to me.
I wish that I didn't keep wanting to destroy it.
You know, I'm trying to stay out of it.
Yes.
I'd love to party with you, but I...
Yes.
Marta, try to get somebody else and if I change my mind I'll call you, okay?
You're not going to get hung up on me, are you?
- Yes, sir, can I help you?
- Yes, can I have a bag please?
- Yes.
- A couple of bags please.
Well, let me see how much those weigh.
- A pound and a quarter.
- I'll have some of those small tomatoes.
- No mushy ones.
- Okay, thanks.
- What do you have in your bag?
- What?
What have you got in your bag?
Can I have a cantaloupe, please?
Wait.
He cut up my clothes...
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Hello?
I can be a very bad girl, you know.
I sometimes need a spanking.
I have very wicked ideas.
I will do anything you ask.
You should never be ashamed of things like that.
You mustn't be.
You know, there's nothing wrong.
I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
She can't remember.
Well, it could have been it could have been hidden in his pocket, I've seen one of those.
All right.
I'll wait for you here.
Bree?
Trask and some officers are coming to examine your apartment.
I want you to stay here today and tomorrow.
You'll be safe here.
I'll only be gone for a few minutes tomorrow.
Bree?
Bree?
Well, you look like you've been with many women, but I didn't know if you'd ever paid for a woman before.
I mean, you wouldn't need to.
So if you do, it's obviously because it excites you.
Because you're not a man that would have to pay for a woman.
You could have any woman you wanted.
The only responsibility you have to me is to enjoy yourself.
I will do anything you ask or want.
Since you know that there are no limits to my imagination.
I place no moral judgments on anything.
We checked out 42 letters of Tom Grunemann's friends.
And we only came up with one with any similarity to the obscene letter.
All right, there's Tom Grunemann.
Different margins, different spacings.
That's mine.
You said to check out everybody.
Same margins, top and sides.
He does best with his middle fingers.
We get fainter registrations on outside keys.
Notice how he invariably does that with the "T" and the "H."
Who is it?
Peter Cable.
But you have no case.
There's not even a body.
I'm sorry we have to meet here, but I'm pretty rushed for time.
I have a business meeting tonight in Chicago.
Any developments?
I think I can close the case. ...if I can have $500 to purchase Jane McKenna's address book.
I don't understand what you mean.
Well, I've found a contact who will sell me the book.
A little black book containing the name of the client that beat up Bree Daniel.
He is also the man who came into Bree Daniel's apartment yesterday and wrecked it.
We know that now because of the semen that he left in her underwear.
The blood type is AB, and Tom's was type A. It wasn't Tom.
I think this man killed Jane McKenna and Arlyn Page.
I think he drowned them.
I you should prepare yourself for the fact that Tom is possibly dead.
The only way I'll find out is to find him.
I need the money before tomorrow night.
- You're meeting him tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- He's bringing the book to my apartment.
- At what time?
8:30.
I'll notify the board as soon as I get to Chicago and have them wire you the money immediately.
Thank you, John.
I certainly hope you're wrong about Tom.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.
I don't want you to do this.
Bree.
I'm just going to a girlfriend's apartment.
I can't stay here, obviously.
Please.
Not with him.
This other girl has a very big apartment, lots of room.
But it's not necessarily how it looks.
Look we all respect each other, right?
I respect you.
Bree respects you.
But you have to respect her, too.
Her best interests.
Mrs. Daniel, I have to close up now.
Leave your name and number with the service and she'll get back to you.
I can't.
Well, I have to close up now.
I almost killed somebody.
Well, I'm certain the doctor would like to speak with you about it.
As a matter of fact, I'll have her call you as soon as she gets home.
I promise.
- Can I use your phone?
- Sure.
Is Mr. Goldfarb there?
Mr. Goldfarb Sr.
I have to talk to somebody.
I'm just a little way across town.
Can I come over?
About half an hour?
Detective Trask, please.
Hi, John Klute.
He didn't take the plane, he cancelled out.
I'm at home in my apartment.
I don't know where she is.
I'll find her.
Okay.
I'll leave word if I go out.
Okay.
I have an appointment with Mr. Goldfarb.
Mr. Goldfarb!
Mr. Goldfarb!
Hello.
What can I do for you?
I'm sorry.
I mean Mr. Goldfarb Sr.
My father left about 15 minutes ago.
He didn't feel so good.
- Can I help you?
- He's working himself to death, poor man.
- You sure I can't help you?
- It's not important.
No, really.
I don't mind.
You're going to miss your train, Mr. Goldfarb.
Excuse me.
Did he leave a message for me?
Bree Daniel.
I thought that was for tomorrow!
Mr. Goldfarb's wire.
Yes, Mama, I'm coming right now.
I know you don't like to get in in the middle of the picture!
Yes, right away.
Bye-bye.
We're closing now, Miss.
May I leave Mr. Goldfarb a message?
Poor man, everybody's friend.
Hello?
Hello?
This is Bree Daniel.
Has the doctor checked in yet?
When she does, tell her I'm at 246-1383.
I'll wait five minutes.
How I can reach the doctor?
The doctor hasn't checked in yet.
I'm trying to locate a Miss Bree Daniel.
I'm sorry sir, but we only take messages for the doctor.
Has she called in or anything?
Has she called the doctor at all today?
- She left a forwarding number.
- Can I have that number, please?
I'm not allowed to give that out.
I'm a police officer.
Please don't make me prove this.
You must understand my position.
I must comply with the rules.
I understand all that.
Will you just give me the number, please?
Can we talk about this reasonably?
I know you're expecting some kind of extravagant behavior but do you believe me?
Yes.
We can talk?
Well, it's just an ordinary matter.
I'm a very well-off man.
I have a position to respect I would feel personally, very uncomfortable to be connected with a certain kind of woman.
I'm sure you understand what I mean.
Look, John Klute works for me.
I know you're his contact.
I know he's trying to acquire Jane McKenna's book.
I'm in a position to offer more for it than he can.
You don't understand what I'm talking about, do you?
Yes.
Jane McKenna's book.
- And I'll try to get it for you.
- No.
Obviously you're frightened and you're lying.
No, I'm not.
I will, I'll try to get it for you.
Is this something Klute's invented.
Is this a trap for me?
- Klute knows about me, doesn't he?
- Knows what about you?
Then everybody knows about me.
So, it doesn't make any difference what I do anymore, does it?
I've no idea what I'm going to do and I'm so deeply puzzled.
I've done terrible things.
I've killed three people.
And yet, I don't consider myself a terrible man.
No more than others.
See, Tom Grunemann discovered me.
We were here on business together and he found me and Jane McKenna in my hotel room.
She had become hysterical and she started screaming and I guess I hit her.
I don't actually recall how it all happened so quickly.
Anyway, she fell and hit her head, and that's when Tom came in the room.
I guess he must've heard her screaming.
But I never understood why she did that.
She had never screamed before.
It was the revulsion and the contempt that I saw on his face and the certainty that sooner or later he would use it against me within the company.
I tried to endure that as long as I possibly could.
You just want me to keep on talking, don't you?
No, I don't.
I do understand.
I really do.
Well, that's what you all do.
You make a man think that he's accepted.
It's all just a great big game to you.
You're all obviously too lazy and too warped to do anything meaningful with your life, so you prey upon the sexual fantasies of others.
I'm sure it comes as no great surprise to you when I say that there are little corners in everyone which were better off left alone.
Little sicknesses, weaknesses, which should never be exposed.
That's your stock in trade, isn't it, a man's weakness?
I was never really fully aware of mine until you brought them out.
How far out of town are we?
- Five miles outside of New York.
- Do you mind if I turn the lights down?
No, it's up to you.
Turn the light out if you'd like.
My name is Peter Cable.
I work for the Tole American Corporation which is situated in Pennsylvania and in New York.
I would not be telling you these things if my intentions weren't honorable.
- You look familiar to me.
- In what way?
I don't know.
Your face looks familiar to me.
I guess I have a confession to make.
We did meet before.
About two years ago.
I often wondered whatever happened to Arlyn Page and here you are.
Yeah, I remember.
Listen I've got get out of here.
I mean I can't...
I remember you.
- Well, what do you remember?
- You beat me up, that's what you did!
It's okay.
Just freaked me out for a minute, that's all.
I promise to drive you back afterwards.
Okay.
Why don't you just tell me what you'd like, and then...
- ... after you tell me what you'd like...
- I'd like to spend some time with you.
- I have been looking for you for two years.
- Why?
That's my business.
I will say that you gave me a great deal of pleasure.
I saw in you things that I had not seen in other women of your profession.
I will not harm you at all physically.
It's all right.
No, it's not all right, and you know it's not all right.
No, it is all right.
If that's what you...
But, you have to tell me first.
If that's what you want...
- ... that's fine.
- Arlyn why don't you lie down on the bed and make yourself comfortable.
I'll not strap you in, I'll not tie you down.
Just lie down on the bed, please.
Be comfortable.
Nothing's going to happen.
Nothing's going to happen.
Okay.
- Why don't you make yourself comfortable?
- I am perfectly comfortable.
Just put your head down.
You have such lovely long blonde hair.
Turn your head.
Like that.
Don't!
I've explained to him what I have to do and I think he understands.
What could ever happen for us?
I mean, we're so different.
I know enough about myself to know that whatever lies in store for me it's not going to be setting up housekeeping with somebody in Tuscarora and darning socks and doing all that.
I'd go out of my mind.
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I don't know how I feel about him.
It's so hard for me to say it!
God!
- To say what?
- I'm going to miss him.
Bree Daniel.
How is Roy?
Well, I'm leaving town right now and I don't expect to be back.
You're very nice.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
I have no idea what's going to happen.
I just can't stay in the city, you know?
Maybe I'll come back.
You'll probably see me next week.
Hot, right?
When the bridge is here, things will be a lot easier.
Bridge?
What bridge?
They're planning a bridge across the Scheldt.
A lot of water will flow past this spot before that's a fact.
But it's what I heard.
And if it's true, I'll chuck you right into the river.
Your bridge builders will have to deal with me first.
With the deacon of Waterhoek.
With deacon Broeke.
There they are.
I can see them.
Really?
- Here already?
Yes, I can see them.
Come and see.
They're early this year.
Come, mother.
Father has arrived.
They're here.
Give it to me.
That's father's.
Mother, mother.
Sieper is back.
They're here.
I can see them all.
Sieper is right in front.
Good Lord, it's true.
They're really here.
Is our Jules with them?
Of course he is.
Pissed, too.
- There'll be hell to pay.
Jenny, hurry.
Are you all right?
So there you are.
- Yes, father.
Welcome home.
- Thank God we've arrived.
It took us nine hours.
The train stopped in Lille, too.
You must be hungry.
- Sieper, hello.
I bet he's more thirsty.
- You can say that again.
The first round is on me.
Do you hear?
It's on me, Spikkerelle.
How can you afford that?
- He must have emptied the offertory.
Don't give him any ideas.
- I wouldn't put it past him.
Right you are.
There is Spikkerelle.
- I'll have one, too.
Hey kid, hurry up.
- Cheers.
Make it a double for me.
Can we settle up?
- Of course.
You wouldn't cheat, would you?
Bloody hell, that's mine.
I've been working my guts out and they're spending it all.
As if we're not working!
Jefke, you've grown a lot.
Can you read yet?
Sister stands at the school gates.
The meadows are green.
- Well done.
You'll be boss one day.
Where will you pay my brother?
- At our place.
What was it like?
- Same as ever.
Slaving away, being pushed about.
But we got the job done.
Glad to be home?
- You bet.
No trouble at all?
No.
Only with Franske.
He was a lazy bugger at first.
But I got him into shape soon.
Sieper, did you hear about the bridge?
Are they still on about it?
- They've only just started.
Let them fuss what they like.
It's just a lot of hot air.
But it's come up in the Council.
- They're trying to make a packet... at the cost of Waterhoek.
But they'll have to think twice.
But Sieper, the surveyors have been around.
Where?
- On the Scheldt.
Did they do their measuring?
- Not for long.
We chased them.
I threw stones and lumps of peat until they cleared off.
It's true.
Snoek got rid of them all.
And we stood around and watched.
Good old Snoek.
You can get into trouble.
- We've got our rights.
They've come here to make trouble.
We've always done without a bridge.
They should leave us alone.
Well spoken.
They want to drive us off our land, the bastards.
Waterhoek is ours.
If the lords in Brussels or at the local Council think... they can ruin Waterhoek with a bridge, they've got it wrong.
They've already figured out the costs.
- And do we get to see any money?
Nothing.
- Not a single franc.
There's not going to be a bridge as long as I live.
We'll show them who Waterhoek belongs to.
Pour the constable another one.
And me too.
Another one for everybody.
- We'll drown them all.
It's all bullshit and politics.
But we'll show them.
Come in now.
Goodbye.
Bye, then.
- Quiet, you'll wake up the kids.
Oh well, oh well.
Hello, Treute, my boy.
How are you?
Leave him be.
Coffee?
Yes, OK then.
That's good.
Yes, we got a rotten deal.
You've got no idea.
The French were above doing the dirty jobs.
They left them for us.
For the Flemish.
And if you didn't like it, you could go home.
But what can you do?
What can you do about it?
Grin and bear it.
Forget it.
You're home now.
Well, well, well.
Look who's here.
Hello, uncle.
And don't I get a kiss?
Yes, uncle.
So you're back again.
Don't hide.
Let's look at you.
Don't be shy with your uncle.
Stop it, Sieper.
That's enough.
- And you, slut, to bed.
How long were you away?
- A year and two months.
And all that time in Paris.
Paris, toujours I'amour.
But uncle...
Didn't you hear me?
To bed.
- Do I have to chase you?
She takes after her mother more now.
- Not a word about her mother.
She's gone and she'll stay gone.
We look after what she left behind.
And that's the end of it.
- Don't get worked up.
Worked up?
About that no-good?
She brings shame on our house.
Staying out all night, with her men-friends.
What are we going to do about it?
What can we do about it?
It's nature's course, so that's it.
Why did she come back?
She didn't bring the same surprise her mother brought us?
She knows the tricks to stay out of that trouble.
God knows what she learnt there in France.
Pour me another one.
- No.
It's much too late.
We're off to bed.
- Yes, that's best.
What now?
- I haven't eaten.
I'm hungry.
If you're angry with me, why do you hit him?
Nuisance, aren't they?
Charlatans.
Come and say hello.
Don't you want to measure on this side?
The cops are shitting themselves with fear.
Straighter.
1.43.
We'll give your ears a good measure.
- Come over here if you dare.
If they don't stop, I'll shoot.
- Take it easy, Arthur.
I'd like to put them in their place.
Hey, Cies.
If you don't calm your pals down, there'll be trouble.
Hey, Cies, calm us down.
- You're asking for it.
I mean it, you know.
Maybe you won't like to hear this... but I think that a bridge here wouldn't be such a bad idea.
How do you mean?
I can see that you're against it, but look at it from two sides.
There are no two sides to it.
They're not only going to build a bridge, but also a brick road.
Our houses will be pulled down and a lot of strangers will take over.
Is that what you want?
So?
What's the other side to this business?
Tell me, Sieper.
What is it?
That we'll get work right here on the doorstep.
We won't have to go to France to work ourselves to death over there.
Work on the bridge?
- You can't mean it.
Well, think about it.
Why think about it?
Can't you see for yourself?
Look, the police have come to invade Waterhoek.
They've got their guns out.
And you want to think about it?
We're no match for them.
There is big money on their side.
They say the word, and their word is law.
Has it ever been different?
- Listen to that.
Hiding behind your woman's skirts?
- If we don't do it, strangers will.
Fine folk like them will come here with their city manners.
As long as I'm deacon nobody will touch the river.
The first man to help build the bridge I'll bash his head in.
Hello men, how are things in Waterhoek?
Broeke, Mr Notary is asking how things are.
Bad, Mr Notary.
As you know very well.
You mean the bridge?
That will get straightened out.
You're always so contrary.
You should take it easy.
Well, goodbye men.
You can't say we didn't warn you.
- Broeke, don't be silly.
Hey, uncle Lander.
Mother, uncle Lander is here.
Hello, Lander.
Hello, Manse.
- Hello, brother.
Lord, you've grown thin.
Don't they feed you in the army?
Yes, but the drills wear the fat off your bones.
I'm glad you're home again.
- So am I, father.
Did you hear about the bridge?
- Let him settle down first, father.
You'll never believe it.
- Let him eat.
Don't mention Sieper.
Sieper?
What about him?
- The things he's up to...
He has the gall to say in public that the bridge would be good for us.
Did he say that?
- Yes.
He's a fool, your Sieper.
How...
Is she back?
She?
Yes, like an ill weed.
- Mira, uncle Lander is here.
Uncle Lander.
Look, it's Mira.
Nobody told me.
Or wrote to me.
And now you see.
Twice, French style.
Lander, I have something to discuss.
- In a minute, father.
And you, tend to the sheep.
- In a minute, grandfather.
And don't giggle like that.
This isn't Paris.
Why are you so hard on her?
She has the devil under her skin.
Three suitors in under two months.
How she got to be so hot-blooded...
- From you.
I'm off to play cards.
- Don't be late.
How long to go?
- A little while, not long.
Come with me.
Well, tell me all.
You tell me.
- Me?
I've got nothing to tell.
What did you have to do in the army?
Keep the gun clean.
And drills in the sand and in the mud.
And in the evening?
To a café.
With a bit of luck.
You've grown beautiful.
Last time I saw you, you were a girl.
Thin as a rake.
But even then I thought...
What did you think?
She's going to be beautiful.
- And what else?
That something might happen, when I got back from the army.
You must have broken lots of hearts out there.
Me?
I can see it in your eyes.
- What about you?
What about me?
What were you up to in France?
- I'd rather not talk about it.
You are right.
I won't be a minute.
Wait here.
Isn't it a beauty?
It won't live long.
Why not?
- It's a ram, isn't it?
And yes, they're the first to go.
I'm going to eat you up.
Keep at it, Lander.
Swim, go on swim.
There's only one Lander.
And that's you.
And there's only you.
Have you no shame, you two?
Where everybody can see you.
What's the matter?
Slut.
With your own uncle, you wretched thing.
Just because your kissing days are over?
You shameless lot, get out.
If we can't do it here, we'll go somewhere else.
As long as it's not under my roof.
This is going to be the brick road.
Six metres wide.
Raise it with five metres of sand for the base.
Up to there is enough.
He's making a fool of us.
- He doesn't even see us.
Hey, fancy-pants.
Bed-wetters.
- Wankers.
Ratface.
- Idiots.
That'll teach you.
Stop it.
We've only come to do your job.
Or do we have to bring in the cops?
- Yes, bring in the cops.
Are you looking for trouble?
- Men, it's enough for today.
I've built six bridges, but I've given plenty more men a black eye.
Boaster.
We've got the law on our side.
Just remember you can't fight the law.
Come on, let's go.
Men.
- Hurry up.
I would have given that gentleman a good working over.
You'd rather give Mira a working over.
- Can't blame him.
Look at them.
City slickers.
What do you have, Mr Maurice?
A gin?
Why not.
Hello, gentlemen.
- Bring us a drink.
Two gins for the gentlemen.
The gentlemen aren't from these parts?
- No.
Are you here for the bridge?
- Yes.
You too, sir?
- Yes, I'm the engineer.
Well, well.
The big wheel himself?
And who are you?
- Me?
I am Lander.
My father is Broeke, deacon of Waterhoek.
And what's your name, Mr Engineer?
Maurice Rondeau.
Aren't you going to buy us a drink, Mr Maurice?
Yes, because it's your first day in our café.
Yes, of course, why not?
A round for everybody from Mr Maurice.
Well then, cheers.
There you are.
Not what you're used to perhaps?
- It's home-brew.
It burns your soul.
Here, you pay.
Goodbye, everybody.
Wait, Mr Maurice.
I'll come with you.
- No, I'm all right.
He's more your type, isn't he?
- He looked very serious.
A serious, smoked herring.
- Why are you so rough on strangers?
You're roughing us up by arriving.
- Listen...
That bridge is for your own good.
The whole area will be modernized.
Get out of here.
- If that's what you want.
Mr Maurice, you're drenched.
You'll catch a cold.
Go sit by the fire, quickly.
Good evening.
Will you join us for a game of cards?
- No, thanks.
Damn.
- What's the matter?
Wait.
- Quiet.
What's up?
Do you want to go back home?
No.
- Keep quiet then.
There they are.
- We can stop searching.
You're up early.
- So are you.
Hey, big shot.
What's the matter, man?
- I say good morning, sir.
And good morning to you.
Bastards.
What do you want?
Get off our boat.
- Come here.
Bastards.
- We'll teach you a lesson, big shot.
Here.
Bastard.
Come here.
Tette, where are you?
Tette...
Quiet.
We'll have to find them first.
I kicked him in the guts.
He must have drowned.
The fat one, too.
He sank like a brick.
Come, Lander.
It's over.
Let's go.
- No, we have to be sure.
Can't see a thing in this fog, damn it all.
Can you see anything?
- No.
Tette.
Do you see them?
No, nothing here.
Cloet, listen.
No, here it is.
Do you hear anything?
There he is, the bastard.
Tette, we've got one of them.
No.
No, don't.
Don't do it, please.
I didn't do anything to you!
And now?
Now what?
- Now the other one.
What else?
Over here.
Come.
I can hear something.
Now it's gone.
You out fishing for eel?
- What about it?
What are you doing?
I wanted to get to the other side.
Won't see much of the sun today.
- No.
Well, there you are.
Don't I have to pay?
When will you come back?
- Don't know yet.
Perhaps tomorrow.
They can't do anything to me anyway.
You could stay here, too.
- No.
It's safer to stay away for a while.
You never know.
Come and see, the police are coming.
Has something happened?
- Everybody out of the house.
Outside, you.
Outside.
Where is your son Lander?
- He didn't do anything.
Lander isn't around.
- Where is he?
That's your problem.
- Find out for yourself.
What do you come into our houses for?
And why?
You know very well.
- I don't know a thing.
Mama, he's hitting me.
- Leave these people alone.
If you want Lander, you'll have to cordon off the forest.
Or look in France.
- Quiet, all of you.
Listen:
I'm listening but I don't hear nothing.
Listen to the Magistrate.
- What can he have to say?
The first one to open his trap will be coming with us.
My son is not a killer.
- Aha, you are the mother.
Your bloody son tried to kill me.
Take it easy, sir.
- You cow, you.
What have you got to say?
- Nothing.
Leave that woman alone.
I am the deacon of Waterhoek.
Address yourself to me.
Shut up, or we'll shut you up.
I'd like to see that.
Why don't you try?
The other one's gone as well.
Hip hip, hurray.
Damn it all, this has gone far enough.
People of Waterhoek... you are going to respect the court here in Belgium, is that clear?
So I'm asking you:
Where are they?
You, red one, when did you last see those murderers?
I don't know any murderers.
- Right, whatever you want.
But can't you see that we're dealing with a beastly case of double murder?
And that it's our duty...
- So do your duty and find them.
What was that?
Did you say something, shorty?
- Wasn't I speaking clearly enough?
You are well enough paid for the job.
Well, earn your wages and get going.
Just come with us, shorty.
This is Waterhoek, you know.
- Shall we give him one on the chin?
That depends on the Magistrate.
People, you heard it.
We'll make you respect the law.
Waterhoek people are not above the law.
We're going to settle this business.
Understand?
You stay here.
Vandale and Cosijns...
Cosijns, you stay over there.
Muilier and Sassens post at the inn.
Cyriel, is that you?
Cyriel?
I thought it had to be Cyriel.
How are things?
It's Wednesday today.
- No, Cyriel.
Tuesday.
Haven't you got any food on you?
- No, it's Lent.
You haven't said your prayers.
- No.
Start on it then.
What prayer?
- A Hail Mary.
That's better.
Do you want my gun?
No.
But thanks for the offer.
Did you see the others?
- Yes, Tette.
At the crossing.
He was sitting under an oak.
I could have caught him like a rabbit.
The cops must be thinking we've gone to France.
You did a bad thing, Lander.
- I know.
I've been stupid.
But it taught them a lesson, those fancy men.
That vermin.
They come here, messing us about...
There they are.
- Run for it.
That way.
Thanks, Cyriel.
Thanks a lot.
- I do it for Mira.
Anyone been here?
- Have you seen Lander Broeke?
We'll take a look inside anyway.
- No one's coming in.
Looking for a fight, Cyriel?
- If I have to.
That means you're up to something.
- It's Wednesday today.
Cyriel, got a glass of beer for me?
- Sure, come in.
Look, there he goes.
Have you gone crazy?
We'll be back for you, Cyriel.
Damn.
What do you take us for?
We'll teach you, you murderer.
He's had enough.
Come on, tie him up.
Look, his eyes are bleeding.
You've got something to account for.
Ah, you've got him.
He gave us a hard time, the bastard.
They beat him up badly, the pigs.
Give me a drink, too.
Go to hell.
Look.
His sweetheart is here, too.
Come a bit closer, girl.
You won't be seeing him again soon.
It will be some time.
- I think so, too.
Better give him a kiss fast.
I've had it, Mira.
Let's put him in the lock-up here, just for one night.
One pint, no foam.
Are you all here?
- Looks like it, Mr Notary.
Bon.
We'll start straight away, because time is money.
The land on both sides of the new road will be divided into building plots.
They are going to be State property.
What does that mean?
Your property will be appraised and you'll be paid what it's worth.
For your old hovel, you'll get a new house worth three times as much.
What if they value at 3 times less?
- What about the work I've put into it?
You've got common sense.
I'll explain.
- Please.
But we'll be kicked off our land.
Everybody in Waterhoek will profit from the changes.
You're chopping up the village.
Look here.
You can read a map, I hope?
This is the Scheldt.
With the bridge.
This is the land I was talking about.
And all them strangers coming in?
- Who is going to profit in the end?
What nonsense.
Jules, give us all a pint or a glass.
If you want to do business and sell up... before it's compulsory, and those in honest business... trying to sell or buy, know where to find me.
Cheers.
I'm leaving the drawings here so you can circulate them.
It's an honest proposition, clear and simple for everybody.
Can we sleep on it for one night?
- Of course.
Sleep?
This is what I'll do with the plans of those suckers.
That was an official document.
And now you can't even use it to wipe your arse with.
I'm helping you to live like rich folk and not in poverty.
Who's living in poverty here?
- All of you.
And you're going to make us rich?
- No, but better off.
It'll make you better off for a start.
- Listen to me.
Well, what's next?
If we have to force this upon you, it'll cost you a pretty penny.
And you're going to make us pay.
- You'll live like people, not like...
Like what, Mr Notary?
Like pigs.
- That's what I wanted to hear.
We'll treat you like pigs.
Come on and grab him.
Go on.
We'll make a man out of him.
Pants off.
Murderers.
What's happening?
- Get him.
I'll give you fifty franc for my trousers.
Hey, come here.
Pigs, that's what you are.
And don't come back.
Or we'll chuck you in the Scheldt.
Let me see.
What an ugly thing.
If it flies into your hair you go crazy.
Feet like mice.
- Let's go and show it.
Grandfather.
We've got a bat.
For the cow barn.
It's still alive.
Get me three hobnails, silly.
Is it going to bring us luck?
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.
Now lightning will never strike us?
- No.
Max.
Go take a look, Max.
Over by the willow tree.
Hey, you there.
What are you doing here?
Taking a walk.
Call your dog back.
Down, Max.
Come here.
He'll go for your throat if I tell him to.
So you weren't looking for Mira?
- Who?
That slut's child called Mira.
She's not in.
She's never in.
Father, come and eat.
- Yes, I'm coming.
Don't let me see you here again.
Don't chase Mira in my own house.
Got that?
Like all the others.
Out so late, Mr Engineer?
- Yes, I was just passing.
Just?
- Yes, just.
My girlfriend is asking you in for a drink.
No, I don't have time.
- That's a pity.
She said maybe you came here looking for me.
Me?
Of course not.
- I didn't think so.
I bet you only go to a café if it's raining.
Yes, that's right.
- Well, goodbye then.
Goodbye, Miss.
Don't you know my name?
Yes:
Mira.
Yes, Mira.
Short for Mirabelle.
Salut.
give it a bang and hit it again give it a bang and hit it again
Sieper keeps them at it.
The miserable dog.
Who would have thought so?
The whole bunch of them, cowards.
What do you want?
They earn well.
They're happy.
Some of them even talk of saving.
- Saving?
What for?
Don't they have somewhere to live?
Food, clothes and booze?
Are they going to imitate those city slickers?
Bragging about who's got the most?
What do you want?
That's progress.
To think that I took that louse called Sieper into my family.
Manse said she went to see Lander, and he cried like a child.
Don't meddle with our family.
What else can we talk about?
The nice weather?
Look at the water level in the river.
Another couple of days of rain and they can forget the pile-driving.
They should stop anyway.
Why?
Help, the dam has burst.
Help.
The dike is gone.
Help, hurry.
Here, on this side.
Help.
I expected it.
The water was so high.
- Look, a man's body.
Did he fall?
What happened?
Too late.
It's beyond repair.
All our work has been for nothing.
They're going to say it's my fault.
- He's still alive.
Who is it?
Do you know him?
- He's from Waterhoek.
Did he do it on purpose?
You have to be possessed by the Devil to do a thing like that.
Those people from Waterhoek, they're all the same.
He's still breathing.
- Yes, he's going to be OK.
He looks a real gentleman.
Can you manage on your own?
Good luck, then.
I should kick you to death, you dirty bastard.
Scum like you should be torn to pieces.
Here's your father.
That's the end of it... for the rest of the winter, I think.
No thanks, Marie.
You prefer beer or gin, I expect?
- No, Mama.
Drink your tea while it's warm.
It'll make you sleep well.
Why do you keep looking at me?
- Aren't I allowed?
You're so nervous.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Tell me.
- It's nothing.
Is it a woman?
A girl?
Of course not.
Why not?
You've become a man, out there with the peasants.
Goodnight, Mama.
And now...
He'll peck your nose.
Slut.
- Yes, grandfather.
Slut, bring me some soup.
- Yes, grandfather.
You're sweating again.
Don't you have to go to your lovers?
It's late.
They must be at the door.
I don't have a lover.
- That's something new.
I have you.
Slut...
- You always say the same thing.
I wouldn't mind a stroll with her.
- Coming our way?
You don't have to ask her twice for it.
We put the beam on this side.
Look Treute, the men in charge of the bridge.
Say hello to them.
Hello, young man.
Say hello to him, too.
That's Mr Maurice.
Hello, Treute.
I knew you would come.
- Tonight?
Tonight.
Don't be afraid.
I didn't bring the dog.
It's swarming with mosquitoes here.
They're always after me.
That's because I've got sweet blood.
What about you?
You've got to undress me.
Isn't it better like this?
I've got to go.
Where?
- To the bridge.
So soon?
- Yes.
They'll see me.
The workmen will see us together.
So what?
Hello, Mr Maurice.
You're up early, if I may say so.
You may say so.
Treute, my boy, she's got him on the hook.
The big boss himself.
Yes, our Mira.
Come along.
Good evening, Mr Maurice, Miss...
can I help you?
We're going to my room, Mrs Maes.
- I don't know the lady.
Are you being suspicious?
- Of course not.
The lady is my fiancée.
- Oh, that's different.
I didn't know.
It's all right, madam.
Aren't you hungry, Mr Maurice?
- I'll eat later, in the hotel.
But you must keep in shape.
A young fellow like you should eat two whisked eggs every morning.
Look at the old guy over there.
Never budges.
Like a stork.
Mind your words.
Isn't that right, Mr Maurice?
In a way that old guy is a relative of yours now.
You're a pretty smart lot.
I brought you something.
A little present.
Are you sad?
- No.
Go sit up straight.
Is it your mother's?
Did you nick it?
- No, I bought it in Ghent.
How much did you pay for it?
- Too much, probably.
How much?
- Three thousand franc.
That's too much.
Don't you like it?
What am I to do?
Whatever you like.
Do you know what's in that box?
Another present.
You have to guess.
Go ahead, guess.
A coat.
- Wrong.
I hardly dared go into the shop.
It was full of women.
But in the end I took the risk and went in.
How beautiful.
Put it on.
- Now?
Why not?
All right.
Turn around.
No, with your face to the door.
You looked, you cheat.
Close your eyes.
I'll teach you.
Here.
On your knees.
As a punishment, for looking.
Voila.
And now you must count to twenty-five.
If we moored the derrick over here, we'd have no trouble with the span.
Just a minute.
- Is that right?
In six weeks it'll be finished.
- High time, too, Mr Maurice.
What will you do then?
Go to Ypres, work on the new road.
That's not so far away.
And you, Mr Maurice?
Is it true you're off to the Congo in the autumn?
Autumn is a long way off.
All right then, salut.
By the way...
Have you seen Mira lately?
- Sometimes she comes home.
Who is she with now?
A guy from Roeselare, called Becu.
It's none of my business.
Salut.
What do you want me to say?
- The truth.
Is it true about you and that slut?
That you see her night and day... and that you're neglecting your work?
- No.
More tea, Professor?
- No, thank you.
So none of it is true?
You're lying, Maurice.
I can see it.
- She is not a slut.
I'm going to marry her.
- So she's got you that far.
You don't know what you're saying.
- A tramp, a foundling.
Calm down, Anna.
Look, it's just a whim.
That happens.
You don't know the ways of the world.
You are ruining your whole future.
And for whom?
For what?
We won't waste another word on it.
Go and do as you see fit.
Go dig your own grave.
You won't get a franc from me, not half a franc.
Don't get carried away.
- Should I be financing that whore?
That's not the point.
- That's what she's after.
What do you know about her?
- Enough.
She's not having your father's money.
- I have a right to my inheritance.
Not half a franc.
Go get yourself a lawyer and we'll see.
But I'll drag it out until you're old and grey.
Does Richard Becu live here?
- He went to the fair in Avelgem.
Can I pass on a message?
No, merci.
Which of you is Richard Becu?
- That's me.
Did you need me?
What for?
- Can't you think what for?
Just say it.
I wanted to say... you're to help cementing tomorrow.
- All right.
Was that all?
If there's anything else you wanted to se me about...
No, that was all.
Did you miss me?
Yes, terribly.
- Even after the way I treated you?
Yes, even then.
I'm ill with longing.
Stay where you are.
My poor fool.
My poor fool of a lover.
I can't help it.
May the bride have the honour?
- Of course.
Here you are.
Are you happy?
- And you?
I was first to ask.
If he doesn't treat you right, just call me.
Do you hear?
- Don't worry, Mrs Rondeau.
That's true.
I am Mrs Rondeau.
What's the matter?
Can't you keep up with it?
He won't be worth much on the wedding night.
None of your lip!
Come on, let's go.
You want a wedding night without teeth?
Take it easy.
What's happening?
Mrs Maes, we're home.
- You're a fine gentleman, Mr Maurice.
We'll have one last drink.
And then they'll be off to bed and we'll be off home.
Not on your life.
- Why not?
I don't mind you, but I don't want that type in here.
What type?
My friends?
- This is a respectable house, Mira.
You're to call me Mrs Rondeau now.
That's fine with me, but that lot is not coming in.
I understand.
We're not welcome here.
Who do you think you are?
Is it because we're from Waterhoek?
Mira, don't take it like that.
Go to hell with your pretty manners and your lousy hotel.
It's full of lice here anyway.
You'll be comfortable here.
It's my late father's bed.
Did he die in it?
- Yes.
He was the finest person I've ever known.
Isn't that right, Mira?
- Yes, he was, Zale.
Children, I'll leave you alone now.
Sleep well.
Or rather:
Don't sleep too much.
I had wanted to take you to Brussels for our wedding night.
Isn't this good enough for you?
Are you asleep?
- No.
Don't I get a kiss?
Yes.
- Stay where you are.
Treute, sitting nicely in the sun?
Will you be a good boy?
Where are you going?
- Away.
For good?
- Yes.
That's what married women do.
But you're worse...
- Worse than my mother.
I think so too.
Yes, Treute.
You're the only one I'll miss.
The only one?
You too, grandfather.
Mr Notary.
Can I come along?
Where do you want to go?
- To the station.
And from there?
- To Ghent.
I can take you to Ghent along the new brick road.
Have you been in an automobile before?
Aren't you afraid?
Me?

Thank you for your attention.

I can't see.
I'm blind.
Good morning, Mr. Phelps.
Undercover Agent Warren Hays, assigned to gather evidence against the underworld empire of John Lawton, was recently blinded in the line of duty.
Lawton's right-hand man, Carl Deetrich, and his chief business adviser, Henry Matula, are bitter rivals, each hoping to succeed Lawton.
Henry Matula is our man, infiltrated into the syndicate five years ago.
Now he is in danger of being uncovered.
Conventional law enforcement agencies are unable to protect him.
Your mission, Jim, should you decide to accept it, is to preserve Matula's cover and to see that he is moved up in the organisation.
This tape will self-destruct in five seconds.
Good luck, Jim.
Nurse.
I understand you're gonna take my place.
Yes, that's right.
I hope you bury them.
We're gonna try.
I'm afraid we'll have to drag your name through the gutter temporarily.
Dismissed from the agency, forfeiture of all pay, no pension, no disability.
A history of alcoholism and dereliction of duty, climaxed by drunkenness on the night of the fire.
I can stand it, for as long as it takes to do the job.
Thank you.
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you.
These lenses work like a two-way mirror.
One side is transparent.
The other side completely opaque.
Now, there will be considerable physical discomfort at first, but it should pass quickly.
How long will the operation take, doctor?
About an hour.
Now, once these appliances are in place, they can only be removed by a trained surgeon.
Now, you've got a whole new world to adjust to.
You'll be in orientation, mobility training for 16 hours a day.
Which will give Casey time to get things set up at the rooming house.
Yeah, and everything's set for you, Barney.
Matula's already told Lawton he's expecting you.
Isn't there a way of giving Jim some vision and still making him seem blind?
Can't take a chance, Casey.
A quick flash of light, a reflex reaction, we're dead.
That's right.
And there's only one way to do it.
Until I remove these appliances,
Mr. Phelps will be totally and completely blind.
Gentlemen, I'm sorry I'm late.
Sit down.
I'm disappointed in the Cordillera operation.
The board of directors voted against replacing the present executive officer with our candidate.
I don't understand the sudden opposition.
Well, maybe it's like you've been saying, Mr. Lawton, somebody gave them a special reason.
Somebody in our organisation.
Not necessarily.
The board of directors might have balked at replacing a man who's turned the company around from loss to profit.
Profit?
With two big chemical spills, a tanker fire and four other major plant accidents in the last six months?
- As I was saying--
- Henry.
Why was there a federal agent at Cordillera?
Well, why don't we ask him?
He's been fired for not getting to the plant in time.
I have reason to believe that someone has been talking.
Find him.
Gentlemen.
Why is it, Henry, every time I say black, you say white?
I say yes, you say no.
I say there's a stool pigeon, and you make a joke.
I'm starting to fill up with you.
Look out.
Watch where you're going, will you?
- I'm sorry.
- Watch it.
The bar's over there.
Pal, can I give you a hand here?
Hey, yes, thank you.
Thank you, buddy.
Hang on.
Let me get you set up to the bar.
- You're a buddy.
- There you go.
Well, a buddy needs a buddy.
Okay, there you go.
Thank you.
Can I buy you a drink?
Sure, why not?
May I help you, gentlemen?
Yes, I will have the same.
- How about you, sir?
- I will have the same as I had before.
And the same as the one before that.
Bourbon.
Make it a double, will you?
Double.
I always drink the same thing.
Bourbon and bourbon and more bourbon.
It lights up the inside.
That's $2, sir.
Hit me again.
Sure, all you can hold.
But would you mind taking care of the tab?
Oh, sure, yeah.
No sweat.
That's no sweat at all.
Yeah, sure, I...
I tell you, I'll write you a cheque.
But set them up for the bar, huh?
Sir, I'm very sorry, but that's against our policy.
- Why?
I got plenty of money.
- I'm sorry.
What, do you think I'm some kind of a deadbeat or something?
My name is Hays.
Bob Hays.
Fifteen years with the department--
Sir, would you please keep your voice down?
You don't know who you're talking to.
I was a federal cop.
Now, I say set them up.
Come on, old buddy.
Let's get you out of here.
Okay, here we go.
All right.
I'll tell you something, I'll never spend a lousy dime in this joint again.
That must be him.
Johnny, get a line on him.
Forget it.
Mr. Lawton, why fool with a cop?
Well, he might be of some help to us.
You do as I say.
Hey, watch it, will you?
I'm sorry.
Mr. Matula?
That's me.
Mr. Matula, I'm Steve Anderson.
It's from Tommy Landers in Detroit.
This is the guy I was telling you about.
When did you get into town?
I just came here from the airport.
Well, sit down.
Have a drink.
Thank you.
Meet Carl Deetrich.
- How are you?
- Hello.
Well, tell me, what are you good for, huh?
Brown is following you.
Look, Mr. Hays, I'm sorry, you know, but, I mean, you haven't paid your rent in two weeks.
Look, I'm good for it.
I'll give you a cheque in the morning, my dear.
A cheque?
Hey, the last one you gave me bounced right back at me.
Oh, look, I'll get the cash from somewhere.
Just give me a couple of days.
I'll borrow it.
Give me till Saturday, will you, Chris, please?
All right, till Saturday, huh?
- You're a very good lady.
- Yeah.
But remember, no room, no rent.
Sure, sure, sure.
Steve Anderson, Johnny Brown.
How are you?
He works for me now.
Hi.
What did you find out, Johnny?
Not much.
He lives around the corner.
- A little room house, 110 Main Street.
- Anything else?
He gave his landlady a bum cheque for the rent.
I overheard her chew him out.
I think we ought to look into this.
He's an ex-federal cop who's worked this area.
So what?
Well, he might know where the tip came from that night.
Well, you don't think he's gonna tell us?
You're both way ahead of yourselves.
Let's first find out what makes this blind man tick.
Yes?
You're the landlady?
Yes.
Well, the...
Well, the sign outside didn't give too many particulars about the room, but I think I'm gonna like it.
Look, it's $25 a week, in advance.
That's just what I want.
A nice room, congenial atmosphere.
Twenty.
And five.
Wait here, I'll get your receipt.
One dollar.
Hi.
Hi.
- Need some help?
- Yes, please.
- I have a problem.
- Haven't we all?
Well, it's a little rickety and it gives me vertigo.
Would you mind?
What's in it for me?
Don't you ever do anything just out of kindness?
Matter of fact, no.
See what I mean?
How do you like your room, Mr. Brown?
Mr. Brown?
- How do you like your room?
- Oh, yes.
Yes, it's just fine.
Just fine.
- Except for one small thing.
- What?
Do you know that the landlady, even after a week, still calls me Mr. Brown?
The name is Johnny.
We'll have to do something about that, huh?
- They're crawling all over me!
- Mr. Hays.
I can't stand them!
They're crawling.
- Mr. Hays.
- Chris.
- Is that you, Chris?
- Yes.
Help me, Chris.
Please help me.
They're crawling all over me.
Help me, Chris, please.
Help me.
Chris, help me.
Please, Chris.
DTs.
Chris, help me, please.
Oh, God.
You know, it was really kind of fun to watch.
Now, a blind man, right?
You gotta picture this.
A blind man with the DTs, right?
You know, I'll bet you that the only thing he can see at all are those things crawling all over him.
I like your sense of humour.
I hate paperwork.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
What do you want me to tell Lawton?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
But Hays is just what he wants.
He's a cop.
Ex, very ex.
A cop.
Mr. Deetrich's office.
- Hang on.
- Deetrich.
- Working late, Carl?
- Yeah.
Carl, what has Brown found out about Hays?
I don't know.
I haven't talked to him about it yet.
I see.
Look, I'm having lunch at Duke's tomorrow.
Why don't you and Brown join me?
- All right.
- Good.
See you then.
Matula.
Well, from what Johnny says, it's obvious that Hays can help us.
Well, maybe it's obvious to you, Matula.
But to me, it stinks.
He's a cop.
I have an idea for a little test for ex-officer Hays.
Look, I left my money at home.
Let me have a bottle and just put it on credit--
- Cash only.
- No, I'll be back with it this afternoon.
- You don't have to worry about it.
- No credit.
Cash only.
Tomorrow I'll bring you the money, I promise you.
Look, get out of here.
Cash, that's it.
Leave.
Why don't you watch where you're going?
Well, I had the green light.
You all right, Mr. Hays?
What happened?
Well, you walked against a red light and almost got hit by a cab.
- Who are you?
- I'm your neighbour, Johnny Brown.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hi, Johnny.
Come on, there's a bench over here.
We can sit down and you can catch your breath.
- Let me take your arm.
- Okay.
- That all right?
- Yeah.
Now, look out, we're coming to a kerb.
- Right there.
Yeah.
- Okay.
All right.
Now, the bench is about two steps.
Here, wait.
You got it?
- That better?
- Yeah.
Well, it's just one thing after another with you, isn't it?
What do you mean?
Well, our landlady told me all about you.
What was it, 15 years a cop?
Give them your eyes.
Then this.
What have they ever given you?
Nothing, right?
- Johnny.
- Yeah?
Lend me a buck, will you?
Just a little dollar.
I gotta have a drink.
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh, you're a good guy, Johnny.
- Here, got it?
- Thanks.
- I'll see you in a minute.
- Wait a second.
- Wait a second.
- What?
How would you like to make 500 of those?
- Five hundred?
- Five hundred dollars.
Five hundred?
For what?
For the name of the undercover man that took your place.
Jim, couldn't you just give him a phoney name?
If Lawton's testing me, he already knows who the agent is.
Can't we get the real name from headquarters?
No, Willy, because he also knows that information is confidential.
There's only one way that ex-officer Hays could get it.
That's by stealing it.
Without help?
- Yes.
- Lawton's got to have men on the inside.
He'd know if we tried to set this up.
I read it the same way, Willy.
Fortunately, I know the building well and I know the computer room.
But I'll need a timing on the rounds of the guards.
Once we have the agent's name, he'll have to be warned that he's been made.
Brown's coming.
Get rid of the extra cups.
It's open.
- Johnny?
- Yeah.
Did you make up your mind?
I need eyes.
I need your eyes.
All right.
You got them.
Good.
Have a drink on it.
Well, where is it?
Coffee, Johnny.
Coffee?
For 500 bucks, I'll even give up drinking.
Well, when do we do this?
Tomorrow night.
Here, little kitty.
There you are, boy.
Now which way do we go?
There's an elevator on the left.
Door next to it.
Get me there when it's clear.
Is that good?
Is that good?
Yeah.
Good boy.
Good boy, O.J.
Good.
Good boy.
Hold it.
Here.
Corner.
We're coming to a corner.
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
What time is it?
Eleven forty-five.
That gives us five minutes before the guard passes.
Where are the files?
No files anymore.
All computers.
- Desk?
- Yeah, right in front of you.
- Everything on?
- The whole room is on.
One-two-nine-CDR.
Right.
What are you waiting for?
This.
Read it.
"Region five, area 12.
Internal assignment 22."
Gloves.
Turn them off.
Look out.
I'll put it behind you.
Sit down.
- Region?
- Five.
Five.
- Area?
- Area 12.
Twelve.
Current internal assignment two-two.
Two-two.
Come on.
All right, let's go.
- What time is it?
- Eleven fifty-one.
We're a minute late.
You, stop or I'll shoot.
Here.
Go.
Come on.
- I can't see him.
What do you do?
- Go.
Stop.
Hold it right there!
Basement.
Hays.
Hays.
Come on, we gotta get out of here.
Hays!
Hays, snap out of it.
Snap out of it.
We gotta get out of here.
Come on, get up.
- Where is it?
- Over here, behind you.
Start climbing.
Come on.
All right, duck your head.
I'll open the window.
You did very well, Mr. Hays.
Five $100 bills.
Thanks.
You realise you've committed a felony.
I haven't forgotten the law, Mr. Lawton.
Good.
I believe I have an informer in my organisation.
You do.
- Who?
- That I don't know.
It means a lot of money to me.
I'm sure it does.
I'd like to help you.
Maybe you can.
Would you mind taking off your glasses, please?
What for?
Oh, call it a whim.
Perhaps I wanna give you a job.
Even a blind man can feel heat, Mr. Lawton.
- True.
- Are you through testing now?
I'm sorry.
Now I'd like you to meet some of my people.
Perhaps you could recognise a voice, a mannerism, a way of doing things.
If that doesn't work, well, you're a good cop, you could think of something.
- How much?
- Name your price.
Two-fifty a week.
Ten grand when I finger your boy.
Done.
Gentlemen.
I'd like you to meet Mr. Hays.
- Mr. Matula.
- Mr. Matula.
Glad to know you.
- Mr. Deetrich.
- Mr. Deetrich.
Something wrong, Mr. Deetrich?
Yeah, plenty.
What did you say?
Forget it.
- Mr. Saunders.
- Mr. Saunders.
Hi, Johnny.
- Well, hi.
- Would you care for a drink?
Well, it's that time of the evening.
Don't apologise for it.
- What would you like?
- Whatever's easy.
He's there.
Go.
Here's to you.
Who is it?
Hays.
I'll get rid of him.
Mr. Hays, I was just getting ready to go out.
Listen, I got the rent money for you.
I owe you two weeks and I wanna give you two weeks in advance.
That's a hundred, right?
- That's a hundred.
- Yeah.
Listen, I haven't had a drink in two days.
How about coming to dinner with me tonight?
Oh, gee, I'm sorry, but I can't.
Why, because I'm blind?
Are you such a bargain?
No, it's just that I told Mr. Brown that I'd go out with him.
Brown?
What do you want with him?
He's a cheap hood, Chris.
Says who?
Never mind.
Hey, where'd you get the bread?
A job.
Oh, doing what?
Call it a research project.
Well, how long is it gonna last?
Depends on me.
I got all the answers right now.
But I'm gonna stretch this thing out as long as I can.
Listen, are you sure you won't have dinner with me?
Well, maybe some other time, huh?
- Okay.
- Hey, and good luck with the job.
What's wrong?
- Yeah?
- Meet me.
Hays, wake up.
What?
Who is it?
It's me, Deetrich.
Deetrich?
Now, listen.
You're not gonna milk Lawton.
- Who's the fink?
- I don't know what you mean.
Johnny, let him feel it.
Now, who?
- You.
- Me?
Now, you know I'm clear.
- Do I?
- What do you mean?
Listen, Deetrich, I don't know any more than you do, but I gotta finger somebody for my ten grand.
I don't like getting pushed around in the night, so it might as well be you.
Why, you filthy, double-cro-- Johnny.
Now, come on, don't be a sap.
You'll only be fingering yourself for Lawton.
Talk to Lawton.
Explain it to him.
Yeah, that's right.
You talk to him.
Just remember I'm solid and he's gonna take a hard look at anybody that tries to dump me.
You had this wired from the beginning, didn't you?
That's right.
Right from the first minute your hood here approached me.
The beauty of it is it doesn't matter, because I can finger you or Matula or anybody and still collect my ten grand.
Unless of course you'd like to offer me 25 grand to keep my mouth shut.
He's too much.
That's right, Johnny.
Too much for you, blind or not.
Now, don't push me, blind man.
I got another proposition for you.
I'm listening.
I'll pay you 25 grand for fingering Matula.
Can you do it?
For 25 grand, sure, why not?
I need a little time.
I got no time.
I wanna get rid of him once and for all.
Where's Lawton now?
He's probably in his office.
He works half the night.
All right, call him.
Tell him we'll meet him there.
Forget that.
This is gonna be on my turf.
We'll get together at the warehouse.
I'll call Lawton and I'll send somebody to pick you up.
You get ready.
I don't trust him.
Neither do I.
That's why I set it up this way.
If anything goes wrong
you'll kill him.
Hello?
All right, Carl, I'll be right over.
He's on his way.
You know what to do.
I've gotta talk to you, Mr. Lawton.
I can't now.
I gotta see Carl.
I must insist, Mr. Lawton.
All right, make it snappy.
Deetrich?
This way, Hays.
- Is Lawton here?
- He'll be here any minute.
Where's Johnny?
Don't worry about Johnny.
Here, sit down.
Right here.
Oh, Anderson, we don't wanna be disturbed.
I understand, Mr. Lawton.
Just relax.
- What is this?
- Just be cool.
Glad you could get here so quick, Mr. Lawton.
- Hi, Carl.
- What's he doing here?
Oh, I thought he should know what's going on.
Yeah, he knows, all right.
He knows real good.
Come on, Hays, tell him.
Matula's your fink, Mr. Lawton.
How do you know that, Mr. Hays?
Well, I thought I recognised his voice.
You thought?
I wasn't sure, so I called him up.
I disguised my voice and gave him a departmental code word.
He thought I was an agent.
He gave the countersign and agreed to a meeting.
He's your man.
Hays, you're a disappointment.
I told you, Mr. Lawton.
I was right all along.
I got another proposition for you.
I'm listening.
I'll pay you 25 grand for fingering Matula.
Can you do it?
For 25 grand, sure, why not?
- I'll need a little time.
- No, I got no time.
I want to get rid of him once and for all.
- Where's Lawton now?
- He's--
Matula's always been smarter than you, Carl.
It's a phoney.
I've been set up.
Have you?
Matula's got your job now, Carl.
- And, Carl, you're fired.
- Johnny, hit him.
Yeah, Hays, here comes yours.
You set this up, Hays.
- Now you're dead.
- Johnny.
- Jim.
- Yeah.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm gonna be.
Let me help you.
Thanks, Barney.
All right, let's go.
Brown's dead.
What do you want me to do with this one?
Kill him.
- Look, Mr. Matula, I was only--
- Save it.
This way, you can consider yourself lucky.
Look, you get this place cleaned up, Steve.
I'll see Mr. Lawton out.
See if you can find some place to hide the garbage.
Then I think you better blow town for a while.
I like your style, Anderson.
Come back.
Right, Mr. Lawton.
Let's go.
Excellent.
Glad to see you.
There are unknown facts about the creation of Nature.
An exciting mystery embrace the enormity of the universe.
Unsolved problems hangs over the existence.
Life and death.
And within this whirlwind of lives, just one thing is certain:
the creation of mind and the formation of the substance.
The existence of man.
Now, everything in the universe become easier.
From waters to forests, from Earth to deep space, everything that exist has a reason.
And the man finds a reason to exist.
Nothing born, nothing lives, nothing dies without a reason.
According to the mental ability of everyone, the right answer could take a long or a short time to come,
or come at the exact moment.
But the truth is only one, for everything and for everybody.
if it exists, it must be a reason.
That's why this film exists.
THE END OF MAN
Don't be so sad, Mrs. Rita.
You'll be fine and you'll walk again.
No, my child.
I know that I'll never leave this wheelchair.
Now go, or you'll be late.
Take care and come back soon.
Farewell, Mrs. Rita.
We'll be back soon.
Help!
Help!
Help me!

Mrs. Rita, what's happening?
.
A man!
A man!
But Mrs. Rita, you are walking!
Yes.
I'm walking!
I'm walking!
A miracle!
A miracle!
It happened just like that, Mrs. Maria, as I'm saying to you.
Very well, Mrs. Dinda...
Look, a naked man!
I drink because I'm a good drinker.
I've got a bell inside my head that rings to tell me when I must stop drinking.
The bell just had ringed!
Yes, my love?
Answer me.
Yes?
.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Let go my daughter!
Let me go!
Let me go!
I must see my daughter.
I want my daughter.

I want my daughter.
I want my daughter back.
Let me go!
Quiet!
My daughter!
My baby, my baby... lt's yours.
Ouch!
A charity, please... a charity...
God bless you.
This man must be a lunatic, or even worse: a drug addict.
I didn't do anything.
I simply get my camera and took some pictures.
A very casual thing.
-But the result was disastrous.
-Right.
Suddenly the man gone mad and throws my camera in the lake.
That's all, officer.
And, along with the damages, he attacked me!
-l see.
Give orders to search this tramp.
-Yes, chief.
Finis Hominis!
Finis what?
.
Finis Hominis!
Gentleman, will you please follow us?
.
What's your name?
Finis...
Hominis.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, attention to this news:
A mysterious man escaped after he was imprisoned by two policemen.
Nobody knows who is this very strange man, as also is strange the clothes he wears.
And that's all by now.
We'll be back tomorrow with another News at Night.
Until tomorrow.
Gentleman, you didn't pay the bill.
-What bill?
-The food you ate.
Why pay?
.
Because everything you ate we also must pay.
So, don't pay anybody and it will be no problem.
Here's your order.
We'll deliver your package tomorrow, okay?
.
Thank you.
You should see what a strange man.
When the waiter tried to charge the bill, the man answered that he wouldn't pay.
And left leaving everybody surprised.
I'm not sure, but I believe that I've already heard about this man.
Yes?
.
Who is it?
.
Count Maximiliano?
If we have room?
Yes, yes, sure.
We'll be awaiting.
Sure.
Bye.
Thank you.
Hush, my baby.
You'll be fine, my child.
Hush.
Mommy's here with you, my little angel.
Hush.
My God, hush, baby, you'll be fine.
Calm down.
Could the doctors take care of the girl now?
.
The child is getting worse.
I've already told you that the doctors are busy.
If you can't wait, take her to another hospital.
My God, this girl will die soon!
Turn around.
Say 33.
33.
-Repeat.
-33.
...Gentil intercepts with his left foot and passes to Júlio... passes to Plínio, Plínio to Caíco, Caíco controls it... crosses the dividing line of the field... and there goes the red team for the attack... again with Plínio, he passes one, two... controls the ball, enters in the box... attention, he prepares the kick, goes to kick...
My child, soon the doctors will take care of you.
Please, be calm, don't worry.
You'll be fine.
I can't take it, what can I do?
I can't wait any longer.
That's enough, it can't be, can't be.
The doctors must see her.
I don't know, he's a very strange man.
He goes upstairs carrying the girl in his arms.
What a strange man, who could he be?
He must be the principal of this hospital.
He came to watch our work.
Say 33.
-One more time.
-33.
-Again.
-33.
-Attention, attention, doctors and nurses...
-l'll be back soon!
Attention, attention, doctors and nurses...
Urgent call to General Surgery...
Urgent call to General Surgery...
Attention, attention, doctors and nurses...
Attention, attention, doctors and nurses...
Urgent call to General Surgery...
Urgent call to General Surgery...
Come, quick, it must be important.
You´ve got to do everything to save this girl.
We can't fail.
Give it all you've got.
This girl must be saved.
But this child is a proletarian.
Remember that we don't know who's that man with the girl.
We need to keep the reputation of this hospital.
-Let's go to the surgery room.
-We've gotta prove that we're the best.
The girl is alive.
Where's that man?
We know how great is the interest on the strange man... who wanders in the streets of our city.
An information that just arrived says that yesterday... a strange act saved the life of a child who was in great agony.
One also knows that this man is the same that... appeared completely undressed a few days ago in the beach of Santos... and that, as they say, is miraculous.
Most peculiar is that he appears and disappears unexpectedly.
Wait for tomorrow other news on this case.
And now, back to our program.
Soft!
Delicious!
You know, they ask me why I spend all my money.
If I got it... right?
.
Sure, darling!
Give daddy a kiss.
Angel, I'm crazy.
Make those things only you know how to do.
I'll do anything you ask me to.
My life!
I'm yours.
My baby.
Your wife are in bed with another man.
No, it can't be. lt's not possible.
Tell it to my father and to all my family.
Tonight she'll meet a real macho man.
-Excuse me.
-What's this...?
You-you sl... slut!
Leave me alone!
Dirty bitch, you'll pay for that!
My father, the blood of this slut will wash the honor of ourfamily.
Adulteress!
Adulteress!
Shameless whore!
Dirty bitch!
Street whore!
Get her!
Get her!
Get this shameless woman.
The man must stop when he doesn't have any reason to continue.
Please, save me!
Don't be afraid.
No one will hurtyou any more.
I don't need any explanation.
I know the truth.
You... did you tell your father about your affairs?
.
Your husband, he really knows who you are?
And you... did you tell her about your affairs?
.
If somebody must be punished, then everyone must punish itself and the forgive will come.
Finis Hominis Saves Adulteress from Lynch Mob!
And now, sweethearts, let's make love.
It's a masterpiece!
Great!
Hurrah!
Only Finis could do better than this magical touch.
How is it going, Valdomiro, you still haven't found that so-called prophet?
.
There he comes.
People, we've found the man.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
We've gotta prepare a big reception for tomorrow.
Yeah!
Yeah!
And couldn't be us a big reception?
But we must give our best and not be a deception!
You can leave it to me because I can handle with this!
And count with me too.
We gotta please the man.
Starting tomorrow, hippies will have a master.
Finis Hominis!
Finis Hominis!
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eya-eh!
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eya-eh!
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eya-eh!
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eya-eh!
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eya-eh!
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eya-eh...
Here begins the New World!
Our world!
Finis Hominis, you're the man!
We are all men.
The birds lives and the children are dressed with the best fabric!
Freedom, freedom, and hurrah to free love!
Shall we love one another!
The master taught us, but mankind has got away from him!
The struggle, before anything else, is for survival!
We search for the truth.
And what else is true, besides money?
.
Here is the man.
Master, these women are for you.
We're searching for the Paradise Lost.
While we're awaiting for the truth.

More money.
Money, money.
Come on, sister, all this money is ours.
This money is mine!
Did you see a very strange looking man, wearing a turban?
-Who, the prophet of peace?
-Yes.
He´s gonna away.
Come get the money he gave to us.
Come on, come on.
No, thank you, I can't.
I must go look for him.
The sales declined a little this month.
We need to launch a new advertising campaign urgently.
But we can't launch an ordinary campaign.
We need something different.
I think I found the solution:
Finis Hominis.
Butwe don't know who is he.
It doesn't matter.
He's the man of the moment.
And as had said Our Lord Jesus Christ, ""l'll be back for thy".
Yes, brothers, he'd came back to reign again!
Yes, brothers, he'd came back because it was written so.
He'd came back for the salvation of all mankind.
My brothers, he's the only hope that reign over thy.
My brothers, he's among us, and within him there's a hope for all mankind.
Hurrah to Finis Hominis!
Hurrah!
Hurrah!
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?
Are you already awake?
Yes.
Darling, I brought your breakfast.
But it's so early...
Did you forgot that I'll travel today?
.
Oh, yes!
And how long you'll be away from me?
No more than two or three days.
But don't you worry.
If anything happens, you tell somebody to look for me.
Take care, my baby.
I don't want you to miss anything, otherwise I'll be the one who'll be worried.
When I come back, I'll have a pleasant surprise for you!
But I'll miss you so much...
But don't you worry.
I'll be back as soon as possible.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be back soon.
Take care, my darling.
Okay.
Bye!
Tony, take me to the airport.
Let's go.
Oh, oh!
Come here, you dirty bitch!
It's for things like this that I have to see you married with him?
What have I done?
""Bye-bye!"...
You bitch!
Take it!
Take it!
Take it!
...
Slut!
That's enough!
Stop it or you'll kill this woman!
Not quite, mom.
She's already used to this.
And Cavalcanti?
Tony is driving him to the airport.
You cretin, what were you doing... that you didn't give him the poison, huh?
I was asleep.
Like I said before, this stupid girl will serve us for nothing.
But, since yesterday, you didn't do anything with me.
Well, this doesn't matter now.
I'll take her to the room.
We'll talk about it tomorrow, okay?
.
But, in the present situation, we can't do any better.
Wind from the sea and my face under the sun, so warm,
Streets full of people who pass and see me passing by,
Rio de Janeiro, I love you, I like everybody who likes,
This sky, this sea, this happy people, I sure tried to write a love poem,
Love was in everything that I saw, ln everything that I ever loved...
Enough!
Enough!
That's enough!
Baby...
You promised.
This crying is annoying me!
Everybody got its own madness.
This is beyond madness, it's real masochism!
There's nothing we can do.
We need her collaboration.
-And so?
-Normal.
Those cataleptic seizures was caused by emotional shocks.
Fortunately they're not fatal.
-Paulo...
-There's no reason to be panic.
And what about the other problem?
Don't worry.
The impotence will disappear during the medical treatment.
I'm in a total despair.
I want to be cured soon.
My wife...
You don't know her.
She's a healthful girl.
She needs me.
I understand.
Within the next days... will arrive a package with foreign medicines... that are perfect in your case.
I'll send you some of these medicine.
For the time being, you can take this one.
It'll help you a lot.
I'll be waiting for the medicine.
Thank you very much.
No problem.
Friends are also for the difficult moments.
Yeah, the girl got his share of happiness.
Okay, the doll is already happy.
Come on, let's go to the business.
The inheritance of our beloved uncle.
We got to find a way, before he returns.
But how?
.
I already know how.
Calm down, calm down...
""...hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come,"
""Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven..."
Poor Mr. Cavalcanti.
Only the good die young, what can we do?
That's life.
Did you see her behavior?
.
It's getting suspicious.
Pedro, tell Mário that the girl isn't crying.
People are getting suspicious.
Tell him that Soninha must cry.
You must do something to that girl.
It can be hard.
I've got an idea.
Come with me.
Cover me.
You cretin!
You must cry.
Baby, you know what to do.
""...and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil..."
""Our father, which art in heaven:
hallowed be Thy name,"
""Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven..."
""Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we..."
Not there!
My baby, you can't leave me...
My darling, don't leave me, don't leave me!
I can't live without you!
Don't leave me, darling!
Don't leave me!
She loved him so much!
It's a beautiful love!
How did he get it?
.
I don't know.
What's matter now is that she's crying.
Yes.
Let's close the casket.
Are you sure that he's really dead?
.
Dead or alive, we'll burry him anyway.
That man isn't dead yet.
He'll arise to continue his existence until the moment of his final day.
Rise, Cavalcanti, to do the best for those who want you dead.
And that my intervention serves as an example to what doesn't have to come, and that your life continues, as intentionally is.
No!
No!
Extra!
Extra!
Finis recreate a scene from two thousand years ago!
Millionaire disinherits his family and his fortune goes for charity institutions!
Civil Guard, São Paulo
We've already got the most important:
the permit to present the show.
Well, I was expecting for this.
After all, the money will go to the corporation hospital.
The show is scheduled for tomorrow night and we still searching for the cast.
I was afraid this could happen.
And what can we do now?
.
Guys, the problem is over.
I've already found an actor.
But only one actor?
.
One actor worth of twenty.
Now it doesn't matter.
What we got to do is to hold that man.
You can be sure that the man is already with us.
-Here are the artist.
-Very well.
Do you want to see our installations?
.
We can think about it later.
What's matter now is the show.
Money is the main problem.
Money for people who are in need.
So, let's the money.
And after that... the show.
Right?
.
-Yeah, he's right.
-Yes, it's a fact.
Thank you.
More.
Come on, you don't have to be shame.
It'sjust a contribution.
Well, I won't give any money, but I can give another hat.
Thank you.
Thirty million.
Good.
Very good!
Close the curtains, because what you'll see now... is something nobody ever saw.
Things gone bad, the man gone away.
-Give them an explanation...
-Yes.
Ladies and gentlemen, the show won't be presented, because, we don't know why, our actor disappeared.
Or, in fact, he vanished.
-Oh, yes?
.
-But vanished how?
.
It's impossible!
The guy must appear.
It's ridiculous!
Where's the responsibility of the organization of the show?
.
It's so ridiculous.
This is so absurd!
I'll talk with the manager!
Why such a rebellion?
The real show was that we've justwatched.
That trick was of bad taste, huh?
Wait. he money is for the corporation hospital, right?
.
-Yes.
-Well, we've already got money enough.
-The show doesn't matter.
-Our main mission is completed.
Please, sir, I'm looking for the prophet of peace.
I was told that he's around here.
I don't know.
I'm also looking for him.
Perhaps that policeman could help us.
He's close to our town and soon he'll be here.
God listened to our prayers.
He sent His emissary to save the world.
Yes, sisters.
Finis came to save the world.
Let's pray to thank God.
Attention!
Attention!
Attention!
Attention!
Authorities must take action.
A man shakes the nation.
He's a deranged man who, although he hasn't attacked defenseless people,
he got a supernatural power greater than that of the authorities.
Attention!
Attention!
Hold that man who, although his peaceful look, represents a great danger.
He's the promised messiah!
I am... an... instrument.
He's the right way.
The truth is in everyone.
He came from a distant planet.
I'm an ordinary human being.
He's the salvation of mankind.
The salvation of each country is in the cooperation of its own people.
And now attention, ladies and gentlemen, for the latest news.
Finis Hominis, the strange man who everybody knows... and that's believed by many as the messiah,
had announced his departure from our town tomorrow.
Millions of people are awaiting for his farewell speech, in the hope to know his origin, his mission and his destination.
That's all for the moment.
Good night.
Centuries goes by, millenniuns goes by.
Everything repeats in the elapsing of eternity.
As I promised, I'm here to bid you farewell.
Because it's approaching the hour when I must leave, to fulfill my mission.
But what was said will last forever.
In the Book of Truth is written the fate of the universe.
Hundreds, thousands, millions of men are listening to me in this moment... knowing that these words are the hope for a better world.
The man carry on his shoulders... the weight of the fate of his own reason to be.
He's blindly searching for the reason of his existence.
When, in his hypocrisy, he runs away from the truth... to hide itself under the shroud of lie.
The man must take care... of his ambition and his disbelief.
Because if this won't happen, it'll be the end of man.
This broadcast will beat all of our ratings records.
The mankind holds itself to the belief, waiting in faith for the miracle,
while the only true miracle is the existence of mankind.
The struggle for wealth is untiring, and the despite for poverty is absolute,
without knowing what's wealth and what's poverty.
When the man looks inside himself and focus his mind in what he sees, in this very moment he'll understand the reason of his origin and his existence.
And a scream of triumph will blast out from his mouth.
It's not possible. I've already asked for a zoom, what are they waiting for?
.
Because the man will finally know the reason to be.
Together with justice, faith and the glorious virtue of love.
It's amazing, ladies and gentlemen, the way this man is able to transmit to mankind his message of faith.
It's written that peace will reign for all eternity... and a kingdom of happiness will be build with forces of good.
Today, thanks to the privilege of television, you can watch inside your own homes... the farewell of a man who now lives in the heart of us all.
Wherever you are, I'll be with you!
My destiny is to follow you!
To the place where l'm going, nobody could follow me.
Master, I've got nothing else!
I've left all behind just to follow you.
You've left everything behind because you wanted to... according to your free will.
Your instinct pushed you to go.
That woman who now is by your side... wouldn't be that one you always been searching?
.
Your instinct wouldn't have lead you to search for the man who now stands close to you?
.
He's coming.
I told you.
He always comes back.
São Cristovão Sanatorium, Nervous illnesses lf it exists, there must be a reason for it.
THE END
You can pour Mr Chadwick's coffee now, Charles Yes, ma'am
Good morning
Good morning, Charles Good morning
Ah, thank you
Good morning, Beth
Mm-hmm
Ah
Beth Hmm?
You are sulking What?
You're sulking I'm not sulking
Of course you're sulking
It isn't necessary
We have had our usual argument, and now the matter is settled
Is it?
Beth, now listen to me
He isn't for you, believe me
But if you insist upon seeing him, I have a right to...
well, to express my feelings
You have no right to control my life
Your life, in this case, is tied in with an employee of the company
What difference does that make?
He's an honest, hardworking...
Yes, he is And he's ambitious He's intelligent He's a good attorney
And he has a flair for the advertising business
And he's also, uh, smart enough to know a golden opportunity when he sees it
You're not Father
No, I'm not your father
I'm your brother, and if your choice in men friends were more mature, believe me, I would stay out of your life
You don't know how to stay out of my life
I won't let you be used, Beth
Therefore, I've taken the appropriate steps Charles
The car ready?
What do you mean you've taken appropriate steps?
Bryce!
What have you done?
I have written a letter to Peter Hamilton He'll receive it when he gets back from Atlanta today
What?
I told him that ifhe continues to see you contrary to my wishes, his employment with Ellison Chadwick will be terminated
I don't believe it!
You've threatened him with...
I won't be home for dinner Don't wait for me, Beth
He won't care if you fire him!
No?
Then let me ask you a question, Beth
If your name wasn't Chadwick and you didn't have all of this, do you think that...
I mean, do you really think that Peter Hamilton would give you a second look?
Now, uh, I'm, uh...
I'm sorry if I sound cruel
I don't mean to be
But the sooner you face the facts, the better
And the cheaper it will be for all of us
What about the price I've paid, first to Father, then to you?
Anything I wanted to do on my own, you or he prevented it!
Beth Beth!
This is hardly the time
No, it never is
Charles Yes, Miss Chadwick?
Tomorrow's your day off, isn't it?
Yes, ma'am
Will you be leaving tonight with the rest of the staff?
Well, I'd planned to, Miss Chadwick
But if you'd like me to stay...
Oh, no, no That won't be necessary
As you wish May I bring you more coffee?
Thank you, Charles, no
That'll be all

[Man] We found a key ring in the bushes, Miss Chadwick
Does it belong to your brother?
[Beth] Yes, those are...
those were his keys
[Man] The front light's burned out
He must have dropped his keys and couldn't find them in the dark
Probably walked around to your French doors and knocked
[Beth] I was asleep
I had taken sleeping pills, and I didn't hear him
[Man] We figure he broke the glass and opened the door
[Beth] I heard the glass and then the alarm go off
I just woke up and...
and reached for the gun
I thought it was a burglar
[Man] Obviously a mistake, Miss Chadwick
A terrible mistake
[Beth] I thought it was a burglar [Man] A terrible mistake

You know what we're talking about [Beth] Okay
[Beth Sniffling] Oh
[Man #1] You then climbed over the gate and started running toward the house
[Sniffling] Well, I was half asleep because I'd taken a sleeping pill
The burglar alarm was on?
Well, yes There's a switch beside my bed
How does it work outside?
At the front door?
Well, if you have a key and use it, it automatically turns the alarm off
Ah
Do you have any idea why your brother went through your French doors knowing he'd probably set the alarm off?
Uh, I...
[Sniffles]
I guess he lost his keys and he came around the side of the house and tried to get in through my wi-window
What time did you go to bed tonight, Miss Chadwick?
[Sniffles] About 9:
3O
I didn't feel very well yesterday, so I didn't go out
Uh, excuse me
- Did I hear you say you stayed home today?
- Yes, that's what I said
You didn't go out at all?
No
- N-No That's what I said
- Thank you
[Man] So when you got there, he was already dead
Yes, that's correct
Or did Miss Chadwick telephone you after she shot her brother?
No, I was on my way over
I stopped at the gate when I heard the shots
How many?
Three
And the alarm was going?
That's right
Why did you drop by, Mr, uh, Hamilton?
I came to see Bryce I work for him
Can you account for your whereabouts this evening?
I came in from Atlanta I landed at 10.00, I took a cab, got into my apartment about 10.45
You can check with the doorman
Why did you come over here afterjust getting home?
It's a little involved, uh...
Miss Chadwick and I have been seeing each other, and Bryce objected
So you came over here to have it out with him?
I suppose you could put it that way
Is this your newspaper?
No
We found these outside in the bushes Thanks
Excuse me
Miss Chadwick, are these your brother's keys?
Yes Where did you find them?
In the bushes, ma'am With that front light burned out, it's really tough to see
Uh, gentlemen, you have our statements
If you don't mind, I think...
No, I'd like to go through this just once more to make sure I got things straight
Gentlemen, please
No, Peter, that's all right Go on
Now, Miss Chadwick, you said you went to bed at 9.30, right?
Yes Mm-hmm
And you took a sleeping pill before you retired
That's right Mm-hmm
Well, would you mind telling me what happened after that?
Well, it was after 11:
OO and I...
I heard the glass break and the alarm go off, and I woke up
You thought it was a burglar
Yes Yes, I thought it was a burglar
You see, it was pitch dark and I was half asleep because I'd taken the sleeping pill
I heard the glass break and the alarm go off, and so I...
I reached for the gun
It was in the drawer beside my bed, and... and then I just started shooting
I didn't know what I was doing Shh
Gentlemen, we'll be available for questioning tomorrow
Right now I'd like to see that Miss Chadwick gets some rest
Right All right, fellas, wrap it up
Thank you very much Good night
Come on, darling
Excuse me
Were you and your brother the only ones that were living here?
Well, yes, except for Charles and the maid
My mother moved to Palm Desert after my father died
Who is Charles?
The butler
I suppose he's off tonight
Yes
Great big place, isn't it?
Well, good night
[Door Closes]
[Barking]
Easy, boy Easy, fella Easy
Easy Easy, now
[Barking Continues] That's right
No, no, no, no...
Enrico, darling Be nice, darling, be nice
You there, pay the cab and bring my luggage Come on, dear
[Door Closes]
She have any luggage?
Luggage?
Right here
And there's 1 O5O on that meter
Gee, I've only got $11
Well, go ahead Keep it all
You're a sport
[Cab Door Closes] [Engine Starts]
[Cab Pulls Away]
[Barking]
All right, easy, boy
Now, Enrico Come here, come here
Come here!
Now, you stop that Do you hear?
I want you to behave yourself
That is a tough little monkey you got there
Enrico is not a monkey He's a pedigreed silky
Oh, I can see that, ma'am It's just a figure of speech
Now, you stay there
Where is my daughter?
I don't know, ma'am
She's, uh, probably asleep
Well, where's Charles?
Uh, it's his day off Are you Mrs Chadwick?
Yes
And you?
My name is Columbo, ma'am
I'm a lieutenant from the police just a minute Not so quickly I'd like to look that over
Well, I must say, you hardly look the role
Well, you know how it is
You...
You brought my bags in?
Uh, y-yes, ma'am The cab fare was $1 O5O
It was a 5O-cent tip, so that's $11
I'll see that you're reimbursed, Lieutenant
Now, tell me, what happened?
Where is she?
Here I am, Mother
Do you feel better now?
No
It was an accident
I don't care what it was
You killed my son Mother...
Oh, you were always so impossible Always
Blundering, making mistakes, causing trouble wherever you were
He looked after her all of her life
He protected you
And now you've destroyed him
Mother, you don't understand It wasn't my fault
I don't want to hear about it
[Sighs] I'm sorry, Lieutenant This must be very embarrassing for you
No, not really, no
You see, I come from a very big family, and at dinnertime it was like, well, you know, Madison Square Garden
We used to patch it up with coffee
- Is that a hint?
- Well, I smelled it when I came in I sure could use some
Mother?
I should think it would be obvious I'm in no mood for coffee
Uh, ma'am, would you like me to take your bags upstairs?
No No, thank you
Beth can attend to them
He was a special man, Lieutenant
Very special
He kept us all together
I thought you lived in Palm Desert
I mean spiritually
When my husband died, I...
I couldn't stay in this house any longer
Well, that's certainly understandable
Was that when your son took over the business, ma'am?
Yes, and turned it into one of the largest advertising agencies on the West Coast
Really?
Marvelous
He took over from my husband in many ways, including dealing with Beth and her problems
Oh
Her choice of men, when she's had a choice, has never been particularly mature
Oh, yeah Like that Peter Hamilton
Exactly He's an obvious fortune hunter
Of course, she would have no way of seeing through him, would she?
I'm afraid not
She's something of a child, Lieutenant
Her decisions are always vague and emotional
Bryce was far more perceptive
He never married, did he?
Why was that?
What are you implying?
Oh, no offense, ma'am
He just seems like a very distinctive and unique man, and I was curious about him
Well, he was
But he had far too many responsibilities for marriage, and I suppose he never met the right woman
Then there was the business
I don't know what's going to happen to the company now
I certainly can't run it, and I don't want to bring anyone in from the outside
You won't have to And what does that mean?
It means that I am an officer of the company In name only
That's because Bryce would never let me participate
Of course he wouldn't You aren't even capable of running your own life
I've never been allowed to run my own life
- Lieutenant, won't you sit down?
- Thank you
But things are different now, aren't they?
There's a change in the status quo
If you are seriously considering...
We're not alone, Mother I suggest we discuss this later
All right, Lieutenant, I've kept you waiting long enough What can I do for you?
Oh, no, no, no That's all right
No, I only have one problem, and that is...
Thank you
Cream?
Sugar?
No, I take it black, thank you
Uh, I couldn't sleep last night
There were a couple of points that were bothering me, so I thought I'd come over here and clear them up
What kind of points?
Thank you
Uh, that newspaper
Newspaper?
Uh, yes, um, the one that I noticed on the table in the foyer
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but, uh, didn't I hear you say that you were home all day yesterday?
That's right
See, that's what puzzles me How did that newspaper get there?
Haven't you ever heard of home delivery?
Oh, yeah Yeah, I have a newspaper delivered to my house every morning
- There's your answer
- No
No, that won't answer it, no
No, the newspaper on the foyer table, that was a late edition
I mean, I even saw race track results in it
I'm afraid I don't quite follow you
Well, if you were home all day, who brought home the newspaper?
Well, Bryce must have brought it home
But Bryce came in through your room He didn't come in through the front door
I mean, he was shot on that side of the house
How did that newspaper get to the other end of the house?
Lieutenant, you seem to be cross-examining my daughter
That's all right, Mother
Bryce must have brought it in, and in my confusion I picked it up and put it on the foyer table when I went to answer the door
Yes, that would be an answer, except for one thing
You left your brother's attaché case out there
Why wouldn't you bring 'em both in at the same time?
I didn't see it
You didn't see it Gee
They couldn't have been too far apart
People are inconsistent when they're in a state of shock, Lieutenant
It's foolish of you to expect rational behavior at a time like that
Well, I'm sure you're probably right about this
I only get into it because I try to figure it out in my mind You understand that
Uh, well, look, I'm sure both of you have a great deal to talk about, so I'm gonna run along
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am
Bye-bye Good-bye
Um, listen, about that $11, ma'am, uh...
If you'll leave me your card, I'll send you a check
I'm all out of cards
Oh Well here
Thank you very much Thank you, Lieutenant
[Barking]
Easy, now Easy!
[Peter Whispering] That'd bejust terrific
[Whispering Continues]
The jury's coming in now
[Feedback]
Have you ladies and gentlemen concluded your deliberations?
- Yes, sir, we have
- Clerk
Thank you
What do you think?
What?
She's home free You watch jupiter and Venus are in good aspect with Pluto
[Hearing Offlcer] I have before me the verdict of the coroner's jury in the matter of Bryce Chadwick, deceased
The jury finds that Bryce Chadwick, age 46, came to his death July 21 at his residence,
2307 Lorraine Drive, death being caused by three 38 caliber bullet wounds in the upper chest
The jury also finds, from the evidence submitted, that the death of Bryce Chadwick was an accident
[Spectators Gasping, Muttering]
Thank you very much Thank you Good luck to you
See?
Thank you, jury members This inquest is now closed
[Hamilton] Nice to be believed, isn't it, huh?
[Chuckles] Yes I want to take the whole jury out for dinner
[Laughing] That is what is known as bribery after the fact
Oh, is it?
Anyway, it's all over Back to normal, huh?
[Beth] Oh, no That's exactly what I don't want
[Hamilton] What do you mean?
Well, I think it's time we made a few changes, that I broke a few patterns
[Chuckling] As long as you don't break ours How 'bout some lunch to celebrate?
Can I take a rain check?
I...
I have a few appointments
You don't mind, do you, darling?
No, no That's all right
Oh, uh, when you get back to the office, would you set up a meeting with the heads of the departments?
What's the agenda?
Reorganization
Uh, tomorrow at 2:
OO Mother
Good morning, Mr Hamilton Oh Lieutenant
Do you remember me?
Yes, I've got a very good memory
I tell you, I envy you that I got to the point where I can't remember my telephone number
What can I do for you, Lieutenant?
Well, I, uh...
I couldn't help overhearing that she turned you down for lunch
You wanna grab a bite with me?
You want to ask me some questions, is that it?
Well, uh...
Listen, it's my treat
[Chuckles] Your...
All right
Window down, please
Oh Right
That's it I held the whipped cream on the Mighty Malt
That's what you wanted?
Uh right
Okay And they, uh...
they were out of onion rings You want a substitution?
Uh, no, that's all right No, that's fine
All right Don't forget to let me know before you leave
I need to take the tray People are always driving off with our trays
Right I'll remember Thank you
You're welcome Right
Tell me something...
you and Miss Chadwick, are you gonna be married?
You don't believe in preliminaries, do you?
Well, you know, sometimes it's just, uh...
Yes, we're gonna be married, but we haven't set the date yet, mainly because of Bryce
Oh, I see You know what I was wondering was the night of the shooting...
why'd you drive over there so late?
Let's say the propulsion was anger
Huh?
What...
What do you mean?
Oh, I got back from a business trip, and there was a letter waiting for me from Bryce
He said to lay off Beth or else Or else?
Or else what?
Oh, it's...
Professional discrimination Things like that
So I got hot, and I went over to have it out with him
I see
Boy, uh, you got there just in time for the commotion
That's quite a coincidence, isn't it?
That's a leading question, Lieutenant
Do you think that, uh, the two of us did Bryce in together?
What do you mean, murder?
Oh, no
I mean, you were at the inquest They said it was an accident
I'm not talking about the inquest I'm talking about you What do you think?
Do I think it was a conspiracy?
No, no
Oh, no No chance of that No, sir
Well, it's rather odd that you're still asking the same questions, though
Oh, well, you know, that's, uh...
well, that's just me
You know, I mean, nothing official
It's just that, you know, I have this, uh, bug about tying up loose ends
Listen, I wanna thank you You've been very helpful to me
Suppose you ask the question that you haven't asked
- Whether or not I'm a fortune hunter
- Well, I never intended...
I'm not
I love Beth with her money or without her money
As a matter of fact, I was quite prepared to quit the company
'Course, that won't be necessary now
No, that won't, but I won't be a hypocrite, Lieutenant
I'm sorry about poor Bryce being killed, but it has gotten Beth out from under his thumb
Oh, yeah Yeah, way out Huh?
What's that supposed to mean?
Way out?
Well, uh, you know, uh, in the courtroom I overheard her say that she was breaking patterns now
This is a terrible thing to admit, but, uh,
I think that, in a way, her brother's death is the best thing that ever happened to her
[Waitress] Hey, mister
You forgot the tray!
Sorry It's all right
May I assist you, sir?
Oh [Chuckles] You scared me
No, I was looking for Miss, uh...
You're Charles, aren't you?
Are we acquainted?
Oh, I saw you at the inquest No, I'm, uh, Lt Columbo
I'm looking for Miss Chadwick
You're a police officer, sir?
Uh, yes, I am Yeah
Uh, is she in?
I'm afraid not, sir
Oh, she isn't?
I see Well, uh...
Uh, do you, uh...
do you know where I can, uh...
uh, get in touch with her?
Yes, she's at the beauty parlor Eugene's
Uh-huh Will that be all, sir?
Yes, Charles Uh, yeah, I think so
Uh...
Hey, smells new It is, sir
Oh Why didn't she take it with her?
It was just delivered
Ah, it was just delivered I see
Well, I wanna tell you, it's a beauty
That's a wonderful piece of machinery Will that be all, sir?
Yeah, Charles, that'll be all
I don't want you to worry about me, Charles
I'm gonna go around the side of the house here and I'm gonna conduct an experiment
Is it something I can help you with, sir?
No, Charles It's a kind of a do-it-yourself thing
Thank you very much
[Woman] May I help you, sir?
Uh well, I'm not a customer
No, I assumed that You're looking for someone?
Yes, I was looking for a, uh, Beth Chadwick
Miss Chadwick?
My name's Lt Columbo
The police?
Well, look now, it's not serious
I just want to talk to her for a moment Oh
Well, right through that door, Lieutenant Cubicle four
Thank you Uh, Lieutenant?
- Your cigar
- What about it?
Uh, well, the fragrance is not, um compatible
That's a shame I just lit it
Uh...
Oh
[Spraying]
Well, what brings you here, Lieutenant?
Oh, I, uh...
I stopped by the house
I talked to Charles, and he told me where you'd be, so I thought I'd come by
There's, uh, just one point that I wanted to clear up
[Chuckles] Do you mind?
Does it matter?
I'm a captive audience We can go, Miss Chadwick
No, no, no That's all right Go ahead and finish
Saw your new car, by the way Oh, that's some automobile
Thank you Really beautiful Beautiful
I suppose you have to order those things weeks in advance, don't you?
Yes, that's right Yeah, that's what I thought
Real change of pace for you, isn't it?
[Chuckles]
Well, I felt like something racy As they say in advertising, a new image
Hmm Yeah Well, you know, I can understand that
I'm sorry Because, uh, it's a natural thing, I think, uh, after a death in the family to want to break loose
That's one way of putting it
Gee, that's funny, though
What?
If you had to order the car some time ago, that would mean that you knew in advance that you were gonna change your style
Finished, Miss Chadwick
May I see?
Yes
Oh!
[Laughing]
[Columbo] WowJust amazing Looks fabulous Fabulous
Miss Chadwick, you look sensational You really think so?
I'd say you were a new woman
Oh, thank you, Lieutenant Good-bye, Gene Thank you Good-bye
See you next week Bye, Felicia Thank you very much
Excuse me Sorry
Why, Miss Chadwick, you look lovely
Thank you You're very kind
The bill, and could I have an appointment next week?
Certainly
Well, Lieutenant, you haven't asked me your question
I'll tell you what...
are you headed home?
Yes
Do you mind if I meet you there, 'cause it kind of has to do with your house
Is this really necessary?
Well, in a way, it does, yes
I promise it won't take long
All right I'll meet you there
Uh, Lieutenant?
Your cigar
Oh, good afternoon, ma'am
Good afternoon Oh, Charles, our lieutenant requires a stepladder
Would you be good enough to get one for him?
Yes, ma'am Another experiment, sir?
Uh, well, I-I guess you could call it that, yeah
Experiment, Lieutenant?
Uh-huh
Like I said, I was out here earlier
Hey, why don't I show it to you?
Now, uh, you figure that your brother had to walk around the side of the house like this
Is that right?
I'd figure it, and so did the coroner's jury
Right
Now, you see, he had to walk on grass
[Chuckling]
Is there some point to this?
Yes, ma'am, there is
You see, uh, now this grass is kind of dry because the sun's been out
Uh, but today's Thursday
And, uh, the gardener cuts the grass on Thursday
Excuse me a minute
You see?
Grass
Yes, well, that's only natural
It certainly is
But, you know, there was no grass on your brother's shoe
I'm afraid I don't quite understand
Your brother was shot a week ago, on Thursday
I looked at the photographs of the body I even had them blown up
For the life of me, I just couldn't see any grass on the soles of his shoe
And I couldn't figure that out Why?
It was freshly cut, and it was sticky because it was at night and there was dew
You know, that's very good
He must have had particles of grass on his shoes, but they were probably brushed off on the carpet and, unfortunately, the room's been cleaned
Yeah I know
Well, unless there's something else... just one more thing
I guess Charles has the stepladder by now, hmm?
I would think Yeah
All right, then
The other morning when I was over here,
I noticed these potted plants
How observant And they're very pretty, you know
But I got to thinking
I said to myself, "Sometimes people keep a spare key outside just in case they forget their own key"
Uh, do you, uh...
do you see this?
What?
This imprint here
Yes What about it?
Well, that's like a...
a fossil or something
You see, a spare key must have been hidden in there for a long time
You see, that's been rained on and everything
- There was a spare key
- Oh?
I put it there myself when the alarm system was installed
Bryce didn't know about it
I also removed it myself recently because I had second thoughts
Wh-What do you mean by "second thoughts"?
If a burglar were, in fact, on the premises, he might find the key, and then what good would the alarm system be?
Good point
Yes Hey, yeah
I was right, wasn't I?
Because you found it
Yeah, I guess I did
All right, Lieutenant I think you've finally overstayed your welcome
The official verdict is death by accidental means, and that should satisfy you
Look, ma'am, I don't mean any offense
I'm just trying to tie up loose ends
You see, I'm compulsive that way It's just a...
Well, that's what my wife says about itJust...
[Laughing] Are you really?
Oh No, I mean, all I meant by that was that, uh...
Well, you see, if...
if there was a key there Yes?
and if Bryce knew about it, well, then of course he would use the key to let himself in through the front door
But I told the truth the night it happened and I told the truth at the inquest
So whatever your little compulsions may be,
I'm afraid I must insist you leave me alone
Oh Uh...
Good-bye
I'll take it all
Yeah?
Well, is that it?
No, I haven't finished [Chuckling]
You're not bored, are you?
No, no I'm having a wonderful time
Is there something young and bright?
Why don't you try this one
Oh, that's marvelous I will try that on Excuse me Excuse us, please
Oh, don't forget to put my hat over by the black baggage Bring it with me?
It'll look great
[Beth] Could you get the zipper?
Peter Yes
Everybody set for this afternoon's meeting?
Uh, yes, but I was wondering, Beth Oh?
Don't you think it's a little premature?
Perhaps another week for things to ease up
No It must be today
All right It's up to you
Oh
Well, what do you think?
Interesting
What does that mean?
[Chuckling]
Well, it's wild It's a little out of your style, though, isn't it?
No, I don't think it is
Well, you asked
Hey, it was a courtesy
I'm perfectly capable of making my own decisions
[Gasps] Oh, what is that silver dress over there on the rail?
And this one This matches it Uh, Beth?
Why don't you finish your wardrobe I'm going back to the office
No, no I want you to wait till I'm ready to go
Do you have trousers that go with the red top?
Beth
I'm not sure what's gotten into you, but
I'm not sure I like it
I'll see you If you need me, I'll be back at the office
Did you want to try this on?
Yes, this one and that blue dress over there, please
Okay
[Chattering, Laughing]
Ladies and gentlemen
Will you please take your seats?
Well, now, we've all been through a period of anxiety and indecision since my brother's death
But in a corporate sense, we must maintain our continuity
As you all well know, this is a family-owned firm
Therefore, as of today, I am assuming the presidency
As my first order ofbusiness,
I would like to announce the elevation of Mr Peter Hamilton to executive vice-president in charge of accounts
As to philosophy, my brother was a traditionalist
I want to break new ground
Would you pass these along, please?
I want to streamline
We're gonna cut down marginal accounts and we're gonna start promoting ourselves for a change
Seems to me we've been selling everything but our own product
Beth, forgive me, but that is our job
Forgive me, but it's not Our job is to grow
Now, when was the last time this agency took on a new account?
- We have, uh, all we can handle
- Nonsense!
Look, Beth, I don't want to be difficult, but l-l...
Fred, I don't mean to interrupt you, but this is really not the time for negative thinking
Now, if you disagree with my approach, you're perfectly free to sever your relationship with the firm
No, Beth, I-I feel that I can accommodate myself to your way of thinking
Yes, I'm sure you can
Any questions?
Very well We'll adjourn
Oh, one more thing A happy and personal note
I'd like to announce my engagement to Mr Hamilton
Thank you
Are those letters for me to sign?
Congratulations, Peter Yeah Right
Congratulations Thank you
You must be out of your mind
What qualifies you to run this company?
I had a very good teacher...
my brother
I've been studying his reports for years and asking questions
Thank you We'll finish later
He may not have known it, but he was grooming me
[Mrs Chadwick] Well, don't forget, I am the majority stockholder
I will not relinquish control
[Giggling] Don't be naive, Mother
Who else can take over and still keep it in the family?
Besides, I'm prepared to go to court if necessary, and you know what that means
Publicity, interviews, scandal
[Gasps] I can't believe you're talking to me like this
[Beth] Are you prepared to take over the company?
You're getting old, Mother, or hadn't you noticed?
[Knocking] Come in
- Am I interrupting something?
- What do you want, Lieutenant?
Well, I just thought that...
Why, hello there, fella!
How you doing?
[Barking]
I got a treat for you I got a little something for him
Here you are You know, I've been carrying these things around with me all week
Come here, boy Come on Take one of these
Look at that Come on Come on
[Barking] Ooh Oh, easy
Easy
I think we have a personality conflict
Do you need me for anything, Lieutenant?
Come here
Uh, no, ma'am No, I don't think so
Then I'll be leaving
Mother?
We'll go into this later
As you wish
[Door Closes] I'll leave the two of you alone
No, that's all right, Peter The lieutenant is going to be very brief
Oh, yes
Well, Columbo, what is it now?
We've talked about keys and grass and newspapers
Oh, thank you Oh, thank you
Well, you know how one thing leads to another When I was...
Thank you
When I was over at your house there the other day, and I was climbing up and down that ladder, I tell you, I had a thought
Something else occurred to me, uh, that's been keeping me awake at night
Oh What might that be?
Well, I was, uh, wondering about that burnt-out bulb Oh in front of your house, and I went over there this morning to take a look at it, and...
You brought it with you
Oh, yeah I didn't think you'd mind No
Uh, this is a hundred-watt bulb Hundred watt?
Got a life of 750, 800 hours
Now, if your house is anything like my house, then you burn the outside light, uh, eight, 1 O hours a day
So that means it would last two, two and a half months
Is that right?
Yeah
I'll concede to your knowledge I don't know
Thank you very much
Uh, now this is what I got to thinking
I hate to change bulbs outside my house because no matter how tight I get that up in the lamp, you see, they attract a lot of dirt and guck, and they're full of dead bugs,
and I just don't even like to go up there and touch 'em
Would you get to the point?
Uh why is that bulb dirt and dust-free?
That bulb is clean as a whistle
[Clears Throat] Now, I think that's kind of strange, don't you?
Hanging there long enough to, uh, burn out, but not hanging there long enough to get dirty
We're a fastidious family
If the bulb is clean, it's because servants cleaned it
They cleaned a burnt-out bulb
They work in the daytime, so how would they know?
All right, Lieutenant I think that'll be enough
Beg your pardon?
I want you to listen to this very carefully
I don't ever want to see you again
You'll be refused admittance to my house and to this office
I have a great deal of work to do and I no longer can indulge your suspicions
If you think you have a case against me, go to the district attorney
Is that clear?
Yes
That's very clear Hmm
Oh...
I'm warning you
No more questions
I wasn't gonna ask a question, ma'am
I just wanted to return your bulb
[Door Closes]
[Yelling] What can we do about him?
[Crashing]
Beth, take it easy Calm down
Oh, stop saying "calm down"!
You're a lawyer Do something
I mean, we can institute some kind of proceedings against him
There must be somebody in city government who can do something
- Calm down Take it easy
- Well, is that your professional advice?
Beth, what in the world has gotten into you?
We never argued like this before
Oh
We're not arguing
Something's wrong What is it?
All right, there is Number one, uh, this business of arbitrarily promoting me lt...
To say the least, it smacks of high-level nepotism
It's, uh...
And I assume there's a number two
Yes, there is You announced our engagement without even letting me know
I thought it would please you
It did please me But don't you think you could have consulted with me?
I was just as surprised here as everybody else
[Scoffs]
Well, I-I did it for you
I mean, we-we are gonna get married, aren't we?
That's not the point
I would like to have had a hand in the decision
Now, it's not like you to act this way This is way out of character for you
Well, if I've changed, it's because I thought you'd like a more exciting woman
A change, yes, but a complete metamorphosis?
I'm not sure, Beth, you're the same person
[Chuckles] Maybe I'm not
Maybe Bryce was right About what?
About your being the wrong kind of man for me
[Door Opens]
[Door Closes]
[Piano]
What's that, the third?
I get paid not to count just keep 'em comin' That's all
Well, I didn't think you people were supposed to drink on duty
Oh, Mr Hamilton
Drink?
Oh, no, that's coffee
No, I don't drink
No, it's been a very long day
I can see it's been a long day for you too
Oh, it shows, huh?
Mmm
You know, it's quite a coincidence, uh, you and I both meeting in the same place like this
Yes, it is, isn't it?
Yeah
- What are you reading?
- Oh, this
This is a, uh, transcript of the inquest
Listen, congratulations I understand you're engaged
- Not necessarily
- Oh, really?
What happened?
Let's get back to this I want to ask you something
Lieutenant, why are you hounding Beth?
Hounding?
Who, me?
Oh, no I'm not hounding anybody Oh, no No
No, what I'm trying to do is get to the bottom of this thing
[Laughing] You know, Lieutenant,
I like you, I really do
But you are devious Devious?
Your job was finished with the coroner's verdict, but you're still hangin' around
You're still asking questions
You even managed to bump into me here
Now, Lieutenant, you don't really think that Beth killed her brother in cold blood, now, do you?
Well, as a matter of fact I do
Mr Hamilton, you asked me what I thought
Now I'm gonna tell you
I think she set it up I think it was deliberate
And I think you can help me prove it
Now, excuse me You're sure that that's coffee that you're drinking?
'Cause you're not making any sense I was there
I know Beth didn't kill anybody It was an accident
Can I tell you about my wife?
You know, my wife, she's got a proverb for every situation
You know, with her, a rolling stone gathers no moss, you gotta look before you leap...
I'm sure that your wife is a very nice woman, but what does that got to do with the case?
To be honest?
She solved it for me
We're havin'an argument last night, she says to me,
"You're puttin' the cart before the horse"
And I said, "Right"
In this case, the horse is before the cart, and I had the answer
And what was that?
In the transcript, you weren't very specific
I know I just read every word of it
But I think, on the night of the murder, you said something
If you can remember that...
and you tell me you got a terrific memory...
Mm-hmm then you know
You'll know for sure whether or not Beth Chadwick murdered her brother
All right And what do I remember?
[Flipping Pages]
Oh
[Door HandleJiggling]
Who is it?
Who's there?
Who's there?
Hello, operator?
Get me the police
Uh...
Operator?
Oh, operator, I'm sorry
Forget it
Lieutenant Columbo?
Is that you?
Come on, Lieutenant
Come in and have a drink
Lieutenant Columbo
This is the way your brother came in that night, isn't it?
How did you get in?
Same way your brother did...
with a spare key
One of my men located your locksmith
He was very cooperative
What do you expect to prove by this bit of nonsense?
I don't want to prove anything, ma'am I came to arrest you
[Laughs] Arrest me?
Yes, ma'am
For the murder of your brother Oh
And I did have a reason for coming in this way
I wanted to see the look on your face
Very well
I'll consider myself under arrest
And now I want to see the look on your face when I call my lawyer
You know what's ironic?
I knew it wasn't an accident the first night
I knew it as soon as I saw that newspaper, but I didn't have any proof
I had to wait for the proof
I had to wait for your fiancé to give it to me
From Peter?
Yes, ma'am
Although I don't think he meant to
You see, according to your story, you were asleep at night
The alarm woke you up, you reached for a gun, and you shot what you thought was a burglar
Which is exactly what happened Couldn't be
Because Mr Hamilton, who was driving up outside at the time, he heard both the shots and the alarm
Of course he did What difference does that make?
Oh, big difference
He heard the shots first, then the alarm
That's the cart before the horse
I mean, how could the alarm wake you if the shots came first?
You see, what really happened was your brother came walking in here just the way I did tonight, and you shot him, and then you set the alarm a few seconds later
Peter is mistaken
No, he's a very good lawyer and he prides himself on his memory
He won't like it, but he'll testify against you in court, ifhe has to
Along with the other holes in your story, I think they'll convict you
Now, really, you don't want to do that
Policemen outside What would be the point?
Besides, you're too classy a woman
Ma'am, will you get dressed now?
Take all the time you need
[Door Closes]
You can pour Mr Chadwick's coffee now, Charles.
Yes, ma'am.
Morning.
- Morning, Charles.
- Good morning.
Ah, thank you.
- Good morning, Beth.
- Hmm.
- Beth?
- Hm?
- You are sulking.
- What?
- You're sulking.
- I'm not sulking.
Of course you're sulking.
It isn't necessary.
We have had our usual argument and now the matter is settled.
Is it?
Beth, listen to me.
He isn't for you, believe me.
If you insist upon seeing him, I have a right to express my feelings.
- You can't control my life.
- Your life, in this case, is tied in with a company employee.
What difference does that make?
He's an honest, hardworking...
Yes.
He's ambitious, intelligent.
He's a good attorney.
And he has a flair for the advertising business.
And he's also smart enough to know a golden opportunity when he sees it.
You're not Father.
No, I'm not your father.
I'm your brother, and if your choice in men friends were more mature,
I would stay out of your life.
- You don't know how to stay out of my life.
- I won't let you be used.
So I've taken the appropriate steps.
- Charles, is the car ready?
- Appropriate steps?
Bryce!
What have you done?
I've written to Peter Hamilton.
He'll receive it when he gets back from Atlanta today.
What?
I told him that if he continues to see you, his employment with Ellison Chadwick will be terminated.
What?
You've threatened him?
I won't be home for dinner.
Don't wait for me.
He won't care if you fire him!
No?
Then let me ask you a question, Beth.
If your name wasn't Chadwick and you didn't have all of this... do you really think that Peter Hamilton would give you a second look?
Now, I'm sorry if I sound cruel.
I don't mean to be.
But the sooner you face the facts... the better.
And the cheaper it will be for all of us.
What about the price I've paid?
First to Father, then to you?
Anything I wanted to do on my own, you or he prevented it!
Beth, this is hardly the time.
No, it never is.
- Charles.
- Yes, Miss Chadwick?
- Tomorrow's your day off, isn't it?
- Yes, ma'am.
Will you be leaving tonight with the staff?
I'd planned to, ma'am, but if you'd like me to stay...
Oh, no.
That won't be necessary.
As you wish.
May I bring you more coffee?
Thank you, Charles, no.
That'll be all.
Hello?
Yes, operator.
Speaking.
Darling, how are you?
I'm going in to wheel and deal, thought I'd call you first.
Aw!
You always surprise me.
Better than being predictable, right?
- 'How's Atlanta?
'
- Oh, just fine.
Hey, I miss you.
I miss you too.
- When'll you be back?
- 'Later tonight. '
'Thought I'd come right over from the airport. '
- 'Darling?
Hello?
'
- Darling, let's make it tomorrow.
- 'It'll be late, you'll probably be tired. '
- Well...
Tomorrow'll be much better.
Mr Gaines will see you now.
Beth, gotta go.
Call you first thing in the morning.
- You do love me?
- No, I hate you with a passion.
Goodbye, darling.
Have a safe trip.
Beth?
Beth, are you awake?
Yes.
Who is it?
Will you open the front door?
I've lost my key.
I'm in bed already.
Come in this way.
- Are they unlocked?
- Yes.
Don't forget to turn off the alarm.
All right.
It's off.
Beth, why didn't you turn off the alarm?
'We found a key ring in the bushes.
Does it belong to your brother?
'
'Yes, those are...
Those were his keys. '
'The front light's burned out. '
'He must have dropped his keys and couldn't find them. '
'Probably walked to your French doors and knocked. '
'I was asleep.
I had taken sleeping pills and I didn't hear him. '
'We figure he broke the glass and opened the door. '
'I heard the glass and then the alarm go off. '
'I just woke up and reached for the gun. '
'I thought it was a burglar. '
'Obviously a mistake, Miss Chadwick. '
'A terrible mistake. '
- 'I thought it was a burglar. ' - 'A terrible mistake. '
'Mistake...
Mistake... '
Well, that does it.
- Beth?
- Bryce!
The most ridiculous thing happened.
I've lost my key to the front door.
- H-How did you get in?
- With this.
- A spare?
- I leave it in a flower pot by the door.
Why didn't you answer?
I was ringing...
Beth?
- Beth, what is it?
- I shot Bryce!
You what?
He came in my room as the alarm went off.
- Go and see.
I want to know if he's...
- All right.
Now, you stay here.
Stay right here.
Beth, he's dead.
'6-Mary-102, 2-Mary-11, clear. '
'Roger on the information.
Frequency 15, clear. ' '6-Mary-2 continuing... '
'Female, 45 years, 5'11", 190 pounds. '
- 'Highway 75.' - 'Channel 17, clear. '
You guys all finished?
OK, that's it.
You catching up on your reading, Lieutenant?
No, not really.
You realise what you...
Yes, I understand.
You then climbed over the gate and started running towards the house?
Well, I was half asleep because I'd taken a sleeping pill.
The burglar alarm was on?
Well, yes.
There's a switch beside my bed.
How does it work outside?
At the front door?
Well, if you have a key and use it, it automatically turns the alarm off.
Ah.
Do you have any idea why your brother went through your French doors knowing he'd probably set the alarm off?
I...
I guess he lost his keys and... he came around the side of the house and tried to get in... through my window.
What time did you go to bed tonight?
About 9:30.
I didn't feel very well yesterday so I didn't go out.
Excuse me.
Did I hear you say you stayed home today?
Yes, that's what I said.
- You didn't go out at all?
- No.
- That's what I said.
- Thank you.
When you got there, he was already dead?
Yes, that's correct.
Or did Miss Chadwick telephone you after she shot her brother?
I was on my way over.
I stopped at the gate when I heard the shots.
- How many?
- Three.
And the alarm was going?
That's right.
Why did you drop by, Mr Hamilton?
I came to see Bryce.
I work for him.
Can you account for your whereabouts this evening?
I came in from Atlanta at ten.
I took a cab and got to my apartment about 10:45.
You can check with the doorman.
Why did you come here after just getting home?
It's a little involved...
Miss Chadwick and I have been seeing each other and Bryce objected.
So you came over here to have it out with him?
I suppose you could put it that way.
- Is this your newspaper?
- No.
- We found these outside in the bushes.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Miss Chadwick, are these your brother's keys?
- Yes.
Where were they?
- In the bushes.
With that light out, it's really tough to see.
Gentlemen, you have our statements.
If you don't mind, I think...
I'd like to go through this once more to make sure I got things straight.
- Gentlemen, please.
- No, Peter, that's all right.
Go on.
Now, Miss Chadwick, you said you went to bed at 9:30, right?
Yes.
And you took a sleeping pill before you retired.
That's right.
Would you tell me what happened after that?
Well, it was after eleven... and I heard the glass break and the alarm go off and I woke up.
You thought it was a burglar?
Yes.
Yes, I thought it was a burglar.
Well, it was pitch dark and I was half asleep because I'd taken the sleeping pill.
I heard the glass break and the alarm go off and so I reached for the gun, it was in the drawer beside my bed, and then I just started shooting.
I didn't know what I was doing.
Gentlemen, we'll be available for questioning tomorrow.
I'd like to see that Miss Chadwick gets some rest.
Right.
All right, fellas, wrap it up.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
Come on, darling.
Excuse me.
Were you and your brother the only ones living here?
Well, yes, except for Charles and the maid.
My mother moved to Palm Desert after my father died.
- Who is Charles?
- The butler.
I suppose he's off tonight.
Yes.
Great big place, isn't it?
Well, good night.
Easy, boy.
Easy, fella.
Easy.
Easy!
Easy, now.
That's right.
No, no, no.
Enrico, darling.
Be nice, darling, be nice.
You there, pay the cab and bring my luggage.
Come on, dear.
She have any luggage?
Luggage?
Right here.
And there's 10.50 on that meter.
Gee, I've only got $11.
Well, go ahead.
Keep it all.
You're a sport.
All right, easy, boy.
Now, Enrico, come here, Come here.
Come here!
Now, stop that, you hear?
I want you to behave yourself.
That is a tough little monkey you got.
Enrico is not a monkey.
He's a pedigree silky.
Oh, I can see that, ma'am.
It's just a figure of speech.
Now, you stay there.
Where is my daughter?
I don't know, ma'am.
She's probably asleep.
Where's Charles?
It's his day off.
Are you Mrs Chadwick?
Yes.
And you?
My name is Columbo, ma'am.
I'm a lieutenant from the police.
Just a minute.
Not so quickly.
I'd like to look that over.
Well, I must say, you hardly look the role.
Well, you know how it is.
You brought my bags in?
Yes, ma'am.
The cab fare was $10.50.
It was a 50-cent tip, so that's $11.
I'll see that you're reimbursed.
Now, tell me, what happened?
- Where is she?
- Here I am, Mother.
- Do you feel better now?
- No.
- It was an accident.
- I don't care what it was.
- You killed my son.
- Mother...
Oh, you were always so impossible.
Always.
Blundering, making mistakes, causing trouble wherever you were.
He looked after her... all of her life.
He protected you...
and now you've destroyed him.
Mother, it wasn't my fault.
I don't want to hear about it.
Sorry, Lieutenant.
This must be embarrassing for you.
No, not really, no.
You see, I come from a very big family and at dinner time it was like, well, Madison Square Garden.
- We used to patch it up with coffee.
- Is that a hint?
I smelled it when I came in.
I sure could use some.
Mother?
I should think it's obvious I'm in no mood for coffee.
Uh, ma'am, would you like me to take your bags upstairs?
No, thank you.
Beth can attend to them.
He was a special man, Lieutenant.
Very special.
He kept us all together.
I thought you lived in Palm Desert.
I mean spiritually.
When my husband died...
I couldn't stay in this house any longer.
That's certainly understandable.
Then your son took over the business?
Yes, and turned it into one of the largest advertising agencies on the West Coast.
Really?
Marvellous.
He took over from my husband in many ways, including dealing with Beth and her problems.
Her choice of men, when she's had a choice, has never been particularly mature.
Oh, yeah.
Like that Peter Hamilton.
Exactly.
He's an obvious fortune-hunter.
Of course, she'd have no way of seeing through him, would she?
I'm afraid not.
She's something of a child, Lieutenant.
Her decisions are always vague and emotional.
Bryce was far more perceptive.
He never married.
Why was that?
- What are you implying?
- No offence, ma'am.
He seems very distinctive and unique and I was curious about him.
Well, he was.
But he had far too many responsibilities for marriage and I suppose he never met the right woman.
Then there was the business.
I don't know what's going to happen to the company now.
I can't run it and I don't want to bring anyone in from the outside.
- You won't have to.
- And what does that mean?
- I am an officer of the company.
- In name only.
That's because Bryce would never let me participate.
Of course he wouldn't.
You aren't even capable of running your own life.
I've never been allowed to run my own life.
- Lieutenant, won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
But things are different now, aren't they?
There's a change in the status quo.
If you seriously think...
We're not alone, Mother.
I suggest we discuss this later.
Lieutenant, I've kept you waiting long enough.
What can I do for you?
Oh, no, no, no.
That's all right.
No, I only have one problem, and that is...
Thank you.
- Cream?
Sugar?
- No, I take it black, thank you.
I couldn't sleep last night.
A couple of points were bothering me, so I thought I'd clear them up.
- What kind of points?
- Thank you.
That newspaper.
Newspaper?
Yes, the one that I noticed on the table in the foyer.
Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't I hear you say that you were home all day yesterday?
That's right.
That's what puzzles me.
How did that newspaper get there?
- Haven't you ever heard of home delivery?
- Oh, yeah.
- I have a paper delivered every morning.
- There's your answer.
No.
No, that won't answer it, no.
The newspaper on the foyer table was a late edition.
I even saw racetrack results in it.
I don't quite follow you.
If you were home all day, who brought home the newspaper?
Bryce must have brought it home.
But he came in through your room, not through the front door.
He was shot on that side of the house.
How did that newspaper get to the other end of the house?
You seem to be cross-examining my daughter.
That's all right, Mother.
Bryce must have brought it in and in my confusion I put it on the table when I went to answer the door.
Yes, that would be an answer, except for one thing.
You left your brother's attaché case out there.
Why wouldn't you bring them both in at the same time?
I didn't see it.
You didn't see it.
Gee.
They couldn't have been too far apart.
People are inconsistent when in a state of shock, Lieutenant.
It's foolish of you to expect rational behaviour at a time like that.
Well, I'm sure you're right about this.
I only get into it because I try to figure it out in my mind.
Uh, well, look, I'm sure both of you have a great deal to talk about so I'm gonna run along.
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.
Um... listen, about that $11, ma'am...
If you'll leave me your card, I'll send you a cheque.
I'm all out of cards.
Oh.
Here.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
Easy, now.
Easy!
That'd be just terrific.
The jury's coming in now.
Have you ladies and gentlemen concluded your deliberations?
- Yes, sir, we have.
- Clerk.
Thank you.
What do you think?
- What?
- She's home free.
You watch.
Jupiter and Venus are in good aspect with Pluto.
I have before me the verdict of the coroner's jury in the matter of Bryce Chadwick, deceased.
The jury finds that Bryce Chadwick, age 46, came to his death July 21st at his residence,
2307 Lorraine Drive, death being caused by three .38 calibre bullet wounds in the upper chest.
The jury also finds from the evidence submitted that the death of Bryce Chadwick was an accident.
- Thank you very much.
Thank you.
- Good luck.
See?
Thank you, jury members.
This inquest is now closed.
Nice to be believed, isn't it, huh?
Yes.
I want to take the whole jury out for dinner!
That is what is known as bribery after the fact.
- Oh, is it?
- Anyway, it's all over.
Back to normal.
That's exactly what I don't want.
What do you mean?
I think it's time we made a few changes, that I broke a few patterns.
As long as you don't break ours.
How about some lunch to celebrate?
Can I take a rain check?
I have a few appointments.
- You don't mind, do you?
- No, it's fine.
Oh, when you get back to the office would you set up a meeting with the heads of departments?
- What's the agenda?
- Reorganisation.
Tomorrow at 2:00.
Mother.
- Good morning, Mr Hamilton.
- Oh.
Lieutenant.
- You remember me?
- I have a very good memory.
I envy you.
I can't even remember my telephone number.
What can I do for you, Lieutenant?
I couldn't help overhearing that she turned you down for lunch.
You wanna grab a bite with me?
- You want to ask me some questions?
- Well...
Listen, it's my treat.
Your...
All right.
Window down, please.
Oh!
Right.
That's it.
I held the whipped cream on the Mighty Malt.
- That's what you wanted?
- Right.
OK.
And they were out of onion rings.
You want a substitution?
No, that's all right.
No, that's fine.
Don't forget to tell me before you leave.
I need to take the tray.
- People always drive off with our trays.
- Right.
I'll remember.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Right.
Tell me, you and Miss Chadwick are gonna be married?
You don't believe in preliminaries.
Well, you know, sometimes it's just...
Yes, we are but we haven't set the date yet, mainly because of Bryce.
Oh, I see.
You know, what I was wondering was... the night of the shooting, why'd you drive over there so late?
Let's say the propulsion was anger.
Huh?
What do you mean?
I got back from a business trip and there was a letter from Bryce.
He said to lay off Beth or else.
Or else?
Or else what?
Oh, it's...
Professional discrimination.
Things like that.
So I got hot and I went over to have it out with him.
I see.
Boy, you got there just in time for the commotion.
That's quite a coincidence, isn't it?
That's a leading question, Lieutenant.
Do you think that the two of us did Bryce in together?
What do you mean, murder?
Oh, no.
I mean, you were at the inquest.
They said it was an accident.
I'm not talking about the inquest.
I'm talking about you.
What do you think?
Do I think it was a conspiracy?
No, no.
Oh, no.
No chance of that.
No, sir.
It's rather odd that you're still asking the same questions.
Oh, you know...
Well, that's just me.
You know, I mean, nothing official.
It's just that, you know, I have this...
bug about tying up loose ends.
Listen, I wanna thank you.
You've been very helpful to me.
Suppose you ask the question that you haven't asked.
- If I'm a fortune-hunter.
- I never intended...
I'm not.
I love Beth with her money or without her money.
As a matter of fact, I was prepared to quit the company.
That won't be necessary now.
No, that won't, but I won't be a hypocrite, Lieutenant.
I'm sorry about poor Bryce being killed but... it has gotten Beth out from under his thumb.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, way out.
Huh?
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Way out?
Well, you know, in the courtroom I overheard her say that she was breaking patterns now.
This is a terrible thing to admit but...
I think that, in a way... her brother's death is the best thing that ever happened to her.
Hey, mister!
You forgot the tray!
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
May I assist you, sir?
You scared me.
No, I was looking for Miss...
You're Charles, aren't you?
Are we acquainted?
I saw you at the inquest.
No, I'm Lieutenant Columbo.
I'm looking for Miss Chadwick.
- You're a police officer, sir?
- Yes, I am.
- Is she in?
- I'm afraid not, sir.
Oh, she isn't?
I see.
Do you know where I can get in touch with her?
- Yes, she's at the beauty parlour.
Eugene's.
- A-ha.
- Will that be all, sir?
- Yes, Charles.
Yeah, I think so.
Uh...
- Hey, smells new.
- It is, sir.
- Oh.
Why didn't she take it with her?
- It was just delivered.
Ah, it was just delivered.
I see.
I wanna tell you, it's a beauty.
- A wonderful piece of machinery.
- Is that all, sir?
Yeah, Charles, that'll be all.
I don't want you to worry about me.
I'm gonna go around the side of the house and conduct an experiment.
Something I can help you with, sir?
No, it's a kind of a do-it-yourself thing.
Thank you very much.
May I help you, sir?
Well, I'm not a customer.
No, I assumed that.
You're looking for someone?
Yes, I was looking for a Beth Chadwick.
Miss Chadwick?
My name's Lieutenant Columbo.
- The police?
- Well, it's not serious.
I just want to talk to her for a moment.
Through that door, Lieutenant.
Cubicle four.
- Thank you.
- Lieutenant?
- Your cigar.
- What about it?
Uh...
Well, the fragrance is not...
compatible.
That's a shame.
I just lit it.
Well, what brings you here, Lieutenant?
Oh, I stopped by the house.
I talked to Charles, he told me where you'd be so I thought I'd come by.
There's just one point that I wanted to clear up.
- Do you mind?
- I'm a captive audience!
- We can go.
- No, that's all right.
Go ahead and finish.
Saw your new car, by the way.
Oh, that's some automobile.
- Thank you.
- Really beautiful.
Do you have to order those things weeks in advance?
- Yes.
- That's what I thought.
Real change of pace for you, isn't it?
I felt like something racy.
As they say in advertising, a new image.
Yeah.
Well, I can understand that.
I'm sorry.
Because it's a natural thing,
I think, after a death in the family to want to break loose.
That's one way of putting it.
Gee, that's funny, though.
What?
If you ordered the car some time ago that'd mean you knew in advance you were gonna change your style.
Finished, Miss Chadwick.
- May I see?
- Yes.
Oh!
- Wow!
Just amazing!
- Looks fabulous.
Fabulous.
- You look sensational!
- You really think so?
I'd say you were a new woman.
Oh, thank you, Lieutenant.
Goodbye, Gene.
Thank you.
See you next week.
Bye, Felicia.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Why, Miss Chadwick, you look lovely.
Thank you.
You're very kind.
- My bill and an appointment next week.
- Certainly.
Lieutenant, you haven't asked me your question.
- Are you headed home?
- Yes.
Do you mind if I meet you there?
It's to do with your house.
- Is this really necessary?
- In a way, yes.
I promise it won't take long.
All right.
I'll meet you there.
Lieutenant?
Your cigar.
Oh, good afternoon, ma'am.
Good afternoon.
Oh, Charles, our lieutenant requires a stepladder.
Would you be good enough to get one for him?
Yes, ma'am.
Another experiment, sir?
Well, I guess you could call it that, yeah.
- Experiment, Lieutenant?
- Uh-huh.
Like I said, I was out here earlier.
Hey, why don't I show it to you?
Now... you figure that your brother had to walk around the side of the house like this.
- Is that right?
- Yes, and the coroner's jury figured it too.
Right.
Now, you see, he had to walk on grass.
- Is there some point to this?
- Yes, ma'am, there is.
You see, now this grass is kind of dry because the sun's been out.
Uh...
But today's Thursday.
And the gardener cuts the grass on Thursday.
Excuse me a minute.
You see?
Grass.
Yes, well, that's only natural.
It certainly is.
But, you know, there was no grass on your brother's shoe.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Your brother was shot a week ago, on Thursday.
I looked at the photographs of the body and for the life of me I just couldn't see any grass on the soles of his shoe.
And I couldn't figure that out.
Why?
It was freshly cut and it was sticky as it was at night and there was dew.
That's very good.
He must have had particles of grass on his shoes but they were probably brushed off on the carpet and, unfortunately, the room's been cleaned.
Yeah.
I know.
Well, unless there's something else...
Just one more thing.
I guess Charles has the stepladder by now.
- I would think.
- Yeah.
All right, then.
The other morning when I was over here I noticed these potted plants.
- How observant.
- They're very pretty, you know.
But I got to thinking, "Sometimes people keep a spare key outside"
"just in case they forget their own key. "
Do you see this?
What?
- This imprint here.
- Yes.
What about it?
Well, that's like a fossil or something.
A spare key must have been hidden in there for a long time.
You see, that's been rained on and everything.
There was a spare key.
Oh?
I put it there when the alarm was installed.
Bryce didn't know about it.
I also removed it recently because I had second thoughts.
What do you mean by second thoughts?
If a burglar were on the premises, he might find the key
- and then what good would the alarm be?
- Good point.
Yes.
Hey, yeah.
I was right, wasn't I?
Because you found it.
Yeah, I guess I did.
I think you've overstayed your welcome.
The official verdict is death by accidental means and that should satisfy you.
Ma'am, I don't mean any offence.
I'm just trying to tie up loose ends.
I'm compulsive that way.
That's what my wife says about it.
Are you really?
No, I mean, all I meant by that was that...
- You see, if there was a key there...
- Yes?
and if Bryce knew about it then he would use the key to let himself in through the front door.
But I told the truth the night it happened and I told the truth at the inquest.
So whatever your little compulsions may be, I'm afraid I must insist you leave me alone.
Oh, uh...
Goodbye.
I'll take it all.
Yeah?
- Well, is that it?
- No, I haven't finished.
- You're not bored, are you?
- No.
I'm having a wonderful time.
- Is there something young and bright?
- This one?
- Oh, that's marvellous.
- Excuse us.
Don't forget to put my hat over by the black baggage.
Bring it with me.
It'll look great.
- Could you get the zipper?
Peter!
- Yes.
Everybody set for this afternoon's meeting?
Yes, but I was wondering, Beth.
Uh... don't you think it's a little premature?
Perhaps another week for things to ease up.
No!
It must be today.
All right.
It's up to you.
Well, what do you think?
Interesting.
What does that mean?
Well, it's wild.
It's a little out of your style, isn't it?
No, I don't think it is.
Well, you asked.
Hey, it was a courtesy.
I'm perfectly capable of making my own decisions.
Oh, what is that silver dress over there on the rail?
And this one!
This matches it.
You finish your wardrobe.
I'm going back to the office.
No.
I want you to wait till I'm ready to go.
Do you have trousers that go with the red top?
I'm not sure what's gotten into you but...
I'm not sure I like it.
I'll see you.
If you need me, I'll be back at the office.
Did you want to try this on?
Yes, this one and that blue dress, please.
OK.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Will you please take your seats?
Well, now, we've all been through a period of anxiety and indecision since my brother's death.
But in a corporate sense, we must maintain our continuity.
As you all well know, this is a family-owned firm.
Therefore, as of today, I am assuming the presidency.
As my first order of business...
I would like to announce the elevation of Mr Peter Hamilton to executive vice-president in charge of accounts.
As to philosophy, my brother was a traditionalist.
I want to break new ground.
Would you pass these along, please?
I want to streamline.
We're gonna cut down marginal accounts and start promoting ourselves for a change.
Seems to me we sell everything but our own product.
Beth, forgive me, but that is our job.
Forgive me, but it's not.
Our job is to grow.
When was the last time this agency took on a new account?
- We have all we can handle.
- Nonsense!
- I don't want to be difficult...
- I don't mean to interrupt but this is really not the time for negative thinking.
If you disagree with my approach, you're free to sever your relationship with the firm.
No, Beth, I feel that I can accommodate myself to your way of thinking.
Yes, I'm sure you can.
Any questions?
Very well.
We'll adjourn.
Oh, one more thing.
A happy and personal note.
I'd like to announce my engagement to Mr Hamilton.
Thank you.
Are those letters for me to sign?
- Congratulations, Peter.
- Yeah.
Right.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
You must be out of your mind.
What qualifies you to run this company?
I had a very good teacher - my brother.
I've been studying his reports for years and asking questions.
Thank you.
We'll finish later.
He may not have known it but he was grooming me.
Well, don't forget, I am the majority stockholder,
I will not relinquish control.
Don't be naive.
Who else can take over and still keep it in the family?
I'm prepared to go to court if necessary and you know that means - publicity, interviews, scandal.
I can't believe you're talking to me like this.
Are you prepared to take over the company?
You're getting old, Mother, or hadn't you noticed?
Come in.
- Am I interrupting something?
- What do you want?
Well, I just thought that...
Why, hello there, fella!
How you doing?
I got a treat for you.
I got a little something for him.
Here you are.
I've been carrying these things around with me all week.
Come here, boy.
Come on.
Take one of these.
Look at that.
Come on.
Come on.
Oh, easy.
Easy.
I think we have a personality conflict.
Do you need me for anything, Lieutenant?
Come here.
No, ma'am.
No, I don't think so.
Then I'll be leaving.
Mother.
We'll go into this later.
As you wish.
I'll leave the two of you alone.
No, that's all right, Peter.
The lieutenant is going to be brief.
Oh.
What is it now?
We've talked about keys and grass and newspapers.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you.
You know how one thing leads to another.
Over at your house there the other day, when I was climbing that ladder, I had a thought.
Something else occurred to me that's been keeping me awake at night.
What might that be?
I was wondering about that burnt-out bulb in front of your house and I went over there this morning to take a look at it...
You brought it with you!
- Yeah.
I didn't think you'd mind.
- No.
Uh... this is a 100-watt bulb. 100 watt?
Got a life of 750, 800 hours.
Now, if your house is anything like my house, then you burn the outside light eight, 10 hours a day so that means it'd last two, two and a half months.
Is that right?
Yeah.
I'll concede to your knowledge.
I don't know.
Thank you very much.
Now this is what I got to thinking.
I hate to change bulbs outside my house because no matter how tight I put it in, they attract a lot of dirt and guck and they're full of dead bugs and I don't like to go up there and touch 'em.
Would you get to the point?
Uh... why is that bulb dirt and dust-free?
That bulb is clean as a whistle.
I think that's kind of strange.
Hanging there long enough to burn out but not hanging there long enough to get dirty.
We're a fastidious family.
If the bulb is clean, it's because servants cleaned it.
They cleaned a burnt-out bulb.
They work in the daytime so how would they know?
All right, Lieutenant, that'll be enough.
- Pardon?
- Listen to this very carefully.
I don't ever want to see you again.
You'll be refused admittance to my house and office.
I have work to do and I no longer can indulge your suspicions.
If you think you have a case against me, go to the district attorney.
Is that clear?
Yes.
That's very clear.
I'm warning you, no more questions.
I wasn't gonna ask a question, ma'am.
I just wanted to return your bulb.
What can we do about him?
Beth, take it easy.
Calm down.
Oh, stop saying calm down!
You're a lawyer.
Do something!
We can institute some kind of proceedings against him.
There must be somebody who can do something!
- Take it easy.
- Is that your professional advice?
Beth, what in the world has gotten into you?
We never argued like this before.
We're not arguing.
Something's wrong.
What is it?
There is.
Number one, this business of arbitrarily promoting me.
To say the least, it smacks of high-level nepotism.
And I assume there's a number two.
Yes.
You announced our engagement without telling me.
- I thought it would please you.
- It did.
But don't you think you could have consulted me?
I was just as surprised as everybody else.
Well, I did it for you.
I mean, we are gonna get married?
That's not the point.
I would like to have had a hand in the decision.
It's not like you to act this way.
This is way out of character for you.
If I've changed, it's because I thought you'd like a more exciting woman.
A change, yes, but a complete metamorphosis?
I'm not sure, Beth, you're the same person.
Maybe I'm not.
- Maybe Bryce was right.
- About what?
About your being the wrong kind of man for me.
- What's that, the third?
- I get paid not to count.
Just keep 'em coming.
That's all.
Well, I didn't think you people were supposed to drink on duty.
Oh, Mr Hamilton.
Drink?
Oh, no, that's coffee.
No, I don't drink.
No, it's been a very long day.
- I can see it's been a long day for you too.
- Oh, it shows, huh?
You know, it's quite a coincidence you and I both meeting in the same place like this.
Yes, it is, isn't it?
Yeah.
- What are you reading?
- Oh, this.
This is a... transcript of the inquest.
Congratulations.
I understand you're engaged.
- Not necessarily.
- Oh, really?
What happened?
Let's get back to this.
I want to ask you something.
Lieutenant, why are you hounding Beth?
Hounding?
Who, me?
Oh, no.
I'm not hounding anybody.
Oh, no.
No, what I'm trying to do is get to the bottom of this thing.
You know, Lieutenant, I like you.
I really do.
- But you are devious.
- Devious?
Your job was finished with the coroner's verdict but you're still here, asking questions.
You even managed to bump into me here.
Now, Lieutenant, you don't really think that Beth killed her brother in cold blood, now, do you?
Well, as a matter of fact...
I do.
Mr Hamilton, you asked me what I thought.
Now I'm gonna tell you.
I think she set it up.
I think it was deliberate.
And I think you can help me prove it.
You're sure that's coffee you're drinking?
Cos you're not making any sense.
I was there.
Beth didn't kill anybody.
It was an accident.
Can I tell you about my wife?
You know, my wife, she's got a proverb for every situation.
A rolling stone gathers no moss, you gotta look before you leap...
I'm sure your wife is very nice but what has that got to do with the case?
To be honest?
She solved it for me.
We're having an argument and she says, "You're putting the cart before the horse,"
and I said, "Right. "
In this case, the horse is before the cart and I had the answer.
And what was that?
In the transcript, you weren't very specific.
I know.
I just read every word of it.
But on the night of the murder you said something.
If you can remember that, and you tell me you got a terrific memory, then you'll know for sure whether or not Beth Chadwick murdered her brother.
All right.
And what do I remember?
Oh...
Who is it?
Who's there?
Who's there?
Hello, operator?
Get me the police.
Uh...
Operator?
Oh, operator, I'm sorry.
Forget it.
Lieutenant Columbo?
Is that you?
Come on, Lieutenant.
Come in and have a drink.
Lieutenant Columbo.
This is the way your brother came in, isn't it?
How did you get in?
Same way your brother did, with a spare key.
One of my men located your locksmith.
He was very cooperative.
What do you expect to prove by this bit of nonsense?
I don't want to prove anything.
I came to arrest you.
- Arrest me?
- Yes, ma'am.
For the murder of your brother.
I did have a reason for coming in this way.
I wanted to see the look on your face.
Very well.
I'll consider myself under arrest.
Now I want to see the look on your face when I call my lawyer.
You know what's ironic?
I knew it wasn't an accident the first night.
I knew as soon as I saw that newspaper but I didn't have any proof.
I had to wait for the proof.
I had to wait for your fiancé to give it to me.
- From Peter?
- Yes, ma'am.
I don't think he meant to.
According to your story, you were asleep.
The alarm woke you, you reached for a gun and you shot what you thought was a burglar.
- Which is exactly what happened.
- Couldn't be.
Because Mr Hamilton, who was outside at the time, heard both the shots and the alarm.
Of course he did.
What difference does that make?
Oh, big difference.
He heard the shots first... then the alarm.
That's the cart before the horse.
I mean, how could the alarm wake you if the shots came first?
You see, what really happened was your brother came walking in here, just the way I did tonight, and you shot him and then you set the alarm a few seconds later.
Peter is mistaken.
No, he's a very good lawyer and he prides himself on his memory.
He won't like it but he'll testify against you in court if he has to.
Along with other holes in your story, I think they'll convict you.
Now, you don't want to do that.
Policemen outside.
What would be the point?
Besides, you're too classy a woman.
Ma'am, would you get dressed now?
Take all the time you need.
You can pour Mr Chadwick's coffee now, Charles.
Yes, ma'am.
Morning.
- Morning, Charles.
- Good morning.
Ah, thank you.
- Good morning, Beth.
- Hmm.
- Beth?
- Hm?
- You are sulking.
- What?
- You're sulking.
- I'm not sulking.
Of course you're sulking.
It isn't necessary.
We have had our usual argument and now the matter is settled.
Is it?
Beth, listen to me.
He isn't for you, believe me.
If you insist upon seeing him, I have a right to express my feelings.
- You can't control my life.
- Your life, in this case, is tied in with a company employee.
What difference does that make?
He's an honest, hardworking...
Yes.
He's ambitious, intelligent.
He's a good attorney.
And he has a flair for the advertising business.
And he's also smart enough to know a golden opportunity when he sees it.
You're not Father.
No, I'm not your father.
I'm your brother, and if your choice in men friends were more mature,
I would stay out of your life.
- You don't know how to stay out of my life.
- I won't let you be used.
So I've taken the appropriate steps.
- Charles, is the car ready?
- Appropriate steps?
Bryce!
What have you done?
I've written to Peter Hamilton.
He'll receive it when he gets back from Atlanta today.
What?
I told him that if he continues to see you, his employment with Ellison Chadwick will be terminated.
What?
You've threatened him?
I won't be home for dinner.
Don't wait for me.
He won't care if you fire him!
No?
Then let me ask you a question, Beth.
If your name wasn't Chadwick and you didn't have all of this... do you really think that Peter Hamilton would give you a second look?
Now, I'm sorry if I sound cruel.
I don't mean to be.
But the sooner you face the facts... the better.
And the cheaper it will be for all of us.
What about the price I've paid?
First to Father, then to you?
Anything I wanted to do on my own, you or he prevented it!
Beth, this is hardly the time.
No, it never is.
- Charles.
- Yes, Miss Chadwick?
- Tomorrow's your day off, isn't it?
- Yes, ma'am.
Will you be leaving tonight with the staff?
I'd planned to, ma'am, but if you'd like me to stay...
Oh, no.
That won't be necessary.
As you wish.
May I bring you more coffee?
Thank you, Charles, no.
That'll be all.
(Phone)
Hello?
Yes, operator.
Speaking.
Darling, how are you?
I'm going in to wheel and deal, thought I'd call you first.
Aw!
You always surprise me.
Better than being predictable, right?
- 'How's Atlanta?
'
- Oh, just fine.
Hey, I miss you.
I miss you too.
- When'll you be back?
- 'Later tonight.'
'Thought I'd come right over from the airport.'
- 'Darling?
Hello?
'
- Darling, let's make it tomorrow.
- 'It'll be late, you'll probably be tired.'
- Well...
Tomorrow'll be much better.
Mr Gaines will see you now.
Beth, gotta go.
Call you first thing in the morning.
- You do love me?
- No, I hate you with a passion.
Goodbye, darling.
Have a safe trip.
(Blows kisses)
(Doorbell)
(Tapping) Beth?
Beth, are you awake?
Yes.
Who is it?
Will you open the front door?
I've lost my key.
I'm in bed already.
Come in this way.
- Are they unlocked?
- Yes.
Don't forget to turn off the alarm.
All right.
It's off.
(Alarm rings)
Beth, why didn't you turn off the alarm?
(Man) 'We found a key ring in the bushes.
Does it belong to your brother?
'
'Yes, those are...
Those were his keys.'
(2nd man) 'The front light's burned out.'
'He must have dropped his keys and couldn't find them.'
'Probably walked to your French doors and knocked.'
'I was asleep.
I had taken sleeping pills and I didn't hear him.'
'We figure he broke the glass and opened the door.'
'I heard the glass and then the alarm go off.'
'I just woke up and reached for the gun.'
'I thought it was a burglar.'
'Obviously a mistake, Miss Chadwick.'
'A terrible mistake.'
- 'I thought it was a burglar.' - 'A terrible mistake.'
(Echoing) 'Mistake...
Mistake...'
(Cars hooting)
(Humming)
Well, that does it.
(Doorbell)
(Tyres screech)
- Beth?
- (Gasps) Bryce!
The most ridiculous thing happened.
I've lost my key to the front door.
- H-How did you get in?
- With this.
- A spare?
- I leave it in a flower pot by the door.
Why didn't you answer?
I was ringing...
(Alarm continues ringing)
(Doorbell)
(Doorbell)
Beth?
- Beth, what is it?
- I shot Bryce!
You what?
He came in my room as the alarm went off.
- Go and see.
I want to know if he's...
- All right.
Now, you stay here.
Stay right here.
Beth, he's dead.
(Police radio) '6-Mary-102, 2-Mary-11, clear.'
'Roger on the information.
Frequency 15, clear.' '6-Mary-2 continuing...'
'Female, 45 years, 5'11", 190 pounds.'
- 'Highway 75.' - 'Channel 17, clear.'
You guys all finished?
OK, that's it.
You catching up on your reading, Lieutenant?
No, not really.
(Man) You realise what you... (Beth) Yes, I understand.
(lndistinct chatter)
(Man) You then climbed over the gate and started running towards the house?
Well, I was half asleep because I'd taken a sleeping pill.
The burglar alarm was on?
Well, yes.
There's a switch beside my bed.
How does it work outside?
At the front door?
Well, if you have a key and use it, it automatically turns the alarm off.
Ah.
Do you have any idea why your brother went through your French doors knowing he'd probably set the alarm off?
I...
I guess he lost his keys and... he came around the side of the house and tried to get in... through my window.
What time did you go to bed tonight?
About 9:30.
I didn't feel very well yesterday so I didn't go out.
Excuse me.
Did I hear you say you stayed home today?
Yes, that's what I said.
- You didn't go out at all?
- No.
- That's what I said.
- Thank you.
(Man) When you got there, he was already dead?
Yes, that's correct.
Or did Miss Chadwick telephone you after she shot her brother?
I was on my way over.
I stopped at the gate when I heard the shots.
- How many?
- Three.
And the alarm was going?
That's right.
Why did you drop by, Mr Hamilton?
I came to see Bryce.
I work for him.
Can you account for your whereabouts this evening?
I came in from Atlanta at ten.
I took a cab and got to my apartment about 10:45.
You can check with the doorman.
Why did you come here after just getting home?
It's a little involved...
Miss Chadwick and I have been seeing each other and Bryce objected.
So you came over here to have it out with him?
I suppose you could put it that way.
- Is this your newspaper?
- No.
- We found these outside in the bushes.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
Miss Chadwick, are these your brother's keys?
- Yes.
Where were they?
- In the bushes.
With that light out, it's really tough to see.
Gentlemen, you have our statements.
If you don't mind, I think...
I'd like to go through this once more to make sure I got things straight.
- Gentlemen, please.
- No, Peter, that's all right.
Go on.
Now, Miss Chadwick, you said you went to bed at 9:30, right?
Yes.
And you took a sleeping pill before you retired.
That's right.
Would you tell me what happened after that?
Well, it was after eleven... and I heard the glass break and the alarm go off and I woke up.
You thought it was a burglar?
Yes.
Yes, I thought it was a burglar.
Well, it was pitch dark and I was half asleep because I'd taken the sleeping pill.
I heard the glass break and the alarm go off and so I reached for the gun, it was in the drawer beside my bed, and then I just started shooting.
I didn't know what I was doing.
Gentlemen, we'll be available for questioning tomorrow.
I'd like to see that Miss Chadwick gets some rest.
Right.
All right, fellas, wrap it up.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
Come on, darling.
Excuse me.
Were you and your brother the only ones living here?
Well, yes, except for Charles and the maid.
My mother moved to Palm Desert after my father died.
- Who is Charles?
- The butler.
I suppose he's off tonight.
Yes.
Great big place, isn't it?
Well, good night.
(Door closes)
- (Yaps)
- Easy, boy.
Easy, fella.
Easy.
Easy!
Easy, now.
That's right.
No, no, no.
Enrico, darling.
Be nice, darling, be nice.
You there, pay the cab and bring my luggage.
Come on, dear.
She have any luggage?
Luggage?
Right here.
And there's 10.50 on that meter.
Gee, I've only got $11.
Well, go ahead.
Keep it all.
You're a sport.
(Engine starts, taxi drives away)
(Yaps)
All right, easy, boy.
Now, Enrico, come here, Come here.
Come here!
Now, stop that, you hear?
I want you to behave yourself.
That is a tough little monkey you got.
Enrico is not a monkey.
He's a pedigree silky.
Oh, I can see that, ma'am.
It's just a figure of speech.
Now, you stay there.
Where is my daughter?
I don't know, ma'am.
She's probably asleep.
Where's Charles?
It's his day off.
Are you Mrs Chadwick?
Yes.
And you?
My name is Columbo, ma'am.
I'm a lieutenant from the police.
Just a minute.
Not so quickly.
I'd like to look that over.
Well, I must say, you hardly look the role.
Well, you know how it is.
You brought my bags in?
Yes, ma'am.
The cab fare was $10.50.
It was a 50-cent tip, so that's $11.
I'll see that you're reimbursed.
Now, tell me, what happened?
- Where is she?
- Here I am, Mother.
- Do you feel better now?
- No.
- It was an accident.
- I don't care what it was.
- You killed my son.
- Mother...
Oh, you were always so impossible.
Always.
Blundering, making mistakes, causing trouble wherever you were.
He looked after her... all of her life.
He protected you...
and now you've destroyed him.
Mother, it wasn't my fault.
I don't want to hear about it.
Sorry, Lieutenant.
This must be embarrassing for you.
No, not really, no.
You see, I come from a very big family and at dinner time it was like, well, Madison Square Garden.
- We used to patch it up with coffee.
- Is that a hint?
I smelled it when I came in.
I sure could use some.
Mother?
I should think it's obvious I'm in no mood for coffee.
Uh, ma'am, would you like me to take your bags upstairs?
No, thank you.
Beth can attend to them.
He was a special man, Lieutenant.
Very special.
He kept us all together.
I thought you lived in Palm Desert.
I mean spiritually.
When my husband died...
I couldn't stay in this house any longer.
That's certainly understandable.
Then your son took over the business?
Yes, and turned it into one of the largest advertising agencies on the West Coast.
Really?
Marvellous.
He took over from my husband in many ways, including dealing with Beth and her problems.
Her choice of men, when she's had a choice, has never been particularly mature.
Oh, yeah.
Like that Peter Hamilton.
Exactly.
He's an obvious fortune-hunter.
Of course, she'd have no way of seeing through him, would she?
I'm afraid not.
She's something of a child, Lieutenant.
Her decisions are always vague and emotional.
Bryce was far more perceptive.
He never married.
Why was that?
- What are you implying?
- No offence, ma'am.
He seems very distinctive and unique and I was curious about him.
Well, he was.
But he had far too many responsibilities for marriage and I suppose he never met the right woman.
Then there was the business.
I don't know what's going to happen to the company now.
I can't run it and I don't want to bring anyone in from the outside.
- You won't have to.
- And what does that mean?
- I am an officer of the company.
- In name only.
That's because Bryce would never let me participate.
Of course he wouldn't.
You aren't even capable of running your own life.
I've never been allowed to run my own life.
- Lieutenant, won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
But things are different now, aren't they?
There's a change in the status quo.
If you seriously think...
We're not alone, Mother.
I suggest we discuss this later.
Lieutenant, I've kept you waiting long enough.
What can I do for you?
Oh, no, no, no.
That's all right.
No, I only have one problem, and that is...
Thank you.
- Cream?
Sugar?
- No, I take it black, thank you.
I couldn't sleep last night.
A couple of points were bothering me, so I thought I'd clear them up.
- What kind of points?
- Thank you.
That newspaper.
Newspaper?
Yes, the one that I noticed on the table in the foyer.
Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't I hear you say that you were home all day yesterday?
That's right.
That's what puzzles me.
How did that newspaper get there?
- Haven't you ever heard of home delivery?
- Oh, yeah.
- I have a paper delivered every morning.
- There's your answer.
No.
No, that won't answer it, no.
The newspaper on the foyer table was a late edition.
I even saw racetrack results in it.
I don't quite follow you.
If you were home all day, who brought home the newspaper?
Bryce must have brought it home.
But he came in through your room, not through the front door.
He was shot on that side of the house.
How did that newspaper get to the other end of the house?
You seem to be cross-examining my daughter.
That's all right, Mother.
Bryce must have brought it in and in my confusion I put it on the table when I went to answer the door.
Yes, that would be an answer, except for one thing.
You left your brother's attaché case out there.
Why wouldn't you bring them both in at the same time?
I didn't see it.
You didn't see it.
Gee.
They couldn't have been too far apart.
People are inconsistent when in a state of shock, Lieutenant.
It's foolish of you to expect rational behaviour at a time like that.
Well, I'm sure you're right about this.
I only get into it because I try to figure it out in my mind.
Uh, well, look, I'm sure both of you have a great deal to talk about so I'm gonna run along.
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.
Um... listen, about that $11, ma'am...
If you'll leave me your card, I'll send you a cheque.
I'm all out of cards.
Oh.
Here.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
(Dog yaps)
Easy, now.
Easy!
(Peter) That'd be just terrific.
The jury's coming in now.
(Feedback)
Have you ladies and gentlemen concluded your deliberations?
- Yes, sir, we have.
- Clerk.
Thank you.
(Woman) What do you think?
- What?
- She's home free.
You watch.
Jupiter and Venus are in good aspect with Pluto.
I have before me the verdict of the coroner's jury in the matter of Bryce Chadwick, deceased.
The jury finds that Bryce Chadwick, age 46, came to his death July 21st at his residence,
2307 Lorraine Drive, death being caused by three .38 calibre bullet wounds in the upper chest.
The jury also finds from the evidence submitted that the death of Bryce Chadwick was an accident.
(Crowd murmuring)
- Thank you very much.
Thank you.
- Good luck.
See?
Thank you, jury members.
This inquest is now closed.
(Peter) Nice to be believed, isn't it, huh?
Yes.
I want to take the whole jury out for dinner!
That is what is known as bribery after the fact.
- Oh, is it?
- Anyway, it's all over.
Back to normal.
(Beth) That's exactly what I don't want.
(Peter) What do you mean?
I think it's time we made a few changes, that I broke a few patterns.
As long as you don't break ours.
How about some lunch to celebrate?
Can I take a rain check?
I have a few appointments.
- You don't mind, do you?
- No, it's fine.
Oh, when you get back to the office would you set up a meeting with the heads of departments?
- What's the agenda?
- Reorganisation.
Tomorrow at 2:00.
Mother.
- Good morning, Mr Hamilton.
- Oh.
Lieutenant.
- You remember me?
- I have a very good memory.
I envy you.
I can't even remember my telephone number.
What can I do for you, Lieutenant?
I couldn't help overhearing that she turned you down for lunch.
You wanna grab a bite with me?
- You want to ask me some questions?
- Well...
Listen, it's my treat.
Your...
All right.
Window down, please.
Oh!
Right.
That's it.
I held the whipped cream on the Mighty Malt.
- That's what you wanted?
- Right.
OK.
And they were out of onion rings.
You want a substitution?
No, that's all right.
No, that's fine.
Don't forget to tell me before you leave.
I need to take the tray.
- People always drive off with our trays.
- Right.
I'll remember.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Right.
Tell me, you and Miss Chadwick are gonna be married?
You don't believe in preliminaries.
Well, you know, sometimes it's just...
Yes, we are but we haven't set the date yet, mainly because of Bryce.
Oh, I see.
You know, what I was wondering was... the night of the shooting, why'd you drive over there so late?
Let's say the propulsion was anger.
Huh?
What do you mean?
I got back from a business trip and there was a letter from Bryce.
He said to lay off Beth or else.
Or else?
Or else what?
Oh, it's...
Professional discrimination.
Things like that.
So I got hot and I went over to have it out with him.
I see.
Boy, you got there just in time for the commotion.
That's quite a coincidence, isn't it?
That's a leading question, Lieutenant.
Do you think that the two of us did Bryce in together?
What do you mean, murder?
Oh, no.
I mean, you were at the inquest.
They said it was an accident.
I'm not talking about the inquest.
I'm talking about you.
What do you think?
Do I think it was a conspiracy?
No, no.
Oh, no.
No chance of that.
No, sir.
It's rather odd that you're still asking the same questions.
Oh, you know...
Well, that's just me.
You know, I mean, nothing official.
It's just that, you know, I have this...
bug about tying up loose ends.
Listen, I wanna thank you.
You've been very helpful to me.
Suppose you ask the question that you haven't asked.
- If I'm a fortune-hunter.
- I never intended...
I'm not.
I love Beth with her money or without her money.
As a matter of fact, I was prepared to quit the company.
That won't be necessary now.
No, that won't, but I won't be a hypocrite, Lieutenant.
I'm sorry about poor Bryce being killed but... it has gotten Beth out from under his thumb.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, way out.
Huh?
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Way out?
Well, you know, in the courtroom I overheard her say that she was breaking patterns now.
This is a terrible thing to admit but...
I think that, in a way... her brother's death is the best thing that ever happened to her.
Hey, mister!
You forgot the tray!
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
May I assist you, sir?
You scared me.
No, I was looking for Miss...
You're Charles, aren't you?
Are we acquainted?
I saw you at the inquest.
No, I'm Lieutenant Columbo.
I'm looking for Miss Chadwick.
- You're a police officer, sir?
- Yes, I am.
- Is she in?
- I'm afraid not, sir.
Oh, she isn't?
I see.
Do you know where I can get in touch with her?
- Yes, she's at the beauty parlour.
Eugene's.
- A-ha.
- Will that be all, sir?
- Yes, Charles.
Yeah, I think so.
Uh...
- Hey, smells new.
- It is, sir.
- Oh.
Why didn't she take it with her?
- It was just delivered.
Ah, it was just delivered.
I see.
I wanna tell you, it's a beauty.
- A wonderful piece of machinery.
- Is that all, sir?
Yeah, Charles, that'll be all.
I don't want you to worry about me.
I'm gonna go around the side of the house and conduct an experiment.
Something I can help you with, sir?
No, it's a kind of a do-it-yourself thing.
Thank you very much.
May I help you, sir?
Well, I'm not a customer.
No, I assumed that.
You're looking for someone?
Yes, I was looking for a Beth Chadwick.
Miss Chadwick?
My name's Lieutenant Columbo.
- The police?
- Well, it's not serious.
I just want to talk to her for a moment.
Through that door, Lieutenant.
Cubicle four.
- Thank you.
- Lieutenant?
- Your cigar.
- What about it?
Uh...
Well, the fragrance is not...
compatible.
That's a shame.
I just lit it.
Well, what brings you here, Lieutenant?
Oh, I stopped by the house.
I talked to Charles, he told me where you'd be so I thought I'd come by.
There's just one point that I wanted to clear up.
- Do you mind?
- I'm a captive audience!
- We can go.
- No, that's all right.
Go ahead and finish.
Saw your new car, by the way.
Oh, that's some automobile.
- Thank you.
- Really beautiful.
Do you have to order those things weeks in advance?
- Yes.
- That's what I thought.
Real change of pace for you, isn't it?
I felt like something racy.
As they say in advertising, a new image.
Yeah.
Well, I can understand that.
I'm sorry.
Because it's a natural thing,
I think, after a death in the family to want to break loose.
That's one way of putting it.
Gee, that's funny, though.
What?
If you ordered the car some time ago that'd mean you knew in advance you were gonna change your style.
Finished, Miss Chadwick.
- May I see?
- Yes.
Oh!
- Wow!
Just amazing!
- Looks fabulous.
Fabulous.
- You look sensational!
- You really think so?
I'd say you were a new woman.
Oh, thank you, Lieutenant.
Goodbye, Gene.
Thank you.
See you next week.
Bye, Felicia.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Why, Miss Chadwick, you look lovely.
Thank you.
You're very kind.
- My bill and an appointment next week.
- Certainly.
Lieutenant, you haven't asked me your question.
- Are you headed home?
- Yes.
Do you mind if I meet you there?
It's to do with your house.
- Is this really necessary?
- In a way, yes.
I promise it won't take long.
All right.
I'll meet you there.
Lieutenant?
Your cigar.
Oh, good afternoon, ma'am.
Good afternoon.
Oh, Charles, our lieutenant requires a stepladder.
Would you be good enough to get one for him?
Yes, ma'am.
Another experiment, sir?
Well, I guess you could call it that, yeah.
- Experiment, Lieutenant?
- Uh-huh.
Like I said, I was out here earlier.
Hey, why don't I show it to you?
Now... you figure that your brother had to walk around the side of the house like this.
- Is that right?
- Yes, and the coroner's jury figured it too.
Right.
Now, you see, he had to walk on grass.
- (Laughing) Is there some point to this?
- Yes, ma'am, there is.
You see, now this grass is kind of dry because the sun's been out.
Uh...
But today's Thursday.
And the gardener cuts the grass on Thursday.
Excuse me a minute.
You see?
Grass.
Yes, well, that's only natural.
It certainly is.
But, you know, there was no grass on your brother's shoe.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Your brother was shot a week ago, on Thursday.
I looked at the photographs of the body and for the life of me I just couldn't see any grass on the soles of his shoe.
And I couldn't figure that out.
Why?
It was freshly cut and it was sticky as it was at night and there was dew.
That's very good.
He must have had particles of grass on his shoes but they were probably brushed off on the carpet and, unfortunately, the room's been cleaned.
Yeah.
I know.
Well, unless there's something else...
Just one more thing.
I guess Charles has the stepladder by now.
- I would think.
- Yeah.
All right, then.
The other morning when I was over here I noticed these potted plants.
- How observant.
- They're very pretty, you know.
But I got to thinking, "Sometimes people keep a spare key outside"
"just in case they forget their own key."
Do you see this?
What?
- This imprint here.
- Yes.
What about it?
Well, that's like a fossil or something.
A spare key must have been hidden in there for a long time.
You see, that's been rained on and everything.
There was a spare key.
Oh?
I put it there when the alarm was installed.
Bryce didn't know about it.
I also removed it recently because I had second thoughts.
What do you mean by second thoughts?
If a burglar were on the premises, he might find the key
- and then what good would the alarm be?
- Good point.
Yes.
Hey, yeah.
I was right, wasn't I?
Because you found it.
Yeah, I guess I did.
I think you've overstayed your welcome.
The official verdict is death by accidental means and that should satisfy you.
Ma'am, I don't mean any offence.
I'm just trying to tie up loose ends.
I'm compulsive that way.
That's what my wife says about it.
Are you really?
No, I mean, all I meant by that was that...
- You see, if there was a key there...
- Yes?
and if Bryce knew about it then he would use the key to let himself in through the front door.
But I told the truth the night it happened and I told the truth at the inquest.
So whatever your little compulsions may be, I'm afraid I must insist you leave me alone.
Oh, uh...
Goodbye.
I'll take it all.
Yeah?
- Well, is that it?
- No, I haven't finished.
- You're not bored, are you?
- No.
I'm having a wonderful time.
- Is there something young and bright?
- This one?
- Oh, that's marvellous.
- Excuse us.
Don't forget to put my hat over by the black baggage.
Bring it with me.
It'll look great.
- Could you get the zipper?
Peter!
- Yes.
Everybody set for this afternoon's meeting?
Yes, but I was wondering, Beth.
Uh... don't you think it's a little premature?
Perhaps another week for things to ease up.
No!
It must be today.
All right.
It's up to you.
Well, what do you think?
Interesting.
What does that mean?
Well, it's wild.
It's a little out of your style, isn't it?
No, I don't think it is.
Well, you asked.
Hey, it was a courtesy.
I'm perfectly capable of making my own decisions.
Oh, what is that silver dress over there on the rail?
And this one!
This matches it.
You finish your wardrobe.
I'm going back to the office.
No.
I want you to wait till I'm ready to go.
Do you have trousers that go with the red top?
I'm not sure what's gotten into you but...
I'm not sure I like it.
I'll see you.
If you need me, I'll be back at the office.
Did you want to try this on?
Yes, this one and that blue dress, please.
OK.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Will you please take your seats?
Well, now, we've all been through a period of anxiety and indecision since my brother's death.
But in a corporate sense, we must maintain our continuity.
As you all well know, this is a family-owned firm.
Therefore, as of today, I am assuming the presidency.
As my first order of business...
I would like to announce the elevation of Mr Peter Hamilton to executive vice-president in charge of accounts.
As to philosophy, my brother was a traditionalist.
I want to break new ground.
Would you pass these along, please?
I want to streamline.
We're gonna cut down marginal accounts and start promoting ourselves for a change.
Seems to me we sell everything but our own product.
Beth, forgive me, but that is our job.
Forgive me, but it's not.
Our job is to grow.
When was the last time this agency took on a new account?
- We have all we can handle.
- Nonsense!
- I don't want to be difficult...
- I don't mean to interrupt but this is really not the time for negative thinking.
If you disagree with my approach, you're free to sever your relationship with the firm.
No, Beth, I feel that I can accommodate myself to your way of thinking.
Yes, I'm sure you can.
Any questions?
Very well.
We'll adjourn.
Oh, one more thing.
A happy and personal note.
I'd like to announce my engagement to Mr Hamilton.
Thank you.
Are those letters for me to sign?
- Congratulations, Peter.
- Yeah.
Right.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
You must be out of your mind.
What qualifies you to run this company?
I had a very good teacher - my brother.
I've been studying his reports for years and asking questions.
Thank you.
We'll finish later.
He may not have known it but he was grooming me.
Well, don't forget, I am the majority stockholder,
I will not relinquish control.
(Laughs) Don't be naive.
Who else can take over and still keep it in the family?
I'm prepared to go to court if necessary and you know that means - publicity, interviews, scandal.
I can't believe you're talking to me like this.
Are you prepared to take over the company?
You're getting old, Mother, or hadn't you noticed?
(Knock at door)
Come in.
- Am I interrupting something?
- What do you want?
Well, I just thought that...
Why, hello there, fella!
- How you doing?
- (Yapping)
I got a treat for you.
I got a little something for him.
Here you are.
I've been carrying these things around with me all week.
Come here, boy.
Come on.
Take one of these.
Look at that.
Come on.
Come on.
- (Yapping)
- Oh, easy.
Easy.
I think we have a personality conflict.
Do you need me for anything, Lieutenant?
Come here.
No, ma'am.
No, I don't think so.
Then I'll be leaving.
Mother.
We'll go into this later.
As you wish.
I'll leave the two of you alone.
No, that's all right, Peter.
The lieutenant is going to be brief.
Oh.
What is it now?
We've talked about keys and grass and newspapers.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you.
You know how one thing leads to another.
Over at your house there the other day, when I was climbing that ladder, I had a thought.
Something else occurred to me that's been keeping me awake at night.
What might that be?
I was wondering about that burnt-out bulb in front of your house and I went over there this morning to take a look at it...
You brought it with you!
- Yeah.
I didn't think you'd mind.
- No.
Uh... this is a 100-watt bulb. 100 watt?
Got a life of 750, 800 hours.
Now, if your house is anything like my house, then you burn the outside light eight, 10 hours a day so that means it'd last two, two and a half months.
Is that right?
Yeah.
I'll concede to your knowledge.
I don't know.
Thank you very much.
Now this is what I got to thinking.
I hate to change bulbs outside my house because no matter how tight I put it in, they attract a lot of dirt and guck and they're full of dead bugs and I don't like to go up there and touch 'em.
Would you get to the point?
Uh... why is that bulb dirt and dust-free?
That bulb is clean as a whistle.
- (Clears throat) - (Columbo) I think that's kind of strange.
Hanging there long enough to burn out but not hanging there long enough to get dirty.
We're a fastidious family.
If the bulb is clean, it's because servants cleaned it.
They cleaned a burnt-out bulb.
They work in the daytime so how would they know?
All right, Lieutenant, that'll be enough.
- Pardon?
- Listen to this very carefully.
I don't ever want to see you again.
You'll be refused admittance to my house and office.
I have work to do and I no longer can indulge your suspicions.
If you think you have a case against me, go to the district attorney.
Is that clear?
Yes.
That's very clear.
I'm warning you, no more questions.
I wasn't gonna ask a question, ma'am.
I just wanted to return your bulb.
What can we do about him?
Beth, take it easy.
Calm down.
Oh, stop saying calm down!
You're a lawyer.
Do something!
We can institute some kind of proceedings against him.
There must be somebody who can do something!
- Take it easy.
- Is that your professional advice?
Beth, what in the world has gotten into you?
We never argued like this before.
We're not arguing.
Something's wrong.
What is it?
There is.
Number one, this business of arbitrarily promoting me.
To say the least, it smacks of high-level nepotism.
And I assume there's a number two.
Yes.
You announced our engagement without telling me.
- I thought it would please you.
- It did.
But don't you think you could have consulted me?
I was just as surprised as everybody else.
Well, I did it for you.
I mean, we are gonna get married?
That's not the point.
I would like to have had a hand in the decision.
It's not like you to act this way.
This is way out of character for you.
If I've changed, it's because I thought you'd like a more exciting woman.
A change, yes, but a complete metamorphosis?
I'm not sure, Beth, you're the same person.
Maybe I'm not.
- Maybe Bryce was right.
- About what?
About your being the wrong kind of man for me.
- What's that, the third?
- I get paid not to count.
Just keep 'em coming.
That's all.
Well, I didn't think you people were supposed to drink on duty.
Oh, Mr Hamilton.
Drink?
Oh, no, that's coffee.
No, I don't drink.
No, it's been a very long day.
- I can see it's been a long day for you too.
- Oh, it shows, huh?
You know, it's quite a coincidence you and I both meeting in the same place like this.
Yes, it is, isn't it?
Yeah.
- What are you reading?
- Oh, this.
This is a... transcript of the inquest.
Congratulations.
I understand you're engaged.
- Not necessarily.
- Oh, really?
What happened?
Let's get back to this.
I want to ask you something.
Lieutenant, why are you hounding Beth?
Hounding?
Who, me?
Oh, no.
I'm not hounding anybody.
Oh, no.
No, what I'm trying to do is get to the bottom of this thing.
You know, Lieutenant, I like you.
I really do.
- But you are devious.
- Devious?
Your job was finished with the coroner's verdict but you're still here, asking questions.
You even managed to bump into me here.
Now, Lieutenant, you don't really think that Beth killed her brother in cold blood, now, do you?
Well, as a matter of fact...
I do.
Mr Hamilton, you asked me what I thought.
Now I'm gonna tell you.
I think she set it up.
I think it was deliberate.
And I think you can help me prove it.
You're sure that's coffee you're drinking?
Cos you're not making any sense.
I was there.
Beth didn't kill anybody.
It was an accident.
Can I tell you about my wife?
You know, my wife, she's got a proverb for every situation.
A rolling stone gathers no moss, you gotta look before you leap...
I'm sure your wife is very nice but what has that got to do with the case?
To be honest?
She solved it for me.
We're having an argument and she says, "You're putting the cart before the horse,"
and I said, "Right."
In this case, the horse is before the cart and I had the answer.
And what was that?
In the transcript, you weren't very specific.
I know.
I just read every word of it.
But on the night of the murder you said something.
If you can remember that, and you tell me you got a terrific memory, then you'll know for sure whether or not Beth Chadwick murdered her brother.
All right.
And what do I remember?
Oh... (Door rattling)
Who is it?
Who's there?
Who's there?
Hello, operator?
Get me the police.
Uh...
Operator?
Oh, operator, I'm sorry.
Forget it.
Lieutenant Columbo?
Is that you?
Come on, Lieutenant.
Come in and have a drink.
Lieutenant Columbo.
This is the way your brother came in, isn't it?
How did you get in?
Same way your brother did, with a spare key.
One of my men located your locksmith.
He was very cooperative.
What do you expect to prove by this bit of nonsense?
I don't want to prove anything.
I came to arrest you.
- Arrest me?
- Yes, ma'am.
For the murder of your brother.
I did have a reason for coming in this way.
I wanted to see the look on your face.
Very well.
I'll consider myself under arrest.
Now I want to see the look on your face when I call my lawyer.
You know what's ironic?
I knew it wasn't an accident the first night.
I knew as soon as I saw that newspaper but I didn't have any proof.
I had to wait for the proof.
I had to wait for your fiancé to give it to me.
- From Peter?
- Yes, ma'am.
I don't think he meant to.
According to your story, you were asleep.
The alarm woke you, you reached for a gun and you shot what you thought was a burglar.
- Which is exactly what happened.
- Couldn't be.
Because Mr Hamilton, who was outside at the time, heard both the shots and the alarm.
Of course he did.
What difference does that make?
(Columbo) Oh, big difference.
He heard the shots first... then the alarm.
That's the cart before the horse.
I mean, how could the alarm wake you if the shots came first?
You see, what really happened was your brother came walking in here, just the way I did tonight, and you shot him and then you set the alarm a few seconds later.
Peter is mistaken.
No, he's a very good lawyer and he prides himself on his memory.
He won't like it but he'll testify against you in court if he has to.
Along with other holes in your story, I think they'll convict you.
Now, you don't want to do that.
Policemen outside.
What would be the point?
Besides, you're too classy a woman.
Ma'am, would you get dressed now?
Take all the time you need.
You can pour Mr. Chadwick's coffee now, Charles.
Yes, ma'am.
Good morning.
Good morning, Charles.
Good morning.
Ah, thank you.
Good morning, Beth.
Mm-hmm.
Ah.
Beth.
Hmm?
You are sulking.
What?
You're sulking.
I'm not sulking.
Of course you're sulking.
It isn't necessary.
We have had our usual argument, and now the matter is settled.
Is it?
Beth, now listen to me.
He isn't for you, believe me.
But if you insist upon seeing him, I have a right to-- well, to express my feelings.
You have no right to control my life.
Your life, in this case, is tied in with an employee of the company.
What difference does that make?
He's an honest, hardworking--
Yes, he is.
And he's ambitious.
He's intelligent.
He's a good attorney.
And he has a flair for the advertising business.
And he's also, uh, smart enough to know... a golden opportunity when he sees it.
You're not Father.
No, I'm not your father.
I'm your brother, and if your choice in men friends were more mature, believe me, I would stay out of your life.
You don't know how to stay out of my life.
I won't let you be used, Beth.
Therefore, I've taken the appropriate steps.
Charles.!
The car ready?
What do you mean you've taken appropriate steps?
Bryce!
What have you done?
I have written a letter to Peter Hamilton.
He'll receive it when he gets back from Atlanta today.
What?
I told him that if he continues to see you contrary to my wishes, his employment with Ellison Chadwick will be terminated.
I don't believe it!
You've threatened him with--
I won't be home for dinner.
Don't wait for me, Beth.
He won't care if you fire him!
No?
Then let me ask you a question, Beth.
If your name wasn't Chadwick... and you didn't have all of this, do you think that--
I mean, do you really think that Peter Hamilton would give you a second look?
Now, uh, I'm, uh-- I'm sorry if I sound cruel.
I don't mean to be.
But the sooner you face the facts, the better.
And the cheaper it will be for all of us.
What about the price I've paid, first to Father, then to you?
Anything I wanted to do on my own, you or he prevented it!
Beth.
Beth!
This is hardly the time.
No, it never is.
Charles.
Yes, Miss Chadwick?
Tomorrow's your day off, isn't it?
Yes, ma'am.
Will you be leaving tonight with the rest of the staff?
.
Well, I'd planned to, Miss Chadwick.
But if you'd like me to stay-- Oh, no, no.
That won't be necessary.
As you wish.
May I bring you more coffee?
Thank you, Charles, no.
That'll be all.
[ Phone Rings ]
Hello?
Yes, operator.
Speaking.
Darling, how are you?
I'm going in to wheel and deal, and I thought I'd call you first.
Oh!
[ Laughs ] You always surprise me.
Well, that's better than being predictable, right?
How's Atlanta?
Oh, just fine.
All of it.
- Hey, I miss you.
- I miss you too.
When'll you be back?
Well, later tonight.
I thought I'd come right over from the airport.
Darling?
Hello?
Uh, darling, let's make it tomorrow.
I mean, it'll be late and you'll probably be tired.
Well, uh--
No, really.
Tomorrow i'll be much better.
Mr. Gaines will see you now.
All right, Beth, gotta go.
I'll call you first thing in the morning.
- You do love me, don't you?
- No, I hate you with a passion.
Good-bye, darling.
Have a safe trip.

I've, uh, I've lost my key.
- I'm in bed already.
Come in this way.
-Are they unlocked?
- Yes.
-Don't forget to turn off the alarm.
All right.
It's off.
[ Window Unlatches ] [ Alarm Bell Ringing ]

[ Groans ]

[ Man ] We found a key ring in the bushes, Miss Chadwick.
Does it belong to your brother?
[ Beth ] Yes, those are-- those were his keys.
[ Man ] The front light's burned out.
He must have dropped his keys and couldn't find them in the dark.
Probably walked around to your French doors and knocked.
[ Beth ] I was asleep.
I had taken sleeping pills, and I didn't hear him.
[ Man ] We figure he broke the glass and opened the door.
[ Beth ] I heard the glass and then the alarm go off.
I just woke up and-- and reached for the gun.
I thought it was a burglar.
[ Man ] Obviously a mistake, Miss Chadwick.
A terrible mistake.
[ Beth ] I thought it was a burglar.
[ Man ] A terrible mistake.

- A spare?
Yes, I leave it in a flower pot by the front door.

[ Beth Sniffling ] Oh.
[ Man #1 ] You then climbed over the gate and started running toward the house.
[ Sniffling ] Well, I was half asleep... because I'd taken a sleeping pill.
The burglar alarm was on?
Well, yes.
There's a switch beside my bed.
How does it work outside?
At the front door?
Well, if you have a key and use it, it automatically turns the alarm off.
Ah.
Do you have any idea why your brother went through your French doors... knowing he'd probably set the alarm off?
Uh, I-- [ Sniffles ]
I guess he lost his keys and... he came around the side of the house and tried to get in... through my wi-window.
What time did you go to bed tonight, Miss Chadwick?
[ Sniffles ] About 9:30.
I didn't feel very well yesterday, so I didn't go out.
Uh, excuse me.
- Did I hear you say you stayed home today?
- Yes, that's what I said.
You didn't go out at all?
No.
- N-No.
That's what I said.
- Thank you.
[ Man ] So when you got there, he was already dead.
Yes, that's correct.
Or did Miss Chadwick telephone you after she shot her brother?
No, I was on my way over.
I stopped at the gate when I heard the shots.
How many?
Three.
And the alarm was going?
That's right.
Why did you drop by, Mr., uh, Hamilton?
I came to see Bryce.
I work for him.
Can you account for your whereabouts this evening?
I came in from Atlanta.
I landed at 1 0:00, I took a cab, got into my apartment about 1 0:45.
You can check with the doorman.
Why did you come over here after just getting home?
It's a little involved, uh--
Miss Chadwick and I have been seeing each other, and Bryce objected.
So you came over here to have it out with him?
I suppose you could put it that way.
Is this your newspaper?
No.
We found these outside in the bushes.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
Miss Chadwick, are these your brother's keys?
Yes.
Where did you find them?
In the bushes, ma'am.
With that front light burned out, it's really tough to see.
Uh, gentlemen, you have our statements.
If you don't mind, I think--
No, I'd like to go through this just once more to make sure I got things straight.
Gentlemen, please.
No, Peter, that's all right.
Go on.
Now, Miss Chadwick, you said you went to bed at 9:30, right?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
And you took a sleeping pill before you retired.
That's right.
Mm-hmm.
Well, would you mind telling me what happened after that?
Well, it was after 1:00... and I-
- I heard the glass break and the alarm go off, and I woke up.
You thought it was a burglar.
Yes.
Yes, I thought it was a burglar.
You see, it was pitch dark... and I was half asleep because I'd taken the sleeping pill.
I heard the glass break and the alarm go off, and so I-- I reached for the gun.
It was in the drawer beside my bed, and-- and then I just started shooting.
I didn't know what I was doing.
Shh.
Gentlemen, we'll be available for questioning tomorrow.
Right now I'd like to see that Miss Chadwick gets some rest.
Right.
All right, fellas, wrap it up.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
Come on, darling.
Excuse me.
Were you and your brother the only ones that were living here?
Well, yes, except for Charles and the maid.
My mother moved to Palm Desert after my father died.
Who is Charles?
The butler.
I suppose he's off tonight.
Yes.
Great big place, isn't it?
Well, good night.
[ Door Closes ]
[ Barking ]
Easy, boy.
Easy, fella.
Easy.
Easy.!
Easy, now.
[ Barking Continues ] That's right.
No, no, no, no--
Enrico, darling.
Be nice, darling, be nice.
You there, pay the cab and bring my luggage.
Come on, dear.
[ Door Closes ]
She have any luggage?
Luggage?
Right here.
And there's 1 0.50 on that meter.
Gee, I've only got $1.
Well, go ahead.
Keep it all.
You're a sport.
[ Cab Door Closes ] [ Engine Starts ]
[ Cab Pulls Away ]
[ Barking ]
All right, easy, boy.
Now, Enrico.
Come here, come here.
Come here!
Now, you stop that.
Do you hear?
I want you to behave yourself.
That is a tough little monkey you got there.
Enrico is not a monkey.
He's a pedigreed silky.
Oh, I can see that, ma'am.
It's just a figure of speech.
Now, you stay there.
Where is my daughter?
I don't know, ma'am.
She's, uh, probably asleep.
Well, where's Charles?
Uh, it's his day off.
Are you Mrs. Chadwick?
Yes.
And you?
My name is Columbo, ma'am.
I'm a lieutenant from the police.
just a minute.
Not so quickly.
I'd like to look that over.
Well, I must say, you hardly look the role.
Well, you know how it is.
You-
- You brought my bags in?
Uh, y-yes, ma'am.
The cab fare was $1 0.50.
It was a 50-cent tip, so that's $1.
I'll see that you're reimbursed, Lieutenant.
Now, tell me, what happened?
Where is she?
Here I am, Mother.
Do you feel better now?
No.
It was an accident.
I don't care what it was.
You killed my son.
Mother--
Oh, you were always so impossible.
Always.
Blundering, making mistakes, causing trouble wherever you were.
He looked after her... all of her life.
He protected you.
And now you've destroyed him.
Mother, you don't understand.
It wasn't my fault.
I don't want to hear about it.
[ Sighs ] I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
This must be very embarrassing for you.
No, not really, no.
You see, I come from a very big family, and at dinnertime it was like, well, you know, Madison Square Garden.
We used to patch it up with coffee.
- Is that a hint?
- Well, I smelled it when I came in.
I sure could use some.
Mother?
I should think it would be obvious I'm in no mood for coffee.
Uh, ma'am, would you like me to take your bags upstairs?
No.
No, thank you.
Beth can attend to them.
He was a special man, Lieutenant.
Very special.
He kept us all together.
I thought you lived in Palm Desert.
I mean spiritually.
When my husband died, I--
I couldn't stay in this house any longer.
Well, that's certainly understandable.
Was that when your son took over the business, ma'am?
Yes, and turned it into... one of the largest advertising agencies on the West Coast.
Really?
Marvelous.
He took over from my husband in many ways, including dealing with Beth and her problems.
Oh.
Her choice of men, when she's had a choice, has never been particularly mature.
Oh, yeah.
Like that Peter Hamilton.
Exactly.
He's an obvious fortune hunter.
Of course, she would have no way of seeing through him, would she?
I'm afraid not.
She's something of a child, Lieutenant.
Her decisions are always vague and emotional.
Bryce was far more perceptive.
He never married, did he?
Why was that?
What are you implying?
Oh, no offense, ma'am.
He just seems like a very distinctive and unique man, and I was curious about him.
Well, he was.
But he had far too many responsibilities for marriage, and I suppose he never met the right woman.
Then there was the business.
I don't know what's going to happen to the company now.
I certainly can't run it, and I don't want to bring anyone in from the outside.
You won't have to.
And what does that mean?
It means that I am an officer of the company.
In name only.
That's because Bryce would never let me participate.
Of course he wouldn't.
You aren't even capable of running your own life.
I've never been allowed to run my own life.
- Lieutenant, won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
But things are different now, aren't they?
There's a change in the status quo.
If you are seriously considering--
We're not alone, Mother.
I suggest we discuss this later.
All right, Lieutenant, I've kept you waiting long enough.
What can I do for you?
Oh, no, no, no.
That's all right.
No, I only have one problem, and that is-
- Thank you.
Cream?
Sugar?
No, I take it black, thank you.
Uh, I couldn't sleep last night.
There were a couple of points that were bothering me, so I thought I'd come over here and clear them up.
What kind of points?
Thank you.
Uh, that newspaper.
Newspaper?
Uh, yes, um, the one that I noticed on the table in the foyer.
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but, uh, didn't I hear you say that you were home all day yesterday?
That's right.
See, that's what puzzles me.
How did that newspaper get there?
Haven't you ever heard of home delivery?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I have a newspaper delivered to my house every morning.
- There's your answer.
- No.
No, that won't answer it, no.
No, the newspaper on the foyer table, that was a late edition.
I mean, I even saw race track results in it.
I'm afraid I don't quite follow you.
Well, if you were home all day, who brought home the newspaper?
Well, Bryce must have brought it home.
But Bryce came in through your room.
He didn't come in through the front door.
I mean, he was shot on that side of the house.
How did that newspaper get to the other end of the house?
Lieutenant, you seem to be cross-examining my daughter.
That's all right, Mother.
Bryce must have brought it in, and in my confusion I picked it up and put it on the foyer table... when I went to answer the door.
Yes, that would be an answer, except for one thing.
You left your brother's attaché case out there.
Why wouldn't you bring 'em both in at the same time?
I didn't see it.
You didn't see it.
Gee.
They couldn't have been too far apart.
People are inconsistent when they're in a state of shock, Lieutenant.
It's foolish of you to expect rational behavior at a time like that.
Well, I'm sure you're probably right about this.
I only get into it because I try to figure it out in my mind.
You understand that.
Uh, well, look, I'm sure both of you have a great deal to talk about, so I'm gonna run along.
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.
Bye-bye.
Good-bye.
Um, listen, about that $1, ma'am, uh--
If you'll leave me your card, I'll send you a check.
I'm all out of cards.
Oh.
Well... here.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
[ Barking ]
Easy, now.
Easy!
[ Peter Whispering ] That'd be just terrific.
[ Whispering Continues ]
The jury's coming in now.
[ Feedback ]
Have you ladies and gentlemen concluded your deliberations?
- Yes, sir, we have.
- Clerk.
Thank you.
What do you think?
What?
She's home free.
You watch.
Jupiter and Venus are in good aspect with Pluto.
[ Hearing Officer ] I have before me the verdict of the coroner's jury... in the matter of Bryce Chadwick, deceased.
The jury finds that Bryce Chadwick, age 46, came to his death July 2 1 at his residence,
2307 Lorraine Drive, death being caused by three .38 caliber bullet wounds in the upper chest.
The jury also finds, from the evidence submitted, that the death of Bryce Chadwick was an accident.
[ Spectators Gasping, Muttering ]
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Good luck to you.
See?
Thank you, jury members.
This inquest is now closed.
[ Hamilton ] Nice to be believed, isn't it, huh?
[ Chuckles ] Yes.
I want to take the whole jury out for dinner.
[ Laughing ] That is what is known as bribery after the fact.
Oh, is it?
Anyway, it's all over.
Back to normal, huh?
[ Beth ] Oh, no.
That's exactly what I don't want.
[ Hamilton ] What do you mean?
Well, I think it's time we made a few changes, that I broke a few patterns.
[ Chuckling ] As long as you don't break ours.
How 'bout some lunch to celebrate?
Can I take a rain check?
I-
- I have a few appointments.
You don't mind, do you, darling?
No, no.
That's all right.
Oh, uh, when you get back to the office, would you set up a meeting with the heads of the departments?
What's the agenda?
Reorganization.
Uh, tomorrow at 2:00.
Mother.
Good morning, Mr. Hamilton.
Oh.
Lieutenant.
Do you remember me?
Yes, I've got a very good memory.
I tell you, I envy you that.
I got to the point where I can't remember my telephone number.
What can I do for you, Lieutenant?
Well, I, uh-- I couldn't help overhearing that she turned you down for lunch.
You wanna grab a bite with me?
You want to ask me some questions, is that it?
Well, uh--
Listen, it's my treat.
[ Chuckles ] Your-
- All right.
Window down, please.
Oh.
Right.
That's it.
I held the whipped cream on the Mighty Malt.
That's what you wanted?
Uh... right.
Okay.
And they, uh-- they were out of onion rings.
You want a substitution?
Uh, no, that's all right.
No, that's fine.
All right.
Don't forget to let me know before you leave.
I need to take the tray.
People are always driving off with our trays.
Right.
I'll remember.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Right.
Tell me something-- you and Miss Chadwick, are you gonna be married?
You don't believe in preliminaries, do you?
Well, you know, sometimes it's just, uh--
Yes, we're gonna be married, but we haven't set the date yet, mainly because of Bryce.
Oh, I see.
You know what I was wondering was... the night of the shooting-- why'd you drive over there so late?
Let's say the propulsion was anger.
Huh?
What-- What do you mean?
Oh, I got back from a business trip, and there was a letter waiting for me from Bryce.
He said to lay off Beth or else.
Or else?
Or else what?
Oh, it's--
Professional discrimination.
Things like that.
So I got hot, and I went over to have it out with him.
I see.
Boy, uh, you got there just in time for the commotion.
That's quite a coincidence, isn't it?
That's a leading question, Lieutenant.
Do you think that, uh, the two of us did Bryce in together?
What do you mean, murder?
Oh, no.
I mean, you were at the inquest.
They said it was an accident.
I'm not talking about the inquest.
I'm talking about you.
What do you think?
Do I think it was a conspiracy?
No, no.
Oh, no.
No chance of that.
No, sir.
Well, it's rather odd that you're still asking the same questions, though.
Oh, well, you know, that's, uh-- well, that's just me.
You know, I mean, nothing official.
It's just that, you know, I have this, uh, bug... about tying up loose ends.
Listen, I wanna thank you.
You've been very helpful to me.
Suppose you ask the question that you haven't asked.
- Whether or not I'm a fortune hunter.
- Well, I never intended--
I'm not.
I love Beth with her money or without her money.
As a matter of fact, I was quite prepared to quit the company.
'Course, that won't be necessary now.
No, that won't, but I won't be a hypocrite, Lieutenant.
I'm sorry about poor Bryce being killed, but... it has gotten Beth out from under his thumb.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, way out.
Huh?
What's that supposed to mean?
Way out?
Well, uh, you know, uh, in the courtroom I overheard her say... that she was breaking patterns now.
This is a terrible thing to admit, but, uh,
I think that, in a way, her brother's death is the best thing that ever happened to her.
[ Waitress ] Hey, mister.!
You forgot the tray!
Sorry.
It's all right.
May I assist you, sir?
Oh. [ Chuckles ] You scared me.
No, I was looking for Miss, uh--
You're Charles, aren't you?
Are we acquainted?
Oh, I saw you at the inquest.
No, I'm, uh, Lt. Columbo.
I'm looking for Miss Chadwick.
You're a police officer, sir?
Uh, yes, I am.
Yeah.
Uh, is she in?
I'm afraid not, sir.
Oh, she isn't?
I see.
Well, uh--
Uh, do you, uh-- do you know where I can, uh-- uh, get in touch with her?
Yes, she's at the beauty parlor.
Eugene's.
Uh-huh.
Will that be all, sir?
Yes, Charles.
Uh, yeah, I think so.
Uh--
Hey, smells new.
It is, sir.
Oh.
Why didn't she take it with her?
It was just delivered.
Ah, it was just delivered.
I see.
Well, I wanna tell you, it's a beauty.
That's a wonderful piece of machinery.
Will that be all, sir?
Yeah, Charles, that'll be all.
I don't want you to worry about me, Charles.
I'm gonna go around the side of the house here and I'm gonna conduct an experiment.
Is it something I can help you with, sir?
No, Charles.
It's a kind of a do-it-yourself thing.
Thank you very much.
[ Woman ] May I help you, sir?
Uh... well, I'm not a customer.
No, I assumed that.
You're looking for someone?
Yes, I was looking for a, uh, Beth Chadwick.
Miss Chadwick?
My name's Lt. Columbo.
The police?
Well, look now, it's not serious.
I just want to talk to her for a moment.
Oh.
Well, right through that door, Lieutenant.
Cubicle four.
Thank you.
Uh, Lieutenant?
- Your cigar.
- What about it?
Uh, well, the fragrance is not, um... compatible.
That's a shame.
I just lit it.
Uh-- Oh.
[ Spraying ]
Well, what brings you here, Lieutenant?
Oh, I, uh-- I stopped by the house.
I talked to Charles, and he told me where you'd be, so I thought I'd come by.
There's, uh, just one point that I wanted to clear up.
[ Chuckles ] Do you mind?
Does it matter?
I'm a captive audience.
We can go, Miss Chadwick.
No, no, no.
That's all right.
Go ahead and finish.
Saw your new car, by the way.
Oh, that's some automobile.
Thank you.
Really beautiful.
Beautiful.
I suppose you have to order those things weeks in advance, don't you?
Yes, that's right.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Real change of pace for you, isn't it?
[ Chuckles ]
Well, I felt like something racy.
As they say in advertising, a new image.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Well, you know, I can understand that.
I'm sorry.
Because, uh, it's a natural thing, I think, uh, after a death in the family... to want to break loose.
That's one way of putting it.
Gee, that's funny, though.
What?
If you had to order the car some time ago, that would mean that you knew in advance that you were gonna change your style.
Finished, Miss Chadwick.
May I see?
Yes.
Oh!
[ Laughing ]
[ Columbo ] Wow!
Just amazing!
Looks fabulous.
Fabulous.
Miss Chadwick, you look sensational.!
You really think so?
I'd say you were a new woman.
Oh, thank you, Lieutenant.
Good-bye, Gene.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
See you next week.
Bye, Felicia.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Why, Miss Chadwick, you look lovely.
Thank you.
You're very kind.
The bill, and could I have an appointment next week?
Certainly.
Well, Lieutenant, you haven't asked me your question.
I'll tell you what-- are you headed home?
Yes.
Do you mind if I meet you there, 'cause it kind of has to do with your house.
Is this really necessary?
Well, in a way, it does, yes.
I promise it won't take long.
All right.
I'll meet you there.
Uh, Lieutenant?
Your cigar.
Oh, good afternoon, ma'am.
Good afternoon.
Oh, Charles, our lieutenant requires a stepladder.
Would you be good enough to get one for him?
Yes, ma'am.
Another experiment, sir?
Uh, well, I-I guess you could call it that, yeah.
Experiment, Lieutenant?
Uh-huh.
Like I said, I was out here earlier.
Hey, why don't I show it to you?
Now, uh, you figure that your brother had to walk around the side of the house like this.
Is that right?
I'd figure it, and so did the coroner's jury.
Right.
Now, you see, he had to walk on grass.
[ Chuckling ]
Is there some point to this?
Yes, ma'am, there is.
You see, uh, now this grass is kind of dry because the sun's been out.
Uh, but today's Thursday.
And, uh, the gardener cuts the grass on Thursday.
Excuse me a minute.
You see?
Grass.
Yes, well, that's only natural.
It certainly is.
But, you know, there was no grass on your brother's shoe.
I'm afraid I don't quite understand.
Your brother was shot a week ago, on Thursday.
I looked at the photographs of the body.
I even had them blown up.
For the life of me, I just couldn't see any grass on the soles of his shoe.
And I couldn't figure that out.
Why?
It was freshly cut, and it was sticky because it was at night and there was dew.
You know, that's very good.
He must have had particles of grass on his shoes, but they were probably brushed off on the carpet... and, unfortunately, the room's been cleaned.
Yeah.
I know.
Well, unless there's something else-- just one more thing.
I guess Charles has the stepladder by now, hmm?
I would think.
Yeah.
All right, then.
The other morning when I was over here,
I noticed these potted plants.
How observant.
And they're very pretty, you know.
But I got to thinking.
I said to myself, ""Sometimes people keep a spare key outside... just in case they forget their own key."
Uh, do you, uh-- do you see this?
What?
This imprint here.
Yes.
What about it?
Well, that's like a-- a fossil or something.
You see, a spare key must have been hidden in there for a long time.
You see, that's been rained on and everything.
- There was a spare key.
- Oh?
I put it there myself when the alarm system was installed.
Bryce didn't know about it.
I also removed it myself recently because I had second thoughts.
Wh-What do you mean by ""second thoughts"?
If a burglar were, in fact, on the premises, he might find the key, and then what good would the alarm system be?
Good point.
Yes.
Hey, yeah.
I was right, wasn't I?
Because you found it.
Yeah, I guess I did.
All right, Lieutenant.
I think you've finally overstayed your welcome.
The official verdict is death by accidental means, and that should satisfy you.
Look, ma'am, I don't mean any offense.
I'm just trying to tie up loose ends.
You see, I'm compulsive that way.
It's just a-
- Well, that's what my wife says about it.
Just--
[ Laughing ] Are you really?
Oh.
No, I mean, all I meant by that was that, uh--
Well, you see, if-- if there was a key there...
Yes?
and if Bryce knew about it, well, then of course... he would use the key to let himself in through the front door.
But I told the truth the night it happened... and I told the truth at the inquest.
So whatever your little compulsions may be,
I'm afraid I must insist you leave me alone.
Oh.
Uh--
Good-bye.
I'll take it all.
Yeah?
Well, is that it?
No, I haven't finished.
[ Chuckling ]
You're not bored, are you?
No, no.
I'm having a wonderful time.
Is there something young and bright?
Why don't you try this one.
Oh, that's marvelous.
I will try that on.
Excuse me.
Excuse us, please.
Oh, don't forget to put my hat over by the black baggage.
Bring it with me?
It'll look great.
[ Beth ] Could you get the zipper?
Peter.!
Yes.
Everybody set for this afternoon's meeting?
Uh, yes, but I was wondering, Beth.
Oh?
Don't you think it's a little premature?
Perhaps another week for things to ease up.
No.!
It must be today.
All right.
It's up to you.
Oh.
Well, what do you think?
Interesting.
What does that mean?
[ Chuckling ]
Well, it's wild.
It's a little out of your style, though, isn't it?
No, I don't think it is.
Well, you asked.
Hey, it was a courtesy.
I'm perfectly capable of making my own decisions.
[ Gasps ] Oh, what is that silver dress over there on the rail?
And this one.!
This matches it.
Uh, Beth?
Why don't you finish your wardrobe.
I'm going back to the office.
No, no.
I want you to wait till I'm ready to go.
Do you have trousers that go with the red top?
Beth.
I'm not sure what's gotten into you, but...
I'm not sure I like it.
I'll see you.
If you need me, I'll be back at the office.
Did you want to try this on?
Yes, this one and that blue dress over there, please.
Okay.
[ Chattering, Laughing ]
Ladies and gentlemen.
Will you please take your seats?
Well, now, we've all been through a period of anxiety and indecision... since my brother's death.
But in a corporate sense, we must maintain our continuity.
As you all well know, this is a family-owned firm.
Therefore, as of today, I am assuming the presidency.
As my first order of business,
I would like to announce the elevation... of Mr. Peter Hamilton... to executive vice-president in charge of accounts.
As to philosophy, my brother was a traditionalist.
I want to break new ground.
Would you pass these along, please?
I want to streamline.
We're gonna cut down marginal accounts... and we're gonna start promoting ourselves for a change.
Seems to me we've been selling everything but our own product.
Beth, forgive me, but that is our job.
Forgive me, but it's not.
Our job is to grow.
Now, when was the last time this agency took on a new account?
- We have, uh, all we can handle.
- Nonsense!
Look, Beth, I don't want to be difficult, but I-I--
Fred, I don't mean to interrupt you, but this is really not the time for negative thinking.
Now, if you disagree with my approach, you're perfectly free to sever your relationship with the firm.
No, Beth, I-I feel that I can accommodate myself to your way of thinking.
Yes, I'm sure you can.
Any questions?
Very well.
We'll adjourn.
Oh, one more thing.
A happy and personal note.
I'd like to announce my engagement to Mr. Hamilton.
Thank you.
Are those letters for me to sign?
Congratulations, Peter.
Yeah.
Right.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
You must be out of your mind.
What qualifies you to run this company?
I had a very good teacher-- my brother.
I've been studying his reports for years and asking questions.
Thank you.
We'll finish later.
He may not have known it, but he was grooming me.
[ Mrs. Chadwick ] Well, don't forget, I am the majority stockholder.
I will not relinquish control.
[ Giggling ] Don't be naive, Mother.
Who else can take over and still keep it in the family?
Besides, I'm prepared to go to court if necessary, and you know what that means.
Publicity, interviews, scandal.
[ Gasps ] I can't believe you're talking to me like this.
[ Beth ] Are you prepared to take over the company?
You're getting old, Mother, or hadn't you noticed?
[ Knocking ] Come in.
- Am I interrupting something?
- What do you want, Lieutenant?
Well, I just thought that-- Why, hello there, fella!
How you doing?
[ Barking ]
I got a treat for you.
I got a little something for him.
Here you are.
You know, I've been carrying these things around with me all week.
Come here, boy.
Come on.
Take one of these.
Look at that.
Come on.
Come on.
[ Barking ] Ooh.
Oh, easy.
Easy.
I think we have a personality conflict.
Do you need me for anything, Lieutenant?
Come here.
Uh, no, ma'am.
No, I don't think so.
Then I'll be leaving.
Mother?
We'll go into this later.
As you wish.
[ Door Closes ] I'll leave the two of you alone.
No, that's all right, Peter.
The lieutenant is going to be very brief.
Oh, yes.
Well, Columbo, what is it now?
We've talked about keys and grass and newspapers.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you.
Well, you know how one thing leads to another.
When I was-
- Thank you.
When I was over at your house there the other day, and I was climbing up and down that ladder, I tell you, I had a thought.
Something else occurred to me, uh, that's been keeping me awake at night.
Oh.
What might that be?
Well, I was, uh, wondering about that burnt-out bulb...
Oh.
in front of your house, and I went over there this morning to take a look at it, and--
You brought it with you.
Oh, yeah.
I didn't think you'd mind.
No.
Uh, this is a hundred-watt bulb.
Hundred watt?
Got a life of 750, 800 hours.
Now, if your house is anything like my house, then you burn the outside light, uh, eight, 1 0 hours a day.
So that means it would last two, two and a half months.
Is that right?
Yeah.
I'll concede to your knowledge.
I don't know.
Thank you very much.
Uh, now this is what I got to thinking.
I hate to change bulbs outside my house because no matter how tight I get that up in the lamp, you see, they attract a lot of dirt and guck, and they're full of dead bugs,
and I just don't even like to go up there and touch 'em.
Would you get to the point?
Uh... why is that bulb dirt and dust-free?
That bulb is clean as a whistle.
[ Clears Throat ] Now, I think that's kind of strange, don't you?
Hanging there long enough to, uh, burn out, but not hanging there long enough to get dirty.
We're a fastidious family.
If the bulb is clean, it's because servants cleaned it.
They cleaned a burnt-out bulb.
They work in the daytime, so how would they know?
All right, Lieutenant.
I think that'll be enough.
Beg your pardon?
I want you to listen to this very carefully.
I don't ever want to see you again.
You'll be refused admittance to my house and to this office.
I have a great deal of work to do and I no longer can indulge your suspicions.
If you think you have a case against me, go to the district attorney.
Is that clear?
Yes.
That's very clear.
Hmm.
Oh-- I'm warning you.
No more questions.
I wasn't gonna ask a question, ma'am.
I just wanted to return your bulb.
[ Door Closes ]
[ Yelling ] What can we do about him?
[ Crashing ]
Beth, take it easy.
Calm down.
Oh, stop saying ""calm down"!
You're a lawyer.
Do something.!
I mean, we can institute some kind of proceedings against him.
There must be somebody in city government who can do something.!
- Calm down.
Take it easy.
- Well, is that your professional advice?
Beth, what in the world has gotten into you?
We never argued like this before.
Oh.
We're not arguing.
Something's wrong.
What is it?
All right, there is.
Number one, uh, this business of arbitrarily promoting me.
It-
- To say the least, it smacks of high-level nepotism.
It's, uh--
And I assume there's a number two.
Yes, there is.
You announced our engagement without even letting me know.
I thought it would please you.
It did please me.
But don't you think you could have consulted with me?
I was just as surprised here as everybody else.
[ Scoffs ]
Well, I-I did it for you.
I mean, we-we are gonna get married, aren't we?
That's not the point.
I would like to have had a hand in the decision.
Now, it's not like you to act this way.
This is way out of character for you.
Well, if I've changed, it's because I thought you'd like a more exciting woman.
A change, yes, but a complete metamorphosis?
I'm not sure, Beth, you're the same person.
[ Chuckles ] Maybe I'm not.
Maybe Bryce was right.
About what?
About your being the wrong kind of man for me.
[ Door Opens ]
[ Door Closes ]
?
[ Piano ]
What's that, the third?
I get paid not to count.
just keep 'em comin'.
That's all.
Well, I didn't think you people were supposed to drink on duty.
Oh, Mr. Hamilton.
Drink?
Oh, no, that's coffee.
No, I don't drink.
No, it's been a very long day.
I can see it's been a long day for you too.
Oh, it shows, huh?
Mmm.
You know, it's quite a coincidence, uh, you and I both meeting in the same place like this.
Yes, it is, isn't it?
Yeah.
- What are you reading?
- Oh, this.
This is a, uh, transcript of the inquest.
Listen, congratulations.
I understand you're engaged.
- Not necessarily.
- Oh, really?
What happened?
Let's get back to this.
I want to ask you something.
Lieutenant, why are you hounding Beth?
Hounding?
Who, me?
Oh, no.
I'm not hounding anybody.
Oh, no.
No.
No, what I'm trying to do is get to the bottom of this thing.
[ Laughing ] You know, Lieutenant,
I like you, I really do.
But you are devious.
Devious?
Your job was finished with the coroner's verdict, but you're still hangin' around.
You're still asking questions.
You even managed to bump into me here.
Now, Lieutenant, you don't really think... that Beth killed her brother in cold blood, now, do you?
Well, as a matter of fact...
I do.
Mr. Hamilton, you asked me what I thought.
Now I'm gonna tell you.
I think she set it up.
I think it was deliberate.
And I think you can help me prove it.
Now, excuse me.
You're sure that that's coffee that you're drinking?
'Cause you're not making any sense.
I was there.
I know Beth didn't kill anybody.
It was an accident.
Can I tell you about my wife?
You know, my wife, she's got a proverb for every situation.
You know, with her, a rolling stone gathers no moss, you gotta look before you leap--
I'm sure that your wife is a very nice woman, but what does that got to do with the case?
To be honest?
She solved it for me.
We're havin' an argument last night, she says to me,
""You're puttin' the cart before the horse."
And I said, ""Right."
In this case, the horse is before the cart, and I had the answer.
And what was that?
In the transcript, you weren't very specific.
I know.
I just read every word of it.
But I think, on the night of the murder, you said something.
If you can remember that-- and you tell me you got a terrific memory--
Mm-hmm.
then you know.
You'll know for sure whether or not Beth Chadwick murdered her brother.
All right.
And what do I remember?
[ Flipping Pages ]
Oh.
[ Door Handle Jiggling ]
Who is it?
Who's there?
Who's there?
Hello, operator?
Get me the police.
Uh--
Operator?
Oh, operator, I'm sorry.
Forget it.
Lieutenant Columbo?
Is that you?
Come on, Lieutenant.
Come in and have a drink.
Lieutenant Columbo.
This is the way your brother came in that night, isn't it?
How did you get in?
Same way your brother did-- with a spare key.
One of my men located your locksmith.
He was very cooperative.
What do you expect to prove by this bit of nonsense?
I don't want to prove anything, ma'am.
I came to arrest you.
[ Laughs ] Arrest me?
Yes, ma'am.
For the murder of your brother.
Oh.
And I did have a reason for coming in this way.
I wanted to see the look on your face.
Very well.
I'll consider myself under arrest.
And now I want to see the look on your face when I call my lawyer.
You know what's ironic?
I knew it wasn't an accident the first night.
I knew it as soon as I saw that newspaper, but I didn't have any proof.
I had to wait for the proof.
I had to wait for your fiancé to give it to me.
From Peter?
Yes, ma'am.
Although I don't think he meant to.
You see, according to your story, you were asleep at night.
The alarm woke you up, you reached for a gun, and you shot what you thought was a burglar.
Which is exactly what happened.
Couldn't be.
Because Mr. Hamilton, who was driving up outside at the time, he heard both the shots and the alarm.
Of course he did.
What difference does that make?
Oh, big difference.
He heard the shots first, then the alarm.
That's the cart before the horse.
I mean, how could the alarm wake you if the shots came first?
You see, what really happened was... your brother came walking in here just the way I did tonight, and you shot him, and then you set the alarm a few seconds later.
Peter is mistaken.
No, he's a very good lawyer and he prides himself on his memory.
He won't like it, but he'll testify against you in court, if he has to.
Along with the other holes in your story, I think they'll convict you.
Now, really, you don't want to do that.
Policemen outside.
What would be the point?
Besides, you're too classy a woman.
Ma'am, will you get dressed now?
Take all the time you need.

Say, did you meet the new receptionist?
She's such a warm girl.
I'll say she's warm.
I introduced myself, and she hugged me.
The entire time we talked, she kept touching me, as though she couldn't believe I was real.
We all have that problem with you, Ted.
I just got hugged out there!
- It's happening to a lot of people.
- Hi!
- Did she get you too, Mary?
- Did who get me?
They got a new receptionist downstairs.
Didn't you see her on the way up?
No.
There was a crowd in the lobby area, though, around the reception desk.
- What's she like?
- Mary Richards!
She's very friendly.
- Hi there.
- Hi!
Don't you know me?
Well, yes, of course I know you.
You're the new receptionist.
[Giggles] Think back, Mar.
Didn't you go to camp when you were a little kid?
Yes.
Yes, I did.
I went to Camp Sunshine for five years.
- And that's where I know you from!
- No.
Oh.
Camp Owmwuk.
Didn't you go to Camp Owmwuk in 1950?
I did!
I went to Camp Owmwuk one year.
That's where I know you...
- No, no.
- That's it!
Yes!
Camp Owmwuk.
It's me...
Twinks.
Twinks!
- Well, well!
- Well.
You haven't changed a bit.
How are you?
Oh, I'm just fine, Mar.
- Oh, well.
- How are you?
Just fine!
Twinks and I were friends in camp.
Yes.
Best friends.
And we haven't seen each other in, what... 18 years.
Not since we were 12.
That makes them 30, Ted.
Wow!
After 18 years, uh, what do you say?
What's new?
Well, they moved the camp to the other side of the lake after it burned down.
- Oh.
- And my father retired.
And, um, I got a new car, and I'm getting married.
Hey, that's terrific!
No kidding!
Well, yeah, the old car needed four new tires, so...
I meant getting married.
Oh, yeah.
Well, that's why I moved to Minneapolis... to be closer to my fiance.
Oh, Mar, isn't it somethin'?
- Us working at the same place.
- It really is!
Oh, Mar, tell me what's new with you.
Well, I moved here, what...
- Mary, don't you have some work to do?
- Yes.
Yes, sir.
Sorry.
- I really have to get to work.
- Yeah, me too.
- How 'bout dinner tonight?
- Fine.
Oh, I have so much to tell you about the kids at camp.
You, uh, still keep up with some of'em, do you?
All of'em.
I still put out the camp alumni bulletin.
Mary, haven't you been getting yours?
Uh, well, no, not for some time now.
Oh, well, I'll get you all the back copies.
- Okay.
- I'll see you later, Mar.
- Right.
- Murray.
Ted!
She was always such a warm, friendly person.
She always used to make up people's bunks for them at camp.
I don't trust warm and friendly people.
Now, if you're through with old home week,
- shall we get on with the mail?
- Yes.
Sorry about all the hysteria out there, but it is fun catching up with old friends.
- Yeah, I did that a couple of weeks ago.
- Oh, who'd you see?
The Second Marine Division.
My old outfit.
- We had a reunion.
- It must have been fun.
Fun?
They booked this big room in a hotel.
The first thing they did was pin this tag on my coat... that said, " Sergeant Grant.
Remember me?"
- So, what's wrong with that?
- What's wrong with that?
There I was, surrounded by 300 drunken ex-privates, and suddenly I didn't have rank on them anymore.
It's amazing how they remembered all the little slights... that I committed in boot camp 20 years ago.
Hey, 'bout 20 years ago, you and I were both in camp.
[Chuckling] I'm sorry.
Of course, some of the reunions I've been to haven't been so bad.
Right there in that same hotel, I went to a Notre Dame reunion.
- It was terrific.
- I didn't know you went to Notre Dame.
I didn't, but those guys really know how to throw a bash.
Word to the wise, Mary...
The best kind of reunion... is one where you don't know anybody.
- I'll, uh, keep that in mind.
- Yeah.
- Remember cute, little Archie, Mary?
- Uh-huh.
I'm so glad I brought the camp scrapbook.
It's nice to point out the people as I tell you about them.
Gee, Twinks, all we've talked about all night long is camp.
I'd love to hear about your life now, you know, or even college.
Anything as recent as high school, even.
Okay, sure.
I understand, Mar.
Hey, look what you wrote here.
"2 good 2 be... 4-got-10."
You wrote it with the numbers.
Wasn't that clever of me?
- Oh, you always were such a kick.
- [Knocking]
- Excuse me.
- Mary, you haven't changed a bit.
Your apartment is still as neat as your tent used to be.
Thank you.
Hi, kid.
I got the brochures from the travel agency.
They have this trip to Hawaii that looks...
- Hi.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you had company.
Oh, I'm not company.
I'm Twinks.
Twinks?
Rhoda Morgenstern, Twinks McFarland.
- Twinks.
- We know each other from Owmwuk.
Owmwuk.
You know, Camp Owmwuk.
Twinks just got a job at the station.
She's the new receptionist.
Receptionist.
Ah, at last a word I know.
You two must have a great deal to talk over, so I'll come back tomorrow.
No, don't go!
I mean... stay.
Okay.
Yes, stay.
I'd love to look at your brochures.
Rhoda and I are just trying to figure out where we might spend our vacation.
Hawaii!
Oh, how fun.
When?
Maybe I can get some time off and go too.
Well, actually, um, Twinks, we're not sure that I can even get the time off.
You know how busy things are at the station.
Yes.
Well, then maybe Rhoda and I can go alone.
Rhoda, would you believe... that it's been, uh, oh, 18 years since Twinks and I saw each other?
Marvelous.
- You're not from here, are you, Rhoda?
- What do you mean?
Well,
I can just tell by the way you talk.
You're right.
I'm from England.
Oh!
Don't you just love Minneapolis?
I just love everyone I've met here!
Listen, uh, I gotta go.
Nice meetin' you...
Twinks.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Oh, I gotta run too.
I'm running late, as usual.
My fiance will kill me.
He says since I've been here, I've spent so much time with all my new friends... that I hardly see him at all.
- I'll get your coat.
- I'll help you.
Oh, Mary, it was so much fun tonight.
How 'bout lunch tomorrow?
Uh, well, tomorrow I, uh, I know that I'm doing something.
I just, uh, can't think what it is.
- Has that ever happened to you, Rhoda?
- No, never.
Well, that's okay.
I'll pencil you in for Thursday then.
Then we can make plans for the weekend later.
- Oh, Rhoda.
- l-I'm on a big diet.
I don't eat all week.
And I fast on weekends.
Oh, that's all right.
We can find something nonfattening to do, like window shopping.
I know we'll have lots in common.
- Bye, Mar.
- Bye, Twinks.
- Bye, Rhoda.
- Bye.
- Twinks, huh?
- [Groans]
- Uh-huh!
- What?
I just figured out what Twinks must be short for..."Tiddledywinks."
What a night.
You just can't imagine.
- I had to be there, huh?
- And unfortunately, I was.
Well, you met her, and you know what old camp stories are like.
- How would I know about camp?
- You must have gone to camp.
No.
Actually, I did go one summer... to a day camp in the Bronx.
Camp Adelman.
- Camp Adelman?
- Yeah.
I was 12 years old before I knew Adelman wasn't an Indian name.
It was from 1:00 to 3:00 in the afternoon.
You got there and you made some ceramic monstrosity in arts and crafts.
Then you drank warm orange drink from a carton.
Then you went home.
You don't know what a deprived childhood is until you've sung campfire songs... on the subway.
"2 good 2 be 4..."
I was 12 years old.
I guess we talked about camp enough for one night.
That's all right.
We didn't just talk about camp.
You think that's all we talked about?
- We talked about other things.
- Yeah?
- We talked about her fiance.
- Oh, what's he do?
- He's a counselor.
- Marriage?
Camp.
I'd tell you to stop reading over my shoulder, but you need all the practice you can get.
- Hi.
- You're late, Mar.
I know.
I had to walk up ten flights of stairs.
- Is the elevator out of order?
- No, but it stops... at the reception area, if you know what I mean.
Twinks is getting to you too, huh?
There are some people who don't see each other for years, and it doesn't matter.
They can just pick right up where they left off and be great friends.
- Yeah.
- Twinks isn't one of them.
Last week we finally ran out of camp talk.
Yes, finally.
And we had nothing left to say to each other.
Maybe she'll get tired of this place and look for a new job.
Yeah, and I know the perfect one for her... greeting planes in Hawaii.
That friend of yours...
I'm gonna give her about one more chance.
About what?
To stop hugging me.
Rudeness doesn't work.
Nastiness doesn't work.
She just keeps right on coming.
She refuses to take a hint.
- Tell her to leave you alone.
- That was my hint!
Mary, why do you keep doing this to me?
Oh, this thing is just getting bigger and bigger.
I'm gonna have to ease out of the friendship thing with her.
How are you gonna do that?
I'll just go out there and tell her that I'm gonna be very busy... for the next few weeks, that I will call her when I'm free.
It's as simple as that.
Maybe I'll do it by phone.
Can't face her, huh, Mar?
Murr, I'd like to test this item on our show tonight.
See what you think of it.
Uh, Twinks?
Hi.
Mary.
Listen, uh, Twinks, I...
Oh, really?
How wonderful.
Well, sure, I'd love to.
The, uh, the 12th.
Yes, I'll make a note of it.
The 12th.
Right.
Bye, Twinks.
- Come on.
- Hmm?
You said the 12th.
What's the 12th?
The 12th is a date in the calendar.
Well, even Ted knows that.
Come on.
What's happening on the 12th?
Twinks is getting married on the 12th.
I don't understand.
What's wrong?
That's good news.
My wife says married girls don't like to go around with single girls.
You should be thrilled!
There's still the matter of the wedding.
But it's only a wedding.
That's not such a big deal.
Yes, it is a big deal when you're going to be the maid of honor!
Anyway, her best friend from California... can't come out to be in the wedding, so what could I say?
- I didn't have the heart to say no.
- You mean the nerve.
Don't you know what standing up for a wedding means?
It's not just walking down the aisle.
I know.
I stood up for 11 weddings in college.
As maid of honor, you have to go running here and there, choosing things, arranging this...
well, you know.
Right.
Well, when you're younger, it doesn't matter.
You get all caught up in the hysteria of the wedding.
But now it's different.
I just don't want to do it.
I don't blame you.
Listen, when you're single in college, it doesn't matter.
You don't care if another girl gets married.
Now I can't stand to see another girl walk down the aisle in a movie theater.
You know the worst part?
I feel like a hypocrite.
I just don't feel close enough to Twinks to be her maid of honor.
Hey, Mary, call her and tell her something came up.
You're right.
Enough is enough.
I will call her and tell her that I'm going out of town, and that's honest.
- How is that honest?
- I'll go.
You're the only person I know who'd take a trip rather than lie.
Hello, uh, Twinks?
Uh, Mary.
Listen, Twinks.
Rhoda and I are...
Purple?
Well, no, Twinks, purple has never really been one of my favorite colors.
I...
Pink.
Okay.
Yes, pink is... is fine.
Oh, never mind.
It was...
It was nothing important.
- Rhoda?
Yeah, she's here.
- What?
- Just a second.
Twinks for you.
- Uh-uh.
- Wh
- What do you mean, "uh-uh"?
- I'm not gonna talk to her.
Rhoda, she knows you're here.
You can't do this to me!
Okay.
Okay, I'll talk to her... for you.
Yeah?
Isn't that too bad?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
See you around.
- That was short.
- You bet it was short.
Okay, so I don't handle people as well as you do.
Maybe I'm a hypocrite.
I don't know.
Before you say another word, shake hands with the bridesmaid who's wearing purple.
Hi, Tommy.
How's the social event of the season coming along?
Well, the rehearsal dinner is tonight, then it'll be all over tomorrow.
I'm just gonna make it.
I'm overdrawn at the bank for the first time in my life.
- I don't believe it.
- What?
A mimeographed wedding invitation.
Aren't they usually engraved?
- Can someone tell me what this is about?
- What is this?
"Mr. and Mrs. Simon McFarland...
"request the honor of your presence at the marriage... of their daughter Rochelle Margaret to Mr. Arnold...
Tvedt."
There he goes again.
Can't you read anything without mispronouncing it?
- How would you pronounce that then?
- "Tvedt."
T-V-E-D-T.
Oh, must be a typo.
What is a "tvedt"?
It's a name.
Arnold Tvedt.
Oh.
- And who is Rochelle Margaret McFarland?
- Twinks.
I should have known.
Poor Twinks.
I just realized.
[Lou] What?
Well, it's just something girls do when they're going with a guy.
They doodle her name and his together, you know, to just see how it's gonna look together.
What a shock it must have been the first time she wrote it down and saw it.
Twinks Tvedt.
Hey, say, Murray, is it all right if I ride with you to the wedding?
- I won't get as wrinkled that way.
- Oh, Ted, you're going?
- Sure.
- Ted'll go anywhere he can wear his tux.
- How 'bout you?
Are you going, Murray?
- Well, I don't know.
I guess we all have to go.
We see her every day.
She does lots of favors.
Well, Mr. Grant, are you, uh, go...
I...
No.
Hi, all.
Mary, here are the dresses for you and Rhoda.
I was so worried they wouldn't get here on time.
I sent to Detroit for them.
Oh, I see you all got your wedding invitations.
I'll put the R.S.V.P. list on the bulletin board and pick it up later.
Oh, Mr. Grant, are you coming?
My father can't be here.
He's overseas.
You remind me so much of him.
I'm not gonna have to give you away or anything, am I?
Oh, no, I just want you to be there.
Yeah, all right.
All right.
Oh, I'm gonna miss you all... so much.
Yeah, same here.
Ohh!
Oh, what a beautiful thing to say.
I guess it's the way I put things.
Oh, Mary, I still can't get over that rehearsal.
Oh, Mary, I still can't get over that rehearsal.
I can't hear you, Rhoda.
The stuff packed around the dress is making too much noise.
I said, that rehearsal...
If that's any indication of what the wedding's gonna be, we're in for a lot of laughs.
What'd you think of Arnold?
You know, it's funny how some people look like their names.
Like I once knew this guy named Fox.
This guy named Fox had red, bushy hair and little, beady eyes.
Now, Arnold, he looks just like a tvedt.
Hey, what's taking you so long, kid?
I want to see the dress.
Mary?
Are you having trouble in there?
- Mary!
- [Quietly] Yeah?
Oh, it's bad, huh?
Well, come out, kid.
How bad could it be?
That bad, huh?
I'd say, uh, 'bout the only thing worse than this dress... would be this dress...
[Both] in purple.
Are you all right?
Who would have thought that the stuff I said was packed around the dress... was the dress?
But wait, it gets better.
As maid of honor, I get the special added attraction... of this sash.
Well, now, no wonder.
That makes it.
Now all you need is a lamb.
You can go as Little Bo Peep.
I can't get over...
Rhoda, to think that we are going to be seen...
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
To be seen in public!
Well, listen, if we get rid of the hoops, it might help.
- Get rid of the hoops?
- Right.
And for a cute touch, we could get sticks and roll them alongside of us.
If we got rid of the hoops and, uh, and the bows...
Right.
We take off the bows, those puffy sleeves, the skirt...
We'll be walking down the aisle in our underwear, Mary.
This is gonna be a challenge...
it really is... to see if we can turn these dresses into something halfway decent.
I'm beginning to look forward to the wedding.
You've gotta be kidding.
No, I mean it.
I know I didn't want to do it at first, but... now that I'm involved in it, all caught up in the fun of the wedding and all...
- [Doorbell Buzzes] - [Rhoda] Who's this?
- Hi!
Twinks!
- Hi.
Oh, you've got it on.
I was hoping to get here before you opened the box.
I wish you had.
- Twinks, what is it?
Tell me.
- I... can't.
- Did you and Arnold have a fight?
- Oh, no.
- [Car Horn Honking]
- Oh, that Arnold, he's so impatient.
He can't stand it when I'm away from him for one second.
Isn't that cute?
- Will you tell me what's wrong?
- Mary.
My best, best... best, very best friend is flying out after all, and I...
You want her to be the maid of honor?
That's it!
Oh, you're not mad?
I knew you'd understand.
- [Horn Honking]
- Oh, that's Arnold.
I better tell him to wait while you take off the dress.
Take off th-the dress?
Yes, so Patsy can wear it.
Well, I ju...
I just...
I just paid for it.
Oh, Mar, I couldn't get another dress from Detroit by tomorrow.
I'm sure you and she can work something out money wise.
Oh, isn't it lucky that you're both the same size?
- [Horn Honking]
- Oh!
That must be the prerequisite for being her best friend... you gotta be a size eight.
Mary, that is why I stay away from warm, friendly people.
- They get you every time.
- She did get me a little, didn't she?
A little?
Mary, you've been running yourself ragged for her, planning her wedding, giving her a shower, buying gifts, just because you shared a bunk 18 years ago.
Then she comes in here and does this?
Ahh.
It's ridiculous.
Frankly, it's not my idea of a friendship.
- You're just gonna take it, aren't you?
- Maybe I won't.
Ah, yes, you will.
You always do.
Well, just maybe this time I won't, that's all.
- Oh, thanks, Mar. - [Horn Honking]
Oh, Arnold!
We were thinking it would look better without the hoops.
- Listen...
Twinks.
- Hmm?
You know, I've been... sort of running myself ragged for you the last couple of weeks, giving showers and gifts and everything... because I thought you were my friend, and now you come in here and tell me some other girl... is just gonna walk down the aisle in my dress.
You know, that somehow bothers me.
Frankly, that's just not my idea of friendship.
You're right, Mary.
It might look better without the hoops.
I'll see you at the wedding.
Bye!
You're right.
I'm glad I got that out of my system.
I am.
Well, I was pretty proud of you.
However, it might have been more effective had she heard you!
Why?
It wouldn't have made any difference at all.
There is no getting through to that girl.
She doesn't listen.
- It's like talking to a wall.
- What are you getting so excited about?
It's all over, and frankly, I don't really mind.
But I do!
I'm still a bridesmaid!
Well, I gotta admit,
I found one great moment of satisfaction during that ceremony.
Really?
What was that?
When I saw that beautiful girl, that friend from California, walking down the aisle in that dress, looking absolutely hide...
Actually, she didn't, you know, look that bad.
Good try, Mar.
How 'bout the viciousness when Twinks threw the bouquet?
Boy, you had to be a real fighter to get that one.
Those girls were more desperate than I was, but not as tricky.

Say, did you meet the new receptionist?
She's such a warm girl.
I'll say she's warm.
I introduced myself, and she hugged me.
The entire time we talked, she kept touching me, as though she couldn't believe I was real.
We all have that problem with you, Ted.
I just got hugged out there!
- It's happening to a lot of people.
- Hi!
- Did she get you too, Mary?
- Did who get me?
They got a new receptionist downstairs.
Didn't you see her on the way up?
No.
There was a crowd in the lobby area, though, around the reception desk.
- What's she like?
- Mary Richards!
She's very friendly.
- Hi there.
- Hi!
Don't you know me?
Well, yes, of course I know you.
You're the new receptionist.
[Giggles] Think back, Mar.
Didn't you go to camp when you were a little kid?
Yes.
Yes, I did.
I went to Camp Sunshine for five years.
- And that's where I know you from!
- No.
Oh.
Camp Owmwuk.
Didn't you go to Camp Owmwuk in 1950?
I did!
I went to Camp Owmwuk one year.
That's where I know you...
- No, no.
- That's it!
Yes!
Camp Owmwuk.
It's me...
Twinks.
Twinks!
- Well, well!
- Well.
You haven't changed a bit.
How are you?
Oh, I'm just fine, Mar.
- Oh, well.
- How are you?
Just fine!
Twinks and I were friends in camp.
Not since we were 12.
That makes them 30, Ted.
Wow!
After 18 years, uh, what do you say?
What's new?
Well, they moved the camp to the other side of the lake after it burned down.
- Oh.
- And my father retired.
And, um, I got a new car, and I'm getting married.
Hey, that's terrific!
No kidding!
Well, yeah, the old car needed four new tires, so...
I meant getting married.
Oh, yeah.
Well, that's why I moved to Minneapolis... to be closer to my fiance.
Oh, Mar, isn't it somethin'?
- Us working at the same place.
- It really is!
Oh, Mar, tell me what's new with you.
Well, I moved here, what...
- Mary, don't you have some work to do?
- Yes.
Yes, sir.
Sorry.
- I really have to get to work.
- Yeah, me too.
- How 'bout dinner tonight?
- Fine.
Oh, I have so much to tell you about the kids at camp.
You, uh, still keep up with some of'em, do you?
All of'em.
I still put out the camp alumni bulletin.
Mary, haven't you been getting yours?
Uh, well, no, not for some time now.
Oh, well, I'll get you all the back copies.
- Okay.
- I'll see you later, Mar.
- Right.
- Murray.
Ted!
She was always such a warm, friendly person.
She always used to make up people's bunks for them at camp.
I don't trust warm and friendly people.
Now, if you're through with old home week,
- shall we get on with the mail?
- Yes.
Sorry about all the hysteria out there, but it is fun catching up with old friends.
- Yeah, I did that a couple of weeks ago.
- Oh, who'd you see?
The Second Marine Division.
My old outfit.
- We had a reunion.
- It must have been fun.
Fun?
They booked this big room in a hotel.
The first thing they did was pin this tag on my coat... that said, " Sergeant Grant.
Remember me?"
- So, what's wrong with that?
- What's wrong with that?
There I was, surrounded by 300 drunken ex-privates, and suddenly I didn't have rank on them anymore.
It's amazing how they remembered all the little slights... that I committed in boot camp 20 years ago.
Hey, 'bout 20 years ago, you and I were both in camp.
[Chuckling] I'm sorry.
Of course, some of the reunions I've been to haven't been so bad.
Right there in that same hotel, I went to a Notre Dame reunion.
- It was terrific.
- I didn't know you went to Notre Dame.
I didn't, but those guys really know how to throw a bash.
Word to the wise, Mary...
The best kind of reunion... is one where you don't know anybody.
- I'll, uh, keep that in mind.
- Yeah.
- Remember cute, little Archie, Mary?
- Uh-huh.
I'm so glad I brought the camp scrapbook.
It's nice to point out the people as I tell you about them.
Gee, Twinks, all we've talked about all night long is camp.
I'd love to hear about your life now, you know, or even college.
Anything as recent as high school, even.
Okay, sure.
I understand, Mar.
Hey, look what you wrote here.
"2 good 2 be... 4-got-10."
You wrote it with the numbers.
Wasn't that clever of me?
- Oh, you always were such a kick.
- [Knocking]
- Excuse me.
- Mary, you haven't changed a bit.
Your apartment is still as neat as your tent used to be.
Thank you.
Hi, kid.
I got the brochures from the travel agency.
They have this trip to Hawaii that looks...
- Hi.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you had company.
Oh, I'm not company.
I'm Twinks.
Twinks?
Rhoda Morgenstern, Twinks McFarland.
- Twinks.
- We know each other from Owmwuk.
Owmwuk.
You know, Camp Owmwuk.
Twinks just got a job at the station.
She's the new receptionist.
Receptionist.
Ah, at last a word I know.
You two must have a great deal to talk over, so I'll come back tomorrow.
No, don't go!
I mean... stay.
Okay.
Yes, stay.
I'd love to look at your brochures.
Rhoda and I are just trying to figure out where we might spend our vacation.
Hawaii!
Oh, how fun.
When?
Maybe I can get some time off and go too.
Well, actually, um, Twinks, we're not sure that I can even get the time off.
You know how busy things are at the station.
Yes.
Well, then maybe Rhoda and I can go alone.
Rhoda, would you believe... that it's been, uh, oh, 18 years since Twinks and I saw each other?
Marvelous.
- You're not from here, are you, Rhoda?
- What do you mean?
Well,
I can just tell by the way you talk.
You're right.
I'm from England.
Oh!
Don't you just love Minneapolis?
I just love everyone I've met here!
Listen, uh, I gotta go.
Nice meetin' you...
Twinks.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Oh, I gotta run too.
I'm running late, as usual.
My fiance will kill me.
He says since I've been here, I've spent so much time with all my new friends... that I hardly see him at all.
- I'll get your coat.
- I'll help you.
Oh, Mary, it was so much fun tonight.
How 'bout lunch tomorrow?
Uh, well, tomorrow I, uh, I know that I'm doing something.
I just, uh, can't think what it is.
- Has that ever happened to you, Rhoda?
- No, never.
Well, that's okay.
I'll pencil you in for Thursday then.
Then we can make plans for the weekend later.
- Oh, Rhoda.
- l-I'm on a big diet.
I don't eat all week.
And I fast on weekends.
Oh, that's all right.
We can find something nonfattening to do, like window shopping.
I know we'll have lots in common.
- Bye, Mar.
- Bye, Twinks.
- Bye, Rhoda.
- Bye.
- Twinks, huh?
- [Groans]
- Uh-huh!
- What?
I just figured out what Twinks must be short for..."Tiddledywinks."
What a night.
You just can't imagine.
- I had to be there, huh?
- And unfortunately, I was.
Well, you met her, and you know what old camp stories are like.
- How would I know about camp?
- You must have gone to camp.
No.
Actually, I did go one summer... to a day camp in the Bronx.
Camp Adelman.
- Camp Adelman?
- Yeah.
I was 12 years old before I knew Adelman wasn't an Indian name.
It was from 1:00 to 3:00 in the afternoon.
You got there and you made some ceramic monstrosity in arts and crafts.
Then you drank warm orange drink from a carton.
Then you went home.
You don't know what a deprived childhood is until you've sung campfire songs... on the subway.
"2 good 2 be 4..."
I was 12 years old.
I guess we talked about camp enough for one night.
That's all right.
We didn't just talk about camp.
You think that's all we talked about?
- We talked about other things.
- Yeah?
- We talked about her fiance.
- Oh, what's he do?
- He's a counselor.
- Marriage?
Camp.
I'd tell you to stop reading over my shoulder, but you need all the practice you can get.
- Hi.
- You're late, Mar.
I know.
I had to walk up ten flights of stairs.
- Is the elevator out of order?
- No, but it stops... at the reception area, if you know what I mean.
Twinks is getting to you too, huh?
There are some people who don't see each other for years, and it doesn't matter.
They can just pick right up where they left off and be great friends.
- Yeah.
- Twinks isn't one of them.
Last week we finally ran out of camp talk.
Yes, finally.
And we had nothing left to say to each other.
Maybe she'll get tired of this place and look for a new job.
Yeah, and I know the perfect one for her... greeting planes in Hawaii.
That friend of yours...
I'm gonna give her about one more chance.
About what?
To stop hugging me.
Rudeness doesn't work.
Nastiness doesn't work.
She just keeps right on coming.
She refuses to take a hint.
- Tell her to leave you alone.
- That was my hint!
Mary, why do you keep doing this to me?
Oh, this thing is just getting bigger and bigger.
I'm gonna have to ease out of the friendship thing with her.
How are you gonna do that?
I'll just go out there and tell her that I'm gonna be very busy... for the next few weeks, that I will call her when I'm free.
It's as simple as that.
Maybe I'll do it by phone.
Can't face her, huh, Mar?
Murr, I'd like to test this item on our show tonight.
See what you think of it.
Uh, Twinks?
Hi.
Mary.
Listen, uh, Twinks, I...
Oh, really?
How wonderful.
Well, sure, I'd love to.
The, uh, the 12th.
Yes, I'll make a note of it.
The 12th.
Right.
Bye, Twinks.
- Come on.
- Hmm?
You said the 12th.
What's the 12th?
The 12th is a date in the calendar.
Well, even Ted knows that.
Come on.
What's happening on the 12th?
Twinks is getting married on the 12th.
I don't understand.
What's wrong?
That's good news.
My wife says married girls don't like to go around with single girls.
You should be thrilled!
There's still the matter of the wedding.
But it's only a wedding.
That's not such a big deal.
Yes, it is a big deal when you're going to be the maid of honor!
Anyway, her best friend from California... can't come out to be in the wedding, so what could I say?
- I didn't have the heart to say no.
- You mean the nerve.
Don't you know what standing up for a wedding means?
It's not just walking down the aisle.
I know.
I stood up for 11 weddings in college.
As maid of honor, you have to go running here and there, choosing things, arranging this...
well, you know.
Right.
Well, when you're younger, it doesn't matter.
You get all caught up in the hysteria of the wedding.
But now it's different.
I just don't want to do it.
I don't blame you.
Listen, when you're single in college, it doesn't matter.
You don't care if another girl gets married.
Now I can't stand to see another girl walk down the aisle in a movie theater.
You know the worst part?
I feel like a hypocrite.
I just don't feel close enough to Twinks to be her maid of honor.
Hey, Mary, call her and tell her something came up.
You're right.
Enough is enough.
I will call her and tell her that I'm going out of town, and that's honest.
- How is that honest?
- I'll go.
You're the only person I know who'd take a trip rather than lie.
Hello, uh, Twinks?
Uh, Mary.
Listen, Twinks.
Rhoda and I are...
Purple?
Well, no, Twinks, purple has never really been one of my favorite colors.
I...
Pink.
Okay.
Yes, pink is... is fine.
Oh, never mind.
It was...
It was nothing important.
- Rhoda?
Yeah, she's here.
- What?
- Just a second.
Twinks for you.
- Uh-uh.
- Wh
- What do you mean, "uh-uh"?
- I'm not gonna talk to her.
Rhoda, she knows you're here.
You can't do this to me!
Okay.
Okay, I'll talk to her... for you.
Yeah?
Isn't that too bad?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
See you around.
- That was short.
- You bet it was short.
Okay, so I don't handle people as well as you do.
Maybe I'm a hypocrite.
I don't know.
Before you say another word, shake hands with the bridesmaid who's wearing purple.
Hi, Tommy.
How's the social event of the season coming along?
Well, the rehearsal dinner is tonight, then it'll be all over tomorrow.
I'm just gonna make it.
I'm overdrawn at the bank for the first time in my life.
- I don't believe it.
- What?
A mimeographed wedding invitation.
Aren't they usually engraved?
- Can someone tell me what this is about?
- What is this?
"Mr. and Mrs. Simon McFarland...
"request the honor of your presence at the marriage... of their daughter Rochelle Margaret to Mr. Arnold...
Tvedt."
There he goes again.
Can't you read anything without mispronouncing it?
- How would you pronounce that then?
- "Tvedt."
T-V-E-D-T.
Oh, must be a typo.
What is a "tvedt"?
It's a name.
Arnold Tvedt.
Oh.
- And who is Rochelle Margaret McFarland?
- Twinks.
I should have known.
Poor Twinks.
I just realized.
[Lou] What?
Well, it's just something girls do when they're going with a guy.
They doodle her name and his together, you know, to just see how it's gonna look together.
What a shock it must have been the first time she wrote it down and saw it.
Twinks Tvedt.
Hey, say, Murray, is it all right if I ride with you to the wedding?
- I won't get as wrinkled that way.
- Oh, Ted, you're going?
- Sure.
- Ted'll go anywhere he can wear his tux.
- How 'bout you?
Are you going, Murray?
- Well, I don't know.
I guess we all have to go.
We see her every day.
She does lots of favors.
Well, Mr. Grant, are you, uh, go...
I...
No.
Hi, all.
Mary, here are the dresses for you and Rhoda.
I was so worried they wouldn't get here on time.
I sent to Detroit for them.
Oh, I see you all got your wedding invitations.
I'll put the R.S.V.P. list on the bulletin board and pick it up later.
Oh, Mr. Grant, are you coming?
My father can't be here.
He's overseas.
You remind me so much of him.
I'm not gonna have to give you away or anything, am I?
Oh, no, I just want you to be there.
Yeah, all right.
All right.
Oh, I'm gonna miss you all... so much.
Yeah, same here.
Ohh!
Oh, what a beautiful thing to say.
I guess it's the way I put things.
Oh, Mary, I still can't get over that rehearsal.
Oh, Mary, I still can't get over that rehearsal.
I can't hear you, Rhoda.
The stuff packed around the dress is making too much noise.
I said, that rehearsal...
If that's any indication of what the wedding's gonna be, we're in for a lot of laughs.
What'd you think of Arnold?
You know, it's funny how some people look like their names.
Like I once knew this guy named Fox.
This guy named Fox had red, bushy hair and little, beady eyes.
Now, Arnold, he looks just like a tvedt.
Hey, what's taking you so long, kid?
I want to see the dress.
Mary?
Are you having trouble in there?
- Mary!
- [Quietly] Yeah?
Oh, it's bad, huh?
Well, come out, kid.
How bad could it be?
That bad, huh?
I'd say, uh, 'bout the only thing worse than this dress... would be this dress...
[Both] in purple.
Are you all right?
Who would have thought that the stuff I said was packed around the dress... was the dress?
But wait, it gets better.
As maid of honor, I get the special added attraction... of this sash.
Well, now, no wonder.
That makes it.
Now all you need is a lamb.
You can go as Little Bo Peep.
I can't get over...
Rhoda, to think that we are going to be seen...
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
To be seen in public!
Well, listen, if we get rid of the hoops, it might help.
- Get rid of the hoops?
- Right.
And for a cute touch, we could get sticks and roll them alongside of us.
If we got rid of the hoops and, uh, and the bows...
Right.
We take off the bows, those puffy sleeves, the skirt...
We'll be walking down the aisle in our underwear, Mary.
This is gonna be a challenge...
it really is... to see if we can turn these dresses into something halfway decent.
I'm beginning to look forward to the wedding.
You've gotta be kidding.
No, I mean it.
I know I didn't want to do it at first, but... now that I'm involved in it, all caught up in the fun of the wedding and all...
- [Doorbell Buzzes] - [Rhoda] Who's this?
- Hi!
Twinks!
- Hi.
Oh, you've got it on.
I was hoping to get here before you opened the box.
I wish you had.
- Twinks, what is it?
Tell me.
- I... can't.
- Did you and Arnold have a fight?
- Oh, no.
- [Car Horn Honking]
- Oh, that Arnold, he's so impatient.
He can't stand it when I'm away from him for one second.
Isn't that cute?
- Will you tell me what's wrong?
- Mary.
My best, best... best, very best friend is flying out after all, and I...
You want her to be the maid of honor?
That's it!
Oh, you're not mad?
I knew you'd understand.
- [Horn Honking]
- Oh, that's Arnold.
I better tell him to wait while you take off the dress.
Take off th-the dress?
Yes, so Patsy can wear it.
Well, I ju...
I just...
I just paid for it.
Oh, Mar, I couldn't get another dress from Detroit by tomorrow.
I'm sure you and she can work something out money wise.
Oh, isn't it lucky that you're both the same size?
- [Horn Honking]
- Oh!
That must be the prerequisite for being her best friend... you gotta be a size eight.
Mary, that is why I stay away from warm, friendly people.
- They get you every time.
- She did get me a little, didn't she?
A little?
Mary, you've been running yourself ragged for her, planning her wedding, giving her a shower, buying gifts, just because you shared a bunk 18 years ago.
Then she comes in here and does this?
Ahh.
It's ridiculous.
Frankly, it's not my idea of a friendship.
- You're just gonna take it, aren't you?
- Maybe I won't.
Ah, yes, you will.
You always do.
Well, just maybe this time I won't, that's all.
- Oh, thanks, Mar. - [Horn Honking]
Oh, Arnold!
We were thinking it would look better without the hoops.
- Listen...
Twinks.
- Hmm?
You know, I've been... sort of running myself ragged for you the last couple of weeks, giving showers and gifts and everything... because I thought you were my friend, and now you come in here and tell me some other girl... is just gonna walk down the aisle in my dress.
You know, that somehow bothers me.
Frankly, that's just not my idea of friendship.
You're right, Mary.
It might look better without the hoops.
I'll see you at the wedding.
Bye!
You're right.
I'm glad I got that out of my system.
I am.
Well, I was pretty proud of you.
However, it might have been more effective had she heard you!
Why?
It wouldn't have made any difference at all.
There is no getting through to that girl.
She doesn't listen.
- It's like talking to a wall.
- What are you getting so excited about?
It's all over, and frankly, I don't really mind.
But I do!
I'm still a bridesmaid!
Well, I gotta admit,
I found one great moment of satisfaction during that ceremony.
Really?
What was that?
When I saw that beautiful girl, that friend from California, walking down the aisle in that dress, looking absolutely hide...
Actually, she didn't, you know, look that bad.
Good try, Mar.
How 'bout the viciousness when Twinks threw the bouquet?
Boy, you had to be a real fighter to get that one.
Those girls were more desperate than I was, but not as tricky.
[Mews]
SHE KILLED IN ECSTASY
I miss you, my darling.
You left me, my only love.
Our time together was far too short.
Just two fleeting years.
And then disaster struck unexpectedly.
I'll never forget our time together.
You gave me more than I dreamed of.
How can I ever forget you?
Your love, your caresses.
You are inside me, my darling.
In me, you live on.
Nothing will destroy your memory.
- Are you happy?
- Yes, incredibly happy.
In a week's time, I'll hear the decision of the Medical Council.
I know what those bigots think about my work... but they can't possibly reject it.
They'll have to support my achievement... my plans.
They'll have to reach a positive decision.
Don't get too excited.
We haven't got their answer yet.
Come on, sweetheart.
I want to show you something.
This is the result of my research.
At first, I used animals.
But in the final phase, I used human embryos.
Human and animal hormones... are injected, resulting in revolutionary changes.
You get viable organisms.
The hormones make them more resistant to cancer, heart failure... and physical and mental decline.
Our love was a powerful, intense experience.
Our bodies merged, our soul became one.
We were united in love, passion and hope.
Your hopes for the future were in the hands of a few people.
They would determine the course of your research... and of both our lives.
They had the power to destroy you... or to confirm your greatness as a scientist.
Dr.Johnson, come forward, please.
- Your experiments are inhuman.
- What do you mean?
- They are even criminal.
- You are a charlatan.
Your plan to alter the human organism with the aid of hormones... is, in our view, a crime.
I'd like to go even further than my colleague Donen.
I followed your research with interest... but it is an infringement of the Hippocratic oath.
There can only be one answer.
We will ask the Medical Council... to stop Dr.Johnson from practicing medicine.
Don't you understand?
It's not about the Hippocratic oath.
It's about mankind, about a better existence.
It is neither a crime nor a violation.
I am right.
You are guilty, not me!
Dr.Johnson, I have here reports about your embryo experiments.
You have denied human embryos the possibility of life.
I would call that a criminal act and a blasphemy.
Blasphemy?
What kind of a world do you live in?
Only one thing counts:
to help people, regardless of morals.
Dr.Johnson, the Council orders you not to continue with your experiments.
Why do you persist in your beliefs?
As you know, I have experimented with humans.
- And what was the result?
- A convincing one.
Enough of that!
Take your papers... and burn them!
Dr.Johnson, you've heard our decision.
Stop your experiments.
What happened?
Darling!
Darling!
They-They came and destroyed everything.
I tried to stop them, but they raged like madmen.
- Who was it?
- I don't know.
There were lots of them.
They really hate you.
They shouted your name.
They want to kill you.
- You're hurt.
- It's just a scratch.
Come on, darling.
Don't worry about me.
You have yourself to think about.
You are a criminal, Dr.Johnson.
- You are committing blasphemy.
- Charlatan!
-Johnson, you are a criminal.
- Expelled!
- You should be killed!
- You are an animal, Johnson!
An animal!
An animal!
You are expelled for good, forever!
- No, no, no, no!
- Expelled!
Expelled!
- An animal!
An animal!
- Forever!
Forever!
An animal!
Yes, yes, yes!
I'm an animal!
Dr. Huston, please.
It's Mrs.Johnson.
My husband is raging like a madman.
I think he's going crazy.
Could you come over?
But if you just talk to him!
One word from you--
I took him away from the city.
We went to a small island where we had a house.
It was an isolated island, like the sky above the clouds.
The house was like a dream-- a labyrinth where the steps echo... where words rebound and return again and again.
Darling.
Darling!
Do you know it?
I know it.
I can do it.
It is no crime.
No crime.
As doctors and humanists, we must strongly condemn those... who contravene ethics, the laws of humanity.
Under the guise of science, fanatical doctors all too often... don't even hesitate from committing criminal acts.
These dreamers must be stopped.
How is mankind to trust us if the charlatans amongst us... the unscrupulous criminals, are not excluded from our midst?
Research allows these people too many opportunities.
We are forced to defend ourselves with all the power we have available.
Otherwise, we dig our own grave.
We must not turn a blind eye to the abuse... committed in the name of medicine.
The countless victims accuse us.
We must not turn a deaf ear.
We must try everything we can to protect people... from dubious experiments.
That's what we are sworn to do.
I thank Professor Walker for his passionate and honest words.
I don't have to go into the case Professor Walker refers to.
We all know about Dr.Johnson's damnable actions.
He will never practice again for as long as he lives.
At our request, the Medical Council has struck him off the register.
- What do you want?
- I didn't mean to startle you.
Don't you remember me?
I saw you after the laboratory was destroyed.
If you want to help us, find the men who destroyed my husband's life.
Who knows?
I might just do that.
There is no doubt as to the crimes of which Dr.Johnson is guilty.
If more evidence is needed, we will provide it.
So much for the legal side of the case.
I can only say, like Professor Walker... that I am filled with disgust and loathing when I hear... of the crimes he committed in the name of science.
Excuse me.
May I ask a stupid question?
- Am I allowed to smoke in here?
- No, that's not permitted.
Thank you, Dr. Huston.
Excuse me.
How do you know my name?
Have we met before?
No, but that doesn't matter.
I just happen to know you.
Johnson is no doctor!
Criminal!
Dr.Johnson!
Blasphemy!
Charlatan!
Criminal!
Expelled!
You should be killed!
An animal!
Expelled!
An animal!
An animal!
Forever!
Expelled!
An animal!
Forever!
Expelled!
An animal!
An animal!
Darling?
Can you hear me, darling?
I want to help people.
Why won't you let me help?
Why?
Can you hear me?
Do you hear me?
I just want to help you.
I love you.
I love you!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
- Why am I treated like a criminal?
- I can't take any more!
I can't take any more!
I am right.
I am right.
Believe me, I just want to help.
Help.
-Johnson, it is blasphemy.
- The spawn of hell!
You are crazy, Johnson.
Crazy!
Crazy!
Crazy!
Where are you?
No, no!
No, no!
I am searching for you, my love... even if it is only your breath caressing me... or a solitary gaze from your eyes.
You left me without a word.
How will I live without you?
Tell me!
I can't do it without taking revenge on your killers.
My revenge will be cruel.
The price for our destroyed lives can only be death.
The world we live in today is ruled by one thing only-- money.
Every day, people are more corrupted, more susceptible to crime.
If we don't fight against it, we will head towards chaos.
We should place all our hope in the young.
But what are they like?
How do they behave?
Do they learn from their parents' mistakes?
One thing is certain.
Today, the young are militant.
Or rather, they don't fit into a pattern.
They have their reservations and don't want to carry out orders.
They claim they want a better world.
They protest against war, demonstrate, incite riots.
All the things we read about every day in the papers.
And we mustn't forget drugs.
These substances alter reality.
They convey an unreal image that doesn't agree with reality.
Inevitably, a young person on drugs rejects the social order.
He ends up being immoral, as it were.
He doesn't fit into the social order with which he must identify.
The question is, do we as adults have to think differently?
- Many thanks, Professor Walker.
- My pleasure.
Good-bye.
- Excuse me.
Have we met before?
- No, I don't think so.
- Buenos Aires?
Montevideo?
- No.
- Bogotà?
Antofagasta?
- I'm sorry, no.
- Mind if I join you?
- Go ahead.
- My name is Professor Walker.
- Yes, I know you.
- How nice.
Why didn't you say?
- Maybe I enjoy guessing games.
- Would you care for a drink?
- If you like.
- Waiter!
- He took a girl to his room.
That's nice.
I suggest we get a bottle and glasses... and find a quiet corner somewhere.
Why stay here?
Don't you have a flat?
No, I'm staying in a hotel.
Which hotel?
- Hotel Aimee.
- Not bad.
Would you like to come back for a drink?
That depends on how much you're paying.
We can come to an arrangement.
I'm not stingy.
- Don't you mind that I want money?
- Not in the least.
- Why?
- Well, it makes everything easier.
Let's go.
We'd better, or you'll never get your money.
Wait here a minute, please.
I like it here.
It's quiet and comfortable.
- Don't you think so?
- That's why I stay here.
Stop it, please.
You're making me nervous.
That is something I can't stand.
Get undressed.
Go on, get undressed.
Don't you want to help me?
Come here.
Wait a second.
You have to degrade me.
You must abuse me and swear at me.
I need that.
Yes, because you're impotent.
You swine!
You're a rat!
- I hate you!
- Yes, more.
You perverted swine!
I'll kill you!
Yes, hit me.
Please!
That's great.
Yes, yes!
Go on.
More!
- Hello, Franklin.
- Hello.
- I didn't know you were coming.
- Donen sent me a letter.
Yes, he wrote to me as well.
It's all very mysterious.
He said I should come alone and make sure nobody followed me.
- Walker was killed last night.
- No, I can't believe it!
We stayed in the same hotel.
I got in at about midnight.
We had adjacent rooms.
I heard someone leaving his room.
I thought it was Walker.
I opened the door.
It was a girl leaving his room.
The sort of girl you wouldn't normally bring back.
She was-- She was dark-haired, vulgar.
Just how you imagine a prostitute.
I went to his room... and that's where I found him.
It was-- It was a gruesome sight.
His throat was cut... and his penis was severed.
That's awful.
- Terrible.
- That's just crazy!
- Did you call the police?
- Of course.
But first, first I took something.
It was this note.
Please, read it.
"This was the first.
There'll be three more."
- "J."
-J?
-J as in Johnson.
- But Johnson is-
- He's dead.
- Excuse me.
Are you English?
- No.
I just thought because you're reading an English book, and--
I understand some English.
- Look.
Red flamingoes.
- I'm sorry?
- There are lots on the other side.
- I'll have to go there.
_
I don't know anybody here, and it's a bit boring on my own.
Take a guess where I'm from.
- Canada?
South Africa?
- No.
- I really don't know.
- I'm from Austria.
From Vienna.
But of course!
You're delicate like porcelain and lively like a waltz.
Thank you very much.
I'm on my own, just like you, and I'm also very bored.
- Do you have any more books?
- Yes, a lot.
- I'll lend you some.
- That would be nice.
Now?
Sure.
Why not come with me?
It's up there.
- Fine.
Let's go.
- Come on, then.
- Usually, nobody lives there.
- No?
Why not?
For special guests only.
I'm in exile.
How exciting!
- It's lovely here.
- Yes?
Do you like it?
- Would you like to pick the books?
- I'm not in a hurry.
Fine.
As you wish.
We have plenty of time.
I'm going to get us a drink.
- Do you like sherry?
- Yes, thank you.
Thanks a lot.
- Are you an artist?
- Yes.
I think your style is very masculine.
I wouldn't say masculine.
It's rather individual.
Really very nice.
So beautiful!
The pictures, of course.
I don't paint at the moment.
I'm not in the mood.
You know what?
I don't really like sherry.
But in your company, it tastes good.
Thank you.
I really love this picture.
I would never part with it.
- What does it mean?
- Whatever you want to see in it.
I like it, but somehow it depresses me.
The shapes are so hard.
It's just a composition.
A play of colors, nothing more.
But I love it.
Because it's clear, like light, as I hope my soul will be one day.
This picture is like an image of myself.
It appears hard... but it is soft and warm.
You are very beautiful.
Just wonderful.
Come on.
You are the second pig to die.
Sleep tight, my darling.
Nobody will disturb your sleep now.
Professor Walker is dead.
I did it.
The woman won't harm you either.
Are you happy now?
Are you?
Talk to me, please!
Dear congregation, let us pray.
Brothers, praise the Lord and thank Him for the good He does.
He gave you life and He will take it away again... so that you shall return to Him.
Let us sing.
- What's the matter?
- Leave me alone.
I don't want to bother you, but when I saw you crying in church--
I'd like to help you.
Believe me, please.
- Is there anything I can do?
- No.
Thank you, but it's useless.
I got married in this church.
This is the first time I've returned.
Excuse me, please.
Wait!
Please.
Happy memories shouldn't make you cry, but you seem distraught.
My husband is very ill.
I don't know how to help him.
Is your husband as young as you?
Nowadays, nearly every disease can be cured.
Nobody can help him.
I'm a doctor.
Maybe I can help him.
Shall we go and see him?
Please don't cry.
I'm Dr. Franklin Huston.
When I said my name, she was as scared as if I was the devil.
I kept thinking about it.
She was a beautiful woman.
If she didn't know me, why should she be so scared?
I'm certain it was Johnson's wife.
Stop it!
Don't talk nonsense.
The girl looks familiar.
Huston, wait here for me.
- Who is the woman at that table?
- What woman?
Dr. Huston, please take a seat.
I take it you've heard about the Walker and Crawford killings.
Of course.
I'm working on the cases.
- I'm sure he wants to kill me too.
- But why?
He wants to take revenge on Walker, Crawford, Donen and me.
What makes you think he wants to take revenge on you?
We rejected the research of a young doctor, Dr.Johnson.
- He was barred from practicing.
- Nobody's going to die.
Besides, Dr.Johnson is dead.
It's not my job to hunt ghosts.
I've got enough work with the living.
- But you must do something!
- We'll see.
I'm not just anybody!
I demand protection.
Fine.
You can count on us.
But only when you're in serious danger.
I'm sorry.
Good-bye.
- Do you have a light?
- Leave me alone.
Leave me alone!
- What can I get you?
- A Bloody Mary.
- Do you have a light now?
- Yes.
Here.
Please.
- Don't you want to talk to me?
- No!
I want to be left in peace.
Leave me alone!
Why don't you come closer?
Why are you following me?
Why are you doing this?
Are you scared?
Yes.
- I'm scared.
- Why?
You know why.
You're scared of a woman?
Yes.
Very scared.
Very.
Don't be silly.
Do I look like a killer?
I know that Dr.Johnson wants to take revenge on me.
But I'm not Dr.Johnson.
Go on.
Come here.
You don't have to be scared of me.
You are the devil.
It's all over now.
The two of us, we'll go away together.
We'll go away together.
Do you hear?
The two of us.
Do you hear me?
We'll start again.
Just the two of us.
Just us.
My wife.
Oh, God!
Why did my wife have to die too?
She was suffocated with a pillow, or something like that.
As far as we can tell, there must have been a struggle.
She has scratches all over her body.
I'd say that it's very likely that it is work of the same killer.
Inspector?
They've brought in the body of the professor.
He has multiple stab wounds.
The body is a mess.
What kind of person commits these atrocities?
Shall we bring up the body, Inspector?
Do that.
Now only Dr. Huston survives.
We'll have to watch him closely.
Come on, gentlemen.
We have a lot to do.
I'm certain we'll find this madman, but we don't have a minute to lose.
You will have to suffer.
You must suffer like him.
Like him!
My husband will rest easier after your death.
My love, we will be reunited... in death.
Not long now, and I'll be with you.
Mrs.Johnson and her husband.
They're both dead.
A dead man was held responsible for these crimes.
I believe it to be the truth.
Mrs.Johnson was a normal woman.
If not for her husband's death... she wouldn't have committed these crimes.
SHE KILLED IN ECSTASY
I miss you, my darling.
You left me, my only love.
Our time together was far too short.
Just two fleeting years.
And then disaster struck unexpectedly.
I'll never forget our time together.
You gave me more than I dreamed of.
How can I ever forget you?
Your love, your caresses.
You are inside me, my darling.
In me, you live on.
Nothing will destroy your memory.
- Are you happy?
- Yes, incredibly happy.
In a week's time, I'll hear the decision of the Medical Council.
I know what those bigots think about my work... but they can't possibly reject it.
They'll have to support my achievement... m)' plans.
They'll have to reach a positive decision.
Don't get too excited.
We haven't got their answer yet.
Come on, sweetheart.
I want to show you something.
This is the result of my research.
At first, I used animals.
But in the final phase, I used human embryos.
Human and animal hormones... are injected, resulting in revolutionary changes.
You get viable organisms.
The hormones make them more resistant to cancer, heart failure... and physical and mental decline.
Our love was a powerful, intense experience.
Our bodies merged, our soul became one.
We were united in love, passion and hope.
Your hopes for the future were in the hands of a few people.
They would determine the course of your research... and of both our lives.
They had the power to destroy you... or to confirm your greatness as a scientist.
Dr.Johnson, come forward, please.
- Your experiments are inhuman.
- What do you mean?
- They are even criminal.
- You are a charlatan.
Your plan to alter the human organism with the aid of hormones... is, in our view, a crime.
I'd like to go even further than my colleague Donen.
I followed your research with interest... but it is an infringement of the Hippocratic oath.
There can only be one answer.
We will ask the Medical Council... to stop Dr.Johnson from practicing medicine.
Don't you understand?
It's not about the Hippocratic oath.
It's about mankind, about a better existence.
It is neither a crime nor a violation.
I am right.
You are guilty, not me!
Dr.Johnson, I have here reports about your embryo experiments.
You have denied human embryos the possibility of life.
I would call that a criminal act and a blasphemy.
Blasphemy?
What kind of a world do you live in?
Only one thing counts:

Don't worry about me.
You have yourself to think about.
You are a criminal, Dr.Johnson.
- You are committing blasphemy.
- Charlatan!
- Johnson, you are a criminal.
- Expelled!
- You should be killed!
- You are an animal, Johnson!
An animal!
An animal!
You are expelled for good, forever!
- No, no, no, no!
- Expelled!
Expelled!

Yes, yes, yes!

- Fine.
Let's go.
- Come on, then.
- Usually, nobody lives there.
- No?
Why not?
For special guests only.
I'm in exile.
How exciting!
- It's lovely here.
- Yes?
Do you like it?
- Would you like to pick the books?
- I'm not in a hurry.
Fine.
As you wish.
We have plenty of time.
I'm going to get us a drink.
- Do you like sherry?
- Yes, thank you.
Thanks a lot.
- Are you an artist?
- Yes.
I think your style is very masculine.
I wouldn't say masculine.
It's rather individual.
Really very nice.
- So beautiful!
- What?
The pictures, of course.
I don't paint at the moment.
I'm not in the mood.
You know what?
I don't really like sherry.
But in your company, it tastes good.
Thank you.
I really love this picture.
I would never part with it.
- What does it mean?
- Whatever you want to see in it.
I like it, but somehow it depresses me.
The shapes are so hard.
It's just a composition.
A play of colors, nothing more.
But I love it.
Because it's clear, like light, as I hope my soul will be one day.
This picture is like an image of myself.
It appears hard... but it is soft and warm.
You are very beautiful.
Just wonderful.
Come on.
You are the second pig to die.
Sleep tight, my darling.
Nobody will disturb your sleep now.
Professor Walker is dead.
I did it.
The woman won't harm you either.
Are you happy now?
Are you?
Talk to me, please!
Dear congregation, let us pray.
Brothers, praise the Lord and thank Him for the good He does.
He gave you life and He will take it away again... so that you shall return to Him.
Let us sing.
- What's the matter?
- Leave me alone.
I don't want to bother you, but when I saw you crying in church--
I'd like to help you.
Believe me, please.
- Is there anything I can do?
- No.
Thank you, but it's useless.
I got married in this church.
This is the first time I've returned.
Excuse me, please.
Wait!
Please.
Happy memories shouldn't make you cry, but you seem distraught.
My husband is very ill.
I don't know how to help him.
Is your husband as young as you?
Nowadays, nearly every disease can be cured.
Nobody can help him.
I'm a doctor.
Maybe I can help him.
Shall we go and see him?
Please don't cry.
I'm Dr. Franklin Huston.
When I said my name, she was as scared as if I was the devil.
I kept thinking about it.
She was a beautiful woman.
If she didn't know me, why should she be so scared?
I'm certain it was Johnson's wife.
Stop it!
Don't talk nonsense.
The girl looks familiar.
Huston, wait here for me.
- Who is the woman at that table?
- What woman?
Dr. Huston, please take a seat.
I take it you've heard about the Walker and Crawford killings.
Of course.
I'm working on the cases.
- I'm sure he wants to kill me too.
- But why?
He wants to take revenge on Walker, Crawford, Donen and me.
What makes you think he wants to take revenge on you?
We rejected the research of a young doctor, Dr.Johnson.
- He was barred from practicing.
- Nobody's going to die.
Besides, Dr.Johnson is dead.
It's not my job to hunt ghosts.
I've got enough work with the living.
- But you must do something!
- We'll see.
I'm not just anybody!
I demand protection.
Fine.
You can count on us.
But only when you're in serious danger.
I'm sorry.
Good-bye.
- Do you have a light?
- Leave me alone.
Leave me alone!
- What can I get you?
- A Bloody Mary.
- Do you have a light now?
- Yes.
Here.
Please.
- Don't you want to talk to me?
- No!
I want to be left in peace.
Leave me alone!
Why don't you come closer?
Why are you following me?
Why are you doing this?
Are you scared?
Yes.
- I'm scared.
- Why?
You know why.
You're scared of a woman?
Yes.
Very scared.
Very.
Don't be silly.
Do I look like a killer?
I know that Dr.Johnson wants to take revenge on me.
But I'm not Dr.Johnson.
Go on.
Come here.
You don't have to be scared of me.
You are the devil.
It's all over now.
The two of us, we'll go away together.
We'll go away together.
Do you hear?
The two of us.
Do you hear me?
We'll start again.
Just the two of us.
Just us.
My wife.
Oh, God!
Why did my wife have to die too?
She was suffocated with a pillow, or something like that.
As far as we can tell, there must have been a struggle.
She has scratches all over her body.
I'd say that it's very likely that it is work of the same killer.
Inspector?
They've brought in the body of the professor.
He has multiple stab wounds.
The body is a mess.
What kind of person commits these atrocities?
Shall we bring up the body, Inspector?
Do that.
Now only Dr. Huston survives.
We'll have to watch him closely.
Come on, gentlemen.
We have a lot to do.
I'm certain we'll find this madman, but we don't have a minute to lose.
You will have to suffer.
You must suffer like him.
Like him!
My husband will rest easier after your death.
My love, we will be reunited... in death.
Not long now, and I'll be with you.
Mrs.Johnson and her husband.
They're both dead.
A dead man was held responsible for these crimes.
I believe it to be the truth.
Mrs.Johnson was a normal woman.
If not for her husband's death... she wouldn't have committed these crimes.
.
SHE KILLED IN ECSTASY
I long for you, my Love.
You have left me, my only Love.
It was too short, our time together.
Two years.
It went so fast.
And then, suddenly, misfortune befell us.
All of a sudden.
I will never forget the time before.
You gave me more than I ever expected from my life.
How could I ever forget you?
Your Love.
Your caresses.
You are inside me, my Love.
You will live on in me.
And nothing will ever be able to destroy your image.
-Are you happy?
-Yes.
Terribly happy.
It will take about a week until I get the decision of the medical congress.
I can imagine what those narrow-minded doctors will think of my work.
But there is no way for them to refuse it.
They will have to support this effort... my plans.
They will have to settle in its favour.
Don't be too effusive.
We don't have the work yet.
Come, darling, I want to show you something.
That is the final result of my research.
In the beginning I made experiments with animals... until the last stage, in which I used human embryos.
The mixture of human and animal hormones... injecting the last ones in the earliest stage of development... causes the revolutionary changes.
You get organisms capable of surviving.
Due to the mixture of hormones, those organisms are far more resistant against... proneness to cancer, cardiac insufficiency, general physical and mental deterioration.
Our love was a powerful and immensely profound experience.
Our bodies melted together to become one... our spirits became one.
Everything was united in us... love, passion and hope.
The hope for your future... a future that was in a few persons' hands... who had to decide on the further development of your research... and on the life of both of us.
Those persons had the power to destroy you... or to raise you to become a recognized scientist.
Dr. Johnson.
Please come closer.
Your operations on embryos are inhuman.
What does it mean, inhuman?
More than that, they are criminal.
Your intention of changing the human organism... by mixing animal and human hormones in the embryonic stage... is what we call a crime.
In this matter, I want to go even further than my colleague Donen.
I don't deny that I followed your report with great interest... but I say that it is a violation of the Hippocratic oath.
There can only be one response, dear colleagues.
We will request that the medical association... ban Dr. Johnson from his occupation.
Don't you understand?
This is not about the Hippocratic oath.
It is about humanity.
About a better existence.
And that is neither a criminal act, nor a violation.
I am right.
You are guilty, not me.
Dr. Johnson, I have here reports on your operations on embryos... with all the details.
You have stolen from human beings in embryonic stage the chance of development.
I call that criminal and blasphemous.
You say blasphemous?
In what world are you living?
There can be only one aim:
To help human beings.
Without moral terms.
Dr. Johnson... for the moment, this group of doctors forbids you to continue your experiments.
Why do you believe in it?
Have you already realized it?
You know, I have carried out experiments on human beings.
And what was the result?
A convincing one.
That's enough.
Take your papers.
It would be best if you burned them.
Dr. Johnson... you have heard our decision.
Stop your experiments.
What happened?
Darling.
Darling.
They came and destroyed everything.
I wanted to stop them, but... they were like insane.
-Who was it?
-I....
I don't know.
Many men.
They must hate you terribly.
They called your name.
They wanted to kill you.
-You are hurt.
-Just a splinter of glass.
It is nothing.
Come, darling.
Don't worry about me.
You have to think of yourself.
You are a criminal, Dr. Johnson.
Your actions are blasphemous.
Quack.
Johnson, you are a criminal.
Expelled.
You should be killed.
You are an animal, Johnson.
An animal.
You are expelled forever.
For eternity.
No, no, no, no.
-Expelled.
-An animal.
Forever.
-An animal.
-Expelled.
-Forever.
-An animal.
Yes.
I am an animal.
Dr. Houston, please.
Mrs. Johnson.
My husband is going berserk.
I believe he is going insane.
Please, can you come?
But if you speak to him....
One word from you....
I just want to....
I just want to help.
I just want to help you.
No!
I am no criminal!
I left town with him.
We went to a small island where we owned a house.
It was a deserted island.
Lonely as above the clouds.
A house born in a dream.
Like a labyrinth, where the steps reverberate.
Where the words rebound and return.
Time and again.
No.
Darling.
What do you want?
I know it.
I can make it.
It is no crime.
No crime....
As doctors and humanists we have to absolutely denounce those... who violate the ethical principles... of human laws.
Time and again we hear... that fanatical doctors, under the guise of scientific experiments... don't shrink from performing criminal acts.
We have to stop such dreamers.
Because how can we expect humanity to trust us... when within our lines we have quacks, unscrupulous criminals... and we do nothing to find them and to ban them from our midst.
Science has reached a point... that offers too many possibilities to such unscrupulous persons.
We are forced... to defend ourselves with all the power we've got.
Otherwise we will dig our own grave.
We cannot close our eyes in front of the misuse... of the word "cure."
The countless victims of such machinations accuse us... and we must not ignore the accusations.
We are forced... to try all that is possible to save those persons... from dubious experiments... and that is the oath that all of us have sworn once.
I want to thank our colleague, Prof. Walker, for his passionate and honest words.
There is no need to go into the details of the case Prof. Walker was referring to.
I'm speaking of Dr. Johnson.
We all know about his disgraceful actions.
Please believe me, Dr. Johnson will never practise again.
At our request, the medical association has decided on his expulsion for life.
-What do you want?
-I didn't mean to frighten you.
Remember me?
I was with you after your husband's lab was destroyed.
Has something else happened?
How dare you ask?
If you want to help us, go find the men who destroyed my husband's life.
Oh, who knows, maybe I'll do that.
It was proved conclusively which crimes have been committed by Dr. Johnson.
In case further proof is requested... we will provide it.
And now to the legal aspect of the case.
I can only say, like Prof. Walker did before... that I feel the profoundest disgust... and revulsion, when I hear... what crimes this man has committed in the name of science.
Pardon me.
I have a very silly question.
Is smoking allowed here?
No, it is not.
Thank you, Dr. Houston.
...because who has any doubts about the riskiness of such experiments.
I beg your pardon.
How do you know my name?
Have we already met?
No.
But what the heck?
I know who you are.
...to stop the devilish deeds of an insane doctor.
No, this Johnson is no doctor.
-You are a criminal, Dr. Johnson.
-You commit blasphemy.
-Quack.
-You are a criminal, Dr. Johnson.
-Expelled.
-You should be killed.
-You are an animal, Johnson.
-Expelled.
-An animal.
-Forever.
-An animal.
-Expelled.
Darling.
Do you hear me, darling?
I just want to help humanity.
Why don't you allow me to help?
Why?
Can you understand me?
Do you hear me?
I just want to help you.
I love you.
Oh, God.
Why do they treat me like a criminal?
-I can't go on anymore.
-Why do they treat me like a criminal?
I can't go on anymore.
I am right.
Believe me, I just want to help.
Just help.
Johnson, that's blasphemy.
The monstrous products of hell.
You are insane, Johnson.
Insane.
Where are you?
No!
No!
I'm searching for you, my love.
And if only one breath of you could caress me.
A look from your eyes.
You left me without any word.
How shall I live without you?
Tell me.
I know I cannot without having taken revenge on your murderers.
My revenge will be dreadful.
Only death can be the price for destroying both our lives.
The world we live in nowadays... is determined by only one thing.:
money.
Every day, humans become more corrupt... more prone to crime.
If we don't fight it by all available means... we will head inexorably towards chaos.
Of course, one should pin his hopes... on youth.
But how is this youth made?
How does it behave?
Does it learn from the mistakes made by its parents?
Sure, one thing is obvious.
Today's youth is not as militant.
Or let's say, you cannot force it into a schema.
It doesn't want to receive orders and execute them unquestioningly.
It claims to search for a better world.
Well, until now it looks like that.
There are protests against war, there are demonstrations, riots... all that stuff which is mentioned every day in the papers.
Of course we must not forget about the drugs.
The drugs distort their reality.
They convey an image which is untrue and which does not correspond to reality.
So it is inevitable that the youngster, who takes drugs, denies the social order.
He becomes amoral.
But not immoral.
His behaviour simply does not match the social order he has to grow into.
Therefore arises the question, if we, the adults, shouldn't rethink and find new ways.
Thank you, Prof. Walker.
Thank you.
Oh, my pleasure.
Goodbye.
I beg your pardon.
Do we know each other?
No, not as far I know.
-Buones Aires?
-No.
-Montevideo?
-No.
-Bogota?
-I'm sorry.
-Antofagasta?
-No.
-May I sit down?
-Please.
May I present myself:
I am Prof. Walker.
I know.
I know you.
How nice.
Why didn't you say so?
Maybe I enjoy your guessing game.
Would you like to join me for a drink?
As you like.
-Waiter.
-Don't bother.
The waiter has gone into a private room, together with a girl.
How nice.
Well, I suggest we get a bottle... and some glasses and look for a quiet little place.
Why do you want to stay?
-Don't you have an apartment?
-No, I stay in a hotel.
Which hotel?
Hotel Numet.
Not bad.
Would you like to have a drink with me there?
That depends on how much you pay.
I'm sure we will find an agreement.
Believe me, I am no miser.
Are you disappointed that I want to be paid?
On the contrary.
Why?
Well, it makes it easier.
Let's go.
Yes, we have to go, otherwise you won't get your money.
Please wait here for a moment.
I like it.
It is quiet and cosy.
-Am I right?
-That's why I stay here.
Please stop that.
You're making me nervous.
I cannot stand that.
Take your clothes off.
Go on, take your clothes off.
Don't you want to help me?
Now come here.
Wait.
You have to be mean to me.
You have to call me dreadful names.
I need that.
Yes, because you are impotent.
-You pig.
-Yes.
-You are a rat.
-Yes.
-I hate you.
-Yes.
Go on.
-You perverted pig.
-Yes.
Thank you.
-I'll beat you to death.
-Yes.
Beat me.
Please.
Yes.
That's good.
Continue.
Yes.
Yes.
-Hello, Fred.
-Hello.
I didn't know that you would come, too.
Donen wrote me to come here.
Yes, he told me the same thing.
Really, that's very mysterious.
He wrote I should come alone and take care that no one follow me.
Last night, Jonathan Walker was killed.
No, I don't believe that.
We stay in the same hotel.
And about midnight, I returned there.
My room was next to his.
Well, I heard somebody leaving his room.
I thought it was Walker.
I opened the door.
It was a girl, leaving his room.
One of those girls one doesn't usually bring into the hotel.
She was dark-haired, vulgar.
Like one usually imagines a prostitute.
I entered his room and I found him.
It was....
It was a horrifying sight.
His throat was cut.
And his penis had been cut off.
Oh, that's terrible.
Horrifying.
That's insane.
-Have you called the police?
-Yes, of course.
Before, I removed something.
It was this note.
Please read it.
"He is the first and three others will follow.
"J."
"J"?
"J" like Johnson.
But Johnson is dead.
-Pardon me, you are English, right?
-No.
Oh, my mistake.
I thought so, because you're reading an English book.
I understand some English.
Look, the red flamingos.
-What did you say?
-The flamingos.
Behind those mountains is a lagoon.
There are many of them.
How nice.
I will go there once.
You should.
You must not always stay in your room reading.
Yes, you are right.
But I don't know anybody here and it is a bit boring.
Guess where I come from.
-Canada?
-No.
-South Africa?
-Oh, no.
Then I don't know.
I come from Austria.
From Vienna.
Yes, of course.
Seeing you... so delicate like porcelain, so lively like a Viennese waltz....
Thank you.
-You know....
-Yes?
I am as alone you are here and of course I am bored, too.
Do you have some other books?
Yes, quite a lot.
If you want to, I can lend you some.
Good heaven.
Right now?
Yes, of course.
If you want to come with me, we must go up there.
-All right, let's go.
-Yes, come on.
You know, usually no one is supposed to stay there.
Really?
How come?
For special guests only.
I'm living here in exile.
Very exciting.
That is beautiful.
-Yes?
Do you like it?
-Very much.
Do you want to choose the books now?
I am in no hurry.
As you like.
We have plenty of time.
I'll fetch us some drinks.
-Do you like sherry?
-Yes, thank you.
Thank you.
-Cheers.
-Cheers.
Are you a painter?
Yes.
I think your style is very masculine.
I wouldn't call it masculine, but personal.
Anyway, I like them a lot.
So beautiful.
-Pardon?
-Of course, the paintings.
For the moment, I don't paint.
I'm not quite in the mood for it.
You know... to be honest, I hate sherry.
But in your company, I like it much more.
Thank you.
I love this painting the most.
I would never give it away.
What does it mean?
Everything you want to see in it.
I like it, but it is somehow depressing.
The shapes are so hard.
It is only my composition.
The play of colours.
Just that.
But I love it.
It is wonderfully clear, like the light.
Exactly as I hope my soul will be once.
This painting is my mirror.
It seems to be hard, but it is soft and warm.
You are beautiful.
Wonderful.
Come.
You are the second pig that died.
Have a nice sleep, darling.
Now no one will disturb your rest.
Prof. Walker is dead.
I did it.
And also the woman can't do you any harm anymore, my darling.
Are you happy now?
Are you?
Please speak!
Dear parishioners, let us pray.
Brothers.
Praise the Lord and thank him for the good he does to you.
He has given you life and he will take it from you... so that you can return into his lap.
Let us sing.
-What's the matter?
-Leave me alone.
I don't want to bother you... but when I saw you crying in the church....
I want to help you.
Please believe me.
Is there something I can do for you?
-No.
-Are you sure?
No, no.
Thank you, but there is no point in trying.
You know, I once married in this church and this is the first time I've come back.
Please excuse me.
Wait.
Please.
Someone who is happy does not cry.
You really seem terribly unhappy.
My husband is very ill.
I don't know to help him.
Is your husband as young as you are?
Nowadays, nearly all diseases can be cured.
No one can help him.
I am a doctor.
Maybe I can help.
Shall we go and see him?
Please stop crying.
I am Dr. Franklin Houston.
When I said my name, she was very shocked... as if the devil was standing in front of her.
Of course I was worried about it.
She was a beautiful young woman.
If she didn't know me... why should she be shocked hearing my name?
There is no doubt.
She must be Dr. Johnson's wife.
Houston!
Stop it.
Stop talking nonsense.
That girl seems familiar.
Houston, please wait for me.
-Who is the woman at that table?
-What woman?
Dr. Houston.
Please take a seat.
It's about....
I guess you are informed about the Walker and Crawford murder cases.
-Yes.
I work on those cases.
-Well...
I am convinced that the murderer wants to kill me, too.
-And why?
-For revenge.
He wants to take revenge on us.
Dr. Crawford, Dr. Walker, Donen and me.
What makes you think he wants to take revenge on you?
The research report of a young doctor, a certain Dr. Johnson.
We have rejected it.
And we had him expelled from the medical association.
Nonsense.
It's not that easy killing someone.
After all, Dr. Johnson is dead.
So what do you want?
Please excuse me, but it is not my job to hunt ghosts and spooks.
The living ones are already enough trouble, you understand?
-But you have to do something.
-Yes, we will investigate.
You cannot dismiss my reputation like this.
I am not just anybody.
-Listen to me, I need to be protected.
-Very well.
You can count on our assistance.
But only when you are in real danger.
I am sorry.
Goodbye.
Have you got a light?
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone.
-What would you like?
-A Bloody Mary.
-Have you got a light now?
-Yes.
Yes.
Please.
Don't you want to talk to me?
No.
I want my peace.
Leave me alone.
Come nearer.
Why... do you haunt me?
Tell me why.
Are you afraid?
Yes.
-I am afraid.
-Why?
You know it.
You are afraid of a woman?
Yes.
Terribly afraid.
Terribly....
That's nonsense.
Do I look like a murderer?
I know that Dr. Johnson wants to take revenge on me.
But I am not Dr. Johnson.
Come on, come here.
Don't be afraid of me.
You are a devil.
It is over, darling.
For both of us.
We will leave together.
We will leave together, do you hear me?
Both of us, do you understand?
We make a new start.
Just the two of us.
Just us.
My wife.
Why did my wife have to die, too?
The death is a result of suffocation.... caused by a pillow pressed on her face.
As far as we could see... there must have been a fight.
Her body is covered with scratches.
Inspector.
I say... most probably it is the same culprit.
Inspector.
The corpse of the professor has arrived... the one who was in your office the other day.
He is covered with stab wounds.
The corpse is in a dreadful state.
What human being could do something like this?
Well?
Shall we be bring the corpse up here, Inspector?
Yes, do so.
The only clue we have left is Dr. Houston.
We have to keep an eye on him.
Come, gentlemen.
We have a lot of work to do.
I am sure, sooner or later we will find this insane person.
But we must not lose time.
That is all that counts now.
You will suffer.
You shall suffer like he did.
Like him.
My husband....
When you are dead, he may sleep calm.
My love.
We will be united... in death.
Soon I will be with you.
Inspector, Mrs. Johnson and her husband are in the car.
Both dead.
A dead man was accused of all those crimes.
And I even think it's true.
Basically, Mrs. Johnson is a ordinary woman... and if her husband was alive, she would never have committed those crimes.

Fritzes...
C'mon, blast is stove to hell.
- Who are you?
- And who are you?
Artillerists from Chuikov's army.
Is that the 1st Byelorussian?
And we're Rybalko's motorized infantry, the 1st Ukrainian Front.
Our own!
Well, greetings!
- Greetings, neighbor.
- Hi!
Just imagine, all fronts got mixed up.
Not mixed up, but joined up.
The mistress of the house offers us coffee.
Thank you.
Comrade Major, maybe we'd better take a drop from my flask?
- Let's drink on such an occasion.
- That's right.
They'll grow better.
Well, to our meeting.
You don't even know which districts the Russians have penetrated.
Some Berlin Commandant you are!
All communications are broken, my Fuhrer.
But the telephones are working.
That's communication, isn't it?
For so long, for so long we haven't rested,
We just had no time for it, alas.
By the leopard crawl, half Europe we have breasted,
And come tomorrow, the final battle, at last.
A little more, just a little bit.
The final battle is the hardest ever.
And I yearn for Russia, home I want to get,
For so long I haven't seen my mother.
And I yearn for Russia, home I want to get,
For so long I haven't seen my mother.
Four years on end those Fritzes give us no peace at all,
Four years it's salty sweat and blood with no end.
I'd rather fall in love with a nice and pretty girl,
I'd rather touch my homeland with my hand.
A little more, just a little bit.
The final battle is the hardest ever.
And I yearn for Russia, home I want to get,
For so long I haven't seen my mother.
And I yearn for Russia, home I want to get,
For so long I haven't seen my mother.
For the last time we'll fight hand-to-hand tomorrow,
For the last time we'll serve our Russia to the end...
The Berlin Commandant speaking.
Do you have Russians there?
We have.
What are they doing?
Singing.
What?
Yes, they're singing, Herr Commandant.
Are you the Russian or the German Commandant?
German, damn it!
They're on Wilhelmstrasse.
The ring is closing up.
My Fuhrer, we're no longer able to defend Berlin.
I thought that if I stayed here all the soldiers would believe in our victory and come to save the city.
And I'm still hoping for this.
General Wenck's army is moving to Berlin!
The will throw the Russians back.
Goebbels, immediately get in touch with General Wenck.
When will his army approach Berlin?
When?
!
My Fuhrer, you need to rest.
No.
No, I'll wait for the news from Wenck.
Wenck!
Wenck is our salvation.
Forward!
Comrade Major, give me a canon to support us in the subway.
The subway goes right to the Reich Chancellery.
Want to take Hitler prisoner?
And why not?
You can never tell.
- All right!
- Thanks, Comrade Major.
The cannon to be subway!
You replace me here!
Forward!
Forward!
Move it!
Do as fine a work at the machinegun as though you're jewelers.
Fire!
Guys, follow me!
Forward, boys!
This way, quick!
Come on, all together!
Hey, brothers, let's move this monster together!
Follow me!
Forward!
Halt!
Halt!
Where's the Reich Chancellery?
Which way to Hitler?
Can you sprechen Russian?
Where's Hitler, I say?
Oh, go to hell.
Bring the cannon here.
Forward!
My Fuhrer, the Russians got into the subway tunnel and are approaching the subway station Kaiserhof.
Open the floodgates and flood all the tunnels.
There're hospitals and the wounded in the tunnels.
Women and children.
Open the floodgates!
If we lose this war, the German nation will cease to exist.
If our nation couldn't even subjugate the Slav peoples, it has no right to exist.
The new generations will start from where we stopped.
Do you believe me, Eva?
I do, my Fuhrer.
This is my order - let the Spree waters run into the tunnels!
You three go forward.
Move it!
Ask him where the Reich Chancellery is and send him to meet his Maker.
All right, Lieutenant, I don't need our advice, I can deal with it.
Do you want a smoke?
Thank you.
You studied Russian?
Yes, I did.
What do you want from me, Herr Major?
Herr Lieutenant gave you a good advice, to send me to meet my Maker.
Why hurry?
A Communist must not hesitate when he faces enemy.
A Communist has no right to doubt.
Your lieutenant has no doubts.
You don't know Communists at all.
We don't need your life.
We want only one thing to destroy fascism.
Go.
If you take up arms again, you'll be shot.
Go.
You're free.
Go.
The Reich Chancellery is over there, not far from here.
Comrade Major, they opened floodgates.
We must leave.
There's an exit on the left, from where we were attacking.
We won't make it.
- Blow up the grating.
- Yes, blow up the grating.
Get down!
Down!
Comrade Major!
Comrade Major, we must leave!
We must leave!
Quiet.
Calm down.
We must leave!
Yartsev!
Come here and hold back the crowd, let only women and children through.
Back up!
Let the women and children through.
Hold them back!
No panicking!
Hold the crowd back!
No panicking!
Calm down!
Get out of the car!
Commander of the 150th Infantry Division Major-General Shatilov
Comrade General, Captain Neustroyev's battalion has reached the Spree.
The Reichstag is ahead.
Yes, there it is, the Reichstag.
Well, Lieutenant-Colonel Orlov, we got to the center of Berlin.
That's right, Comrade General.
The last nut to crack.
The Germans are fighting like the devils.
Not going to capitulate.
One way or another, but we'll have to force the Spree and take the Reichstag.
- Where's Neustroyev's command post?
- Just next to us, Comrade General.
Attention!
Look more serious.
Look in the camera Get ready.
Ready.
One.
Two.
Three.
- Have you snapped.
- How could I?
It's a Party assignment, not some tourist snapshots.
I understand.
Let's do it once more.
Sit down.
The general.
Comrade General, the battalion is tidying up after battle.
I can see.
Sparing no eau-de-Cologne.
That's right, Comrade General.
- Take me to the regiment commander.
- Yes, Comrade General.
What's going on here?
Making photos for Party cards.
Deputy Battalion Commander for Political Instruction Lieutenant Berest.
Where do you plan to award Party cards to our young Communists?
We'll do it in the Reichstag, Comrade General.
That's right.
Good for you, political officer.
Comrade General.
Commander of the 756th Rifle Regiment Colonel Zinchenko.
Now, Zinchenko.
I'm handing this banner to you.
Your regiment is to hoist it on the Reichstag.
Thank you, Comrade General.
Who will carry the banner?
Scout Yegorov!
Here!
Scout Kantaria.
Here!
Hoist this banner on the Reichstag dome.
BERLIN April 29
Battery commander!
Commander of the tank company Vasilyev is here to be at our command!
You will assist us with fire!
All right, I got you!
Dorozhkin, go to the battalion.
I'm sending you a radio man!
Comrade Captain, I can't swim.
Don't worry, you'll be all right.
Come here.
My Fuhrer.
The Russians are 600 meters away from the Imperial Chancellery.
We don't have ammunition.
No provisions.
The last airfield has been burned by Russian artillery.
And where's Wenck's army?
Where's Wenck?
My Fuhrer, Wenck is waging a battle in the Potsdam area.
He can't break through to Berlin.
Is that all?
That's all, My Fuhrer.
Thank you, gentlemen.
You can go.
My Fuhrer.
I was delivered a radiogram.
Benito Mussolini and his girlfriend Clara Petacci
were hanged by the partisans upside down, in the Piazzale Loreto in Milan.
What a terrible cruelty.
My Fuhrer, there's an opportunity to breakthrough out of Berlin.
I have a tank detachment ready.
No.
Leave us alone.
I don't want to die as our mistress.
All right, Eva.
We'll have a wedding.
Leave me alone!
What wedding can it be now?
Leave me alone!
Comrade Commander.
We caught their priest.
He's weird, seems not to be in his right mind.
Koshelev, find out what this priest wants.
Yes, Comrade Commander.
Commander of the 8th Guard Army Colonel-General Chuikov
Concentrate all fire on the Reich Chancellery.
Yes, concentrate all fire on the Reich Chancellery.
Did you find out what this priest wants?
He keeps talking about some wedding.
He says it's time to stop the bloodshed.
And he's right.
A politically conscious priest.
Send him to the antifascists.
Let his God speak to the German soldiers, if they're still believers.
It's the National Committee for a Free German speaking.
We're calling on you to lay down arms.
Thus you will save your lives.
The new Germany needs you.
Surrender!
Surrender!
Father, this is a German patriot, comrade Willi, an antifascist.
He's been transmitting for two days.
Join, Father, in the just cause.
Germans, my brothers.
It's I who is asking you, the pastor of St. Georg Church.
Stop.
Stop.
Does the groom wish to say anything?
I've decided to choose as my wife Eva Braun, with whom I'm bound by many years of true friendship.
And she will go with me to death of her own free will as my wife.
Does the bride wish to say anything?
I'll be happy to be Adolf Hitler's wife.
- Do you belong to the Aryan race?
- Yes.
- Do you have any hereditary diseases?
- No.
Seal your answers with your personal signatures.
I congratulate Adolf and Eva a new happy family of the great Germany.
BERLIN April 30
- Berest, go ahead with the 1st company.
- Yes.
Forward!
Follow me!
Forward!
Boys!
Follow us, forward!
Follow me!
Tell the colonel that we've secured the first floor.
Tank-man, come here.
Connection with the colonel, quick!
What?
The first floor taken?
Good boys!
Connection with the general.
You've gained the first floor?
Good for you!
Go on!
- Connection with the commander.
- Yes.
You've taken the first floor?
Why does it take you so long!
The banner, quick!
Hoist the banner, you got me?
Commander of the 3rd Shock Army Colonel-General Kuznetsov
Get me the Marshal!
You've taken the first floor?
It's slow, you move too slowly, General.
Put me through to Comrade Stalin.
The Fuhrer must die not from poison, but from a bullet, like a soldier.
If we don't hear a shot, you will go in and do what has to be done.
Yes, sir.
Linge!
Linge!
The Fuhrer has shot himself.
Follow me!
Tank-man!
Give me quick connection with ours.
Will do.
Let them fire at the upper floors.
"Boxes"! "Boxes"!
I'm "Reichstag"!
Our brothers ask for fire.
At the wolfs lair!
More exactly, at their head!
Did you copy?
Over.
They did it.
Never mind, in a tank it can be even worse.
Sure.
What's the matter?
Listen, boy.
BERLIN May 1
And Jesus said to his apostles:
For whoever exalts himself will be humbled.
Germany wanted to exalt herself, and she has died.
No, father, Germany is not dead.
It's not the end, but the beginning of a new Germany.
Who are you?
I'm a Communist.
Please cease fire!
We're sending out truce envoys.
You'll recognize them by a white flag.
Attention!
We ask to cease fire!
And these who heard His words kept them in their hearts.
And He said to the apostles: remember...
I'm Chief of the German Army General Staff General Krebs.
We're listening, General Krebs.
I have to inform you that on April 30
Adolf Hitler committed suicide in his bunker.
Grossadmiral Doenitz has been appointed the new head of state,
Dr. Goebbels the Reich Chancellor.
The former German government no longer exists.
Reich Chancellor Dr. Goebbels has authorized me to ask you for ceasefire for one day.
To what purpose?
So that Grossadmiral Doenitz and the new government could arrive in Berlin.
No, General Krebs.
We won't agree to any ceasefire, either for a day, or for an hour.
Only complete and unconditional surrender.
I'm not authorized to conduct negotiations about surrender.
There will be new thousands of victims.
Will you pass on to Moscow our request about the ceasefire?
The answer will be the same.
How will know about the answer from Moscow?
We'll establish direct telephone communication with the Reich Chancellery.
The signalman!
Comrade General, Senior Lieutenant...
Translate to the German that the senior lieutenant will go with him.
You'll go with the German general to the Reich Chancellery.
- To the lair?
- Yes, to the lair.
May I take grenades?
No grenades.
You'll establish communication.
Yes, Comrade General.
You got a really lousy place here.
You can get rheumatic alright.
Go, go.
Here.
"Stalingrad", "Stalingrad".
I'm "Berlin".
It's all right.
No capitulation.
If we recognize unconditional surrender, the German people will lose everything.
In these tragic hours for Germany I'm ready to follow the Fuhrer's example.
Bormann, try to break through to the west, to our friends.
Krebs, tell the Russians that there will be no capitulation.
Are you ready, Magda?
Not yet.
The doctor is wavering.
I'm sorry, Frau Goebbels, I can't kill children.
Maybe we'll pass them under the protection of International Red Cross?
Don't forget that they're Goebbels's children.
Give me the syringe.
Excuse me, where do you have a toilet here?
What do you want from me?
Go away!
There will be no negotiations.
- Well, all right, no negotiations
- Go away now.
You'll shoot at the back of our heads as we walk up.
It's more than I can bear, Herr Reich Minister.
You want the Russians to hang us upside down?
Do it!
Yes, it's a really lousy place you have here.
BERLIN May 2
Georgy Konstantinovich, Chuikov's on the line.
Chuikov?
What?
Comrade Marshal.
The Hitlerites put out a white flag, they're surrendering.
Repeat it.
The Hitlerites put out a white flag in the Reichstag, they're surrendering.
Congratulations to you, Chuikov!
Congratulations!
Is it really the end, Georgy Konstantinovich?
Four years.
1,410 days.
And nights.
Comrade Marshal.
The Berlin garrison asks you to tune to frequency 440.
Attention, Russians!
Tune to wave 440.
We ask you to cease fire.
We ask you to cease fire and enter the negotiations.
Go over to transmitting.
Transmit.
We have only one condition - an unconditional surrender.
Cease fire in 15 minutes.
We'll be taking prisoners at the Brandenburg Gate.
We guarantee life to everybody.
We guarantee life to everybody.
Well, you alive, infantry?
Congratulations.
Haven't you seen Dorozhkin, my radio man?
Is there Dorozhkin here?
Dorozhkin!
Dorozhkin!
Dorozhkin!
Dorozhkin!
They killed him.
Vaska.
Vaska!
Vaska.
Why are you crying?
It's victory!
Comrade General, it's victory!
Congratulations!
Victory!
Victory!

YOUR NAME IS UNKNOWN, YOUR FEAT IS IMMORTAL

Sincro: wyxchari
You are sure the Master knows?
The report on the Doomsday weapon is missing from our files.
Only he could have taken it.
Then we can use the Doctor to deal with this problem.
The Doctor resents his exile bitterly.
Do you think he'll co-operate with us?
I doubt it.
We immobilized his TARDIS, took away his freedom to move in space and time.
Then we must restore his freedom as long as it serves our purpose.
Doctor, why don't you give up?
You've been working on that thing for simply ages.
You know I can't give up, Jo.
It's far too important.
Still at it, Doctor?
Now don't you start!
The latest field reports are in.
Still no trace of the Master.
Well, I didn't expect there would be.
No, his TARDIS is working again now.
He could be anywhere in space and time.
Yes, that's as maybe, Doctor, but I've got to keep on looking.
You're wasting your time, Brigadier.
Hello, Laboratory?
Yes, he's here.
Brigadier?
Oh, thank you.
Lethbridge Stewart?
Right.
Send him into my office.
One of my agents thinks he's picked up a trace of the Master.
Your agents are always picking up traces of the Master!
This agent happens to be particularly reliable, Doctor.
I'll let you what he says if you're interested.
Ah, now you've offended him!
Well!
Well, look what happened last time.
The man they arrested turned out to be the Spanish ambassador!
Well, there you are.
That's done it.
Done what?
I've made myself a completely new dematerialization circuit.
One that'll bypass the Time Lords homing control
- I hope.
You don't seriously think you'll get that thing working again, do you?
Oh no!
No, I've been doing all this work for fun!
I mean it's just a sort of hobby isn't it?
A kind of game?
A game?
Well, what have you got in there anyway - a policeman?
Why not step inside and see for yourself?
I don't believe it!
It's bigger inside than out!
Yes, that's because the TARDIS is dimensionally transcendental.
What does that mean?
It means that it's bigger inside than out!
Now then...
That's impossible!
The doors have closed.
Well, I can't, Jo!
I think we're taking off!
Well, stop it!
Well, I'm trying to.
Something's operating it by remote control!
The Time Lords!
I'm afraid you were right, Doctor.
Another dead end and we...
Doctor... come back at once!
All right, Doctor.
The joke's over.
Open the doors and let me out?
I can't, Jo.
We've taken off.
All right then, where are we?
At the moment we're nowhere.
Oh, don't be silly - we can't be nowhere.
We're outside the space-time continuum.
What?
Look.
What's happening?
Where are we going?
I've no idea.
We'll just have to wait until we emerge.
The planet Uxarieus!
So that's our destination...
Very impressive... but can we go back to Earth now, please?
I don't know, Jo.
I just don't know.
Is that supposed to be where we are?
That is where we are.
All right then, if we've landed on another planet, why don't you open the doors.
Because the atmosphere out there might be poisonous, that's why.
I'll just check.
And is it?
Is it what?
Is the atmosphere poisonous?
No, no, it's quite healthy.
Similar to Earth before the invention of the motor car.
Look Doctor, are you going to open the doors or not?
Well, I can but try.
Thank you.
Doctor!
That's an alien world out there, Jo.
Think of it.
I don't want to think of it!
I want to go back to Earth!
Look, do you realize how long I've been confined to one planet?
All that talk of yours about traveling in time and space - it was true!
Well, of course it was true!
Before I was stranded on Earth, I spent all my time exploring new worlds and seeking the wonders of the universe.
But you don't know what's out there!
Then let's find out!
Don't you want to set foot in another world?
Well, yes, I do but I...
Good!
Come on.
We'll just take a quick look around... and then I'll try and get you back to Earth, all right?
All right.
Look...
It's got different colored petals.
What are they?
Well, tracks made by some sort of machine.
This planet must be inhabited after all.
I think we'd get a better view from up there.
Come on, what are you waiting for?
I feel a bit scared.
Come on, Jo.
Nothing to worry about.
Those things up there?
Like some sort of prefabricated dwellings.
Well look, there's another one - a small one, up there.
Let's go and take a look at them.
Oh no, you don't!
Let's get back to the TARDIS.
Yes, all right.
But, erm...
Do you mind if I take a look at that rock first?
It's rather unusual.
Doctor?
Doctor?
Listen, Ashe, I saw those creatures.
We both did.
I surveyed this planet myself before the colony was set up.
Well, you didn't do much of a job.
And all the time we've been here, there's been no trace of any hostile animal life.
Well, there is now!
We heard this roaring in the middle of the night.
When we looked out, there it was.
What did it look like?
It was enormous - some kind of giant lizard.
You must have been having nightmares!
Did it do any damage?
No, I fired a few shots and frightened it off.
Well, exactly.
All right, Martin.
David, how many men have you got to spare?
About six.
Well, go over to Martin's dome and have a look - just in case.
Very well.
What the...?
Leeson, who's this?
How do you do?
Well, I must say this is most impressive.
We found these two in sector twenty-seven.
They say they're explorers.
Where do they come from?
Err, we come from Earth.
They were examining rock samples.
They're mineralogists.
It was bound to happen!
Look, we are not mineralogists.
And even if we were, why all the hostility?
It's a respectable profession.
Because we don't want our planet gutted!
This is our world!
You've no right to be here!
Look, we've as much right to be here as anybody else.
This planet has been classified as suitable for colonization.
Once your big mining combines move in, you'll reduce it to a galactic slagheap!
Haven't you got laws to deal with this kind of thing?
Yes, there are laws.
We complain to Earth's government just like all the others.
By the time you get a final decision, the planet's useless.
I see.
Yes well, I can sympathize with you gentlemen but I can assure you that I'm not working for anybody.
Then just why have you come here?
Pure chance.
My spaceship developed a fault.
We had to land somewhere.
Can you show me your papers?
Err, papers?
Err, no, err, th... erm, they're back in my spaceship, if you'd like to come back there with me...
I think it would be better if you spent the night here.
We'll go to your spaceship in the morning.
Oh, we don't want to put you to any trouble.
I'd rather you did as I say.
Jane?
Yes, John?
Show our two... "guests" to the dining area.
We'll fix up your sleeping accommodation later.
Yes, go with them.
It's all right, Jo.
I'll join you later.
All right.
This way.
What do you think you're up to!
These are your crop records, I take it?
That's right, but I... really don't see what it has to do with you.
It's a very poor showing, isn't it?
Are you operating above subsistence level?
We're surviving!
Come on!
No, no, just a minute.
I'd like to hear what he has to say.
Unless I'm very much mistaken, you've got far more to worry about that mineralogist.
Just what do you mean by that?
Unless things improve radically, you're in grave danger of starving to death...
I don't care what Ashe says, we say it, didn't we?
I'm sure Ashe believes you.
You can sit where you like.
Ah, he thinks we're seeing things.
You two had better watch out.
It could be you next.
Ashe will take care of things.
Is that the first course?
It's the only course.
Supplies are getting a bit low.
_ bound to be difficult.
It's very nice.
Thank you.
I'd better get back to my husband.
At least it's better than being back on Earth.
Oh, I don't know - things weren't so bad there.
Weren't they.
No room to move?
Polluted air?
Not a blade of grass left on the planet, and a government that locks you up if you think for yourself.
At least they fed you - this isn't exactly the Garden of Eden.
And Ashe said we could make it further.
Are you ready, Martin?
We're going to look for your monsters.
Let's hope we find something.
You may be sorry if you do.
Oh, we can skin it and you can use it for a rug.
Hello!
Hello.
I'm Mary Ashe.
My father told me about you.
Jo Grant, how do you do?
Is that what they're wearing on Earth now?
More or less...
It was all quite different when we left back in '71.
You left in 1971?
No, 2471!
I've been checking the northern sector.
How's it going?
It isn't.
These cover crops won't even start to grow.
What about the other sectors?
Huh!
It's even worse.
Never mind, my dear.
We should never have come here.
We didn't even have a room of our own on Earth.
Now, we've got land.
What's the point of owning land if it won't grow a decent crop?
Ashe is working on it.
Ashe knows we're beaten.
He just won't admit it.
Anyway, probably doesn't matter anymore.
What do you mean?
Those people that I found this morning - suppose they are spies for one of the big mining combines.
You seemed to believe what they say.
What was that?
I don't know.
Must have been the wind.
Even if the mining combines do come, they can't drive us out.
We were here first.
Oh, can't they?
It's happened before.
Get on the radio!
Don't go out there!
Maybe I can drive it off.
Hello?
Main dome - can you hear me?
!
Can you hear me?
!
This is main dome.
Please identify.
This is Jane Leeson.
Our dome is being attacked.
Some kind of giant reptile!
Please, you must send help!
Who are you?
What do you want?
Go away!
Go away!
See if I've got this right - you brought your colonists to this planet just over a year ago?
Yes.
You set up your main dome here... with all your subsidiary domes around it.
That's right.
I made a preliminary survey before I sent for the others.
And you were convinced that this planet was suitable for habitation, despite the exhaustion of the soil?
Well, worn out soil can be reclaimed, Doctor, as you well know.
We should have had subsidence crops within the year.
Exactly - should have.
The cover crop refuses to grow!
We plant it; it shoots up and then withers - again and again.
There seems to be no reason for it.
Well, in theory, you should have a bumper crop by now.
I can't feed my people on theories, Doctor.
No, no, of course not.
Well, in practical terms, what you must do is this...
Jane Leeson's just radioed in!
Well, can't it wait?
I'm very busy.
She say's their dome's being attacked!
Attacked?
By some kind of giant reptile!
I heard it too - she sounded terrified!
The radio cut out while she was still talking.
But didn't you say you'd sent some men down there?
Yes, but to Martin's dome at the other end of the colony.
Look; get in touch with Winton.
Tell him to get over to Leeson's dome as fast as he can.
I'll join you there.
I'll come with you, if I may.
Well, there's no need for you to get involved, Doctor.
Scientific curiosity, my dear chap.
I find your planet most intriguing.
Very well, thank you.
Doctor, I don't think you should go.
It might be dangerous.
Jo, don't worry about me.
I'll be careful.
Now go and get some sleep.
Sleep!
How do you expect me to s..?
Doctor!
_at Leeson's dome.
I repeat
- Leeson's dome.
Do you read me?
I read you.
We're on our way.
Be careful.
How long did you say you'd been on this planet?
Just over a year.
And you found no sign of these creatures then?
There's no animal life.
Just a few birds and insects.
Well, there is now.
Robert, there's nothing you could have done.
They were both dead when we got here.
Did you see the creatures?
We caught a glimpse of one as we arrived.
Everyone blazed away like mad.
And what happened?
Nothing.
It didn't even seem to notice.
You must have missed!
What - all of us?
We tried to get in closer but it just... disappeared.
Vanished into the darkness.
It'll be daylight soon.
Perhaps we shall be able to pick up tracks or bloodstains.
I doubt it.
Come and take a look at these claw marks, gentlemen.
Well, what about them?
Are you trying to tell me these were made by a giant lizard, Winton?
Yes, it must have been a least twenty-foot high.
Twenty foot high?
Yes.
Well, will you kindly tell me how a creature twenty feet high came through that door?
Why can't you admit defeat, Ashe?
We've got to get back to Earth.
If we go back to Earth, we'll be worse off than we were before.
All our savings have gone into this.
Then we must move on to another planet.
If we stay here, we'll be dead!
I'm not sure that we can move on.
Our spaceship was old when we bought it - it may not survive another trip.
Oh, Robert, why won't you admit your mistakes?
We've invested a year of our lives in this place.
We've got the beginnings of a colony.
Our food stocks are getting lower all the time.
We can't even support ourselves.
All right, we've got problems, but they can be overcome!
Ashe is perfectly right.
There is no reason why this planet should not support a thriving colony.
I suppose you're an expert in agriculture?
Yes, yes, as a matter of fact, I am.
Then why won't my crops grow?
Because they are being inhibited by some unnatural force!
We must track it down and overcome it.
But two people have been killed, or have you forgotten that?
Killed by creatures that vanish without trace?
Look, we saw something!
Whatever it was you saw can be destroyed!
This colony is our only hope.
If we leave it, we'll have nothing.
If we stay, we may have a future.
Why won't you...
He's right!
We've put too much work into this place to leave.
What if these animals attack again?
We fight back.
Good!
Now what about the rest of you?
Are you willing to give it another try?
Well, if there really is a chance...
There is if we stick together!
Now, what we've got to do is to organize patrols for the domes.
The Doctor here will help us with...
Robert, wait!
One of the patrols found him wandering in the south sector.
Get some water, somebody - quickly!
Where are you from?
Can you understand what I say?
It's all right, old chap, You're amongst friends now.
Who are you?
Where have you come from?
Colony... come from colony...
What colony?
Long way... from here.
Do you mean there's another colony on this planet?
I've been wandering...
long time... nine months.
These other colonists - well where are they?
Dead... they're all dead... giant lizards!
Lizards?
Came from nowhere... killed... everything.
I'm the only one...
left.
I hope you find what you're looking for, Doctor.
I only hope you're right.
No!
No, he is our friend.
Err, these are ours.
You must leave them.
Do they have a language of their own?
I've never heard them speak but they seem to understand what I say.
Extraordinary.
Must be some rudimentary telepathic ability.
Are they friendly?
Depends on how you treat them.
We had two colonists killed when we first moved here.
You... must go... now.
Just what are you looking for Doctor?
I've no idea.
Possibly some evidence to convince your colonists to stay.
Yes, I thought I'd won them over until that man turned up.
Now I don't know how long I can hold them.
Just play for time.
Yes.
Well, I'd better get back there to see what's happening.
Can you find your own way back?
Yes, oh yes, of course.
Right, I'll leave you to it then and... be careful.
[Ringing servant's entrance bell]
Well?
Mrs. Butlagens has sent me.
Well?
I've come about the position.
- As parlormaid, was it?
- Underhouse parlormaid.
I am the house parlormaid.
Well, come in.
- I'll tell Mr. Hudson you're here.
- Who's Mr. Hudson?
The butler.
Oh, the bloke all in black at the front door.
Wait in there.
Oh, my finger!
Oh, tab's coming off!
Not gone altogether, then has it?
Oh, I daren't look.
If you got blood on them potatoes, my girl,
You can throw them away, and start all over again.
And get a move on, girl!
Who are you, when you're at home?
[Bell rings]
Alfred has taken my buttons off, again,
I know he has.
What am I gonna do?
Go to Mr. Hudson, Miss Roberts.
Don't come whining around me.
I'm all behind, like a cow's tail.
Well, well?
Who are you?
- I've been sent by...
- Where're you going?
- Mind if I...?
- No.
Oh!
Alfred, get out from under my feet, right now!
Somebody answer that bell, Alfred!
Cat got you tongue, has it?
- Well, be off with you!
- No, you should let me explain...
Everywhere!
Oh...
No one cares.
My name is Clemance.
Clemance.
I've come about the position.
Clemance?
What sort of a name is that?
- Answer me.
I'm parlormaid,
- and you're still the boxwallah novelist.
A silent woman is above Rubies.
- Well!
- It's a French name.
- French!
Huh.
We don't want no foreign muck in here.
None of your nasty old Josine, thank you very much.
Greasy man again then, Mrs. Bridges?
Ow!
None of that behavior in my kitchen, Mr. Pearce.
- Get back to your stables!
- Mrs...
And be off with you!
Oh!
The milk's taut.
Now see what you've made me do, all.
This place'll be the death of me.
What's wrong with mutton, anyway?
I'll bleed to death.
Good!
Couldn't have anyone seen my button hooks, all twelve vanished.
Well, what's to become of me?
Let you discourse be "Yea, Yea" and "Nay, Nay."
for whatsoever is more than this is of evil.
Oh!
Ah!
Who is he?
Alfred, the footman.
Take no notice of him.
He was brought up religion.
I thought I told you to wait in there!
I'm sorry.
The cook said to bring...
I said nothing of the sort!
And it's Mrs. Bridges, if you please.
Not cook.
This is gentleman's house.
We're not making a very good start, are we?
Well, come on.
Mr. Hudson's waiting for you.
The new girl of our position, my lady.
Yes, Hudson.
Ask her to come in, will you?
- To whom it may concern, that there...
- Ahhh!
...the bearer of this letter is well recommended for domestic.
Uh huh.
- What is your name?
- Clemance du Main.
- And you are French?
- Of French.
You must call me my lady, when you reply.
I'm sorry, my lady.
This letter appears to be from someone whose name I cannot read.
who lives at the Chateau Lac du Champs, near Lyon.
I haven't heard of it.
My ma was overmaid till I got there.
Why did you leave your previous employment?
My mother was took sick, and I had to return to England.
- I hope she's better now.
- Why, my lady?
It's important to be able to concentrate on your work.
Oh, that's all right.
She died.
I'm sorry.
I must assume the agency has checked your reference.
Yes, that's right.
You're new to service, are you not?
That's all right...
This hat and all their mitts and everything all over this chair
They'd never take that girl on.
Her?
She couldn't tell a feather duster from a boa constrictor.
Quite unsuitable.
She went to the front door!
You're quite right, Rose.
Untrained and blind to all we posses.
Is luncheon ready, Mrs. Bridges?
I confess to a wholesome appetite.
Two shakes of a lamb's tail, Mr. Hudson.
I've had trouble with range again.
That's according to the coal.
Isn't it, Emily.
[Bell ringing]
Ho!
That must be in the morning room.
[Bell rings]
Yes.
Mr. Hudson.
Right, thank you, Rose.
Clemance du Main.
Why's she trying to get into service with a name like that?
Well, I hope she gets taken on.
I like her.
It's not for you to hope, nor not hope neither, for that matter, Emily.
It's for you to keep the fire in.
You let it go on purpose.
Oh, I never did.
The coal's wet.
And that's Alfred's fault.
He always leaves the coal house door open.
I'll put you in the coal house.
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust.
They're past blame, Emily.
Aw, now, you're against me, too.
Oh, yes, Hudson.
I intend to engage this young woman.
She'll have her dinner in the servant's hall, and collect her belongings afterward.
Rose can show her what to do.
And, the young person's name my lady?
- Sarah.
- No, my name is Clemance.
- Clemance is not a servant's name.
- Yes but, I don't like...
Go with Hudson, Sarah.
- Remember, you're here on trial.
- Yes, my lady,
Mr. Hudson, do I have to be called Sarah?
- Yes.
- I don't like it.
It is not for you to question your betters.
- Are you my better?
- Indeed I am.
What makes you better than me.
I'm not being rude.
I just want to know.
I am older than you, and therefore wiser, and I've learned humility.
[Gasp]
You?
- It is a hard lesson, but once learned never forgotten.
How did you learn it?
My grandmother was a proud woman and died of starvation.
I just can't abide cold food.
Greasy mutton.
- It'll taste all the better for the waiting.
Emily, another plate.
- Alfred, get a chair.
Thank you very much.
[Praying]
May the Lord bless our endeavors, and grant us conciliation for that rank
- in which in his infinite mercy he has seen fit to place us, and for what we are about to receive of his great bounty, we may be truly grateful that in the end we may find favor in his eyes, and sit in honor at his table.
Amen
- Amen.
- Amen
Sarah, is joining us as underhouse parlormaid, Miss Roberts.
Indeed, Mr. Hudson.
On trial, I take it.
On trial.
Rose, you are to instruct Sarah in her duties.
Yes, Mr. Hudson.
With a good heart, and a glad will, if you please, Rose.
Naturally, Mr. Hudson.
That's Miss Roberts.
She's her ladyship's personal maid.
- That's Mr. Pearce.
Mr. Pearce is the coachman.
- That's Emily.
Emily does...
[Mrs. Bridges knocks on the table.]
Silence, if you please.
- Everyone is served, Mrs. Bridges.
Thank you, Mr. Hudson.
You may talk.
Mutton again.
What's wrong with mutton, Mr. Pearce, with a nice drop of caper sauce?
Nothing, Miss Roberts, nothing at all.
Perhaps you'd prefer to eat hay, like your horses.
Forget I spoke, ladies.
- Could I have the caper sauce, please.
It's not food for young women.
No reach for glasses.
Millions would be grateful for what we have, Mr. Pearce.
- Wouldn't you agree, Sarah?
Mr. Hudson's addressing you, Sarah.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
It's just that the name's so unfamiliar.
Couldn't I be called Clemance if only down here?
Oh, my dear, I've never heard of such a name belowstairs.
Whatever was your mother thinking of?
Search the good book from cover to cover and not find that name.
Lady Marjorie's wishes must be respected.
Clemence.
A good name for a filly, I'll say that, but hardly a human.
I think it's a lovely name.
- As I was saying... millions would be grateful for mutton once a week, let alone mutton once a day.
Wouldn't you agree, Sarah?
Yes, Mr. Hudson.
[Hudson chuckles]
Did you really live in France, Sarah?
Yes.
Were you in service there?
No, I lived in a chateau.
Once I had my own maid, like Lady Marjorie.
I think we must learn to take Sarah's statements with a pinch of salt.
I don't lie, eh.
I didn't you say you did?
Of course she just exaggerates.
If our ladyship finds Sarah satisfactory, I'm sure we all do.
It is not for us either to chose or judge our companions in service.
Rose, as you know very well.
How about some more caper sauce, dear?
Thank you.
Say something in French, then.
Some other time.
Ha. ha.
What are you laughing for?
Don't you believe me?
You're as English as I am.
I'm not.
My mother was a gypsy.
I can read hands and tell the future and put curses on people.
What, preserve us, the Witch of Ender, herself.
If my mother was a gypsy I wouldn't speak of it.
I nearly ran off with the gypsies once when I was a girl.
That was a long time ago.
Oh, not as long as all that, Mrs. Bridges.
A little more sauce, Mr. Hudson,
I think that's just a straight blend.
Thank you.
I'm not ashamed of my mother.
She was a gypsy princess and very beautiful.
More mutton, Mrs. Bridges?
Just a morsel, thank you, Mr. Hudson.
A French Count saw her and married her, and she died giving birth to me.
Well, my father married then a very wicked woman.
And when he died, she treated me like a servant and in the end she threw me out altogether.
But I've got lawyers fighting for me, and in the end, I'll come into my own.
In the meantime, I must live as best as I can.
- Oh, it's just like a story in a book.
- Exactly, Emily, a tale from a penny novelette.
All very well for a kitchen maid, but not what one expects for a house parlormaid.
Say something in French.
Go on.
Would you like me to read your hand for you, Mrs. Bridges?
Shall she read my hand, Mr. Hudson?
By all means, Mrs. Bridges, if it pleases you.
After dinner.
- Oh, do mine, do mine!
Wicked nonsense.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Rose.
Truth is stranger than fiction.
It's unhealthy and dangerous.
Not if you have a clear conscience.
It isn't given to mortals to know the future.
Oh, yes it is, but it's against the will of God.
Look what happened to King David.
He didn't do so bad though, did he?
Dirty old devil!
Mind your tongue some gardener,...
She ought to be locked up!
Rose!
That's enough.
Well, why won't she say something in French, then, answer that.
'Cause she's coward, that's why.
Because she don't chose to, that's why.
Don't let these old prudes upset you, Sarah.
What's for pudding, then, Mrs. Bridges.
Roly poly, Mr. Pearce.
And don't you go telling me nothing I don't want to hear, or you'll get your ears boxed.
- To meet with King David, then to the Witch of Ender,
- so does Mrs. Bridges seek knowledge from our Sarah, here.
- Huh, huh.
Someone's gonna' get struck by lightnin'.
Sarah, Sarah.
Say something in French.
Go on.
If you can.
[Sarah sings a song in French]
Auprès de ma blonde, qu'il fait bon, fait bon, fait bon,
Auprès de ma blonde, qu'il fait bon dormir.
[Alfred sneaks into Rose's and Sarah's bedroom]
Come on!
Get up!
It's half past five!
- Aw!
Alfred, I'll kill you!
- Where am I?
You're in Mr. Bellamy's house's servant's quarters, where else?
And it's time to get up.
[Sarah whines and rolls over]
[Rose opens the window]
If we get behind in the morning, there's trouble all day.
So up with you.
[Sarah complains]
Me legs won't work.
Me feet are cold.
Oh, they will.
Which they must.
It's half past five!
Light a one, Sarah.
Well, come on, you'll be late.
I trust you can remember your duties.
When you're dressed and ready...what then?
Uh.
I must make sure that Emily's got the range working properly, so that Mrs. Bridges can go on.
Then I lay out breakfast in the servants room.
Then there's Lady Marjorie's tray.
And don't forget to shine up the milk jug, for goodness sake, and don't leave sticky finger marks.
Then there's the servant's breakfast.
I suppose I'm allowed to sit down and eat.
After breakfast, make sure Emily's not hiding in the budo, again.
If she is, I'm going to barge in full view.
I shall be brushing and dusting in the drawing room and the morning room.
Well, go on.
Uh...
Then...upstairs I'll clean out the grates and relay and light the fires.
If I can find the matches.
You got a good memory, I'll say that for you.
Oh!
Why is a mouse doing in the grates, please.
Corn meat, the door master's box.
I'd better do that for the time being.
But you fetch your water.
Now, If the boiler's troublesome, you'll have to use the hot water kettle.
Now, after the baths, I'll do the upstairs breakfast.
I'd like you to help me there.
And make sure Emily's got all the boots and shoes done.
She keeps all of them in the sleeps in the morning, but I don't know why.
And keep out of Mr. Bellamy's way, whatever you do.
Why?
Just pretend you're not there, especially in the morning.
Such fussy boots.
That will never do.
You want to borrow a pair of mine?
- I have a spare pair.
- Thank you.
A bit smaller, I dare say, but better sore feet than shabby boots.
Oh, and today's the day for fresh bacon.
Now, it's a bit of a rush, but it's got to be done while they're having breakfast.
The Lady Marjorie eats like a little bird.
Oh, and the covers, of course.
How'm I going to remember it all?
Well, you must.
Anyway...here's a list.
Oh,...
I forgot.
You've got it upside down.
Oh, so I have.
What you call a certain girl?
I'm cold.
Um, well, work soon warms you.
[Cough]
[Blowing coals]
Oh, Mrs. Bridges will kill me.
[Blowing hard]
Oh, and I'm late with the morning tea, again.
Oh, oh, give the fire a blow again for me, will you?
It's not going properly yet.
You never have yet.
and you never will
[Kitchen doorbell rings]
Oh, who are you?
I work here.
Good luck, chicken.
Where is she?
Who?
Who d'ya think?
Oh, it's you, Mattie.
She's on the way down on the undercate colander.
She's in such a waspish.
You should be laying out the servant's breakfast, go on.
Yes.
Well, go on!
[Sarah watches the outside]
[Mrs. Bridges comes fussing at Emily]
Tastes like dishwater.
Not fit to drink.
Whatever it is.
If you put boiling water on that pub, my girl, may lightning strike me before it get's to you.
Oh, I swear I didn't, Mrs. Bridges.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
She's waiting for you, Mrs. Bridges.
Who?
Matty!
Why didn't you say so!
Put a fork on the table before you lay up.
[Sarah watches outside again]
There you are, Matty.
Nice plump one.
[Sarah puts two and two together]
Morning, Rose.
Good morning, Mrs. Bridges.
Sarah.
What are you thinking of?
Why isn't that table made?
What have you been doing?
I shall require my best silk hat.
Very good, sir.
I shall send it round to the hatter's for ironing this morning.
The, uh, new underhouse parlormaid, sir.
I see.
Oh, it's quite nice, isn't it?
But why change?
Mornings are housemaid.
Afternoons are parlormaid, see?
Oh.
Come on!
Is that kettle boiled yet?
Almost.
Get the silver sugar bowl from the cupboard.
What for?
Her ladyship's tray.
She'll be expecting it when she comes in.
No jobs in the lorry rolls
There we are.
Emily, where's Lady Marjorie gone to in the afternoons?
Playing cards, mostly, or just driving in the park.
To while away the time I suppose till Mr. Bellamy gets home from Parliament.
I wouldn't fancy it.
Oh, I would.
Imagine driving round and round in a fine carriage with strong white horses and everyone looking at you?
We'll give her ladyship that.
Fore wait.
Public chore.
Here, I'll take it up.
No!
Not until she rings for it.
And I'll take it up this afternoon.
You can fetch it, if you behave yourself.
Uh.
A very pleasant afternoon, my lady.
Yes, isn't it Hudson?
Your tea my lady.
Thank you, Rose.
Mrs. Bridges thought you might be a bit hungry, my lady.
Rose.
How do you find the new girl?
Quite satisfactory, my lady.
I hope you're looking after her.
Of course, my lady.
Will that be all, my lady?
She claims to be something of a seamstress.
So I set her to repairing the tapestry cushion.
I thought we were going to send it out, my lady.
Very old and very delicate, otherwise, of course,
I would have undertaken it myself.
Well, she has delicate fingers and nice, neat movements.
Yes, my lady.
Will that be all, my lady?
I'd be interested to see it as soon as she's finished it.
Very good, my lady.
If I was rich, I'd have a little cottage in the country, and no one to shout to me, and lots of kids.
I'd never forget the names, the way our Ma'am did us.
Oh, that's boring.
That's not exciting.
I want excitement.
Time for a chat, I see.
Tea's a poison;
full of tannin.
Sarah.
Yes.
I thought you were supposed to be sewing Lady Marjorie's cushion.
That pillow is worth hundreds of pounds.
You might at least be getting on with it.
- I've done it.
- Where.
Show me.
I see.
Well, you better take it up to her, hadn't you?
No, I want to finish me tea, oh...
- It's beautifully done.
- Thank you, my lady.
Where did you learn to sew like that?
In a convent.
- In France?
- Yes, that's right.
Were the nuns good to you?
Most of the time.
But, sometimes, they'd dress me in a long canvas robe and shut me up in the dark so with no food or water for a whole day.
Why?
Teach me to be thankful, my lady.
What for?
God's mercy.
That was a strange way of bringing you to know it.
That's what I said, and back I went.
What other talents have you besides sewing?
- None, really.
- Are you sure?
Well...
I can tell fortunes.
Hands and tea leaves.
I could do yours, my lady.
What nonsense.
No.
I'm very good at it.
I'm never wrong.
- I know what my future is.
- Do you, my lady?
Very well, Sarah, what do you see, then?
A tall, dark stranger from overseas, I suppose.
Yes, there is.
Bringing good fortune with him?
Bringing mixed fortune, good and bad.
He bears a sword, and is about to use it and should not.
Dear me.
Does it mean something to you, my lady?
Indeed, it does not.
You see, there's first an increase in wealth, then a decrease.
Now you are surrounded by many friends, and they all wish you well, except one, a false friend.
How alarming.
You should...watch yourself.
That's all, my lady.
Oh, there's a gentleman of great authority near the rim, nearly out of the picture, but I think, yes I think he's coming nearer to you.
Yes, Mr. Bellamy.
He'll be home soon.
This is superstitious nonsense.
- No, my lady...
- That'll do, Sarah.
You can go, now.
Sarah.
[Bell ringing]
Mr. Bellamy wanting to dress for dinner.
Her Ladyship's...
Oh, there she is!
I can't be in two places at once!
Alfred, are you sure you haven't seen her?
No.
What do I know about gloves?
I was sewing a button on them, you must have seen them.
Alfred, take these up to the dressing room.
Give the trousers a final brush before you lay them out.
Now, remain with that waist, as good as white, must remain white.
Now, look sharp, the carriage is ordered for eight o'clock.
Emily!
Yes, Mr. Hudson.
More coke in the boiler at once.
The bath water's not properly hot yet.
Oh, everything's at the last minute.
How can I ask Alfred tonight, but
I make sure...
Cool in the can, Miss Roberts.
Cool in the can.
- Mr. Hudson.
- Yes.
The carriage is here, and Mr. Pearce wants to know what time they're leaving.
Tell him eight o'clock.
He's early.
No. no.
Not there, my girl.
Up here in the pantry.
...after.
Hudson.
[Clock striking 8 o'clock]
[Carriage departing sounds]
- Where do you going?
- Out.
It's the gypsy in me.
I can't bear to be shut in.
Does Mr. Hudson know you're going?
Its only for a minute.
But, you have to ask him or you get into trouble.
I'm not asking, and you're not going to tell him, are you?
- No.
- Right.
Then I'll tell you fortune for you when I get back.
But if you breathe a word to a living soul, I'll curse you, and your blood will turn to ice in your veins and you will die horribly within the week.
There.
You'll ruin your eyes, Emily.
What's it matter.
I won't be needn'em much longer.
Nope.
When I breathe I get a pain.
The good die young, they say.
And I have a the impression on me chest.
[Emily coughs]
I wish you'd stop reading that rubbish.
It isn't rubbish!
Things like that do happen.
I think Sarah is more tragic and more romantic than anything in the book.
I would lay down my life for her, if it was asked.
Would you?
Well, where is she, then?
I do not know.
I am silent.
What's the matter with you?
Torch me to death if you wish.
My lips are sealed.
Well, for goodness sake.
I only wanted her to turn down the beds.
It's on her list as clear as daylight.
Or, do I have to do her work, too.
And you can pull out my toenails one by one and still I shan't speak.
What's the matter with that girl?
Why aren't you in bed?
I want to wait up till they come back.
They won't be anything to see.
There might be.
They could bring someone with them.
Oh, a tall, dark stranger from across the seas who'll fall in love with me, and take me away from all this!
It's Sarah.
She's been puttin' ideas in her head.
She has strange powers.
She sees things we can't see.
Stuff and nonsense.
The kind we cannot discover, Mrs. Bridges.
We can not.
I'm just gonna' fetch some bread and cheese.
D'you care for a bit, Rose?
Very much, Mrs. Bridges.
I'll have a bit, thank you.
Emily.
You sure you don't know where Sarah is?
-Well, she's...
-She's not in the kitchen.
She's not in the pantry.
Emily, look at me.
I want the truth.
Oh, what's this?
Who's been at my larder?
Where's the strug smith to madam of a place on the left?
-Miss...
-What's happening?
Somebody's stolen a bird out of my larder.
That's what happened.
Are you sure?
You think I don't know me own larder?
Mr. Hudson!
Emily, where is Sarah.
She hasn't gone out, has she?
Did you call, Mrs. Bridges?
-I did, indeed, Mr. Hudson.
-Why was that, Mrs. Bridges.
Because a plump and dressed bird cannot walk, Mr. Hudson.
We have a thief in our midst.
A human foxed up chicken stealer.
When I lay my eyes on her, I'll skin her alive!
Or him.
Kindly assemble the staff in question.
If that's what you want, Mrs. Bridges.
How long has the melancholy fowl been missing?
Twenty minutes, Mr. Hudson since I last saw it laying on the shelf.
Oh, in that case, we have the staff in question assembled.
With the exception of Sarah, who seems to be temporarily absent.
You would hardly steal you own bird, Mrs. Bridges and then complain of it.
We know Rose would not, could not, and if Emily had done it I swear there would still be feathers 'round her mouth.
It was a plumped and dressed bird, Mr. Hudson.
Not a feather left upon it.
Even the back fluff was singed.
I was speaking in metaphor, Mrs. Bridges.
I'm led to the conclusion that the guilty party is none other than Sarah.
A stranger in our midst.
Not the gipsy princess after all, but a common thief.
I knew it.
And what is to be done with a creature so unnatural?
I stole it.
And in what dark hole, I wonder, is she hiding?
It was me, not her!
Emily knows.
I know nothing.
I don't want my blood turn to ice.
All this fuss about a bird.
It was you who summoned me, Mrs. Bridges.
Well, perhaps a rat took it off.
Or, it's in a cockroach, who's working in earnest, I dare say.
A principle is at stake ladies.
A chicken today, emeralds tomorrow, and the whole staff under suspicion.
It is not, after all, as if Sarah has the privileges granted by custom and common humanity to the cook.
When she comes back, I'll skin her alive.
Oh, I swear, I swear I don't know where she is.
If she comes back!
It'd be better for everyone if she didn't!
Well!
-Sarah, I never told them.
-Sarah!
Come in here!
-but I never said a word.
-Shut the door.
-Liar!
-whisper...a whisper Sarah.
-Slut!
-speak at night...
Rose!
That's enough of that!
You, too, Emily.
We have reason to believe that you have stolen a chicken from Mrs. Bridge's larder.
That you have crept out into the night to dispose of the forbidden loot, and have returned with your ill-gotten profits concealed about your person.
What have you to say about yourself?
Well?
If Mrs. Bridges can do it, why the hell shouldn't I?
Well?
[Carriage approaching]
[Alfred opens door]
Thank you, Alfred.
You should go to bed now.
Thank you, sir.
[Door closes]
[Bedroom door closes]
Hmmm.
You'll have nothing, my dear?
No, thank you.
Strange to see Archie Hazlett across the dining table again.
And his new wife.
But I see why it all happened.
What eyes that woman has.
One can hardly excuse it.
It's the thin end of the wedge, you know.
Soon, we'll see divorced people everywhere be obliged to chat and smile as if it were nothing unusual.
In a moment I'm afraid you will say, And the old queen hardly cold in her grave.
It's true, I don't like change.
It goes too quickly, becomes not progress but disintegration.
Spoken like a good English woman, and an excellent wife for a Tory politician.
Oh...tomorrow's what I'm thinking about
Joe Chamberlain on tariff reform again, and the front bench shuffling in its shoes.
The Prime Minister should be more firm with him.
My father wouldn't have put up with it.
Your father, he'd have run them single-handedly if he could.
Knew the value of firmness and resolution.
And you're your father's daughter.
I hope so.
Don't bother your pretty head.
These are men's matters.
Don't say that!
Now, why should I not bother my head?
I have precious little else to fit in it.
-No.
You do so much.
-What do I do?
-You run this house.
-The servants do that in their own way.
Yes, and a lot goes on that I know nothing about.
I saw a light downstairs.
The servants are still up.
Have some hot milk.
Everyone worries too much about me.
Now don't drink.
You know I don't like bells ringing late in dark corridors.
One day, you know, if things go on as they have been, you might ring and ring and no one would ever come.
-Umm?
-There's be nobody there.
I'm not as bad as you think.
Don't get the police.
You're but a thief, Judanaiad.
When I saw Mrs. Bridges do it, I thought anyone could.
Then you were wrong to think you were as good as her.
No, I didn't think of it that way, please.
Oh, oh, please is it, now?
We have changed our tone, haven't we?
Look, I'm never do anything like it again.
I've given the money to Mrs. Bridges.
But, what good will it do to have me pinched?
Thought we was all on the same side.
Poor girl, one could pity her, I suppose.
She's a moral imbecile.
What have I done to you!
You pretend to be something you are not.
You make yourself out to be better than us.
Not better, just more interesting.
Well, it does no one any harm;
it's only a bit of fun.
How can lies be fun?
They're not lies, they're make believe.
You are what you are.
There's no escape not for you or me.
There must be some escape!
Oh, to be an underhouse parlormaid is not so terrible.
I think it'd be wonderful.
In a minute I'll remember you're here, Emily, and send you to bed.
But, I..
I ought to be here, Mrs. Bridges.
As a lesson to me.
What in?
Pride goin' before a fall.
Murder will out.
Oh, a stitch in time saves nine.
Anything you like, eh, believe it, but please don't send -me to bed.
-Bed!
Please!
Nuttin' exciting ever happens.
Why can't I stay and watch the police take her out?
Because the police aren't coming, Emily.
Not if Sarah chooses to confess her faults.
You are a common, ignorant, worthless girl, Sarah.
-Can you deny it?
-No.
-And a liar and a thief.
-Yes.
You are an ordinary person, Sarah.
Like the rest of us.
Yes.
And you told lies to Lady Marjorie.
You lied your way in, where you had no right.
Yes.
And you've no French blood in you.
Let alone, noble blood.
No.
And you are lucky to have found this home with us.
Yes.
Very well.
The police need not be called.
Thank you.
Ah, but upstairs must be informed.
Oh, no.
With a recommendation for mercy.
Oh, coming from you, Rose, I'm sure it'll be accepted.
Don't tell Lady Marjorie;
I'd be so ashamed.
Oh, she's not all bad, you see, she's capable of remorse.
Look, take this bible, Sarah, and read this page.
You will find written there the ten commandments.
Now, take note of the sixth commandment:
Thou shall not steal.
Now, repeat it to yourself.
Make her write it out, like at school.
Not a bad idea, Mrs. Bridges.
Rose, fetch the pen and paper.
She will write it out a dozen times in her best hand just to suit you, Mrs. Bridges.
Oh, thank you, Rose.
There, now.
Take the pen, and write for Mrs. Bridges.
Thou shalt not steal.
I can't, Mr. Hudson, I can't.
Go on, girl, write.
Mrs. Bridges is waiting for proof of you reformation.
No, please.
And why not?
I just...
I can't write!
I don't know how.
You can't write?
Not even can I read.
Mr. Hudson.
Didn't they send you to school?
I was needed at home.
Didn't your mother learn you.
I never had no mother.
I was with someone else's mother, from the age of five.
They went to school;
I stayed home.
She's very upset.
I think, perhaps, Mr. Hudson...
I dare say you're right, Mrs. Bridges.
What?
I dare say there's no necessity to tell them upstairs about this unfortunate incident.
A missing chicken, a dog, a cat, who's to say?
These things will happen, even in the best regulated household.
Thank you.
Now, you go to bed, my girl.
Yes, sir.
Go on, I'll do that, girl.
Oh, Rose, I'll turn down the lamps.
Just you tidy up a bit, will you?
[Gasp]
Did I startle you?
No.
It's just I wasn't expecting no one.
They've gone to bed.
Who?
The master and Lady Marjorie.
Oh.
-Don't you go up there.
-Huh?
Bit of trouble downstairs.
Raised voices, and heard Mr. Hudson's mostly.
Oh, that's, uh...
No, Mr. Sullivan, we were having an argy-bargy down there, all of us.
It won't come to tarny, might say.
I'll tell you somethinng, Sarah.
They're not a bit ritz.
The whole lot of 'em.
Write out the sixth commandment Thou shall not steal.
How do you know that?
You wasn't there?
I know everything that goes on in this house.
You were listening at the keyhole.
Slap!
[Sarah screams]
There's badness and sin in all of us.
Filth and degradation.
Let go of my arm and fist.
Beware the lusts of flesh.
Let me go to bed!
Kate would say.
Who's Kate?
Underhouse maid before you.
Lust not for thy neighbor.
For the wrath of the Lord shall be visited upon you.
[Sarah escapes upstairs]
[Sarah's room door opens]
[Rose] It's cold.
Go to bed.
All those big empty rooms down there, and us crammed up here together.
[Rose] Well?
-Who slept in this bed before me?
-A silly girl called Kate.
-What happened to her?
-She isn't here anymore.
-Why not?
-Curiosity killed the cat.
I expect she just withered away.
We'll probably find her, all shriveled up in the corner like a dead insect.
I know.
I'll ask Alfred what happened to her.
Shall I?
He's a real top.
I'll pop up there and ask him.
You've got to be up at five.
I hope you know your list.
Yes.
But you can't.
You can't read.
Oh, I was only saying that.
I was making it up.
Then read for me now!
If you're not struck dead by lightning.
I'm sorry.
I donno' what comes over me.
A bit difficult for you, I suppose.
I'll get up with you in the morning, and show you what to do.
Thank you.
Now, go to sleep.
Or you'll be good for nothing in the morning.
Why are you being so good to me?
I like the house to run properly, that's all.
We should help all our neighbors.
I used to dream of all kinds of future for myself.
Never thought I'd end up in service.
It's not so bad.
Safe.
You know where you are, and what's gonna' happen next.
The outside world is dangerous.
Nobody seems to ask us if we're ignorant.
You know, if you could read and write you'd not be so frightened.
and then, perhaps, you'd behave yourself.
There're so many things I wanna' do and be.
And time passes so quickly.
You've got to learn to accept.
But, I was gonna' be married once.
Huh.
He was killed in the war in Africa.
They gave him a medal for being so brave.
Silly bugger.
Why did you go into service, Rose?
Aw...well...when I was a girl, on Lady Majorie's family estate,
a carriage used to pass our cottage door every Thursday on it's way to market.
And the lady and gentleman, wot' rode in the carriage, well they'd once been like butler and housekeeper for a big family house nearby.
My mother put me into service, so I, too, would ride in a carriage one day.
[Sigh]
That was quite a sacrifice for Rose.
Oh, just sometimes, I do wish that carriage had taken another route to market.
You're very clever, aren't you, Rose?
Umm.
But you've got more...
for fever...
What?
[Man's voice heard outside]
[Shush heard]
[Man's voice again]
[Voice louder] Listen Rose, what is it?
[Voice shouts] Oh, it's only Alfred having one of his bad dreams.
-Does it happen often?
-Quite often.
He's a bit touched, you see.
Oh.
But Mrs. Bridges looks after him.
Well, we all do, really.
No ritter.
He's one of us.
[Small sounds from Alfred]
He's not...he's not gonna' murder us
-in our beds, is he?
-No.
I'll take care of you.
What's the matter?
I don't know.
I'm nervous mostly.
Would you like me to brush your hair?
Uh, huh?
Well, my mother used to do it for me when I was little.
It makes you go to sleep.
All right.

Pretty, huh ?
I'll bet a lot of you folks don't believe that, about a wish coming true, do you ?
Well, I didn't either.
Of course, I'm just a cricket singing my way from hearth to hearth, but...
let me tell you what made me change my mind.
One night a long time-- ahem.
Pardon me.
Wait'll I fix this thing.
There.
One night a long time ago... my travels took me to a quaint little village.
It was a beautiful night.
The stars were shining like diamonds... high above the roofs of that sleepy old town.
Pretty as a picture.
As I wandered along the crooked streets, there wasn't a soul to be seen.
The only sign of life was a lighted window... in the shop of a wood-carver named...
Geppetto.
So I hopped over... and looked in.
It was a shame to see a nice cheerful fire like that going to waste.
So what do I do ?
I go in !
I looked around.
Of course, being in a strange place like that,
I didn't know what to expect.
A cricket can't be too careful, you know.
Soon as I saw there was no one about, I made myself at home.
As I stood there warming my...
myself, I took a look around.
Well, sir, you never saw such a place.
The most fantastic clocks you ever laid your eyes on, and all carved out of wood.
And cute little music boxes, each one a work of art.
And shelf after shelf of toys and--
And then something else caught my eye.
A puppet !
You know, one of those marionette things, all strings and joints.
[ Chuckle ]
Cute little fellow.
Ding, ding.
Going up ?
Good piece of wood too.
[ Man ] Well, now,
- it won't take much longer.
- Meow.
Just a little more paint and he's all finished.
I think he'll be all right.
- Don't you, Figaro ?
- Purr.
## [ Humming ]
Ahh !
Beg pardon.
See ?
[ Chuckles ]
That makes a big difference.
Ver-r-r-y good.
Very, very good.
Well, you can't please everybody.
Now I have just the name for you.
Pinocchio !
Do you like it, Figaro ?
No ?
You do, don't you, Cleo ?
Well, we'll leave it to little woodenhead.
You like it ?
That settles it !
Pinocchio it is !
Come on, now, we'll try you out.
Music, Professor !
Hey !
Ouch, ouch !
Take it easy there !
Oh, break it up, will you ?
Whew !
Lotta down beats in there.
## [ Humming ]
# Little woodenhead go play your part #
# Bring a little joy to every heart #
# Little do you know and yet it's true #
# That I'm mighty proud of you #
# Little wooden feet and best of all #
# Little wooden seat in case you fall #
Oh-ho !
How graceful !
# My little woodenhead #
## [ Humming ] ## [ lmitating Trombone ]
Cleo, meet Pinocchio.
Say, "How do you do ?"
[ Chuckles ]
Say hello to Figaro.
Oops !
Oh-ho-ho !
Up to mischief already.
You see what happens ?
## [ Slowing ]
Boo !
[ Chuckling ]
- Up we go !
Ah, you're a cute little fellow.
- Meow.
Purr, purr.
And that smile !
You know, I--
- Meow !
- You rascal !
Jealous, huh ?
You know, Pinocchio,
I think Figaro is jealous of you.
Don't worry, Figaro.
I sti- [ Clocks Chiming ]
- Uh-oh.
Quack, quack.
Quack, quack.
Buzz, buzz.
Buzz, buzz.
- Cuckoo, cuckoo.
- Cuckoo, cuckoo.
Gobble, gobble.
Gobble, gobble.
Peep, peep.
Peep, peep.
Hiccup, hiccup, hiccup, hiccup.
Waa !
Waa !
Waa !
Waa !
I wonder what time it is.
It's getting late.
Come now.
We go to bed.
Good night, Pinocchio.
Little funny face.
Good night, Cleo, my little water baby.
Figaro ?
You say good night too.
Go on !
Now go to sleep, my little mermaid.
Good night.
Oh hum.
This is my idea of comfort.
Solid comfort.
[ Chuckle ] Look at him, Figaro.
He almost looks alive !
Wouldn't it be nice if he was a real boy ?
Oh, well.
Come on.
We go to sleep.
Ah, Figaro.
I forgot to open the window.
Oh, Figaro !
Look, look, the wishing star !
Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight.
I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I make tonight.
Figaro, you know what I wished ?
I wished that my little Pinocchio... might be a real boy !
Wouldn't that be nice ?
Just think.
A real boy.
A very lovely thought, but not at all practical.
A real... boy.
[ Snoring ]
[ Clocks Ticking ]
[ Snoring, Clocks Ticking ]
Quiet !
After all, enough's enough.
Now what's up ?
Hey, what's going on here ?
As I live and breathe, a fairy !
Mm-mmm !
Good Geppetto, you have given so much happiness to others.
You deserve to have your wish come true.
Little puppet made of pine, wake.
The gift of life is thine.
Whew !
What they can't do these days.
I can move !
I can talk !
I can walk !
- Yes, Pinocchio, I've given you life.
- Why ?
Because tonight Geppetto wished for a real boy.
Am I a real boy ?
No, Pinocchio.
To make Geppetto's wish come true...
- will be entirely up to you.
- Up to me ?
Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish,
- and someday you will be a real boy.
- A real boy !
That won't be easy.
You must learn to choose between right and wrong.
Right... and wrong ?
But how will I know ?
- How'll he know !
- Your conscience will tell you.
- What are conscience ?
- What are conscience !
I'll tell ya !
A conscience is that still, small voice people won't listen to.
That's just the trouble with the world today.
- Are you my conscience ?
- Who, me ?
Would you like to be Pinocchio's conscience ?
Well... uh, I, I--
Uh-huh.
Very well !
What is your name ?
Oh, Cricket's the name.
Jiminy Cricket.
- Kneel, Mr. Cricket.
- Huh ?
No tricks now.
I dub you Pinocchio's conscience.
Lord high keeper of the knowledge of right and wrong, counselor in moments of temptation... and guide along the straight and narrow path.
Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket.
Well !
Ho-ho-ho !
My, my !
Mmm !
Say, that's pretty swell.
Gee... thanks !
But... don't I get a badge or somethin' ?
We'll see.
- You mean, maybe I will ?
- I shouldn't wonder.
- Make it a gold one ?
- Maybe.
Now remember, Pinocchio, be a good boy.
And always let your conscience be your guide.
Good-bye, milady.
Good-bye.
## [ Humming ]
Not bad, says I.
Oh, yeah !
Ho-ho-ho !
Almost forgot about you.
Well, Pinoke, maybe you and I had better have a little heart-to-heart talk.
Why ?
- Well, you want to be a real boy, don't you ?
- Uh-huh.
All right, sit down, son.
Now, you see,
- the world is full of temptations.
- Temptations ?
Yep !
Temptations.
They're the wrong things that seem right at the time, but... even though the right things may seem wrong sometimes, sometimes the wrong things, [ Chuckle ] may be right at the wrong time, or... visa versa.
Ahem.
Understand ?
Uh-uh.
But I'm gonna do right !
Attaboy, Pinoke, and I'm gonna help ya !
And anytime you need me, you know, just whistle...
like this.
[ Whistle ]
Like this ?
[ Blows Air ]
No, no.
Try it again, Pinoke.
- Like this ?
[ Blows Air ]
- No, son.
Now listen !
[ Whistling ]
- [ Whistle ]
- That's it !
Come on, now.
Let's sing it !
# When you get in trouble and you don't know right from wrong #
# Give a little whistle # [ Whistle ]
- # Give a little whistle # - [ Whistle ]
# When you meet temptation and the urge is very strong #
# Give a little whistle Give a little whistle #
# Not just a little squeak Pucker up and blow #
- # And if your whistle's weak, yell #
- Jiminy Cricket ?
Right !
# Take the straight and narrow path #
# And if you start to slide give a little whistle #
# Give a little whistle #
# And always let your conscience be your guide # ## [ lmitating Trombone ]
# Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh #
## [ Saw Whistling ]
# Take the straight and narrow path #
# And if you start to slide #
# Give a little whistle # Yoo-hoo.
# Give a little whistle # Woo-hoo !
# And always let your conscience be your guide #
# And always let your conscience be your guide #
Look out, Pinoke !
- Who is there ?
- It's me.
Ahhh !
It's me.
Huh ?
Shh, Figaro !
There's somebody in here.
- Meow !
- Shh !
Careful now, Figaro.
He might spring out on us at any time.
He's in here somewhere.
- Here I am !
- [ Screeches ]
Ohh !
Pinocchio !
How did you get down here ?
- I fell down.
- Oh, you did.
Ohh !
You are talking.
- Uh-huh.
- No, no, no, no !
- Yes !
And I can move too !
- No, no, you can't !
I'm dreaming in my sleep !
Oh, wake me up !
Wake me up !
Now we see who's dreaming.
Go on... say something.
Gee, you're funny.
- Do it again !
- You do talk !
Yes !
The blue fairy came.
- The blue fairy ?
- Uh-huh, and I got a conscience.
- A conscience !
- And someday...
I'm gonna be a real boy.
A real boy !
It's my wish, it's come true !
Figaro, look !
Figaro, look !
He's alive, he can talk !
Say hello to Figaro.
Hello to Figaro.
Oh, Cleo !
I almost forgot.
Look, it's Pinocchio !
She's my little water baby.
Isn't she cute ?
[ Pinocchio ] Yeah, cute !
[ Geppetto Laughing ]
This calls for a celebration !
Music !
You start one, Pinocchio.
# Tra-la-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la #

Help!
Water!
- [ Screeches ]
Here it is !
I got it !
Here's water.
Here's some water.
Help !
Where's water ?
That was close.
Maybe we'd better go to bed... before something else happens.
Little man, you've had a busy night.
Now, close your eyes and go to sleep.
Why ?
Oh, everybody has to sleep.
Figaro goes to sleep, and Cleo.
And besides, tomorrow you've got to go to school.
Why ?
Oh, to learn things... and get smart.
[ Pinocchio ] Why ?
Ahh... because.
[ Pinocchio ] Oh.
[ Laughter ]
Oh, look, Father.
Look !
- Wait !
Stand still now.
- What are those ?
Huh ?
Oh, those !
They are your schoolmates, girls and boys.
Now get in.
They are your schoolmates, girls and boys.
Now get in.
- Real boys ?
- Yes !
But hurry now.
Oh, wait, wait !
Here's an apple for the teacher.
Now turn around and let me look you over.
[ Chuckling ]
Huh ?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Here.
Run along now.
Ho-ho-ho, wait, wait.
Come back here, Figaro.
School is not for you.
Good-bye, Father !
Good-bye, son.
Hurry back.
# Tra-la-la-la La-la-la ##
[ Laughing ]
Ah, Gideon, listen.
The merry laughter... of little innocent children wending their way to school.
Thirsty little minds rushing to the fountain of knowledge.
School, a noble institution.
What would this stupid world be without--
Well, well, well !
Stromboli !
So that old rascal's back in town, eh ?
Remember, Giddy, the time I tied strings on you... and passed you off as a puppet ?
We nearly put one over on that old gypsy that time !
[ Laughing ]
A little wooden boy.
Now, who--
A wooden boy !
Look, Giddy, look.
It's amazing.
A live puppet without strings.
A thing like that ought to be worth a fortune to someone.
Now let me see.
That's it !
Stromboli !
Why, that old faker would give his-
- Listen.
If we play our cards right, we'll be on easy street or my name isn't Honest John.
Quick !
We'll head him off.
Shh !
Now's our--
No, no, stupid.
- Don't be crude.
- [ Hiccups ]
Let me handle this.
Here he comes.
Ah, yes, Giddy, as I was saying to the duchess only yesterday--
Oh !
Oh, how clumsy of me !
My, my, my, my.
[ Honest John ] Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
- I do hope you're not injured.
- I'm all right.
Ah, splendid !
Well, well.
Quite a scholar, I see.
Look, Giddy, a man of letters.
- Here's your book.
- I'm going to school.
School !
Ah, yes.
Then you haven't heard of the easy road to success.
- Uh-uh.
- No ?
I'm speaking, my boy, of the theater !
Here's your apple.
Bright lights, music, applause !
- Fame !
- Fame ?
Yes !
And with that personality, that profile, that physique--
Why he's a natural born actor, eh, Giddy ?
- But I'm going--
- Straight to the top.
I can see your name in lights, lights six feet high.
- What is your name ?
- Pinocchio.
Pinocchio !
P-I-N-U-O-
- Uh--
We're wasting precious time.
Come.
On to the theater !

- Oh, it's Jiminy !
Whatcha doin' up there ?
- Huh ?
Who ?
Wh-What ?
[ Honest John ] Jiminy ?
Up where ?
Shh.
- You must be seeing things.
- Oh, no, that's my conscience.
Now, now, now.
Just calm down.
Why, there's nothing up there to be afraid of.
[ Groaning ]
[ Muffled Mumbling ]
Psst !
[ Whistle ] Pinoke !
Psst.
Pinoke ?
Over here.
Over here.
Oh, Jiminy, I'm gonna be an actor !
All right, son.
Take it easy now.
- Remember what I said about temptation?
- Uh-huh.
- Well, that's him.
- Oh, no, Jiminy.
- That's Mr. Honest John !
- Honest John ?
[ Mumbling ]
Get me outta here !
Ohh !
All right then, here's what we'll tell 'em.
You can't go to the theater.
Say "Thank you just the same."
- You're sorry, but you've got to go to school.
- Mm-hmm.
[ Honest John ] Pinocchio ?
Oh, Pinocchio !
Woo-hoo.
Here they come.
Now you tell 'em.
Woo-hoo !
Oh, little boy !
There you are !
Where were we ?
Ah, yes... on to the theater !
[ Pinocchio ] Good-bye, Jiminy, good-bye !
- # Hi diddle dee dee An actor's life for me #
- Huh ?
Good-bye ?
- Pinoke, you can't go !
- # A high silk hat and a silver cane #
- There he goes.
- # A watch of gold with a diamond chain ##
What'll I do ?
I'll run and tell his father.
No, that'd be snitching.
I'll go after him myself.
Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude the performance of this great show,
Stromboli, the master showman-- that's-a me.
And by special permission of the management-- that's-a me too.
Is presenting to you something... you will absolutely refuse to believe !
- [ Crowd Murmuring ]
- Well, looks like a sellout.
Introducing the only marionette-a... who can a-sing and a-dance... absolutely without the aids of a-strings.
I hope-a so.
The one... and only...
Pinocchio !
- [ Applause ]
- Hmph !
What a buildup.
# I got no strings to hold me do-- #
[ Laughter ]
Go ahead...
make a fool of yourself !
Then maybe you'll listen to your conscience.
[ High-pitched Squealing ]
[ Muttering ln Italian ]
[ Laughter ]
Cute kid.
[ ltalian Continues ]
# I got no strings to hold me down #
# To make me fret or make me frown #
# I had strings but now I'm free #
# There are no strings on me #
# Heigh ho the merry-o #
# That's the only way to be #
# I want the world to know #
# Nothing ever worries me I got no strings-- #
What I told you, huh ?
# They got strings but you can see #
# There are no strings on me #
[ Laughter, Applause ]
# You have no strings Your arms is free #
# To love me by the Zuider Zee #
# Ya-ya-ya if you would woo #
# I'd bust my strings for you #
# You've got no strings Comme ci, comme ca #
# Your savoir faire is ooo-la-la #
# I've got strings but entre nous #
# I'd cut my strings for you #
# Down where the Volga flows there's a Russian rendezvous #

Hey !
Hey !
Hey !
Hey !

Hey !
- Hey !
- Hey !
- # There are no strings on me ## - [ Laughter ]
[ Cheering ]
Huh ?
They like him.
He's a success.
Gosh !
Maybe I was wrong.
Well... guess he won't need me anymore.
What does an actor want with a conscience anyway ?
[ Geppetto ] What could have happened to him ?
Where could he be at this hour ?
I'd better go out again and look for him.
And remember, nobody eats a bite... until I find him.
[ Door Closes ]
[ Cleo Gurgles ]
[ Stromboli ] # I got-a no strings but I got-a the brain #
# I buy a new suit and I swing-a the cane #
# I eat-a the best and I drink-a champagne #
# I got-a no strings on me ##
- Bravo, Pinocchio !
- They liked me !
Mmm !
200 !
- You are sensational !
- You mean, I'm good ?
Ahhh !
300 !
You are colossal !
Does that mean I'm an actor ?
Sure !
I will push you in the public's eye.
Your face, she will be on everybody's tongue.
Will she ?
Ye-
- Huh ?
What's this ?
[ Grumbling ]
[ Muttering ln Italian ]
Ahhh !
For you, my little Pinocchio.
For me ?
Gee, thanks !
I'll run right home and tell my father.
[ Coughing ]
Home ?
Oh, sure.
Going home to your father.
Oh, that is very "comeecal."
You mean, it's funny ?
Oh, sure !
Yes.
- I'll be back in the morning.
- Be back in the morning !
[ Mumbling ] Going home ?
There, this will be your home...
- where I can find you always !
- No, no, no !
Yes, yes, yes !
To me... you are belonging.
We will tour the world.
Paris.
London.
Monte Carlo.
"Constantinopolee."
No, no !
Yes !
We start tonight !
Mmmm !
You will make lots of money... for me !
And when you are growing too old, you will make good firewood !
[ Wicked Laugh ]
Let me outta here.
I gotta get out !
You can't keep me !
Quiet !
Shut up !
Before I knock-a you silly !
Good night, my little wooden gold mine.
[ Wicked Laugh ]
No !
No, wait !
Lemme out !
I'll tell my father !
[ Stromboli ] Giddy up !
Get along there.
Jiminy !
Oh, Jiminy !
[ Whistle ]
Jiminy, where are you ?
[ Whistle ]
- Jiminy Cricket !
- [ Thunder ]
Well, there he goes.
Sitting in the lap of luxury, the world at his feet.
Oh, well, I can always say "I knew him when."
I'll just go out of his life quietly.
I would like to wish him luck though.
Sure !
Why not ?
Pinocchio ?
Pinocchio !
It's me, your old friend, Jiminy.
Remember ?
Jiminy !
Gee, I'm glad to see ya !
Pinocchio, what's happened !
What did he do to ya ?
He was mad.
He said he was gonna push my face in everybody's eye.
- Yeah ?
- And just 'cause I'm a goldbrick, he's gonna chop me into firewood !
Oh, is that so ?
Now, don't you worry, son.
I'll have you outta here in no time at all.
Why, this is just as easy... as rolling' off a... umph !
[ Clanking ]
Kinda rusty.
[ Clanking ]
Needs a little oil.
[ Echo ] Needs a little oil, needs a little oil.
That's what I said.
Woo-hoo-hoo !
Must be one of the old models.
You mean, you can't open it ?
Yeah.
Looks pretty hopeless.
- It'll take a miracle to get us outta here.
- Gee.
Pinocchio ?
[ Thunderclap ]
Pinocchio !
Giddy up !
[ Mumbling ]
- Pinocch-- - [ Thunderclap ]
A fine conscience I turned out to be.
I shoulda listened to you, Jiminy.
No, it was my fault.
I shouldn't have walked out on you.
Guess I'll never see my father again.
Oh, buck up, son.
It could be worse.
Be cheerful...
like me !
Aw, take it easy, son.
Come on, blow.
Attaboy.
Oh, well, it stopped raining anyway.
Hey, that star again !
The lady !
The fairy !
What'll she say ?
What'll I tell her ?
You might tell her the truth.
Why, Pinocchio !
Uh... hello !
- Sir Jiminy !
- Well !
This is a pleasant surprise !
Ha-ha.
Pinocchio, why didn't you go to school ?
School ?
Well, I--
Go ahead, tell her.
I was going to school 'til I met somebody.
- Met somebody ?
- Yeah, two big monsters !
With big green eyes.
Why, I--
Monsters ?
Weren't you afraid ?
No, ma'am.
But they tied me in a big sack.
You don't say !
- And where was Sir Jiminy ?
- Huh ?
Oh, Jiminy ?
Psst.
Leave me outta this.
They put him in a little sack.
- No !
- Yeah !
- How did you escape ?
- I didn't.
They chopped me into firewood !
Oh, look, my nose !
What's happened ?
Perhaps you haven't been telling the truth, Pinocchio.
- Perhaps ?
- Oh, but I have !
Every single word !
Oh, please help me.
I'm awful sorry.
You see, Pinocchio, a lie keeps growing and growing... until it's as plain as the nose on your face.
She's right, Pinoke, you better come clean.
I'll never lie again, honest, I won't.
Please, your honor, uh, I mean...
Miss Fairy.
Give him another chance for my sake.
Will ya ?
Huh ?
I'll forgive you this once.
But remember, a boy who won't be good... might just as well be made of wood.
[ Together ] We'll be good, won't we ?
Very well, but this is the last time I can help you.
Gee, look, Jiminy !
My nose !
Hey, we're free.
Come on, Pinoke.
[ Stromboli ] # I buy-a new suit and I swing-a the cane #
# I eat-a the fish and I drink-a champagne #
# I got-a no strings on me ##
Toodle-ooo, Stromboli.
- Good-bye, Mr. Stromboli.
- Shh !
Quiet !
Let's get outta here before something else happens.
[ Honest John ] # Hi diddle dee dee An actor's life for me #
# A high silk hat and a silver cane #
# A watch of gold with a diamond chain #
# Hi diddle dee day An actor's life is gay # # lt's great to be a celebrity #
# An actor's life for me ##
And the dummy fell for it.
Ha-ha !
Hook, line and sinker !
[ Laughing Continues ]
[ Hiccups ]
[ Honest John ] And he still thinks we're his friends !
And did Stromboli pay !
Plenty !
[ Wicked Laugh ]
That shows you how low Honest John will stoop.
Eh, Giddy ?
[ Hiccups ]
Now, Coachman, what's your proposition ?
Well, how would you blokes like to make some real money ?
Well...
and who do we have to, eh--
No, no !
Nothing like that.
You see...
I'm collecting stupid little boys.
Stupid little boys ?
You know, the disobedient ones what play hooky from school.
Ohh !
And you see-- [ Whispering ]
Yes.
Oh !
...and I takes 'em to Pleasure Island !
Ah, Pleasure Island.
Pleasure Island ?
But the law, suppose they--
No, no.
There is no risk !
They never come back...
as boys !
[ Wicked Laugh ]
Now...
I've got a coach load leaving at midnight.
We'll meet at the crossroads and no double-crossing !
- No, sir.
- Scout around.
- Any good prospects you find, bring 'em to me.
- Yes, chief.
- I'll pay you well.
I got plenty of gold.
- Yes, yes.
No, sir, nothing can stop me now.
I'll make good this time.
- You'd better !
- I will.
I'm going to school.
That's the stuff, Pinoke.
I'd rather be smart than be an actor.
Now you're talkin' !
Come on, slowpoke.
I'll race ya home.
[ Honest John ] Well, well, Pinocchio, what's your rush ?
I gotta beat Jiminy home.
Oh, hello.
- Well, how is the great actor ?
- I don't want to be an actor.
- Stromboli was terrible !
- He was ?
Yeah, he locked me in a bird cage.
- He did ?
- Uh-huh, but I learned my lesson.
- I'm going--
- Oh, you poor, poor boy.
You must be a nervous wreck.
That's it !
You are a nervous wreck.
Ahem.
We must diagnose this case at once.
Quick, Doctor, your notebook.
Bless my soul.
Mmmmm !
Mm-hmm !
My, my.
Just as I thought.
A slight touch of monetary complications... with bucolic semi-lunar contraptions of the flying trapezes.
Mm-hmm !
Say hippopotamus.
- Hi-ho-hotamus.
- I knew it !
Compound transmission of the pandemonium... with percussion and spasmodic frantic disintegration !
- Close your eyes.
What do you see ?
- Nothing.
- Open them.
Now what do you see ?
- Spots !
Ha-ha !
Now that heart.
- [ Beating ]
- Ooo !
My goodness !
A palpitating syncopation of the killer diller... with a wicky wacky stomping of the floy joy !
Quick, Doctor, that report.
Oh !
This makes it perfectly clear.
My boy, you are allergic.
- Allergic ?
- Yes !
And there is only one cure.
- A vacation... on Pleasure Island !
- Pleasure Island ?
Yes !
That happy land of carefree boys... where every day is a holiday !
- But I can't go.
I--
- Why, of course you can go.
I'm giving you my ticket.
- Here.
- Thanks !
But I'm--
Oh, tut-tut-tut, I insist.
Your health comes first.
Come, the coach departs at midnight !
# Hi diddle dee dee lt's Pleasure Isle for me #
# Where every day is a holiday and kids have nothing to do but play ##
Pinoke ?
Oh, Pinoke ?
Now where do you suppose he-- Huh ?
Pinocchio !
Hey, come back.
Giddy up.
[ Coughing ]
Well, [ Coughing ] here we go again.
My name's Lampwick.
What's yours ?
Pinocchio.
Ever been to Pleasure Island ?
Uh-uh.
But Mr. Honest John gave me--
Me neither, but they say it's a swell joint.
No school, no cops.
You can tear the joint apart and nobody says a word.
Honest John gave me--
Loaf around, plenty to eat, plenty to drink.
- And it's all free !
- Honest John--
Boy, that's the place.
I can hardly wait !
[ Boat Whistle Toots ]
[ Cheering ]
## [ Carnival ]
[ Barker ] Right here, boys !
Right here.
Get your cake, pie, dill pickles and ice cream.
Eat all you can.
Be a glutton.
Stuff yourselves.
It's all free, boys.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
The rough house, the rough house.
It's the roughest, toughest joint ya ever seen.
- Come in and pick a fight, boys.
- Oh, boy, a scrap !
- Come on.
Let's go in and poke somebody in the nose.
- Why ?
- Just for the fun of it.
- Okay, Lampy.
[ Barker ] Tobacco Road.
Get your cigars, cigarettes and chewing' tobacco.
Smoke your heads off.
There's nobody here to stop you.
Pinocchio ?
[ Coughing ]
Pinocchio !
There's something...
phony about all this.
I gotta get him outta here !
[ Barker ] Hurry, hurry, hurry.
See the model home.
It's open for destruction and it's all yours, boys !
She's all yours.
What'd I tell ya ?
Ain't this a swell joint ?
Yeah !
Being bad's a lot of fun, ain't it ?
Yeah, uh-huh.
Get a load of that stained-glass window.
All right, now.
Hop to it, you blokes.
- [ Whip Cracking ]
- Come on !
Come on !
Shut the doors and lock 'em tight.
Now get below and get them crates ready.
Give a bad boy enough rope and he'll soon make a jackass of himself.
[ Wicked Laugh ]
[ Jiminy ] Pinocchio !
Pinocchio ?
[ Whistle ]
Where is everybody ?
The place is like a graveyard.
I don't like the looks of this.
Pinocchio !
Hey, where are you ?
[ Whistling ]
Where do you suppose all the kids went to, Lampwick ?
They're around here somewheres.
What do you care ?
- You're havin' a good time, ain't ya ?
- Uh-huh, I sure am.
Oh, boy !
This is the life, huh, Pinoky ?
Yeah !
It sure is !
Ah, you smoke like me grandmother !
Come on, take a big drag like this.
Okay, Lampy.
Heh, some fun, huh, kid ?
Okay, Slats, your shot.
[ Lampwick ] What's the matter, Slats ?
Losing your grip ?
[ Jiminy ] Pinocchio !
So this is where I find you !
How do you ever expect to be a real boy ?
Look at yourself...
smoking, playing pool !
Hey... who's the beetle ?
Let go !
Put me down !
[ Muffled ] Let me out.
He's my conscience !
He tells me what's right and wrong.
What ?
You mean, you take orders from a grasshopper ?
Grasshopper ?
Look here, you impudent young pup !
It wouldn't hurt you to take orders from your grasshop--
Your conscience, if you have one.
Yeah-yeah, sure.
Screwball in the corner pocket.
Woo-hoo-hoo !
Why, why-- ya young hoodlum !
I'll knock your block off !
- [ Laughing ]
- I'll take you apart and put you back together !
Oh, don't hurt him, Jiminy.
He's my best friend.
Why, I'll-- Your best friend ?
And what am I ?
Just your conscience !
Okay, that settles it !
- But, Jiminy ?
- You buttered your bread, now sleep in it !
[ Yells ]
Ha-ha-ha !
Go on, laugh.
Make a jackass outta yourself.
I'm through !
- This is the end.
- But, Jiminy ?
- Lampwick says a guy only lives once.
- Lampwick... hmph !
Come on, come on.
Let him go.
Lampwick... hmph !
Lampwick !
It burns me up.
After all I tried to do for him.
Who's his conscience, anyway ?
Me or that hoodlum, Lampwick ?
I've had enough of this.
I'm taking the next boat out of here.
Open up that door !
I wanna go home.
Hee-haw !
Hee-haw !
[ Coachman ] Come on, you blokes, keep 'em moving !
Lively there now.
We haven't got all night.
[ Braying Continues ]
Where'd all the donkeys come from ?
Come on, come on.
Let's have another.
- And what's your name ?
- Hee-haw !
Okay, you'll do !
In you go !
[ Coachman ] You boys'll bring a nice price.
[ Wicked laugh ] All right, next !
And what might your name be ?
- Alexander.
- Hmm.
So you can talk !
Yes, sir.
I wanna go home to my mama !
Take him back !
He can still talk !
Please, please !
I don't wanna be a donkey.
- Let me outta here !
- Quiet !
You boys have had your fun.
Now pay for it !
Boys ?
So that's what-- Pinocchio !
Huh !
To hear that beetle talk... you'd think somethin' was gonna happen to us.
Conscience !
Aw, phooey !
Where's he get that stuff ?
How do you ever expect to be a real boy?
What's he think I look like?
- A jackass ?
- You sure do !
Hee-haw, hee-haw !
Hey, you laugh like a donkey.
Hee-haw !
Did that come outta me ?
Oh !
Huh ?
What the-
- What's going on ?
Aaah !
I've been double-crossed !
Help !
Help !
Somebody, help !
I've been framed !
Help !
Please, you gotta help me.
Be a pal.
Call that beetle.
Call anybody.
Mama ?
Mama !
Hee-haw, hee-haw, hee-haw, hee-haw !
Oh !
What's happened ?
I hope I'm not too late.
What'll I do ?
Pinocchio !
Jiminy !
Oh, Jiminy, help !
Pinoke, the kids, the boys, they're all donkeys !
Oh !
You too.
Come on, quick !
Before you get any worse.
This way, Pinoke.
It's the only way out.
Hurry up...
before they see us.
You gotta jump !
Jiminy ?
Jiminy ?
You all right ?
Sure !
[ Cough ]
I thought we'd never make it.
Certainly feels good to be back on dry land.
Come on, let's get home.
- Father, I'm home !
- We're home, Mr. Geppetto.
- It's me, Pinocchio !
I'm home to stay.
- [ Bell Ringing ]
Here he is, Mr. Geppetto.
Home at last.
Hey, maybe he's asleep.
Father ?
Father, it's me.
Pinoke, come here.
Look.
He ain't here.
He-
- He's gone.
Yeah, and Figaro.
And Cleo too.
Maybe something awful happened to him.
Don't worry, son, he probably hasn't gone far.
Hey !
It's a message.
- What's it say ?
- It's about your father.
- Where is he ?
- Why, uh, uh.
It says here... he went looking for you and was swallowed by a whale.
- Swallowed by a whale ?
- Yeah, uh-huh.
A whale ?
A whale named Monstro.
- But wait, he's alive.
- Alive ?
Where ?
Inside the whale at the bottom of the sea.
- Bottom of the sea ?
- Uh-huh.
- Hey, where you going ?
- I'm going to find him.
Pinoke, are you crazy ?
- Don't you realize he's in a whale ?
- I've gotta go to him.
Hey, Pinoke, wait !
Listen here, son--
This Monstro, I've heard of him.
He's a whale of a whale !
He swallows whole ships alive !
Tie it good and tight now.
And besides, it's dangerous.
- Bye, Jiminy.
- Good-bye ?
I may be live bait down there, but I'm with ya.
Come on...
let's go.
[ Jiminy ] Look out below !
[ Gurgling Voice ] Gangway, down there.
Gee !
What a big place.
Come on, Jiminy.
All right.
Soon as I take on some ballast.
One side, sister.
Well... so long.
Hmm.
Put it in the wrong end.
Hmm !
No more privacy than a goldfish.
Ooo !
Chilly.
Father ?
Father ?
Hey, Pinoke, wait for me !
Father ?
Father !
Huh !
He ain't my father.
Uh, Mr. Geppetto !
Hey !
What the--
Hey, let go !
Run along, you little... squirt.
What's the matter ?
Can't a fellow-
- I was only--
We were only looking for...
Monstro.
That got 'em.
Father ?
Father ?
Oh !
Hello.
Oh !
Can you tell me where we can find Monstro, the whale ?
Gee !
They're scared.
Uh, pardon me, pearl, are you acquainted with Monstro, the whale ?
Whoa, hold it there.
Hmph !
Father ?
One side there, son.
Come on, boys, break it up.
Break it up now.
[ Whinnying ]
[ Jiminy ] Hey !
What the--
Whoa, quit shoving'.
Don't crowd.
Take it easy there.
- Whoa there.
- [ Whinnies ]
Steady there, Nellie.
Go ahead, Pinoke, ask them.
Could any of you tell me where to find Monstro ?
Whoa !
Whoa, boy.
Uh, sakes alive.
Father ?
- Father ?
- Mr. Geppetto ?
Not a bite for days.
[ Geppetto ] We can't hold out much longer.
Ah...
Ah...
Ah-choo !
Ah-choo !
I never thought... it would end this way, Figaro.
Starving to death... in the belly of a whale.
My poor little Pinocchio.
He was such a good boy.
It's hopeless, Figaro.
There isn't a fish left.
If the monster doesn't wake up soon,
I'm afraid we...
we are done for.
Here they come !
Tuna !
Oh, tuna fish !
Food !
We'll eat !
Here's a big one.
Keep them in there, Figaro.
Wait !
Wait a minute !
Have you seen--
Monstro !
Ohh !
We gotta get outta here.
Woo-hoo-hoo !
Come on, Pinoke.
Don't wait for me !
Never saw so many !
Whoops !
Ha-ha-ha-ha !
Here's another one.
Enough for weeks !
Here's a big one.
Keep them in there, Figaro !
Hey, blubber mouth, open up.
I gotta get in there.
Looks like the last of them.
Here's a big one.
Only a few left.
We gotta work fast.
- Hey !
- Here's another one.
Hey, Father !
- Father !
- Don't bother me now, Pinocchio.
P-
- Pinocchio ?
- Father !
- Pinocchio, my son !
- Hey, Father, here I am.
- Huh ?
Oh, oh, yes !
Pinocchio, my boy !
I'm so happy to see you.
Me too, Father.
- Whoops.
- Figaro !
Ah, Figaro.
Cleo !
Oh, Cleo !
- You're here too.
- Yes !
- We're all together again.
- Ah-choo.
- Oh, you are soaking wet.
- Yes, Father.
- You mustn't catch cold.
- But I came to save you.
You know, you shouldn't have come down here.
- But, Father.
- But I'm awfully glad to see you.
Let me take your hat off.
Oh !
Pinocchio !
Wha-
- What's the matter ?
Those ears !
Huh ?
Ears ?
Oh, these !
[ Chuckle ] Oh, that's nothing.
I got a tail too !
Hee-haw !
Pinocchio !
What's happened to you ?
Well, I--
- I, I--
- Oh, never mind now.
Old Geppetto has his little woodenhead.
Nothing else matters !
[ Jiminy ] I gotta get in !
My pal's in there.
Come on, ya big moose !
Open up, I tell ya !
- Hey !
Cut it out.
- [ Squawking ]
Hey, beat it, you buzzards !
Get out ?
Oh, no, no, son.
I have tried every way.
Why, I even built a raft.
A raft ?
That's it !
We'll take the raft and when the whale opens his mouth--
No, no, no, no.
Now, listen, son.
He only opens his mouth when he's eating.
Then everything comes in, nothing goes out.
- Oh.
- It's hopeless, Pinocchio.
Come, we make a nice fire and we cook some of the fish.
A fire !
That's it !
- Yes !
And then we'll all eat again.
- A great big fire !
- Lots of smoke.
- Smoke ?
Oh, yes, sure.
- Smoked fish will taste good.
- Quick, some wood.
Pinocchio, not the chair.
- Hurry, Father, more wood !
- What'll we sit on ?
We won't need it.
We're getting out !
Getting out ?
But how ?
- We'll make him sneeze !

Fan Ke...
What do you want?
I'm looking for Engineer Mr. Fan, it's urgent
He can't hear you, you'll have to go up
Fine
Fan Ke
Go back down, it's dangerous
The master has asked for you
I cannot come now
He says you'll have to, no matter what
It's urgent
Please cover for me, I'll be right back
Sure
What's going on?
I've just had my training today
I don't think it'd be about that
Someone from Thailand is visiting Master
He asked for you after talking to the man
Here you are
Everyone
Chen, what do you think?
Dad
You called me back for a demonstration?
I
Come here, and greet Uncle Chen
Uncle Chen, hello
I've known Uncle Chen for 20 years, since when,
I went to Thailand for boxing matches
I'll go to Thailand with him day after tomorrow
Got some business to take care of
Please take some days off at work
You'll have to be in charge here
I can't do that, dad
I'm an engineer
There're plenty of engineers in this world
But only a few have martial arts training like you
Just let the other engineers back you up
In that case...
You've a heart condition, you shouldn't travel
Don't worry about me
Come, let's catch up
Sure
Stop it, I've work to do
Sir
I know presently it's not right to take time off
But my father is very stubborn
And he's got a heart condition
He insists on it.
I tried speaking to him last night
You should know that...
When the project reaches its crucial stage,
You'll have to be here
I understand
Excuse me
Mr. Fan, you've a call
Yes
What now?
I'm at work
What?
I mean, he was alright this morning!
Fine, I'll be right over
My father's had a heart attack
He's in the hospital now
I've got to rush there
Mai, please cover for me
The foremen know about the project
Fan Ke
Where's my father?
You are the patient's son?
Yes
Miss, can we go inside?
I'm afraid not
Dad
Doctor, how is he?
Let him speak, don't disobey
He...
There's a picture in the drawer
This one?
I've seen it
However you might not know him
He's your elder brother
My brother?
Please don't let the patient get emotional
Twenty three years ago
When I used to promote martial arts
I lived in Thailand for about six months
And I became involved with a Thai girl
Then I came home
Your mother was still alive
I didn't bring the Thai girl along with me
Some time later she gave birth to him
after the child was born...
Uncle Chen has been looking out for her
But later she refused his help
And Chen lost contact with her
Once she brought the child's picture... and found Uncle Chen
She requested him to pass it to me
We've never heard from her since then
Uncle Chen doesn't even know his name
Recently...
He's just heard that...
This kid is now a professional boxer
I was planning to look him up in Thailand
Don't worry, dad.
I'll locate him
I know you will.
There're many boxers in Thailand
Look at this photograph
There's a tattoo on his left arm
Son, you must find him... you must!
I will, father
Don't worry, I will go right away
I will find my brother
Papal
Mr. Fan, the patient...
One, Two, Three, Four, Five
Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, T en
Wenlie will definitely win
Look at him!
Of course he will
That's right
Mr. Xu
Another win
From fighting in the back alleys
T o now in the ring
You've built up your reputation
And the bets on you are getting bigger
I'm a boxer, not a gambler
Here, this is your share
I've never been so rich
Not before, now you've money
Similar to your career path
You've become an acclaimed boxer
From fighting in the back alleys
This is your pay.
I'll be your manager hereafter
I have someone doing that already
Is that so?
Look at him now
Do you think he can continue?
Stop it
You think it over
We're very flexible about the pay
I'll give you a day to think about it
And don't forget the match a few days later
The one with Cannon
Yes
Come in
Mr. Qiangren, Wenlie won't listen
In his next match...
Get Cannon to punch him to death
Y es, about Miller, he's also...
Take care of Miller first
Wenlie
Yulan, why didn't you ask me... whether I won or lost today?
It doesn't matter
T o me, you are always the champion
But I have to especially win... the match with Cannon on the day after
You are going up against Cannon?
Wenlie, listen to me, cancel the match
Why?
Cannon is the Thai boxing champion
Couple of boxers have been beaten... to death by him in the ring earlier
Don't worry, I know about Cannon's skills... more than you do
Do you mean that you WILL win?
You tell me
I must win, I've got to!
Bets have already been placed
The odds are fifteen to one
Most'll bet on me losing, but I've to win
Wenlie, you always emphasize that...
You're a boxer, not a gambler
I've no choice.
The other day I took Mom for check-up
She has to be operated on soon
I'll need to come up with the money
Yulan, I have no other way... except winning this match with Cannon
You just got here, rest a while
No, I have to go right now
You've given me addresses of a few boxing clubs
What am I waiting for?
Alright, I'll go with you
I can manage on my own
There're lots of Chinese in Bangkok
I can ask my way around
Just lend me your car
Be careful, and don't get in any fights
Uncle Chen, I'm an engineer not a boxer
Today is the Songkran festival
Try not to get splashed at
Mister, you don't seem to be from around here?
I'm from Hong Kong
Chinese love to watch Thai Boxing
Look, the boxers are all so smart
My picture used to be on the wall once
It was there for everyone to admire
Sir, so you are a boxer!
Yes, I was
But since after my last fight...
I stayed in the hospital for three months
And then I've turned into an alcoholic
Please buy me a drink, Mister
Don't drink too much, it's not good for you
Young man, what you're saying... is too late to an old drunk like me
Sir, just a moment please
What's this boxer's name?
He...
He's called a dead man
A dead man?
Yes, he will be one;, after today
Why's that?
Have a look at the program
He's fighting with Cannon this afternoon
Cannon?
The Thai Boxing Champion
We haven't had one quite ruthless in years
He's already beaten two to death in the ring
He can't kill everyone though!
Well, true...
But this afternoon...
The odds that Miller gets beaten to death... are eight to one
Many are betting on Miller's survival
But I know
I know how it works
Miller will die 8 to 1;
Qiangren can earn a lot this time
His name's Miller?
What do you want?
I'm looking for Miller
Go away
I'm looking for Miller
Miller...
Why're you looking for him?
It's something urgent
Please lead me to him
The match is about to begin
You'll see him on the ring
No, the word is he'll get killed today
Hence I must meet him now
Who told you so?
I need to see him
Guys
Stop it
Wenlie, this is none of your business
You're beating people up for no reason
Let's go
Did they hurt you?
Oh no
You are...
A boxer.
I'd suggest you please leave
You're lucky that I'm around
You might not be so lucky next time
Who are they?
Never mind
Doesn't look like you're in this business
Leave it
Go!
Miller...
Beat him
Let Miller fight on
I can't be your accessory in murder
If he's not dead, you will be!
This one's the best, yes
Beat him
Brother...
No, brother...
Stop it, brother
He can't fight anymore
One, Two, Three, Four
Stop the fight
Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine
What's going on?
Brother
Miller's dead
Cannon has killed him
No!
Stop
Brother...
The dead boxer was his brother
Are you a new boxer?
No
Then what were you doing in the ring?
If I didn't stop him...
Miller's brother would've been crushed
You're pretty good;
but that isn't Thai boxing
Chinese Boxing
Chinese?
My name is Fan Ke
I'm looking for a boxer.
On his left arm is...
Wenlie, Mr. Qiangren wants to see you
I don't wish to meet him
When he asks for you... you show up.
That's the rule
I'll be an exception then
Wenlie, if you don't want to see that guy...
Are you assisting me?
You're from abroad, is it?
Just arrived yesterday
Bangkok is a scenic city
Just do your sightseeing, don't get into trouble
I really wish to meet that guy
You...
Hey, watch it!
Sorry, miss
I was chasing that car
Is it urgent?
Fine, I'll take you
Can I drive?
Alright
Where's that car?
It's gone!
Are you Chinese?
No, but I can speak the language
Quite fluent at it too
You're from abroad?
Just arrived yesterday
You're just in time for Songkran
Oh yes, now that I remember...
You were at the festival yesterday
Would you like me to show you around?
I'd sure like that
Miller's dead, you know?
I know
Go and find Xu Qiu to sign a contract
I'll arrange for you to win over Cannon
I could have done it anyway
You would've been killed, like Miller
I'll let it spread to punters once you step out
Tell them to bet that you'll die
Throw him out
Who are you?
This is my car
Kid, Mr. Xu is over there, he wants to see you
Didn't you hear her?
This is her car
Drive away now
Who were they?
What're they after?
I'm not sure
I had to fight when they're picking on me
Go now
I'm not going
This isn't a show
I do realise
But I can't leave a friend behind
A friend?
Aren't we friends?
Excuse my intrusion
My name is Xu, and your name is?
I have no intention of knowing you
Why should I introduce myself?
Back at the stadium, you dared to fight him
You've got guts!
You wanted to see Miller before it began
What for?
I thought he's the person I was looking for
And wasn't he?
I must've got the wrong guy
If it's some boxer you're looking for...
I might be able to help
I know all the boxers in Bangkok
What's his name?
I don't know his name
I only know of a tattoo on his left arm
It's the tattoo of an anchor and a sparrow
Would you happen to know him?
There're plenty of boxers with tattoos
Why particularly him?
He's my elder brother
If you know who he is, tell me
I don't
Tell me
Cannon
Don't come any closer
I know you guys are up to no good
But I don't think you'd dare to kill out of the ring
Only in the ring... where you set those murders up
I'll show you some colors
What colors?
Red or white?
He definitely must know my brother!
You sure are good!
I don't do this for a living
I'm a civil engineer
It's quite late.
Let me take you back
I'll show you around tomorrow
Great
See you at the same place
Wenlie
You're wounded, Wenlie!
You were not in a match today
Why are you hurt?
No problem.
It's only a nose bleed
I bumped into some hooligans
And a fight ensued
Wash that blood off your face
Gently... and don't wake mom up
Wenlie, people are saying that...
Cannon has killed yet another one
I'd suggest not to fight with Cannon
Walk out of it now
It's not a big deal
I can't
As for your mom's operation fees...
We'll figure something out
We have no other way, it's a lot of money
Except...
except that I give in to Qiangren
I'd rather die than accept defeat
I'm really worried about you
Don't worry, I'll be fine
If only I beat Cannon...
Then I won't be competing anymore
Really?
But you...
You're here again, mister!
Miller died yesterday
Today Qiangren's staff are taking death bets
I think, Wenlie...
Sir, would you know...
Which boxer has a tattoo... of an anchor and a sparrow on his left arm?
Miller had one
But his was an eagle and the globe
Then I have no idea
What's up?
I still have no idea where to find my brother!
Meidai, I want to watch this match
Thai boxing, it's so violent
I've met this boxer before
And I like him
Fine, I'll come with you then
Why is she crying?
Hey, you can't help anyway
She hopes that the authorities would cancel the match
She says Wenlie is no match for Cannon
She's probably Wenlie's lover
What?
I need to speak to that girl
Think about it, killing is illegal
But Cannon killed my brother
Yes, I'm sorry about it too
But don't do anything you'll regret
And I won't assist you in murder
I must kill him, I must
Misai
Misai
Yulan, you've been crying?
Oh no!
What're the swellings on your face?
There you go again
This is common for a boxer
Mom's admitted to hospital this morning
After this match...
She can have the operation tonight
You'll get fined for plucking flowers
When the flower's in your hair...
The police will only praise when they see you
You're quite a charmer
Thank you
For what?
For not running me down yesterday
We had hardly met and yet you let me drive
I could've been a bad guy, you know
I knew you were not
Sixth sense, is it?
What's the hurry?
We still have some time before the match
There isn't much time left, I'd like...
Fine, boxing match is next
Great
Draw it
Draw it
Sure...
It's only normal... for one to run when frightened
Wenlie, you still have time to change your mind
Forget about Miller, he was a fool
It's your call if you want to be likewise
Didn't know you had a younger brother!
I don't have one
No?
He came looking for you
He said that there's a tattoo of an anchor... and a sparrow on his brother's left arm
That's you, Wenlie
Where's he?
Who knows?
But after tonight...
He'll die sooner or later on the streets!
Mom did mention that she's... asked someone to take a picture of me to dad
My own younger brother!
Meidai, look
Wenlie's about to come on stage
She should go inside
Why is she staring at his picture?
Perhaps I know the reason
I think no one suffers like her
Miss, are you Wenlie's friend?
What's so exciting about a boxing match?
Why are all these people here?
If it's a fair competition
It's a good sport
Fair?
It's not a fair world
Hope Wenlie wins
He can't lose
Cannon, get ready
Yes
Hurry
Wenlie, it's almost time
One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six
Seven, Eight, Nine, T en
Wenlie
Fan Ke, he's your brother
He's my brother?
I've got to stop this game
Fan Ke
Wenlie, stop
Wenlie, you're my brother
Stay in your seat
You can't die
They're going to kill him!
Fan Ke
Manager, Wenlie is his brother
Please stop this match
I can't, and if you don't return to your seat... we'll have you thrown out
Fan Ke, come on
Let's return to our seats
We'll wait until this match is over
You don't know
Wenlie won't give in to the bad guys
Cannon will kill him
Wenlie, stop, get down
Stop, Wenlie
Fine, stop it, I'll return to my seat
Please don't kick him out
One, Two, Three
He can't fight anymore
We're really gonna kick you out next time
Five, Six, Seven, Eight
One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six
Wenlie
Wenlie, go
Beat him
One, Two, Three, Four, Five
Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, T en
Wenlie...
Wenlie...
Wenlie, you're my brother!
You?
My name is Fan Ke, I'm your brother
My brother
I've got to tell Yulan about my victory
She must be worried sick
Yulan?
She has been waiting outside
Wenlie has won
Yulan
Wenlie!
We'll go to the hospital, and...
This is my brother
Your brother?
Let's go, I'll tell you all about it
Wenlie
Leave me alone
I've only lost one match
It's no big deal, beat it
Cannon, I'm Misai, Miller's brother
I came here for revenge
Cannon
He's dead!
Wenlie's killed Cannon
Get someone to go to Wenlie's place
And kill him
Wenlie...
No one's around
You take him back
He will return sooner or later
The rest of you wait here
Yes
Go
Trash the place, destroy it
How did it go?
The operation went smoothly
It's a success
My mom's a beauty
But she has aged through the hard years
She's tough and hasn't sought financial help
I know, you're so much like her
Wenlie, you should rest
We will stay here
You leave first, and come back in the afternoon
I'll show you some pictures of mom... and dad when they were young
Sure
This time around...
You won't leave with them
You'll allow me to help, right?
Sure
Wenlie, you killed Cannon
And Qiangren lost money because of you
Only if you promise to fill in Cannon's place
If not... it's up to you!
Cannon's dead?
What a bluff!
Come with me to see Qiangren
Nope
Guys
I'll take care of them
You go after Xu
You still dare hit me?
Hurry...
Hey, don't you think mom's pretty?
You trashed my place
What do you have to say?
I'll pay for the damages, please let me go
I'll get Misai to bring you the money
Misai
When we came here...
Misai was here, and we've taken him... to Mr. Qiangren
Come, we've got to save Misai
Call the police.
Wenlie's gone over to Qiangren's
Qiangren will kill him
I'll inform the police
Misai asked me to kill Cannon with him
Now that Cannon's dead...
He must've killed Cannon in waiting room
I've got to ask him
Where does Qiangren live?
Not far from here
I was the one who killed Cannon
He was your money plant
Let's go...
Misai
Be careful, bro.
That's Qiangren
I've fought Cannon, I'm not afraid
He's much stronger than Cannon
Did you kill Misai?
And now it's your turn!
This is your doom day
He's a murderer.
He killed Misai
Arrest him
Tell mom I'm going to Hong Kong for a while
When she recovers, I'll come to fetch her
And I'll take you along as well
Meidai, I hope you'll visit Hong Kong
And how do you propose to welcome me?
Gonna run you down with a sports car!
Let's go.
Fan Ke...
What do you want?
I'm looking for Engineer Mr. Fan, it's urgent
He can't hear you, you'll have to go up
Fine
Fan Ke

What's this boxer's name?
He...
He's called a dead man
A dead man?
Yes, he will be one;, after today
Why's that?
Have a look at the program
He's fighting with Cannon this afternoon
Cannon?
The Thai Boxing Champion
We haven't had one quite ruthless in years
He's already beaten two to death in the ring
He can't kill everyone though!
Well, true...
But this afternoon...
The odds that Miller gets beaten to death... are eight to one
Many are betting on Miller's survival
But I know
I know how it works
Miller will die 8 to 1;
Qiangren can earn a lot this time
His name's Miller?
What do you want?
I'm looking for Miller
Go away
I'm looking for Miller
Miller...
Why're you looking for him?
It's something urgent
Please lead me to him
The match is about to begin
You'll see him on the ring
No, the word is he'll get killed today
Hence I must meet him now
Who told you so?
I need to see him
Guys
Stop it
Wenlie, this is none of your business
You're beating people up for no reason
Let's go
Did they hurt you?
Oh no
You are...
A boxer.
I'd suggest you please leave
You're lucky that I'm around
You might not be so lucky next time
Who are they?
Never mind
Doesn't look like you're in this business
Leave it
Go!
Miller...
Beat him
Let Miller fight on
I can't be your accessory in murder
If he's not dead, you will be!
This one's the best, yes
Beat him
Brother...
No, brother...
Stop it, brother
He can't fight anymore
One, Two, Three, Four
Stop the fight
Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine
What's going on?
Brother
Miller's dead
Cannon has killed him
No!
Stop
Brother...
The dead boxer was his brother
Are you a new boxer?
No
Then what were you doing in the ring?
If I didn't stop him...
Miller's brother would've been crushed
You're pretty good;
but that isn't Thai boxing
Chinese Boxing
Chinese?
My name is Fan Ke
I'm looking for a boxer.
On his left arm is...
Wenlie, Mr. Qiangren wants to see you
I don't wish to meet him
When he asks for you... you show up.
That's the rule
I'll be an exception then
Wenlie, if you don't want to see that guy...
Are you assisting me?
You're from abroad, is it?
Just arrived yesterday
Bangkok is a scenic city
Just do your sightseeing, don't get into trouble
I really wish to meet that guy
You...
Hey, watch it!
Sorry, miss
I was chasing that car
Is it urgent?
Fine, I'll take you
Can I drive?
Alright
Where's that car?
It's gone!
Are you Chinese?
No, but I can speak the language
Quite fluent at it too
You're from abroad?
Just arrived yesterday
You're just in time for Songkran
Oh yes, now that I remember...
You were at the festival yesterday
Would you like me to show you around?
I'd sure like that
Miller's dead, you know?
I know
Go and find Xu Qiu to sign a contract
I'll arrange for you to win over Cannon
I could have done it anyway
You would've been killed, like Miller
I'll let it spread to punters once you step out
Tell them to bet that you'll die
Throw him out
Who are you?
This is my car
This is her car
Drive away now
Who were they?
What're they after?
I'm not sure
I had to fight when they're picking on me
Go now
I'm not going
This isn't a show
I do realize
But I can't leave a friend behind
A friend?
Aren't we friends?
Excuse my intrusion
My name is Xu, and your name is?
I have no intention of knowing you
Why should I introduce myself?
Back at the stadium, you dared to fight him
You've got guts!
You wanted to see Miller before it began
What for?
I thought he's the person I was looking for
And wasn't he?
I must've got the wrong guy
If it's some boxer you're looking for...
I might be able to help
I know all the boxers in Bangkok
What's his name?
I don't know his name
I only know of a tattoo on his left arm
It's the tattoo of an anchor and a sparrow
Would you happen to know him?
There're plenty of boxers with tattoos
Why particularly him?
He's my elder brother
If you know who he is, tell me
I don't
Tell me
Cannon
Don't come any closer
I know you guys are up to no good
But I don't think you'd dare to kill out of the ring
Only in the ring... where you set those murders up
I'll show you some colors
What colors?
Red or white?
He definitely must know my brother!
You sure are good!
I don't do this for a living
I'm a civil engineer
It's quite late.
Let me take you back
I'll show you around tomorrow
Great
See you at the same place
Wenlie
You're wounded, Wenlie!
You were not in a match today
Why are you hurt?
No problem.
It's only a nose bleed
I bumped into some hooligans
And a fight ensued
Wash that blood off your face
Gently... and don't wake mom up
Wenlie, people are saying that...
Cannon has killed yet another one
I'd suggest not to fight with Cannon
Walk out of it now
It's not a big deal
I can't
As for your mom's operation fees...
We'll figure something out
We have no other way, it's a lot of money
Except...
except that I give in to Qiangren
I'd rather die than accept defeat
I'm really worried about you
Don't worry, I'll be fine
If only I beat Cannon...
Then I won't be competing anymore
Really?
But you...
You're here again, mister!
Miller died yesterday
Today Qiangren's staff are taking death bets
I think, Wenlie...
Sir, would you know...
Which boxer has a tattoo... of an anchor and a sparrow on his left arm?
Miller had one
But his was an eagle and the globe
Then I have no idea
What's up?
I still have no idea where to find my brother!
Meidai, I want to watch this match
Thai boxing, it's so violent
I've met this boxer before
And I like him
Fine, I'll come with you then
Why is she crying?
Hey, you can't help anyway
She hopes that the authorities would cancel the match
She says Wenlie is no match for Cannon
She's probably Wenlie's lover
What?
I need to speak to that girl
Think about it, killing is illegal
But Cannon killed my brother
Yes, I'm sorry about it too
But don't do anything you'll regret
And I won't assist you in murder
I must kill him, I must
Misai
Misai
Yulan, you've been crying?
Oh no!
What're the swellings on your face?
There you go again
This is common for a boxer
Mom's admitted to hospital this morning
After this match...
She can have the operation tonight
You'll get fined for plucking flowers
When the flower's in your hair...
The police will only praise when they see you
You're quite a charmer
Thank you
For what?
For not running me down yesterday
We had hardly met and yet you let me drive
I could've been a bad guy, you know
I knew you were not
Sixth sense, is it?
What's the hurry?
We still have some time before the match
There isn't much time left, I'd like...
Fine, boxing match is next
Great
Draw it
Draw it
Sure...
It's only normal... for one to run when frightened
Wenlie, you still have time to change your mind
Forget about Miller, he was a fool
It's your call if you want to be likewise
Didn't know you had a younger brother!
I don't have one
No?
He came looking for you
He said that there's a tattoo of an anchor... and a sparrow on his brother's left arm
That's you, Wenlie
Where's he?
Who knows?
But after tonight...
He'll die sooner or later on the streets!
Mom did mention that she's... asked someone to take a picture of me to dad
My own younger brother!
Meidai, look
Wenlie's about to come on stage
She should go inside
Why is she staring at his picture?
Perhaps I know the reason
I think no one suffers like her
Miss, are you Wenlie's friend?
What's so exciting about a boxing match?
Why are all these people here?
If it's a fair competition
It's a good sport
Fair?
It's not a fair world
Hope Wenlie wins
He can't lose
Cannon, get ready
Yes
Hurry
Wenlie, it's almost time
One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six
Seven, Eight, Nine, T en
Wenlie
Fan Ke, he's your brother
He's my brother?
I've got to stop this game
Fan Ke
Wenlie, stop
Wenlie, you're my brother
Stay in your seat
You can't die
They're going to kill him!
Fan Ke
Manager, Wenlie is his brother
Please stop this match
I can't, and if you don't return to your seat... we'll have you thrown out
Fan Ke, come on
Let's return to our seats
We'll wait until this match is over
You don't know
Wenlie won't give in to the bad guys
Cannon will kill him
Wenlie, stop, get down
Stop, Wenlie
Fine, stop it, I'll return to my seat
Please don't kick him out
One, Two, Three
He can't fight anymore
We're really gonna kick you out next time
Five, Six, Seven, Eight
One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six
Wenlie
Wenlie, go
Beat him
One, Two, Three, Four, Five
Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, T en
Wenlie...
Wenlie...
Wenlie, you're my brother!
You?
My name is Fan Ke, I'm your brother
My brother
I've got to tell Yulan about my victory
She must be worried sick
Yulan?
She has been waiting outside
Wenlie has won
Yulan
Wenlie!
We'll go to the hospital, and...
This is my brother
Your brother?
Let's go, I'll tell you all about it
Wenlie
Leave me alone
I've only lost one match
It's no big deal, beat it
Cannon, I'm Misai, Miller's brother
I came here for revenge
Cannon
He's dead!
Wenlie's killed Cannon
Get someone to go to Wenlie's place
And kill him
Wenlie...
No one's around
You take him back
He will return sooner or later
The rest of you wait here
Yes
Go
Trash the place, destroy it
How did it go?
The operation went smoothly
It's a success
My mom's a beauty
But she has aged through the hard years
She's tough and hasn't sought financial help
I know, you're so much like her
Wenlie, you should rest
We will stay here
You leave first, and come back in the afternoon
I'll show you some pictures of mom... and dad when they were young
Sure
This time around...
You won't leave with them
You'll allow me to help, right?
Sure
Wenlie, you killed Cannon
And Qiangren lost money because of you
Only if you promise to fill in Cannon's place
If not... it's up to you!
Cannon's dead?
What a bluff!
Come with me to see Qiangren
Nope
Guys
I'll take care of them
You go after Xu
You still dare hit me?
Hurry...
Hey, don't you think mom's pretty?
You trashed my place
What do you have to say?
I'll pay for the damages, please let me go
I'll get Misai to bring you the money
Misai
When we came here...
Misai was here, and we've taken him... to Mr. Qiangren
Come, we've got to save Misai
Call the police.
Wenlie's gone over to Qiangren's
Qiangren will kill him
I'll inform the police
Misai asked me to kill Cannon with him
Now that Cannon's dead...
He must've killed Cannon in waiting room
I've got to ask him
Where does Qiangren live?
Not far from here
I was the one who killed Cannon
He was your money plant
Let's go...
Misai
Be careful, bro.
That's Qiangren
I've fought Cannon, I'm not afraid
He's much stronger than Cannon
Did you kill Misai?
And now it's your turn!
This is your doom day
He's a murderer.
He killed Misai
Arrest him
Tell mom I'm going to Hong Kong for a while
When she recovers, I'll come to fetch her
And I'll take you along as well
Meidai, I hope you'll visit Hong Kong
And how do you propose to welcome me?
Gonna run you down with a sports car!
Let's go.
Fan Ke...
What do you want?
I'm looking for Engineer Mr. Fan, it's urgent
He can't hear you, you'll have to go up
Fine
Fan Ke
Go back down, it's dangerous
The master has asked for you I cannot come now
He says you'll have to, no matter what lt's urgent
Please cover for me, I'll be right back
Sure
What's going on?
I've just had my training today I don't think it'd be about that
Someone from Thailand is visiting Master
He asked for you after talking to the man
Here you are
Everyone
Chen, what do you think?
Dad
You called me back for a demonstration?
!
Come here, and greet Uncle Chen
Uncle Chen, hello l've known Uncle Chen for 20 years, since when, I went to Thailand for boxing matches I'll go to Thailand with him day after tomorrow
Got some business to take care of
Please take some days off at work
You'll have to be in charge here I can't do that, dad I'm an engineer
There're plenty of engineers in this world
But only a few have martial arts training like you
Just let the other engineers back you up ln that case...
You've a heart condition, you shouldn't travel
Don't worry about me
Come, let's catch up
Sure
Stop it, I've work to do
Sir I know presently it's not right to take time off
But my father is very stubborn
And he's got a heart condition
He insists on it.
I tried speaking to him last night
You should know that...
When the project reaches its crucial stage,
You'll have to be here I understand
Excuse me
Mr. Fan, you've a call
Yes
What now?
I'm at work
What?
I mean, he was alright this morning!
Fine, I'll be right over
My father's had a heart attack
He's in the hospital now I've got to rush there
Mai, please cover for me
The foremen know about the project
Fan Ke
Where's my father?
You are the patient's son?
Yes
Miss, can we go inside?
I'm afraid not
Dad
Doctor, how is he?
Let him speak, don't disobey
He...
There's a picture in the drawer
This one?
I've seen it
However you might not know him
He's your elder brother
My brother?
Please don't let the patient get emotional
Twenty three years ago
When I used to promote martial arts I lived in Thailand for about six months
And I became involved with a Thai girl
Then I came home
Your mother was still alive I didn't bring the Thai girl along with me
Sometime later she gave birth to him
After the child was born...
Uncle Chen has been looking out for her
But later she refused his help
And Chen lost contact with her
Once she brought the child's picture... and found Uncle Chen
She requested him to pass it to me
We've never heard from her since then
Uncle Chen doesn't even know his name
Recently...
He's just heard that...
This kid is now a professional boxer I was planning to look him up in Thailand
Don't worry, dad. I'll locate him I know you will.
There're many boxers in Thailand
Look at this photograph
There's a tattoo on his left arm
Son, you must find him... you must!
I will, father
Don't worry, I will go right away I will find my brother
Papa!
Mr. Fan, the patient...
One, Two, Three, Four, Five
Six, Seven, Eight , Nine, Ten
Wenlie will definitely win
Look at him!
Of course he will
That's right
Mr. Xu
Another win
From fighting in the back alleys
To now in the ring
You've built up your reputation
And the bets on you are getting bigger I'm a boxer, not a gambler
Here, this is your share I've never been so rich
Not before, now you've money
Similar to your career path
You've become an acclaimed boxer
From fighting in the back alleys
This is your pay.
I'll be your manager hereafter I have someone doing that already ls that so?
Look at him now
Do you think he can continue?
Stop it
You think it over
We're very flexible about the pay
I'll give you a day to think about it
And don't forget the match a few days later
The one with Cannon
Yes
Come in
Mr. Qiangren, Wenlie won't listen ln his next match...
Get Cannon to punch him to death
Yes, about Miller, he's also...
Take care of Miller first
Wenlie
Yulan, why didn't you ask me... whether I won or lost today?
It doesn't matter
To me, you are always the champion
But I have to especially win... the match with Cannon on the day after
You are going up against Cannon?
Wenlie, listen to me, cancel the match
Why?
Cannon is the Thai boxing champion
Couple of boxers have been beaten... to death by him in the ring earlier
Don't worry, I know about Cannon's skills... more than you do
Do you mean that you will win?
You tell me I must win, I've got to!
Bets have already been placed
The odds are fifteen to one
Most'll bet on me losing, but I've to win
Wenlie, you always emphasize that...
You're a boxer, not a gambler I've no choice.
The other day I took Mom for check-up
She has to be operated on soon I'll need to come up with the money
Yulan, I have no other way... except winning this match with Cannon
You just got here, rest a while
No, I have to go right now
You've given me addresses of a few boxing clubs
What am I waiting for?
Alright, I'll go with you I can manage on my own
There're lots of Chinese in Bangkok I can ask my way around
Just lend me your car
Be careful, and don't get in any fights
Uncle Chen, I'm an engineer not a boxer
Today is the Songkran festival
Try not to get splashed at
Mister, you don't seem to be from around here?
I'm from Hong Kong
Chinese love to watch Thai Boxing
Look, the boxers are all so smart
My picture used to be on the wall once lt was there for everyone to admire
Sir, so you are a boxer!
Yes, I was
But since after my last fight... I stayed in the hospital for three months
And then I've turned into an alcoholic
Please buy me a drink, Mister
Don't drink too much, it's not good for you
Young man, what you're saying... is too late to an old drunk like me
Sir, just a moment please
What's this boxer's name?
He...
He's called a dead man
A dead man?
Yes, he will be one; after today
Why's that?
Have a look at the program
He's fighting with Cannon this afternoon
Cannon?
The Thai Boxing Champion
We haven't had one quite ruthless in years
He's already beaten two to death in the ring
He can't kill everyone though!
Well, true...
But this afternoon...
The odds that Miller gets beaten to death... are eight to one
Many are betting on Miller's survival
But I know I know how it works
Miller will die 8 to 1 ;
Qiangren can earn a lot this time
His name's Miller?
What do you want?
I'm looking for Miller
Go away I'm looking for Miller
Miller...
Why're you looking for him?
It's something urgent

Come, we've got to save Misai
Call the police.
Wenlie's gone over to Qiangren's
Qiangren will kill him I'll inform the police
Misai asked me to kill Cannon with him
Now that Cannon's dead...
He must've killed Cannon in waiting room I've got to ask him
Where does Qiangren live?
Not far from here
I was the one who killed Cannon
He was your money plant
Let's go...
Misai
Be careful, bro.
That's Qiangren I've fought Cannon, I'm not afraid
He's much stronger than Cannon
Did you kill Misai?
And now it's your turn!
This is your doom day
He's a murderer.
He killed Misai
Arrest him
Tell mom I'm going to Hong Kong for a while

And thenl've turned into an alcoholic
Please buy me a drink, Mister

A dead man?
Yes, he will be one;, after today
Why's that?
Have alook at the program
He's fighting with Cannon this afternoon
Cannon?
The Thai Boxing Champion
We haven't had one quite ruthless in years
He's already beaten two to death in the ring
He can't kill everyone thoughl
Well, true...
But this afternoon...
The odds that Miller gets beaten to death... are eight to one
Many are betting on Miller's survival
Butl know I know how it works
Miller will die 8 to 1 ;
Qiangren can earn alot this time
His name's Miller?
What do you want?
I'mlooking for Miller
Go away I'mlooking for Miller
Miller...
Why're youlooking for him?
It's something urgent
Pleaselead me to him

No, the word is he'll get killed today
Hencel must meet him now
Who told you so?
I need to see him
Guys

Cannon has killed him
Nol
Stop
Brother...
The dead boxer was his brother
Are you a new boxer?
No
Then what were you doing in the ring?
lfl didn't stop him...
Miller's brother would've been crushed
You're pretty good;
but that isn't Thai boxing
Chinese Boxing
Chinese?
My name is Fan Ke I'mlooking for a boxer.
On hisleft arm is...
Wenlie, Mr. Qiangren wants to see you I don't wish to meet him
When he asks for you... you show up.
That's the rule I'll be an exception then
Wenlie, if you don't want to see that guy...
Are you assisting me?
You're from abroad, is it?
Just arrived yesterday
Bangkok is a scenic city
Just do your sightseeing, don't get into trouble I really wish to meet that guy
You...
Hey, watch itl
Sorry, miss I was chasing that car ls it urgent?
Fine,I'll take you
Canl drive?
Alright
Where's that car?
It's gonel Are you Chinese?
No, butl can speak the language
Quite fluent at it too
You're from abroad?
Just arrived yesterday
You're just in time for Songkran
Oh yes, now thatl remember...
You were at the festival yesterday
Would youlike me to show you around?
I'd surelike that
Miller's dead, you know?
I know
Go and find Xu Qiu to sign a contract I'll arrange for you to win over Cannon
I could have done it anyway
You would've been killed,like Miller
I'lllet it spread to punters once you step out
Tell them to bet that you'll die
Throw him out
Who are you?
This is my car
Kid,Mr.Xuisoverthere, hewantstoseeyou
Didn'tyou hearher?
This is her car
Drive away now
Who were they?
What're they after?
I'm not sure
I had to fight when they're picking on me
Go now
I'm not going
This isn't a show
I do realise
But I can't leave a friend behind
A friend?
Aren't we friends?
Excuse my intrusion
My name is Xu, and your name is?
I have no intention of knowing you
Why should I introduce myself?
Back at the stadium, you dared to fight him
You've got guts!
You wanted to see Miller before it began
What for?
I thought he's the person I was looking for
And wasn't he?
I must've got the wrong guy
If it's some boxer you're looking for...
I might be able to help
I know all the boxers in Bangkok
What's his name?
I don't know his name
I only know of a tattoo on his left arm
It's the tattoo of an anchor and a sparrow
Would you happen to know him?
There're plenty of boxers with tattoos
Why particularly him?
He's my elder brother
If you know who he is, tell me
I don't
Tell me
Cannon
Don't come any closer
I know you guys are up to no good
But I don't think you'd dare to kill out of the ring
Only in the ring... where you set those murders up
I'll show you some colors
What colors?
Red or white?
He definitely must know my brother!
You sure are good!
I don't do this for a living
I'm a civil engineer
It's quite late.
Let me take you back
I'll show you around tomorrow
Great
See you at the same place
Wenlie
You're wounded, Wenlie!
You were not in a match today
Why are you hurt?
No problem.
It's only a nose bleed
I bumped into some hooligans
And a fight ensued
Wash that blood off your face
Gently... and don't wake mom up
Wenlie, people are saying that...
Cannon has killed yet another one
I'd suggest not to fight with Cannon
Walk out of it now
It's not a big deal
I can't
As for your mom's operation fees...
We'll figure something out
We have no other way, it's a lot of money
Except...
except that I give in to Qiangren
I'd rather die than accept defeat
I'm really worried about you
Don't worry, I'll be fine
If only I beat Cannon...
Then I won't be competing anymore
Really?
But you...
You're here again, mister!
Miller died yesterday
T oday Qiangren's staff are taking death bets
I think, Wenlie...
Sir, would you know...
Which boxer has a tattoo... of an anchor and a sparrow on his left arm?
Miller had one
But his was an eagle and the globe
Then I have no idea
What's up?
I still have no idea where to find my brother!
Meidai, I want to watch this match
Thai boxing, it's so violent
I've met this boxer before
And I like him
Fine, I'll come with you then
Why is she crying?
Hey, you can't help anyway
She hopes that the authorities would cancel the match
She says Wenlie is no match for Cannon
She's probably Wenlie's lover
What?
I need to speak to that girl
Think about it, killing is illegal
But Cannon killed my brother
Yes, I'm sorry about it too
But don't do anything you'll regret
And I won't assist you in murder
I must kill him, I must
Misai
Misai
Yulan, you've been crying?
Oh no!
What're the swellings on your face?
There you go again
This is common for a boxer
Mom's admitted to hospital this morning
After this match...
She can have the operation tonight
You'll get fined for plucking flowers
When the flower's in your hair...
The police will only praise when they see you
You're quite a charmer
Thank you
For what?
For not running me down yesterday
We had hardly met and yet you let me drive
I could've been a bad guy, you know
I knew you were not
Sixth sense, is it?
What's the hurry?
We still have some time before the match
There isn't much time left, I'd like...
Fine, boxing match is next
Great
Draw it
Draw it
Sure...
It's only normal... for one to run when frightened
Wenlie, you still have time to change your mind
Forget about Miller, he was a fool
It's your call if you want to be likewise
Didn't know you had a younger brother!
I don't have one
No?
He came looking for you
He said that there's a tattoo of an anchor... and a sparrow on his brother's left arm
That's you, Wenlie
Where's he?
Who knows?
But after tonight...
He'll die sooner or later on the streets!
Mom did mention that she's... asked someone to take a picture of me to dad
My own younger brother!
Meidai, look
Wenlie's about to come on stage
She should go inside
Why is she staring at his picture?
Perhaps I know the reason
I think no one suffers like her
Miss, are you Wenlie's friend?
What's so exciting about a boxing match?
Why are all these people here?
If it's a fair competition
It's a good sport
Fair?
It's not a fair world
Hope Wenlie wins
He can't lose
Cannon, get ready
Yes
Hurry
Wenlie, it's almost time
One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six
Seven, Eight, Nine, T en
Wenlie
Fan Ke, he's your brother
He's my brother?
I've got to stop this game
Fan Ke
Wenlie, stop
Wenlie, you're my brother
Stay in your seat
You can't die
They're going to kill him!
Fan Ke
Manager, Wenlie is his brother
Please stop this match
I can't, and if you don't return to your seat... we'll have you thrown out
Fan Ke, come on
Let's return to our seats
We'll wait until this match is over
You don't know
Wenlie won't give in to the bad guys
Cannon will kill him
Wenlie, stop, get down
Stop, Wenlie
Fine, stop it, I'll return to my seat
Please don't kick him out
One, Two, Three
He can't fight anymore
We're really gonna kick you out next time
Five, Six, Seven, Eight
One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six
Wenlie
Wenlie, go
Beat him
One, Two, Three, Four, Five
Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, T en
Wenlie...
Wenlie...
Wenlie, you're my brother!
You?
My name is Fan Ke, I'm your brother
My brother
I've got to tell Yulan about my victory
She must be worried sick
Yulan?
She has been waiting outside
Wenlie has won
Yulan
Wenlie!
We'll go to the hospital, and...
This is my brother
Your brother?
Let's go, I'll tell you all about it
Wenlie
Leave me alone
I've only lost one match
It's no big deal, beat it
Cannon, I'm Misai, Miller's brother
I came here for revenge
Cannon
He's dead!
Wenlie's killed Cannon
Get someone to go to Wenlie's place
And kill him
Wenlie...
No one's around
You take him back
He will return sooner or later
The rest of you wait here
Yes
Go
Trash the place, destroy it
How did it go?
The operation went smoothly
It's a success
My mom's a beauty
But she has aged through the hard years
She's tough and hasn't sought financial help
I know, you're so much like her
Wenlie, you should rest
We will stay here
You leave first, and come back in the afternoon
I'll show you some pictures of mom... and dad when they were young
Sure
This time around...
You won't leave with them
You'll allow me to help, right?
Sure
Wenlie, you killed Cannon
And Qiangren lost money because of you
Only if you promise to fill in Cannon's place
If not... it's up to you!
Cannon's dead?
What a bluff!
Come with me to see Qiangren
Nope
Guys
I'll take care of them
You go after Xu
You still dare hit me?
Hurry...
Hey, don't you think mom's pretty?
You trashed my place
What do you have to say?
I'll pay for the damages, please let me go
I'll get Misai to bring you the money
Misai
When we came here...
Misai was here, and we've taken him... to Mr. Qiangren
Come, we've got to save Misai
Call the police.
Wenlie's gone over to Qiangren's
Qiangren will kill him
I'll inform the police
Misai asked me to kill Cannon with him
Now that Cannon's dead...
He must've killed Cannon in waiting room
I've got to ask him
Where does Qiangren live?
Not far from here
I was the one who killed Cannon
He was your money plant
Let's go...
Misai
Be careful, bro.
That's Qiangren
I've fought Cannon, I'm not afraid
He's much stronger than Cannon
Did you kill Misai?
And now it's your turn!
This is your doom day
He's a murderer.
He killed Misai
Arrest him
Tell mom I'm going to Hong Kong for a while
When she recovers, I'll come to fetch her
And I'll take you along as well
Meidai, I hope you'll visit Hong Kong
And how do you propose to welcome me?
Gonna run you down with a sports car!
Let's go.
The nightmare again?
Don't worry, don't worry.
Don't worry.
It'll soon be over.
Dad?
- Going already?
- Soon.
Tod's not here yet.
Oh, don't go yet.
Here.
- Happy birthday, darling.
- But it's tomorrow.
Well, what's wrong with now?
Open it.
Oh, sorry I couldn't find any pretty paper.
Oh, Dad.
It's beautiful.
It's the most precious thing I can give you.
I'll treasure it.
No,no, no...
Don't just treasure it.
It was meant to be worn.
It must be worth a fortune.
Supposing I'll lose it?
You won't.
Wear it always.
Wear it now.
Here.
Happy birthday, darling.
Thank you.
Hi.
Glad you could make it.
